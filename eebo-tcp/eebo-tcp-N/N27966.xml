            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN allowing this Oration to be made public, I am actuated more, from a wiſh to comply with your requeſt, than from any idea, that it is deſerving of this high mark of your eſteem.</p>
            <p>Many pieces of compoſition, may anſwer well enough for the haſty manner, in which they generally are recited; but which, however, are by no means proper to be committed to the preſs: becauſe their faults are thus render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permanent; which, in the former inſtance, were generally forgotten as ſoon as made public.</p>

As various writers have expreſsly treated on many of the ſubjects contained in the following pages; it is obvious, that it is not to be regarded as altogether new; and hence, another reaſon for not deſiring to acquieſce in a meaſure, which was by no means anticipated.</p>
            <p>I however, offer theſe pages to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, under a full conviction, that the above conſiderations will induce you to overlook the many errors they contain.</p>

            <p>THE unexpected honour you have conferred upon me, in appointing me to deliver your annual oration, could not fail of being highly grateful to my feelings, and would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally impel me to the ſtrongeſt acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this diſtinguiſhed mark of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and eſteem. But, whilſt I avow thoſe feelings which your conduct has awakened; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me alſo to ſay, I cannot contemplate this reſpected aſſembly without regret, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many gentlemen, better qualified to do juſtice to the appointment, are now before me. I can, however, confidently aſſert, that there is no one preſent, whoſe wiſhes for the proſperity of our inſtitution exceed my own. Its preſent flouriſhing ſtate, cannot fail of giving pleaſure to all who have its welfare at heart; whilſt the induſtry and application of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are the ſureſt pledges of its continuation and increaſe.</p>
            <p>

The difficulty of chuſing a ſubject for an oration, did not occur, at the time of my accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the charge committed to me. Had I been equally ſenſible of it then, as I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; nothing would have induced me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to your wiſhes, but a thorough convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that each member owes it to our ſociety, to comply with every reſolve in which he may be concerned, to the extent of his abilities. This difficulty in the choice of a ſubject, ariſes from the neceſſity of its being general in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet, at the ſame time, ſo connected with the ſcience of Medicine, as to render it in ſome meaſure tributary thereto. From this cauſe it moſtly happens, that a deficiency of matter is made up by a luxuriance of ſtyle, and fertility of imagination; which, although they do not tend to the inſtruction of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; yet they gratify the mind, by affording a temporary amuſement. Under this impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without expecting to add much, either to your inſtruction or amuſement; I muſt beg your indulgence, whilſt I take a ſhort view, of the <hi>importance</hi> and <hi>reſpectability</hi> of the SCIENCE OF MEDICINE, as demonſtrated by the extent of its reſearches; and by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal homage which has ever been paid to it, by all ranks and conditions of men; even by thoſe who, in health, affect to ridicule and deſpiſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037264_0008_100CA320C8B460D8"/>
This ridicule, the offspring generally of little minds, although highly unjuſt and illiberal, we are not to be ſurpriſed at, when we conſider, how great an opening is given to it by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate diſputes and diſſentions of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves. The intereſts of the profeſſion are loſt, in the diſgraceful employment of perſonal invective, or of malicious and ſlanderous hints. The errors of individuals are rancorouſly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered conſpicuous to the public eye; and this is often done without any attention to the voice of truth. The unkind conſtructions, and ill-timed remarks, of fellow-practitioners, cannot fail of being a great ſource of that degrading light in which Medicine is often held by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Theſe unhappy jealouſies and animoſities, frequently prove of the worſt conſequences to patients. We have ſeen them carried to their higheſt pitch amongſt ourſelves; and, I fear with the moſt fatal iſſue to our fellow citizens: for, as theſe quarrels do not ſtop here, but extend themſelves to the public; a diverſity of opinion prevails, which ultimately undermines all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the profeſſion; and prevents any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for advice, until that period has elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in which alone, the powers of medicine might have proved efficacious. By this diſunion, phyſicians loſe the advantages ariſing from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual communication, and from the confidence which is acquired in their opinions, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037264_0009_100CA322524736E8"/>
of each other. Opinions, however, unfortunately, are not regarded according to their intrinſic m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rit; but according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whom they proceed; and propoſals, delivered with openneſs, are often whiſpered abroad, and miſrepreſented to the public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to honour and ſecreſy. Theſe quarrels, ſometimes ending in appeals to the public, tend ſtill further to heighten the animoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and widen the breach; and generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the contending parties, by making them objects of ridicule to the world: Added to this, they diſcredit the profeſſion, and expoſe the whole Faculty to contempt. They alſo may be regarded as one powerful cauſe of the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of emperics; who diminiſh the practice of the regular phyſician. When ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for each other, appears to exiſt amongſt members of the ſame profeſſion; it is ſcarcely a ſubject of wonder, if the public ſhould alſo diveſt themſelves of it; unacquainted as they are, with the many difficulties attendant upon the practice of phyſic.</p>
            <p>In all ages, much wit has been diſplayed upon our profeſſion: A ſlight attention, however, will ſhew, that the ridicule has been employed againſt phyſicians, rather than againſt the art itſelf. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mean and unworthy arts have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to raiſe importance, by perſons impelled
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037264_0010_100CA3245BA44758"/>
by neceſſity, excited by vanity, or anxious to conceal their conſcious ignorance. An affectation of profound knowledge, or of myſtery in every thing relative to the profeſſion; an air of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own ſkill and abilities; or a ſolemn and ſtately demeanour; are ſome of the arts, which have been uſed to give celebrity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who could not otherwiſe have attained it. Such are the arts, which have not eſcaped the penetration of the more judicious; nor eluded the ſhafts of ridicule and humour. Hence, in moſt dramatic exhibitions, in which the phyſician is introduced, he is treated as a pedant and a fool. But it is evident, that here, the manners of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons are aimed at; not the profeſſion itſelf; which, from time immemorial, has been regarded as one of the moſt uſeful and beneficial to mankind.</p>
            <p>The great Hippocrates has told us, that <q>The art of Phyſic is the moſt excellent of all arts; and has alſo obſerved, that it is the buſineſs of a phyſician to make new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſcience, or to perfect ſuch as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made; rather than to ſpend his time in cenſuring or depreciating others.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hippocrat. de Arte.</note> This dictate, the reſult of wiſdom, juſtice, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the moſt illiberal of the profeſſion will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037264_0011_100CA325E53D8608"/>
not attempt to controvert. The diſſentions of phyſicians are, indeed, the greateſt objection which is made to the profeſſion of phyſic; and may be regarded as the foundation of every other objection. It is that which the illuſtrious Bacon advances; and even Hippocrates himſelf, who ſays, <q>When phyſicians are ſo much at variance amongſt themſelves, about the method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acute diſeaſes, that the ſame method ſhall be highly extolled by one, and run down by others; phyſic itſelf, muſt of neceſſity fall into contempt amongſt the vulgar; who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that phyſicians themſelves have no certain method to purſue, or that there is no ſuch art as that of Medicine.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hippocrat. de Ratione Victus in Morb. acutis.</note> This objection has been thus anſwered by the ſame great man; <q>That this very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is a proof of the reality of the art; for if there was no ſuch thing as an Art of Medicine, no ſyſtem of precepts, or rule of practice for the artiſt to be directed by; there would not be good and bad phyſicians, as there are now, but all of them would be alike ignorant and unſkilful; and the cure of the ſick would depend upon chance alone. But as long as phyſic remains an art, ſo long will one artiſt continue to excel another, as well in the goodneſs of his hand as head.</q>

But, in truth, the utility of Medicine ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> never been ſeriouſly denied; for every perſon who ſuffers pain or ſickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, (in words, at leaſt, which coſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) the uſefulneſs of an art from which he obtains relief.</p>
            <p>Life, when oppreſſed with diſeaſe, is but a compound of woes. Health adds delight to every enjoyment; and, as the end of medical ſcience is to reſtore and preſerve health, every perſon is concerned in its improvement. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is as important in its object, as it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in its attainment.—It is extenſive in its reſearches; and preſuppoſes an acquaintance with many other ſciences: and it demands of thoſe who engage in its purſuit, an enlarged and benevolent mind.</p>
            <p>A deſire of knowledge, and a ſpirit of enquiry, are natural to man. Theſe, therefore, ſhould be directed to worthy objects. And what can be more ſo, than the ſtudy and preſervation of that moſt ſimple, yet moſt compound and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing work of an Omnipotent Creator! Or, what can tend more effectually to raiſe our thoughts, to the Divine Author of its exiſtence!</p>
            <p>In a ſubſequent part of this Oration, I ſhall attempt to demonſtrate, ſtill further, the utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037264_0013_100CA32A8C405270"/>
of the ſcience of Medicine, by a ſhort view of ſome of thoſe virtues, which the practice of phyſic either does, or ought to inſpire, in the breaſt of every member of the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>If we take a view of the antiquity of the ſcience of Medicine, it would neceſſarily appear, to have been coeval with the origin of man; or at leaſt, with the period of his expulſion from that ſtate of felicity, which he is repreſented to have enjoyed in the garden of Eden. For, as by the curſe, which was inflicted on our firſt parents at the Fall, they were doomed to feel the arrows of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and the infirmities of human nature; from that period, attempts muſt have been made for the cure of diſeaſes, and the relief of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which devolved upon them by ſuch a curſe. Theſe rude, but well-meant attempts of each perſon, to relieve the diſtreſs of his neighbour, muſt however have ceaſed, when ſome were ſuppoſed to have acquired greater ſkill than others: to theſe of courſe, the ſick would apply for aſſiſtance;—and this, in fact, we muſt eſteem as the origin of the art: A know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a few ſimples, probably formed its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent. I have ſaid above, that the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Medicine muſt have <hi>neceſſarily</hi> been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eval with the origin of man:—I ſhould rather have ſaid, that thoſe fundamental principles, on
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037264_0014_100CA32C94B75458"/>
which the ſcience is founded, exiſted at that early period of the world, in as full force as at preſent. We only excel our anceſtors by the developement of facts; and by a judicious excluſion of principles, founded in error, and in the belief of preternatural agents and cauſes; which exiſted only in the heated imaginations of their authors and their followers. Succeeding generations, it is to be hoped, will improve upon the preſent; until the higheſt degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall be acquired, which is compatible with the imperfect ſtate in which we live.</p>
            <p>Medicine ſeems to have attained to greater perfection, amongſt the Greeks than amongſt any other nation of antiquity; if we may judge from thoſe writings which have come to hand. We are not, however, abſolutely to draw ſuch a concluſion; as, from the great difficulty at that period, of tranſmitting knowledge to poſterity, or even of diffuſing it amongſt cotemporaries; from the want of ſome method of rendering that knowledge permanent; which, fortunately we poſſeſs in the art of printing; when alſo we recollect, that a great portion of ancient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was, by the uſe of hieroglyphics, almoſt entirely confined in the hands of their prieſts; we may be allowed to ſuppoſe that Greece <hi>alone</hi> did not bear away the palm of ſcience. This ſuppoſition is ſtrengthened by the probability
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037264_0015_100CA32E280EE5E8"/>
that the Greeks derived their literary and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific knowledge from the Egyptians; and that they only extended it by the aid of letters.<note n="*" place="bottom">Before the invention of letters, mankind may be ſaid to have been perpetually in their infancy; as the arts of one age or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try generally died with their inventors. <hi>Botanic Garden; note on Papyra.</hi>
               </note> Be this however as it may, the Greeks certainly have the merit of having conveyed to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, the rudiments of Medicine, and of every other art or ſcience, at that time known—<q>Hippocrates, who has been called the great father of Phyſic, is the firſt, whoſe writings have been tranſmitted to the preſent day; and we cannot withhold our eſteem from him, whether we conſider the morality and liberality of his works, or his numerous and acute obſervations, together with the great order in which they are conveyed. But</q> (adds Dr. Denman) <q>if there be any progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power in the human mind, if there be any advantage obtained in the practice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, by the knowledge of the circulation of the blood; or of a more correct anatomy and phyſiology at large; by the application of chemiſtry; by a more copious Materia Medica; by the records of experience, or by many collateral arts which Medicine calls in to its aid, we may be allowed to ſay, that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037264_0016_100CA330AB07F5F0"/>
Hippocrates ought not to be conſidered as the guide of phyſicians at the preſent time, or as having limited the perfection or extent of the art; but as an illuſtrious ſpecimen of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient medical knowledge and practice: And if this obſervation holds good with reſpect to Hippocrates, it will have more force when applied to all his tranſcribers and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Of the dignity of the profeſſion of Phyſic, I ſhall ſay but little. It has ſtood the teſt of time; and cannot receive any addition from my praiſe. It has always ranked amongſt the moſt liberal of the profeſſions; and on the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grounds. To excel in it, requires a larger compaſs of knowledge than is neceſſary in any other ſcience. Mathematics, natural hiſtory and philoſophy, are nearly allied to it: whilſt the extenſive ſtudies of anatomy, chemiſtry and botany, are its immediate branches. A knowledge of the dead and living languages, is by many thought indiſpenſable: and to this we may add, that knowledge of the world, of men and manners, which are highly uſeful to the medical character; and which is naturally acquired, from an extenſive intercourſe with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037264_0017_100CA332AEF408E8"/>
all ranks of people. Medicine, notwithſtanding the extent of knowledge which it preſuppoſes, is a ſcience, concerning which every one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to reaſon moſt, and yet of which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the leaſt information. Who, that has not made mathematics his ſtudy, will preſume to argue on the abſtruſe and difficult calculations of algebra? Yet the more difficult and abſtruſe ſcience of Medicine is apparently obtained by intuition; as a previous education ſeems unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to qualify a perſon to embrace it at once, in its fulleſt extent!</p>
            <p>The ſcience of Medicine is an ample field for the exerciſe and diſplay of genius. No profeſſion requires a more comprehenſive mind. In the other learned profeſſions, certain laws and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes exiſt, to which every queſtion muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and by which it muſt be determined;—a ſteady application, and a good memory, are here the chief requiſites. Little room is left for the diſplay of genius, where invention can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add, nor judgment improve; becauſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed laws, whether right or wrong, muſt be ſubmitted to. In Medicine, where no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed laws exiſt, the caſe is different—Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt reſt on his own judgment; and it is his buſineſs to make a ſelection of facts, from thoſe theories with which his memory has been loaded in the courſe of a liberal education. To

effect this, the prejudices of youth are to be overcome. This will prove a taſk of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty; as much candor and patience are eſſential, to diveſt our minds of what, in general, takes ſuch forcible poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Were I here to take a view of the many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which the profeſſion of Phyſic enforces on its adherents, I ſhould extend this piece far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the uſual limits, and encroach too greatly on that time, upon which, I fear, you already think I have too much treſpaſſed. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore detain you but a few minutes on this part of my ſubject.</p>
            <p>An extenſive field is preſented by Medicine, for the exerciſe of HUMANITY. The numerous opportunities of relieving diſtreſs, which a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician enjoys, muſt, to a benevolent mind, be one of its greateſt pleaſures. The Faculty have often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been reproached with hardneſs of heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> charge to be unjuſt; not only from an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with many members of the profeſſion, whoſe enlarged and philanthropic minds are exerted in the daily purſuits of benevolence and virtue; but alſo from the writings of the moſt celebrated phyſicians of all ages; which are, of themſelves, ſufficient to exonerate their authors from ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037264_0019_100CA337001FAD60"/>
a reproach. Who, after reading the works of Sydenham, a Haller, Boerhaave, and others; will be hardy enough to charge them with ſuch a failing? A failing, indeed, one of the greateſt of which a phyſician can be guilty! Humanity may in fact be regarded, as the greateſt moral qualification of a medical man. It is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal foundation of the profeſſion; acted upon, long before it was regarded as a diſtinct ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Doubtleſs, there are many unworthy members of our profeſſion, (as is the caſe with every other) to whom ſuch a charge will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.—The loſs, however, of one of the greateſt incitements for the relief of the ſick, is the proper puniſhment it brings with it.—Habit, it is true, may inſure a command of temper, which may be miſtaken for inſenſibility; but too great a ſhare of ſenſibility, often renders a phyſician incapable of that ſteadineſs and vigor of action, on which perhaps the life of his patient may greatly depend. Men of the moſt compaſſionate tempers, by daily viewing ſcenes of diſtreſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a firmneſs of mind, which is abſolutely requiſite in the practice of Phyſic. They can feel both pity and compaſſion, without allowing themſelves to be enervated and unmanned. Thoſe who are callous to every ſentiment of humanity, affect to treat this ſympathy with ridicule; by repreſenting it, either as hypocriſy, or as a proof of a weak mind. There can be no doubt that it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037264_0020_100CA339863E82C0"/>
may be, and often is aſſumed: But it is eaſily ſeen through. Real ſympathy, will not permit a phyſician to act differently, to perſons in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ranks of life. It is even more careful of ſhewing itſelf towards thoſe in better circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; leſt an unworthy conſtruction ſhould be put upon it. It is equally unfounded, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a compaſſionate and feeling heart, to be the effect of a weak mind. Univerſal experience proves the reverſe of the propoſition; and that rough and bluſtering manners, are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concomitants of a weak underſtanding; and frequently are aſſumed to conceal from the world thoſe very infirmities which their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors blame in others.</p>
            <p>HUMANITY is that ſenſibility of heart, which makes us feel for the diſtreſſes of our fellow-creatures; and of conſequence, incites us moſt powerfully to their relief. Sympathy produces attention to an hundred circumſtances, which may tend to relieve a patient; an attention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of wealth to purchaſe. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the confidence and affection of a patient; which often is of the utmoſt conſequence to his recovery. A patient feels the approach of a phyſician who poſſeſſes a compaſſionate heart, a ſoftneſs of manners, and, what Shakeſpear has emphatically called, "the milk of human kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," like that of an angel miniſtring to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037264_0021_100CA33B0F0922E8"/>
Whilſt the viſit of a man of harſh and brutal manners, makes his heart ſink, as at the preſence of one who is about to pronounce his ſentence of death.</p>
            <p>CHARITY, the offspring of Humanity, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important virtue, ſtrongly enforced upon its votaries, by the ſcience of Medicine. The phyſician, more than any other deſcription of men, is moſt converſant with miſery and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Happy the man who improves from this view of ſuffering humanity!—True Charity does not limit her bounty to one claſs or deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men; She regards the whole human race as relatives; and the world as her abode. At the bedſide of poverty and ſickneſs, ſhe is moſt at home; and here, her claims are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon the profeſſion of Phyſic: From ſuch a claim, none of its votaries are exempt. They here poſſeſs the power of ſtripping death of half his terrors; and of ſmoothing the avenues to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world. How high enrolled above the common claſs of men, does the great, the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious HOWARD appear, when viſiting the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my manſions of diſeaſe and death; and, like a guardian angel, ſnatching from deſtruction the miſerable wretch, whoſe feeble lamp of life, ſcarce glimmered in its ſocket; or, when reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the careſſes of an affectionate family, a hapleſs parent, whoſe anxious care and ſteady
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037264_0022_100CA33C99300368"/>
induſtry, could not avert the iron hands of ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poverty! Let us view this extraordinary man, (who lived not for himſelf, but for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) with active benevolence, expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the moſt contagious diſeaſes; unappalled by the rapid ſtrides of death; cheering, by his affability and mildneſs, the bed of ſickneſs or diſtreſs; and, like a good Samaritan, adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the balm which ſhould ameliorate the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the afflicted! Let us view him ranging through the earth, to offer his devotions at the ſhrine of humanity; and ultimately ſnatched from an admiring world, by that inexorable tyrant, whoſe regions he had ſo often ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully invaded; to be a companion of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly beings, whoſe actions he had ſtrove to imitate in his terreſtrial abode. Where, in that anxious, awful moment of expiring life, was the ſympathiſing friend, to aſſuage the agony of corporeal ſufferings, or cloſe the eye-lids of this dying ſaint. Alas! no friend was there! Of the numbers, to whom he had ſo often min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered, not one was preſent, to receive his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting breath. That God, however, in whoſe ſervice he cloſed his well-ſpent life, did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him in the hour of diſtreſs, when the mind's eye is fixed upon "that undiſcovered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from whoſe bourne no traveller returns." The pleaſing retroſpect of a well-ſpent life, upheld him in the conflict, and enabled him to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037264_0023_100CA33EB887E0C8"/>
raiſe his hopes with confidence to heaven, whoſe gates were wide extended to receive him.</p>

            <p>PATIENCE next to the above mentioned vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is of the greateſt neceſſity to the medical man. It might, indeed, in ſome points of view, be regarded as a branch of humanity. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for the exerciſe of this virtue, ariſes from many and various ſources. I have already noticed a very conſiderable one, in the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Faculty, and the illiberality, which ſometimes prevails amongſt them. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here, only mention that, ariſing from the conduct of patients themſelves; together, with the contradictions and diſappointments, to which, in the courſe of his practice, the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is ſubjected. The laſt, more frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, from too great ſtrictneſs in his directions; which, if not abſolutely eſſential to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037264_0025_100CA34386F54FA0"/>
of the patient, had better be avoided; as the almoſt invariable non-compliance with them, neceſſarily leads to a concealment of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation. Hence, he is ignorant of the true ſtate of the ſick; and aſcribes to the diſeaſe, what is probably owing to irregularity in diet; or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes effects to medicines, which were daily thrown into the fire, or out of a window. A phyſician ſhould certainly be abſolute in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over his patients: To this, however, few will ſubmit; and indeed, a phyſician has no juſt title of complaint, if his advice is not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; as he has no right to prevent any one from going out of the world in his own way.</p>
            <p>Thoſe afflicted with nervous diſeaſes, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not a little, to call forth the patience of a phyſician. Though their fears are groundleſs, for the moſt part; yet their ſufferings are real; and hence, to treat them with neglect, or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is equally cruel and abſurd. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the mind demand the tendereſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy; and the greateſt ſkill is required to avoid neglect and ridicule on the one hand; and too anxious a ſolicitude on the other.</p>
            <p>As you muſt all be ſenſible how much the characters of individuals, as well as the peace and happineſs of families; may ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the exerciſe of the virtues of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037264_0026_100CA3458C168B20"/>
honor and ſecrecy; I ſhall not enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their neceſſity to a phyſician. From his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, many opportunities muſt occur, of knowing the private tranſactions, and characters of families—He views mankind under the moſt diſadvantageous circumſtances: Oppreſſed by pain and ſickneſs; leading to peeviſhneſs, and impatience; in place of their uſual cheerfulneſs and vigor of mind.</p>
            <p>Temperance and ſobriety, are eſſential to the character of the medical man. You will at once accede to the propoſition, on my merely ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Judgment, diſcernment, and every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite qualification to the phyſician; are totally incompatible with a want of theſe virtues.</p>
            <p>The high importance of medical ſcience is obvious, not merely from what has been ſaid; but alſo, from conſidering its improvement as in ſome degree dependant, on the progreſs of all the other numerous arts and ſciences. From theſe, it borrows many lights; and acquires new aid by their augmentation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The ſcience of Medicine is ſo extenſive; and ſo limited are our faculties, in attempting to explore the receſſes of nature; that our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on this ſubject muſt ever be exceedingly confined. Perfection in this ſcience is not to

be hoped for; the labour of ages will enlarge our ſtock of knowledge; but we ſhall be forced to confeſs, that perfection is yet far from our reach. Improvement is, however, undoubtedly in our power. Induſtry and abilities will never want ſubjects for employment; nor fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe who exert them.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Medical and Chirurgical Review.</note> In our new, and almoſt unexplored country; very much remains to do, in every department of knowledge. The ample volume of the works of nature is open to our view, and each votary to ſcience, is loudly invited, to a participation of the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant banquet, which its pages afford. Your induſtry, and perſeverance, Gentlemen, will go far to raiſe our country, to an equal eminence with the moſt favoured parts of the globe. New and certain avenues to the temples of honor and of fame, will here be lighted up, by the radiant torch of truth: Let me hope, that many whom I now addreſs; are deſtined to attain an eminence, as great as Newton, Bacon, Boyle, and all thoſe other illuſtrious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, who rank ſo high in the annals of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>It is a ſubject of regret, that the knowledge of medical ſcience, is ſo diffuſed, through vaſt numbers of volumes, and in different languages,

as to preclude a complete view of all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, except it be acquired at a great expence, and with great labour. In Europe indeed, this is in a great meaſure obviated, by the numerous periodical publications, of the higheſt importance; which monthly, nay week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and almoſt daily iſſue from the preſs. Such works are peculiarly acceptable to perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in extenſive practice; or who are remote from the centre of publication. As yet, our country has been backward in adding to the general ſtock, by ſimilar attempts. One laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able example has been ſet, and the important work is ſtill continued with undiminiſhed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and I truſt will add, not only to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but alſo to the emolument of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Medical Repoſitory of New-York.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Permit me, Gentlemen, to extend for a few minutes, this view of a ſubject ſo highly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting to us, as fellow-members of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. How grateful muſt be the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its rapid increaſe! Scarcely have ten years elapſed, ſince it firſt ſprung into exiſtence, by the active and well-directed endeavours of a few individuals; and already do we reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt its members, moſt of the reſpectable and eminent of the profeſſion, throughout the United
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037264_0029_100CA34BE51E5990"/>
States. By its junction alſo with the American Medical Society; it has added the reſpectability of that inſtitution, to the youthful vigour which animates itſelf.</p>
            <p>I confidently truſt, that the zeal which has heretofore been evinced in the advancement of its reputation; will ſtill exiſt, to carry it yet further on the road to perfection; when you are ſettled in your profeſſional purſuits at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from us.</p>
            <p>I muſt remind you, Gentlemen, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this ſociety, are more extenſive, than I believe is generally imagined. We are not to be limited to the reception, or diſcuſſion, of medical facts or papers. We muſt conſider, that the republic of Medicine, which extends its influence throughout the univerſe; and of which, we are fellow-members; has a juſt claim upon our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions. The publication of Tranſactions and Memoirs, is, if I miſtake not, an important part of the intentions of this inſtitution. The carrying into execution this important meaſure, (in which unfortunately, we have been too neglectful) will evince to the world that ſcience is not confined to the ſhores of Europe. Hitherto, our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been very limited. Let us now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to render ourſelves conſpicuous, as a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and ſcientific Body. Let each member think
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037264_0030_100CA34DF2A59B50"/>
that on his individual exertions, depends the honour of the whole; and we ſoon ſhall ſee it riſe to an unexampled pitch of celebrity and reputation. Each member has it in his power to enrich the ſociety, by favouring it with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate details, of facts and obſervations; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the hiſtories of diſeaſes, remarkable either in themſelves or treatment; with diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch morbid bodies as may come under their notice; and the remarks and inferences, occaſioned thereby. A judicious ſelection from theſe, for publication, could not fail of ſoon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us known, abroad and at home. Such a work would doubtleſs meet with a ready recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially, as each member would wiſh to poſſeſs a publication, in the honor of which he found himſelf ſo cloſely intereſted.</p>
            <p>I truſt I am not ſingular, in thus wiſhing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the reputation of our hitherto flouriſhing Body. How honourable ſuch a ſtep would be, I ſhall not pauſe to determine. I ſincerely hope, due attention will be given to a ſubject, from which we may anticipate ſuch beneficial effects. We want only thoſe materials, of which each member is poſſeſſed; to erect a ſtructure, whoſe duration ſhall extend to the end of time; and whoſe beneficial influence, ſhall pervade the univerſe.</p>

The Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, which now ranks high as a ſcientific inſtitution; aroſe from a beginning, ſmall as our own. Its cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity may in part be aſcribed to having purſued to a certain degree, the meaſure above recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; by publiſhing a judicious ſelection of the moſt meritorious theſes, which have made their appearance in that Univerſity. And ſhall an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, founded under the auſpices of a ſchool, where a candidate for medical honors, dare not publiſh any thing, which ſtrikes at the doctrines there promulgated: Shall, I repeat it, ſuch an inſtitution ſurpaſs our own? where, under the extended wings of our beloved Alma Mater; freedom of opinion in Medical ſcience, is not only tolerated, but even encouraged! Moſt of the experimental theſes here made public, I will venture to aſſert, are not ſurpaſſed, either in merit or information, by thoſe which are brought forward in the trans-Atlantic ſeminaries. A ſelection of the moſt meritorious, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, under your auſpices, would not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the credit of our ſociety; but would alſo tend to double the diligence of the ſtudents; by the pleaſing expectation of ſuch honourable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being paid to their inveſtigations. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who come to purſue their medical ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in this place; will be aſhamed to leave it, without having it in their power to ſay, they are members of ſo valuable an inſtitution; whilſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037264_0032_100CA3528B868020"/>
the difficulty of obtaining a memberſhip; will make them exert all their diligence and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to attain a ſeat ſo honorable to themſelves.</p>
            <p>My wiſh to ſee our ſociety on a footing, equally eminent with ſimilar inſtitutions of Europe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces me treſpaſs on your time, by recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch objects to your attention, as to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear beſt calculated, to promote ſo deſirable an end. Seminaries of learning, like governments, have their riſe; their acme; their decline, and fall. The ſchools of Italy gave place to thoſe of Holland, and they in turn have been eclipſed by the ſuperior brilliancy of the Scottiſh ſchools. In the death of a Cullen, and the retirement of a Black, a ſhock has been ſuſtained by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical ſchool of Edinburgh; from which, it will not ſoon recover. I may be allowed to hope, that the time is not far diſtant; when the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs Hygeia, in conjunction with the genius of Philoſophy, ſhall extend the ſame of <hi>our</hi> medical ſchools; and, continuing to illumine our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, with the unerring torch of truth and wiſdom; ſhall render America the grand empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium of ſcience, and the arts; from which the never-cloying ſtreams of knowledge ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; to augment the maſs of human happineſs; and to communicate their cheering influence to every quarter of the globe.</p>

To extend ſtill further, the reputation of our ſociety; allow me to call to your ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the propriety, of eſtabliſhing a Library<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To expatiate on its utility, is unneceſſary; as you muſt all be convinced of it.—It is true, the Medical ſtudents who reſort to this place, poſſeſs extraordinary advantages, in having acceſs to the excellent library belonging to the Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania Hoſpital; and to the public library of our city.—But, as I conceive the augmentation of the means of information, is the ſureſt mode of increaſing, and extending ſcience; I anxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſt, that ſuch a meaſure will not be long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. The medical inſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">The Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh.</note> which I have already noticed; derives not a little of its cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity, from the extenſive library which it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes. Such praiſe-worthy examples, will doubtleſs meet with that regard, to which they are ſo juſtly entitled. It may be objected, that the eſtabliſhment of a library requires conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time and expence. From theſe very cauſes there is no time like the preſent, for carrying it into effect; as we ſhall the ſooner have to boaſt of its exiſtence. By ſmall beginnings, great ends are frequently accompliſhed. We cannot walk before we creep; neither can we, without a commencement, hope to attain, what each of you will admit, is highly to be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037264_0034_100CA356216BEC68"/>
wiſhed for. I am certain that all of you feel diſpoſed, as much as is in your power, to add to the reputation of an inſtitution, from which, I doubt not, you have derived both pleaſure and inſtruction: In no way can this be more likely to occur, than by increaſing its ſources of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and improvement. Let me urge you then, Gentlemen, to carry into effect, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure long contemplated; that you may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſay, Our Library was inſtituted, under your immediate exertions: and, I hope it will rapidly increaſe; as a teſtimony of your zeal and deſire, of promoting the intereſts of ſcience and humanity.</p>
            <p>I have thus, Gentlemen, brought to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, thoſe pages, which I have prepared in compliance with your appointment. If they have failed in affording you either inſtruction or amuſement; I truſt you will nevertheleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with indulgence, in conſideration of your having made ſo bad an election.—With every wiſh for your uninterrupted health and proſperity; I now bid you an affectionate adieu.</p>
