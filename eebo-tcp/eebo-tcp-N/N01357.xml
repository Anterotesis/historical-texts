            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Dead Child was once raised
unto Life, by GOD, at the
<hi>Prayer</hi> of an Holy Prophet
unto Him. And in the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this Child, we read, 2 King. IV.
34. He <hi>lay upon the Child, and</hi> (first)
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001614_0004_0F4D7F3238860820"/>
               <hi>put his Mouth upon his Mouth; and</hi> (then)
<hi>his Eyes upon his Eyes; and</hi> (afterwards)
<hi>his Hands upon his Hands;—and the
Child opened his Eyes.</hi> We <hi>Pray,</hi> That
the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Children may <hi>Live.</hi> If
we are our Selves the true Children of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> it will appear in this; we
shall importunately. <hi>Pray</hi> to God for
our Children, <hi>Oh! that they may Live in
thy sight!</hi> But <hi>Praying</hi> for them, is not all
we have to do for them. The <hi>Enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Word</hi> of God must be applied unto
them. We must apply the <hi>Lively O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
of the Word, unto the <hi>Mouthes,</hi>
and the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and the <hi>Hands</hi> of the
Children. If our God please then to
make an Application of it unto their
<hi>Hearts,</hi> this will cause them to <hi>Live.</hi>
Yea, tho' the Children are <hi>Cast forth
unto the Loathing their Person,</hi> and even<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Dead,</hi> and rotting and stinking in
their Sin; yet, <hi>O Lord, Thou wilt say
unto them, Live; yea, thou wilt say unto
them in their Blood, Live.</hi> There is

that it suits <hi>all Ages.</hi> It has <hi>Milk</hi> for
the <hi>Babes,</hi> as well as <hi>Meat</hi> for the

               <hi>Strong.</hi> It instructs both the <hi>Old</hi> and
the <hi>Young,</hi> to <hi>Praise the Lord.</hi> You have
here a Psalm, of Lessons to be Learn'd
by <hi>Children;</hi> even as soon as they learn
their Letters. In the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> every
Verse begins with a New Letter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Order of the Alphabet;
Perhaps, that so the <hi>Hebrew Children</hi>
might have it as Early as they had
their Alphabet. <hi>Children</hi> are here
called upon. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
&amp; Commended unto <hi>Children.</hi>
It is here shown unto <hi>children,</hi> what
they are to do, that they may be <hi>Happy
Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which I now
gather from it, is;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are in the Word of God, Good
Lessons for Children;</hi> There are
<hi>Lessons relating to the Fear of God,</hi>
which may be Understood, even by
them who are come to the Least
<hi>Understanding;</hi> which should be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderd
by them that can Use the
<hi>Least Consideration.</hi>

               <hi>Luther</hi> would say, The <hi>best Preacher</hi>
is he, that Preaches what we call,
<hi>Childishly;</hi> that so accommodates the
Truths of the Gospel, unto his Hearers,
that even the <hi>Little Children</hi> may <hi>mind</hi>
them when they hear them, and grow
sensible of them. I propose at this
Time, to make an Essay at <hi>such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and speak such Things, as they
who are in the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Little Children,</hi> &amp;
many Others, who have not much more
<hi>Sense</hi> than they, may take a Good No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. There are Truths of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which may be apprehended by the
<hi>Smallest Capacities;</hi> and by the <hi>Youngest</hi>
that are capable of Minding any thing
in the World. I am now to set such
Things before you, and such <hi>Lessons
relating to the Fear of God,</hi> as may be
apprehended by the very <hi>Children</hi> in
the Congregation; I desire to do it,
in such Plain Terms, that the <hi>Smallest
Capacities</hi> may Entertain the <hi>Lessons of
Piety;</hi> and be Quickened unto the <hi>Fear
of God.</hi> And yet the Things now to
be set before you, will be such, that
the most Illuminated Christians in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001614_0007_0F4D7F3682313BC8"/>
Auditory, and such as are in the highest
Form of Christianity shall hear nothing
but what may be for their Edification
too. Tho' the <hi>Lambs</hi> may Wade in
the <hi>Still Waters,</hi> to which the Shepherd
of their Souls, is now leading of them,
yet they will be such, that the <hi>Elephants</hi>
may also Swim in them. Sirs, Don't count
your selves neglected, in a Discourse
now so adapted unto <hi>Infancy.</hi> But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Shame and Grief make this
Reflection, <hi>Alas, that after so long a
Time, I should be so little improved, as to
need still that the first Elements of Piety
should be inculcated upon me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all our People, attend unto the
Plainest <hi>Maxims of Piety; Hear these,
O all ye People, every one of you!</hi> And let
even the <hi>Weakest</hi> and <hi>Youngest</hi> of our
People, give attention; <hi>Come, ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Hearken to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Weakest,</hi> and even the <hi>Youngest</hi>
People, <hi>Children</hi> themselves, while yet
in their Minority, may be Taught,
<hi>That</hi> and <hi>How</hi> the Great <hi>God is to be
Feared,</hi> and what the <hi>Fear of God</hi> will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001614_0008_0F4D7F3757F3D218"/>
bring them to. Plainly, They that
are of the <hi>Lowest Capacity</hi> among you,
may know this; <hi>The Great God is He
who Made me, and I ought to Fear and
Serve my Maker!</hi> That plain Lesson is
not above the <hi>Lowest Capacity;</hi> Psal.
LXXVI. 7. <hi>Thou, even thou are to be Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
O Lord.</hi> But then, What is implied
in, <hi>The Fear of God?</hi> They that are of
the <hi>Lowest Capacity</hi> may be taught thus
much; <hi>I am to show my Fear of God, by
being afraid of Sinning against Him.</hi> That
Lesson is not above them; Prov. VIII.
13. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is to hate Evil.</hi>
They may be taught thus much; <hi>I am
to show my Fear of God, by being afraid of
having Him Angry with me.</hi> That Lesson
is not above them; Heb. X. 31. <hi>It is a
fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the
Living God.</hi> They may be taught thus
much; <hi>I must Fear God, and fly to my
Saviour, that I may be delivered from the
Wrath of God.</hi> That Lesson is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them; Psal. CXLVII. 11. <hi>The Lord
takes Pleasure is those that Fear Him, and
that Hope in His Mercy.</hi> And thus
much may be taught unto them; I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001614_0009_0F4D7F37C6AFF1D0"/>
               <hi>must Fear God, and I must Chuse the Things
that Please God.</hi> they may Con that
Lesson; Eccl. XII. 13. <hi>Fear God, and keep
His Commandments; for this is the whole
Duty of Man.</hi> These Plain Things
may be instilled into our <hi>Children</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and will be so, when they are
<hi>Taught of God.</hi> Well, And, if this <hi>Fear
of God</hi> be in us, what will be the <hi>Issue</hi> of
it? They that are of the <hi>Lowest Capacity</hi>
may be taught thus much; <hi>I shall be no
loser by the Fear of God.</hi> And thus
much, <hi>It is good for me to draw near unto
God.</hi> And thus much, <hi>God is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them who diligently Seek Him.</hi>
They that are of such a <hi>Low Capacity,</hi>
as to have no other <hi>Wisdom,</hi> yet may be
taught this, <hi>That until we have the Fear
of God, we have no Wisdom at all.</hi> This
<hi>Lesson</hi> is a very Easy one; We may
teach it our <hi>Children;</hi> it was the first
Instruction of <hi>Solomon</hi> unto his, as it had
been the Instruction which his Father
had before given unto him, Prov. 1. 7.
<hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of
Wisdom.</hi> Child, Thou dost never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be <hi>Wise,</hi> till thou <hi>Fear God;</hi> And
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001614_0010_0F4D7F38B8984FD0"/>
the <hi>Fear of God</hi> will make thee <hi>Wise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Salvation.</hi> This thou mayest know;
And with the Knowledge thou mayest
attain to something of the <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
There is no Obscurity, no Difficulty,
in this <hi>Lesson;</hi> tis a <hi>Plain Song</hi> that may
be presently learnt; Psal. XXXL. 1st.
<hi>Oh! how great is thy Goodness, which thou
hast laid up for them that Fear thee.</hi> The
<hi>Promises</hi> which the <hi>Conenant of God</hi>
makes to them that <hi>Fear Him,</hi> as they
are very <hi>Great,</hi> so they are very Plain
Promises. Tis <hi>Plainly</hi> Promised, and
very Intelligibly Declared, so that our
poor <hi>Children</hi> themselves may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Declaration; <q>Child, <hi>Fear
God;</hi> Resolve to be Religious; and
Walk in the ways of His Religion;
Then, thou shalt find, <hi>As a Father Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
his Children, so the Lord Pities them
that Fear Him;</hi> and will Pardon their
Sins. Thou shalt find, <hi>The Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
will arise with Healing in His
Wings, to them that Fear His Name.</hi>
Thou shalt find, <hi>The Lord will fulfil the
Desire of them that Fear Him.</hi> Thou
shalt find, <hi>The Angel of the Lord En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001614_0011_0F4D7F39219F8370"/>
about them that Fear Him.</hi> Thou
shalt find, <hi>The Fear of the Lord will be a
Fountain of Life.</hi> Thou shalt find,
<hi>When the Time of the Dead comes, that
they shall be Iudged, God will give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
unto all that Fear His Name.</hi>
               </q>
These are no <hi>Dark Sayings.</hi> People
of the <hi>Lowest Capacity</hi> may be apprised
of these Things. When they are so,
then they are <hi>taught the Fear of the Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. The <hi>Weakest,</hi> &amp; even the <hi>Youngest</hi>
People, and our <hi>Children</hi> while yet but
<hi>Infants,</hi> may be taught, <hi>That</hi> there are
<hi>Evil Practices,</hi> which will prove Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to them; and <hi>What</hi> are those
<hi>Evil Practices.</hi> The <hi>Fear of God</hi> will
cause People to Shun those <hi>Evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
which are Condemned in the <hi>Word
of God.</hi> Even People of the <hi>Lowest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
may be taught that <hi>Lesson;</hi> Job
XXVIII. 28. <hi>Behold, The Fear of the
Lord, that is Wisdom; and to Depart from
Evil is Vnderstanding.</hi> Be the <hi>Capacity</hi>
of People, never so <hi>Ordinary,</hi> yet they
have something of the Divine <hi>Law</hi>
Written upon their Hearts; The <hi>Finger</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:001614_0012_0F4D7F3A15F08BF0"/>
of God has Written something of the
<hi>Law</hi> on the <hi>Fleshly Tables.</hi> A <hi>Conscience</hi>
will betimes begin to Work, in the
Children of Men. A <hi>Conscience</hi> will
tell them, while they are vet in their
Childhood, that such and such Things
are <hi>Evil Things,</hi> and that the <hi>Wrath of
God will come on the Children of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
who do such Things. Let the
<hi>Capacity</hi> of People be never so <hi>Low,</hi> yet
they may learn this Lesson; <hi>I must not
Venture to do any thing that is Condemend
by the Light of God in my Soul.</hi> That
Lesson is not <hi>too High</hi> for the <hi>Lowest
Capacity;</hi> Job XXIV. 13. Wicked Men,
<hi>They are of those that Rebel against the
Light.</hi> But there are many special
Cautions in the Word of God, which
may be bro't unto People of the <hi>Lowest
Capacity;</hi> and it will he found, that
their <hi>Conscience</hi> will agree to them;
&amp; so it will be found the <hi>Lessons</hi> will not
be above them. All the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are such Things; They are Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
for the Lowest Capacity Our
<hi>Children</hi> may betimes learn the Ten
<hi>Commandment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> What is Forbidden and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001614_0013_0F4D7F3A75C8C0C8"/>
What is <hi>Required</hi> in the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
In the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> there
is done, what we read; Psal. LXXVIII. 5.
<hi>God has appointed a Law, which He Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our Fathers, that they should make
them known unto their Children.</hi> It
would be a Sad Thing, if any Child of
<hi>Seven Years</hi> Old, should be so Unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
as to be Unable to say, the <hi>Ten
Commandments,</hi> or to be Ignorant, what
that <hi>Fear of God</hi> is, which is taught in
the <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we may Specify several Points,
in which People of a very <hi>Mean Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
may be taught that <hi>Fear of God,</hi> which
is to be Expressed in the avoiding of
some <hi>Evil Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. <hi>People of Low Degree,</hi> You may
learn this Lesson in the <hi>Fear of God;
The Name of God must always be treated
Awfully, and Holily, and Seriously; and
have an awful Respect Paid unto it.</hi> You
must not use the <hi>Name</hi> of the Glorious
GOD, Vainly, Lightly, Irreverently.
You must not <hi>Swear Prosantly</hi> by the
<hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Lasty One.</hi> You
must not <hi>Test</hi> on or with the Word of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001614_0014_0F4D7F3B761DA340"/>
the Great GOD. When you are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Worship of God, you must
behave your selves, as in the Presence
of the <hi>Great King, whose Name is Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
No <hi>Sleeping,</hi> and no <hi>Sporting,</hi> is to
be indulged in the <hi>Assembly's,</hi> wherein
God is <hi>Greatly to be feared, and had in
Reverence.</hi> These are very Evident
Things. Tis a plain Lesson; <hi>O Lord,
They are thine Enemy's, who take thy Name
in Vain.</hi> Children, You can reach to
that Lesson; Deut. XXVIII. 58, 59. <hi>If
thou wilt not fear this Glorious &amp; Fearful
Name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD, <hi>the
Lord will make thy Plagues Wonderful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. They must be very Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
indeed, who can't learnt this Lesson
in the <hi>Fear of God; I must not Abuse the
Good Creatures of God; nor abuse any Self
in the Vse of them.</hi> Every Body knows,
That our <hi>Drink,</hi> and our <hi>Meat,</hi> and our
<hi>Cloathing,</hi> are the <hi>Good Creatures</hi> of God.
It may therefore be soon known, by our
very <hi>Children</hi> themselves, That it is a
Wicked Thing to <hi>Drink too much;</hi> It is
a Brutish Thing to <hi>Eat too much;</hi> God
has not given us our Apparel, to hang
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001614_0015_0F4D7F3C84810BB0"/>
out the <hi>Flags of Pride,</hi> and gratify our
<hi>Vanity.</hi> Children, This Lesson is not
beyond you; Rom. XIII. 13, 14. <hi>Let us
Walk Honestly; not in rioting &amp; drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Put on the Lord Iesus Christ, and
make not Provision for the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. There is this Lesson in the
<hi>Fear of God,</hi> which every one may learn,
as soon as 'tis possible; <hi>The Lord's Day
must be kept Holy to the Lord; the Sabbaths
of the Lord must be the Lord's.</hi> Our <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
themselves, can't but soon perceive,
that we distinguish <hi>One Day in Seven</hi> for
the peculiar Service of God. When
the <hi>Passover</hi> was instituted, it was then
supposed; <hi>It shall come to pass, Your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall say to you, What mean you by this
Service?</hi> On the Institution of the <hi>Lord's
Day,</hi> we may soon inform our <hi>Children,
What we mean by the Service.</hi> Even
these, and they who cannot Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
any more than these, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
<q>The Glorious God having
Made the World is <hi>Six Day, &amp; Rested
on the Seventh,</hi> He has allow'd us to
Work in the world <hi>Six Days,</hi> but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to <hi>Rest</hi> from doing so, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001614_0016_0F4D7F3F4B3AC568"/>
we be Wholly for Him on the <hi>Seventh.</hi>
And our Saviour JESUS, <hi>Rising from
the Dead,</hi> on this Day, we ought this
Day to Remember, that He now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
our <hi>Victorious Redeemer.</hi> By
spending this Day in Communion with
God, we prepare for the <hi>Rest</hi> which
<hi>remains for His People,</hi> at the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Dead;</hi> but if we Mispend
this Day, we deserve to <hi>fall short of
Entring into the Rest of God.</hi>
               </q>—The
Lesson is quickly learnt; Lev. XIX. 30.
<hi>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence
My Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. The <hi>Fear of God</hi> has this
Lesson in it, than which there can be
nothing more easy to learn; <hi>Parents
must be Obey'd; God will not bear to see
Parents Wrong'd and Griev'd by a Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Off-spring.</hi> Where are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
so <hi>Blockish,</hi> as not to be aware of
this? <hi>Children</hi> owe much <hi>Obedience</hi> to
their <hi>Parents. Disobedient,</hi> Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
Disobliging <hi>Children,</hi> know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be, what they ought not to be.
<hi>Vndutiful Children,</hi> are <hi>Self-Condemned,</hi>
and know that they do not their Duty.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001614_0017_0F4D7F405CEDF9B0"/>
               <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> and <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
to <hi>Parents,</hi> one would think, there
should scarce be any Need of teaching
them. There is no <hi>Mystery</hi> in this
Matter; Tis no Sublime abstruse No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Tis not a Deep Thing that
cannot be fathomed; The short Arm
of a Child may fathom it; <hi>Honour thy
Father and thy Mother, that thy Days
may be long in the Land.</hi> By that time
the <hi>Child shall have Knowledge to Cry,
My Father, or my Mother,</hi> it may have this
<hi>Knowledge</hi> with it, <hi>I must do, as my Father,
and as my Mother bids me!</hi> Ere the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
go off our Knees, we may learn
them this Lesson; Eph. VI 1. <hi>Children,
Obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is
right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. They must be very Stupid,
unto whom this Lesson in the <hi>Fear of:
God,</hi> is not a very fair one; <hi>I may Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with nothing but what is my own, or with
the leave of the Owner.</hi> Tis nothing but
what our very <hi>Children</hi> may be aware
of; That it is a Crime to <hi>Steal.</hi> Every
one may come to the Knowledge or
this; If you <hi>Wrongfully take</hi> a Peny from
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001614_0018_0F4D7F407418CAC0"/>
another, tis a Crime that you are guilty
of. If you <hi>rob an Orchard,</hi> you have the
Guilt of a Crime lying on you. If you
<hi>Cheat</hi> any one in your dealing with
him, there is a Crime in the <hi>Fraud.</hi> It
is a Criminal Thing, to <hi>Encroach</hi> on the
Propriety of a Neighbour. These are
such Obvious Things, our very <hi>Children</hi>
may and should be acquainted with
them. There is nothing in all this,
but what any body in the World may
be advised of. Tis a Lesson which
there is no Trouble in learning of: Jer.
11. 26. <hi>A Thief is ashamed, when he is found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly. There is this Lesson in the
<hi>Fear of God,</hi> which all may learn, even
as soon as they can speak; <hi>To tell a Lye
is to do a base thing; A Lying Tongue is
an Abomination to the Lord.</hi> There
needs no Pains to insinuate this, into
the dullest Minds that we can Meet
withal; It should be your care <hi>always
to speak the Truth.</hi> You must be <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that will not Lye,</hi> else the Lord will
not be <hi>your Saviour.</hi> No Minds are of
such a Dulness, that they can't be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this; You must have a Care
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001614_0019_0F4D7F414F5A2148"/>
of <hi>Lying.</hi> While we have our <hi>Children,</hi>
but as <hi>Chickens</hi> yet under our Wings,
we may easily infuse this into them;
You must never tell a <hi>Lye;</hi> Tis a Vile
Thing to tell a <hi>Lye;</hi> If you have done
a <hi>Fault,</hi> you must not cover it with a
<hi>Lye;</hi> Such a Covering will but make
you yet <hi>More Faulty</hi> than you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
It won't require May Strokes
to beat this Truth into the <hi>Children.</hi>
By that time the <hi>Child shall know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the Evil, and abuse the Good,</hi> it may
know, that <hi>Lying</hi> is to be <hi>Abhorred;</hi>
and the <hi>Liar</hi> shall be <hi>forsaken</hi> of all his
Friends. Tis a Lesson, that can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come too soon; Eph. Iv. 25. <hi>Put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Lying; Speak the Truth, every one
with his Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly. And who is there, to
whom this Lesson in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi>
will be Unintelligible? <hi>I must wish Ill
unto none; but as far as I can do Good unto
all.</hi> There are those, who may Confess,
<hi>I have not the Vnderstanding of a Man; I
have not learned Wisdom, nor have I the
Knowledge of the Holy Ones.</hi> But yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
these, may come to so much <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001614_0020_0F4D7F43AED0E8B8"/>
and so much <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and
so much <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as this; You should
<hi>hurt no body;</hi> You should be <hi>harmless</hi> and
<hi>blameless;</hi> You should be Glad, when
your Neighbour sees <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
Good Things, and not Enviously
Wish, that you had them from him.
You shou'd be Griev'd when your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is in <hi>Advorsity,</hi> and be ready to
help him against any Bad Things that
may threaten him. These are <hi>Dictates</hi>
which cannot be Question'd; It may be
said, <hi>These things cannot be spoken against.</hi>
Our very <hi>Children</hi> may take in such
things as these. This is a Lesson that
any one may learn, under the <hi>Nurture
and Admonition of the Lord;</hi> Rom. XII.
10. <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another, in
Brotherly Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! If our <hi>Children,</hi> and the People
of the <hi>Lowest Capacities,</hi> would come &amp;
hearken to us, in such Plain Things, as
these, they would be <hi>taught the Fear of
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>111. The <hi>Weakest,</hi> and even the
<hi>Youngest</hi> People, our <hi>Children</hi> soon after
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001614_0021_0F4D7F4431528E70"/>
they have done hanging on <hi>the Breast;</hi>
May be taught, <hi>That</hi> their <hi>Conversion</hi> to
God is necessary, and <hi>What</hi> they will do,
if ever they come to be <hi>Converted.</hi> The
<hi>Fear of God</hi> will imply a Sincere and
Thorough <hi>Conversion</hi> unto Him: it will
bring People to do those things, which
are done by none but those that are
<hi>Converted</hi> unto God. The People of
the <hi>Lowest Capacity,</hi> may &amp; should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
themselves, about the <hi>Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi>
of a <hi>Real Conversion.</hi> Our <hi>Children</hi>
themselves, tho' it be not long since
they were <hi>Weaned,</hi> yet, supposing they
can act Reasonably, they will not <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
themselves in things too high for them,</hi>
if they are Exercised about the <hi>Great
Matters</hi> of their <hi>Conversion</hi> to God; It
will be but a Reasonable Thing of them
to think often on this; <hi>What shall I do
if I am Converted unto God?</hi> And, <hi>What
will become of me, if I am not Converted
unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the People, in the
Lowest Class that can be; yet the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
may be taught, some things of the
<hi>Greatest importance</hi> for all <hi>the People</hi> in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001614_0022_0F4D7F462A2D5918"/>
the World. That <hi>Vast Concern,</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
to God, is to be indeed address'd
at this rate, <hi>Hear this, All ye People, Give
Ear, All ye inhabitants of the World; Both
Low and High, Rich and Poor together.</hi>
Truly, <hi>Low</hi> People, and <hi>Poor</hi> People, and
<hi>Young</hi> People, and All that have Souls
to look after, are to be called upon, thus
to look after their Souls. Indeed, the
<hi>Highest</hi> &amp; the <hi>Richest</hi> upon Earth, have
infinite cause to be Sollicitous on this
Greatest of all Occasions. To <hi>You,</hi> Sirs,
it must be said; If you Die Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> be your
other <hi>Excellencies</hi> what they will, yet
you <hi>die without Wisdom.</hi> And then;
Tho' a Man have the <hi>Wisdom</hi> to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>
&amp; <hi>Manage</hi> Whole Nations of Men,
if he <hi>die without this Wisdom,</hi> How art
thou <hi>fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son
of the Morning,</hi> who didst <hi>Order the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>
Tho' a Man have the <hi>Wisdom</hi> to
Understand as <hi>Many Languages</hi> as a
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> or a <hi>Mordecai;</hi> if he <hi>die
without this Wisdom,</hi> he must be Lodg'd
where he shall gnaw his Tongue for
Pain, and know no Speech but that of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001614_0023_0F4D7F4692A39B40"/>
Roaring and Blasphemy. Tho' a Man
have the <hi>Wisdom</hi> to Understand as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sciences</hi> as an <hi>Alsted,</hi> or a <hi>Scaliger,</hi> if
he <hi>die without this Wisdom,</hi> he must go
into Utter Darkness, and know nothing
but his own Unutterable increase of
Sorrow. A Man may have the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
to Calculate the Motions of the
Heavens, and yet Unconverted unto
the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> he will be turn'd into
<hi>Hell</hi> after all. But I must not forget,
the Small Folks with whom I am now
Concern'd. We read concerning, <hi>The
First Principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> which
<hi>they that have need of Milk,</hi> should have
taught unto them; and we find, Heb.
VI. 1. <hi>Repentance from Dead Works, and
Faith towards God,</hi> are some of those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
Verily, our <hi>Children</hi> that <hi>have
need of Milk,</hi> are to be taught these
things; You must <hi>Repent</hi> of your Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and you must <hi>Believe</hi> in God
your Saviour; else you <hi>Dy</hi> and Perish
Wonderfully.</p>
            <p>First; <hi>Children,</hi> You are to be thus
Taught in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> such a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as this; <hi>If I do not in Time and in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001614_0024_0F4D7F478A3A2A00"/>
Truth Turn unto God, I shall dy in my Sins;
and, Oh! Miserable my Death, if it find
me so!</hi> Tis a Plain Lesson, Mat. XVIII. 3.
<hi>Except ye be Converetd, and become as Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children, ye shall not enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Even our <hi>Little
Children</hi> themselves may Learn this
Lesson; <hi>Without Conversion I shall be shut
out of Heaven.</hi> Tis a Plain Lesson;
Joh. III. 3. <hi>Except a Man be born again,
he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi> Even
our <hi>Children</hi> within a few Years after
they are <hi>First-born,</hi> may learn this Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>If I am not New-born, I shall find it
good for me that I had never been born at
all.</hi> They that are but <hi>Little Creatures,</hi>
and such as are very Shallow ones, yet
may drink in this Lesson of God; <hi>I
must be a New Creature; or else He that
Made me will not have Mercy on me.</hi> Our
very <hi>Children</hi> may soon Learn this;
That if they be <hi>Wicked Children,</hi> they are
<hi>Cursed Children;</hi> That if they are <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Children,</hi> they are not the <hi>Children
of God;</hi> That if they are not the <hi>Children
of God,</hi> they are the <hi>Children of Satan;</hi>
That <hi>Satans Children</hi> are all <hi>Slaves,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001614_0025_0F4D7F47F5388AD0"/>
shall be thrown into the same <hi>Fire,</hi> with
the <hi>Devil and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Go on, <hi>Children,</hi> and be
Taught, for you may be so, what is done
<hi>for,</hi> and what is done <hi>by,</hi> them that are
by <hi>Conversion</hi> bro't unto the <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> They that are not got beyond
the Capacity of <hi>Children,</hi> may be taught
this Lesson; <hi>I cannot of my self Turn unto
God; I must Cry unto God, that He would
Graciously Turn me to Himself.</hi> You must
be very Sottish indeed; you are <hi>Stones,</hi>
and no Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if you
don't feel your selves Unable to <hi>Turn</hi>
your Selves. But we read of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
himself; Jer. XXXI. 18. <hi>I have
been as a Bullock unaccustomed unto the Toke;
Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; For
thou art the Lord my God.</hi> It follows,
<hi>This is a dear Son, a pleasant Child, I
will surely have Mercy on him.</hi> Ah, Dear
Children; If ever God <hi>Surely have Mercy</hi>
on you, He will bring you to this; You
will see that you shall never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Yoke of Obedience</hi> to Him, till
He bring you to it. And then, as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001614_0026_0F4D7F4A08A5C2A8"/>
               <hi>Young</hi> as you are, you will Cry out, <hi>Oh!
Turn thou me, my God; Oh! Turn thou
me, that I may be turned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> They that are not got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Capacity of <hi>Children,</hi> may be
taught this Lesson; <hi>Wo is unto me, that I
have Sinned; I am in a Woful, because I
am in a Sinful Condition.</hi> If you are but
as <hi>Children,</hi> yet you may see, The Sin
of your <hi>First Father is Your Sin.</hi> Yet
you may see, The Sin of your <hi>Vile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
has in it <hi>All Sin.</hi> Yet you may
see, That your <hi>Sins</hi> are indeed without
Number; <hi>Innumerable Evils Compassing
of you,</hi> more than the <hi>Hairs of your
Heads.</hi> Yet you may see, That for
your Sins you have the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
on you. Yet you may see, the
<hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> defiling of you; the <hi>Power</hi>
of <hi>Satan</hi> Enslaving of you; the Devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pit ready to Swallow you up. As
<hi>Young</hi> as you are, you may be taught
that Cry; Luk. XVIII. 13. <hi>God be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me a Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> They that are not got
beyond the Capacity of <hi>Children,</hi>
may be taught this Lesson; <hi>There is a
Saviour willing to receive me,</hi> and relieve
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001614_0027_0F4D7F4AE09B3AA0"/>
me; <hi>and if I would be Saved, I must come
unto Him.</hi> The Eternal Son of God,
who dwells in our JESUS, took <hi>Little
Children,</hi> into His Arms, and <hi>Blessed</hi>
them: Oh! <hi>Children Blessed indeed!</hi> And
<hi>You</hi> too, may be so. He added, Mat.
XIX. 14. <hi>Suffer Little Children to come
unto Me; for of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> Ah, <hi>Little Children,</hi> You may
come unto your Saviour. If you can
take notice of what is now spoken, you
may come to this Thought, <hi>There is a</hi>
JESUS, <hi>who Saves His People from their
Sins.</hi> You may come to this Thought;
<hi>My</hi> JESUS <hi>is able to Save unto the Vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
all that come unto Him.</hi> You
may come to this Thought; <hi>My</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
<hi>will Cast out none that come unto Him.</hi>
As <hi>Young</hi> as you are, you may then come
into such Thoughts and such Cries as
these; <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver
my Soul; O my Saviour, Bind up my Soul
in the Bundle of Life! O my Saviour, Let
thy Blood Cleanse me from all my Sin! O
my Saviour, Guide me by thy Counsel, and
bring me to thy Glory!</hi> If you can request
any Person to do you any Kindness,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001614_0028_0F4D7F4AF6D6CD98"/>
can you not make this Request unto
the Blessed Jesus, <hi>O my Saviour, Take me
into thy Precious Hands.</hi> If you can ask
for <hi>Bread</hi> when you are Hungry, or for
<hi>Help</hi> when you are Uneasy; Cannot
you as well say, <hi>O my Saviour, I am
distressed, undertake for me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Tho' you are not got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Capacity of <hi>Children,</hi> yet you
may be taught this Lesson; <hi>I must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to Live an Holy Life, and be fixed
in my Resolutions.</hi> We read of such a
thing as that; Jer. III. 4. <hi>Wilt thou not
from this Time Cry unto me, My Father,
Thou art the Guide of my Youth?</hi> Why,
Tho' you are yet in your <hi>Youth, Young</hi>
in <hi>Years,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Young</hi> and Weak
in every thing; Yet you may Resolve,
<hi>The Great God shall be my God for ever
and ever, and my Guide even unto Death.</hi>
It was the Counsel; 1 Joh. V. 21. <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children, Keep your selves from Idols.</hi>
As <hi>Young</hi> as you are, <hi>Little Children,</hi>
you may Resolve, <hi>I will not Sin to Please
the Flesh, I will not Sin to Gain the World,
I will not hearken to the Sinful Motions of
the Devil.</hi> Of a <hi>Little</hi> Child we are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001614_0029_0F4D7F4BC068C068"/>
told; 1 King. XIV. 13. <hi>In him there is
found some Good Thing towards the Lord
God of Israel.</hi> As <hi>Young</hi> as you are, tho'
not beyond a <hi>Little Child,</hi> You may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve;
<hi>I will above all things desire to Know
God, and Serve God, and be in Good Terms
with God, and Vphold Communion with
God; And I will place my Happiness in
these things.</hi> We read of <hi>Children walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Truth.</hi> Even <hi>Children</hi> may
Resolve to take such a <hi>Walk,</hi> as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the <hi>Truth</hi> of God. We read
of being <hi>Followers of God as Obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
Even <hi>Children</hi> may Resolve to
<hi>Follow God,</hi> in imitating the <hi>Example</hi> of
the Holy One. And so Resolved, our
<hi>Young</hi> People, and such as are of a <hi>Low
Capacity,</hi> they may keep Constant in these
Resolutions; Their Constancy may be
Perpetual; They may begin Betimes,
and hold out unto the End.</p>
            <p>IV. The <hi>Weakest,</hi> and even the
<hi>Youngest</hi> People, <hi>Children</hi> soon after their
first <hi>going alone;</hi> may be taught, <hi>That</hi>
there are Certain <hi>Duties</hi> wherein they
are to <hi>Walk with God;</hi> and <hi>What</hi> those
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001614_0030_0F4D7F4DB6F18188"/>
Duties are, and <hi>How</hi> to be Managed,
<hi>How</hi> to be Performed. The <hi>Fear of
God</hi> will put People upon Certain <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
wherein God is to be Glorified. It
was the Wish, Deut. V. 29. <hi>O that they
would fear Me, and keep all My Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
always, that it might be well with
them, and with their Children for ever.</hi>
There are <hi>Commandements,</hi> in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to which, the <hi>Fear of God</hi> will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a <hi>Walk with God;</hi> and they are so
Plain, that our <hi>Children</hi> themselves may
Conform unto them. Two or Three
of them shall be intimated.</p>
            <p>First. There is <hi>Prayer to God;</hi> they
that are yet but in the Capacity of
<hi>Children,</hi> may do something at it; may
<hi>Pray without Ceasing.</hi> It is a Lesson
which any one of you all may learn;
there is nothing impracticable in it by
the <hi>Lowest Capacity;</hi> Mat. VI. 6. <hi>Enter
into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy
Door, Pray to thy Father which is in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</hi>
Say not, my Child, <hi>I know not
how to Pray.</hi> What? Hast thou fallen
into so many <hi>Sins,</hi> and canst thou not
<hi>Pray, For thy Names sake, Lord, Pardon
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001614_0031_0F4D7F4E203FA938"/>
my Iniquity, for it is Great!</hi> Hast thou
so many <hi>Ails</hi> in thy Soul, &amp; canst thou
not <hi>Pray, Lord, Heal my Soul, for I
have Sinned against thee!</hi> Dost thou so
much need a <hi>New Heart,</hi> and canst thou
not <hi>Pray, Lord, Create in me a Clean
Heart, and Renew a Right Spirit within
me!</hi> Art thou <hi>Dying</hi> every Day, and
canst thou not Pray, <hi>Lord, Let not my
Death overtake me, before I have begun
to Live unto God?</hi> Dost thou know of no
<hi>Mischiefs,</hi> which thou art afraid of?
Dost thou know of no <hi>Mercies</hi> worth
asking for? Consult the Book of <hi>Psalms;</hi>
Consult the State of thy <hi>own Soul;</hi> and
thou canst not be such an <hi>awkward Thing,</hi>
as to have nothing to say on thy Knees
before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly. You have the <hi>Word of God;</hi>
they that are yet but in the Capacity
of <hi>Children,</hi> may perceive whose <hi>Word</hi>
it is; that they have <hi>God</hi> speaking to
them in it. He was a <hi>Young Child,</hi> who
when the <hi>Word</hi> of God called upon
him, said; 1 Sam. III. 10. Lord, <hi>Speak,
for thy Servant heareth.</hi> One must be
more Silly than a Child in the School-boyes
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001614_0032_0F4D7F4F207BC7D8"/>
boyes Cloathes, who Paies no Regard
unto the <hi>Word of God.</hi> There is in this
Word, that which the <hi>Angels themselves
desire to look into;</hi> and there is that
which be speaks Regards from the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Capacity. Children,</hi> As soon as you
can Read, you may take the Bible, and
in Reading of it, think, <hi>This is the Voice
of God; God now Speaks unto me.</hi> When
you hear Sermons from the Ministers
of God, you have to do with God in
their Ministry, and may think; <hi>Here
are Messages from God; God now Speaks
unto me.</hi> The Lesson is a short one; <hi>I
will bear what God the Lord will Speak!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. They that are yet got no
further than the Capacity of <hi>Children,</hi>
have a <hi>Lesson</hi> to learn, which their <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Neighour</hi> is Comprized in.
The <hi>Way-faring Ones,</hi> tho' <hi>Feels,</hi> need
not <hi>Err,</hi> in the Way of their <hi>Duty to
their Neighbour;</hi> Let them only keep
to that plain Rule; Mat. VII. 12. <hi>All
things whatsoever ye would, that Men
should do to you, do ye even so to them.
Children</hi> themselves would forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>an Ill Thing</hi> towards another, if they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001614_0033_0F4D7F4F91181D28"/>
would but think; <hi>Should I be willing, to
have such a thing done by another to me?
Children</hi> themselves would be ready to
do a <hi>Good Thing</hi> unto another in Distress,
if they would but think; <hi>Would not I
be glad, if such a thing might be done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to me?</hi> And, <hi>Children,</hi> You are
not of such a <hi>Low Capacity,</hi> that you
can't form such Thoughts as these.</p>
            <p>V. There are some Religious and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening
<hi>Meditations,</hi> with which the
<hi>Weakest,</hi> and the <hi>Youngest</hi> of us all, and
People of the <hi>Lowest Capacities,</hi> may A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
themselves unto the <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
There are Certain <hi>Meditations</hi> which
have a Notable Tendency to Enkindle
the <hi>Fear of God</hi> in the Souls of Men.
Tho' People are of never such <hi>Low Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,</hi>
yet they can form such <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
The <hi>Children</hi> that Play in the
Streets, may leave their Play, and fall
into such <hi>Meditations.</hi> Children, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you are, and as <hi>Young</hi> as you are,
You may think; <hi>The Eye of God is now
upon me; God hears all that I Say; God is
acquainted with all my Ways.</hi> Add to this;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001614_0034_0F4D7F50686AB1E8"/>
It is said, Gal. III. 27. <hi>As many of you
as have been Baptised into Christ have put
en Christ.</hi> Children, When once you have
been told, that you have been <hi>Baptised,</hi>
which ought to be very Early, You
should think, <hi>What was I Baptised for?
I was bound in my Baptism to the Service of
my Saviour. I have been Washed in His
Name, and I shall do a Dirty thing, if I Sin
against my Saviour.</hi> Again; Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
sayes; Mat. XI. 28, 29. <hi>Come unto
Me, and Learn of Me.</hi> When you are
going to <hi>School,</hi> you may think; <hi>My
Saviour is willing to be my Tuter; O my
dear Saviour, I will come &amp; Learn of Thee.
None teaches like to thee.</hi> Once more;
We read; 1 King. XIV. 17. <hi>The Child
died.</hi> You see <hi>Children</hi> carried unto
their Graves: In the Burying-place
you see Graves not longer than you
are. How lately have you seen a <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Flowre</hi> Cropt? You may now think;
<hi>I may Dy as Young as I am. I know not
the Day of my Death. Lord, Make me
Ready for it.</hi> Moreover, We read, Rev.
XX. 12. <hi>I saw the Dead, Small and Great
Stand before God.</hi> You may <hi>Lodge</hi> such
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001614_0035_0F4D7F50F1FD9F68"/>
Thoughts as these, and throw away
your <hi>Vain</hi> Ones; <hi>I must One Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Iudgment-Seat of God. As
Little as I am, I shall not be left Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by the Glorious Iudge of the World.</hi>
Carry on the Thoughts; Think; <hi>If I
Fear God, I shall for ever be With the
Lord, and be unspeakably Blessed in His
Heavenly Places.</hi> Think; <hi>If I have not
the Fear of God, I shall be thrown into a
place of Torment; and an Everlasting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
will be my Portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have had <hi>Lessons relating to
the Fear of God</hi> Plainly set before you;
Such Lessons, and so <hi>Plainly</hi> offered, that
People of the <hi>Lowest Capacity</hi> may <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
them and <hi>Consider</hi> them.</p>
            <p>There are Two Remarks, which I
have now to make upon them.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>The First Remark.</head>
               <p>We cannot be Satisfied, that our
People of the <hi>Lowest Capacity,</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
our <hi>Children,</hi> should remain
Strangers to the <hi>Fear of God. Children,</hi>
As <hi>Young</hi> as you are, 'tis not <hi>too Soon</hi> for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001614_0036_0F4D7F525BA9C598"/>
you to <hi>Dy;</hi> 'tis not <hi>too Soon</hi> for you to
fall into a <hi>Damnation that Slumbers
not;</hi> 'tis not <hi>too Soon</hi> for you to Mind
what you are <hi>a doing,</hi> and where you
are <hi>a going.</hi> Then 'tis not <hi>too Soon</hi> for
you to <hi>Fear God;</hi> 'tis not <hi>too Soon</hi> for you
to <hi>Vnderstand</hi> and <hi>Consider,</hi> what you
have to <hi>Know</hi> and to <hi>Do</hi> in the <hi>Fear of
God.</hi> We read, Isa. XXVIII. 9. <hi>Whom
shall He teach Knowledge? And whom shall
He make to Vnderstand Doctrine? Them
that are Weaned from the Milk, &amp; Drawn
from the Breasts.</hi> Truly, E're you have
been any long time <hi>Weaned from the
Milk, and Drawn from the Breasts,</hi> you
may be <hi>Taught</hi> the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and you
may <hi>Mind</hi> what you are <hi>Taught.</hi> Oh!
When shall it be said of our <hi>Children,
Behold, they Pray!</hi> When will our <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
answer all Temptation to Sin, <hi>How
shall I do this Wickedness, and Sin against
God!</hi> When will our <hi>Children</hi> make that
Enquiry, <hi>What shall I do to be Saved?</hi> O
our <hi>Children,</hi> and You also that in your
<hi>Capacity</hi> are not better than <hi>Children;</hi> to
YOU is this Lesson sent; <hi>Acquaint your
selves now with God; thereby Good shall
come unto you!</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001614_0037_0F4D7F5271335E10"/>
               <head>The Second Remark.</head>
               <p>Then People of an <hi>Higher Capacity,</hi> &amp;
such as have Out-grown the Years and
Wits of <hi>Children,</hi> are most <hi>Inexcusable,</hi> if
they should persist without the <hi>Fear of
God.</hi> It was a sharp Censure and <hi>Satyr</hi>
upon some; 1 Cor. III. 1. <hi>I could not
speak unto you, but as unto Babes.</hi> But
it must come with a greater Sharpness,
if it may be said, <hi>You have not so much
Fear of God in you, as might be expected in
Babes.</hi> Alas, It would be <hi>Inexcusable</hi>
in our <hi>Children,</hi> if they should Know
and Do no better, than many People
who pretend unto the Years of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
O You that are come to some
<hi>Forwardness,</hi> and it may be, some <hi>Figure</hi>
and <hi>Station</hi> in the World; it cannot be
endured, that YOU should go on <hi>still
in your Trespasses.</hi> When <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Death</hi>
are set before you; What? Are you
not <hi>Old</hi> enough to Chuse; And will
you still make a <hi>Choice,</hi> like an <hi>Infant</hi>
or an <hi>Ideot?</hi> You have the <hi>Path</hi> on
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001614_0038_0F4D7F532EFDB578"/>
the <hi>Right</hi> Hand, and the <hi>Path</hi> on the
<hi>Left,</hi> set before you; What? Will
you act as if you were the Children
of <hi>Ninive,</hi> not knowing the <hi>Right Hand
from the Left?</hi> The Demand of God
was that; <hi>Show your selves Men.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
'tis time for many of you to
<hi>Show your selves Men;</hi> and not Prove
your selves <hi>Worse than Children.</hi> 'Tis
to be shown by the <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
