            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>PERHAPS the Sentiments contained in the following pages, are not <hi>yet</hi> ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently fa≈øhionable to procure them general Favor; a long Habit of not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Thing <hi>wrong,</hi> gives it a ≈øuperficial appearance of being <hi>right,</hi> and rai≈øes at fir≈øt a formidable outcry in defence of Cu≈øtom. But the Tumult ≈øoon ≈øub≈øides. Time makes more Converts than Rea≈øon.</p>
                  <p>As a long and violent abu≈øe of power, is generally the means of calling the right of it in que≈øtion (and in matters too which might never have been thought of, had not the ≈øufferers been aggravated into the inquiry) and as the King of England hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his <hi>own Right</hi> to ≈øuport the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in what he calls <hi>Theirs,</hi> and as the good People of this Country are grievou≈øly oppre≈ø≈øed by the Combination, they have an undoubted privilege to enquire into the Preten≈øions of both, and equally to reject the U≈øurpation of <hi>either.</hi>

                  <p>In the following Sheets, the Author hath ≈øtudiou≈øly avoided every thing which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonal among our≈øelves. Compliments as well as cen≈øure to individuals make no part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The wi≈øe, and the worthy, need not the

                     <head>Of the Origin and De≈øign of <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> in general, with conci≈øe Remarks on the ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.</head>
                     <p>SOME writers have ≈øo confounded ≈øociety with government, as to leave little or no di≈øtinction between them; whereas, they are not only different, but have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedne≈øs; the former promotes our happine≈øs <hi>po≈ø≈øitively</hi> by uniting our affections, the latter <hi>negatively</hi> by re≈øtraining our vices. The one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages intercour≈øe, the other creates di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions. The fir≈øt is a patron, the la≈øt a puni≈øher.</p>
                     <p>Society in every ≈øtate is a ble≈ø≈øing, but Government even in its be≈øt ≈øtate is but a nece≈ø≈øary evil; in its wor≈øt ≈øtate an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable one: for when we ≈øuffer, or are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the ≈øame mi≈øeries <hi>by a Government,</hi> which we might expect in a country <hi>without Government,</hi> our calamity is heightened by
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:014966_0008_0F954E6ECF970EF0"/>
reflecting that we furni≈øh the means by which we ≈øuffer. Government like dre≈øs is the badge of lo≈øt innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradi≈øe. For were the impul≈øes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience clear, uniform, and irre≈øi≈øtibly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the ca≈øe, he finds it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to ≈øurrender up a part of his property to furni≈øh means for the protection of the re≈øt; and this he is induced to do, by the ≈øame prudence which in every other ca≈øe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øes him, out of two evils to choo≈øe the lea≈øt. Wherefore, ≈øecurity being the true de≈øign and end of government, it unan≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follows, that whatever form thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears mo≈øt likely to en≈øure it to us, with the lea≈øt expence and greate≈øt benefit, is preferable to all others.</p>
                     <p>In order to gain a clear and ju≈øt idea of the de≈øign and end of government, let us ≈øuppo≈øe a ≈ømall number of per≈øons ≈øettled in ≈øome ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtered part of the earth, unconnected with the re≈øt; they will then repre≈øent the fir≈øt peopling of any country; or of the world. In this ≈øtate of natural liberty, ≈øociety will be their fir≈øt thought. A thou≈øand motives will excite them thereto, the ≈øtrength of one
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014966_0009_0F954E6F84133E50"/>
man is ≈øo unequal to his wants, and his mind ≈øo unfitted for perpetual ≈øolitude, that he is ≈øoon obliged to ≈øeek a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the ≈øame. Four or five united would be able to rai≈øe a tolerable dwelling in the mid≈øt of a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, but one man might labour out the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon period of life without accompli≈øhing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time would urge him to quit his work, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very different want call him a different way. Di≈øea≈øe, nay even misfortune would be death; for tho' neither might be mortal, yet either would di≈øable him from living, and reduce him to a ≈øtate in which he might rather be ≈øaid to peri≈øh, than to die.</p>
                     <p>Thus nece≈ø≈øity like a gravitating power would ≈øoon form our newly arrived emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants into ≈øociety, the reciprocal ble≈ø≈øings of which, would ≈øuper≈øede, and render the obligations of law and goverment unnece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary while they remained perfectly ju≈øt to each other: but as nothing but Heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably happen that in proportion as they ≈øurmount the fir≈øt difficulties of emigration, which

bound them together in a common cau≈øe, they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other: and this remi≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs will point out the nece≈ø≈øity of e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome form of government to ≈øupply the defect of moral virtue.</p>
                     <p>Some convenient tree will afford them a State Hou≈øe, under the branches of which the whole Colony may a≈ø≈øemble to deliberate on public matters. It is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that their fir≈øt laws will have the title only of REGULATIONS and be enforced by no other penalty than public di≈øe≈øteem. In this fir≈øt parliament every man by natural right will have a ≈øeat.</p>
                     <p>But as the Colony encrea≈øes, the public concerns will encrea≈øe likewi≈øe, and the di≈øtance at which the members may be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occa≈øion as at fir≈øt, when their number was ≈ømall, their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling, This will point out the convenience of their con≈øenting to leave the legi≈ølative part to be managed by a ≈øelect number cho≈øen from the whole body, who are ≈øuppo≈øed to have the ≈øame concerns at

≈øtake which tho≈øe have who appointed them, and who will act in the ≈øame manner as the whole body would act were they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent. If the colony continues encrea≈øing, it will become nece≈ø≈øary to augment the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the repre≈øentatives, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found be≈øt to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part ≈øending its proper number: and that the <hi>elected</hi> might never form to them≈øelves an intere≈øt ≈øeparate from the electors, prudence will point out the propriety of having elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions often: becau≈øe as the elected might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the electors in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be ≈øecured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for them≈øelves. And as this frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange will e≈øtabli≈øh a common intere≈øt with every part of the community, they will mutually and naturally ≈øupport each other, and on this (not on the unmeaning name of king) depends the <hi>≈øtrength of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the happine≈øs of the governed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here then is the origin and ri≈øe of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; namely, a mode rendered nece≈ø≈øary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014966_0012_0F954ED0F61DDDD8"/>
world; here too is the de≈øign and end of government, viz. Freedom and ≈øecurity. And however our eyes may be dazzled with ≈øhow, or our ears deceived by ≈øound; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prejudice may warp our wills, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt darken our under≈øtanding, the ≈øimple voice of nature and of rea≈øon will ≈øay, 'tis right.</p>
                     <p>I draw my idea of the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, viz. That the more ≈øimple any thing is, the le≈øs liable it is to be di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the ea≈øier repaired when di≈øorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and with this maxim in view I offer a few remarks on the ≈øo much boa≈øted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of England. That it was noble for the dark and ≈ølavi≈øh times in which it was erected, is granted. When the world was over-run with tyranny the lea≈øt remove there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from was a glorious re≈øcue. But that it is imperfect, ≈øubject to convul≈øions, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing what it ≈øeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe is ea≈øily demon≈øtrated.</p>
                     <p>Ab≈øolute governments, (tho' the di≈øgrace of human nature) have this advantage with them, that they are ≈øimple; if the people ≈øuffer, they know the head from which their

≈øuffering ≈øprings; know likewi≈øe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and are not bewildered by a variety of cau≈øes and cures. But the con≈øtitution of England is ≈øo exceedingly complex, that the nation may ≈øuffer for years together without being able to di≈øcover in which part the fault lies, ≈øome will ≈øay in one and ≈øome in another, and every political phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian will advi≈øe a different medicine.</p>
                     <p>I know it is difficult to get over local or long ≈øtanding prejudices, yet if we will ≈øuffer our≈øelves to examine the component parts of the Engli≈øh con≈øtitution, we ≈øhall find them to be the ba≈øe remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with ≈øome new Republican materials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi>‚ÄîThe remains of Monarchical ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in the per≈øon of the King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi>‚ÄîThe remains of Ari≈øtocratical tyranny in the per≈øons of the Peers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi>‚ÄîThe new Republican materials, in the per≈øons of the Commons, on who≈øe virtue depends the freedom of England.</p>
                     <p>The two fir≈øt by being hereditary are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014966_0014_0F954ED3F6E38768"/>
independent of the People; wherefore in a <hi>con≈øtitutional ≈øen≈øe</hi> they contribute nothing towards the freedom of the State.</p>
                     <p>To ≈øay that the con≈øtitution of England is an <hi>union</hi> of three powers reciprocally <hi>checking</hi> each other, is farcical, either the words have no meaning or they are flat contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>To ≈øay that the Commons are a check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, pre≈øuppo≈øes two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir≈øt.</hi>‚ÄîThat the King is not to be tru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without being looked after; or in other words, that a thir≈øt for ab≈øolute power is the natural di≈øea≈øe of Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi>‚ÄîThat the Commons by being appointed for that purpo≈øe, are either wi≈øer or more worthy of confidence than the Crown.</p>
                     <p>But as the ≈øame con≈øtitution which gives the Commons a power to check the King by with-holding the ≈øupplies, gives after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King a power to check the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by empowering him to reject their other bills; it again ≈øuppo≈øes that the King is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014966_0015_0F954ED4BA5C6630"/>
wi≈øer than tho≈øe whom it has already ≈øuppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be wi≈øer than him. A mere ab≈øurdity!</p>
                     <p>There is ≈øomething exceedingly ridiculous in the compo≈øition of Monarchy; it fir≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a man from the means of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet empowers him to act in ca≈øes where the highe≈øt judgment is required.‚Äî The ≈øtate of a king ≈øhuts him from the world yet the bu≈øine≈øs of a king requires him to know it thoroughly: wherefore, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts by unnaturally oppo≈øing and de≈øtroying each other, prove the whole character to be ab≈øurd and u≈øele≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Some writers have explained the Engli≈øh con≈øtitution thus; the King ≈øay they is one, the people another; the Peers are an hou≈øe in behalf of the King; the Commons in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the people; but this hath all the di≈øtinctions of an hou≈øe divided again≈øt it≈øelf; and tho' the expre≈ø≈øions be plea≈øantly arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet when examined they appear idle and ambiguous: and it will always happen, that the nice≈øt con≈øtruction that words are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, when applied to the de≈øcription of ≈øomething which either cannot exi≈øt, or is too incomprehen≈øible to be within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs of de≈øcription, will be words of ≈øound
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014966_0016_0F954ED57916F998"/>
only, and tho' they may amu≈øe the ear, they cannot inform the mind: for this explanation includes a previous que≈øtion, viz. <hi>how came the King by a power which the people are afraid to tru≈øt and always obliged to check?</hi> Such a power could not be the gift of a wi≈øe people, neither can any power <hi>which needs checking</hi> be from God: yet the provi≈øion which the con≈øtitution makes, ≈øuppo≈øes ≈øuch a power to exi≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But the provi≈øion is unequal to the ta≈øk, the means either cannot, or will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øh the end, and the whole affair is a <hi>Felo de ≈øe</hi>: for as the greater weight will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carry up the le≈øs, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the con≈øtitution has the mo≈øt weight, for that will govern: and tho' the others, or a part of them, may clog, or check the rapidity of its motion, yet ≈øo long as they cannot ≈øtop it, their endeavours will be ineffectual: The fir≈øt moving power will at la≈øt have its way, and what it wants in ≈øpeed will be ≈øupplied by time.</p>
                     <p>That the crown is this overbearing part in the Engli≈øh con≈øtitution needs not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014966_0017_0F954ED645D37868"/>
and that it derives its whole con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence merely from being the giver of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and pen≈øions is ≈øelf evident, wherefore, tho' we have been wi≈øe enough to lock the door again≈øt ab≈øolute Monarchy, we at the ≈øame time have been fooli≈øh enough to put the Crown in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the key.</p>
                     <p>The prejudice of Engli≈øhmen in favour of their own government by King, Lords and Commons, ari≈øes as much or more from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pride than rea≈øon. Individuals are undoubtedly ≈øafer in England than in ≈øome other countries: but the will of the King is as much the law of the land in Britain as in France with this difference, that in≈øtead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the people under the more formidable ≈øhape of an act of parliament. For the fate of Charles the Fir≈øt, hath only made kings more ≈øubtle‚Äînot more ju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore laying a≈øide all national pride and prejudice in favour of modes and forms, the plain truth is, that <hi>it is wholly owing to the con≈øtitution of the people, and not to the con≈øtitution of the government</hi> that the crown is not as oppre≈ø≈øive in England as in Turkey.</p>

                     <p>MANKIND being originally equals in the order of creation, the equality could only be de≈øtroyed by ≈øome ≈øub≈øequent circum≈øtance: the di≈øtinctions of rich and poor may in a great mea≈øure be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, and that without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe to the har≈øh ill-≈øounding names of oppre≈ø≈øion and avarice.

                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014966_0019_0F954ED7CA9361D8"/>But there is another and greater di≈øtinction for which no truly natural or religious rea≈øon can be a≈ø≈øigned, and that is, the di≈øtinction of Men into KINGS and SUBJECTS. Male and female are the di≈øtinctions of nature, good and bad the di≈øtinctions of Heaven; but how a race of men came into the world ≈øo exalted above the re≈øt, and di≈øtingui≈øhed like ≈øome new ≈øpecies, is worth enquiring into, and whether they are the means of happine≈øs or of mi≈øery to mankind.</p>
                     <p>In the early ages of the world according to the ≈øcripture chronology there were no kings; the con≈øequence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confu≈øion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this la≈øt century, than any of the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical governments in Europe. Antiquity favours the ≈øame remark; for the quiet and rural lives of the fir≈øt Patriarchs hath a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ≈øomething in them, which vani≈øhes away when we come to the hi≈øtory of Jewi≈øh royalty.</p>
                     <p>Government by kings was fir≈øt introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the World by the Heathens, from whom the children of I≈øreal copied the cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014966_0020_0F954ED8773AA048"/>
It was the mo≈øt pro≈øperous invention the Devil ever ≈øet on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to their decea≈øed Kings, and the Chri≈øtian World hath improved on the plan by doing the ≈øame to their living ones. How impious is the title of ≈øacred Maje≈øty applied to a worm, who in the mid≈øt of his ≈øplendor is crumbling into du≈øt.</p>
                     <p>As the exalting one man ≈øo greatly above the re≈øt cannot be ju≈øtified on the equal rights of nature, ≈øo neither can it be defended on the authority of ≈øcripture; for the will of the Almighty as declared by Gideon and the Prophet Samuel, expre≈ø≈øly di≈øapproves of government by Kings, all anti-monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical parts of ≈øcripture have been very ≈ømoothly glo≈ø≈øed over in monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, but they undoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form. "<hi>Render unto Cae≈øar the things which are Cae≈øar's</hi>" is the ≈øcripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no ≈øupport of monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a king and in a ≈øtate of va≈ø≈øalage to the Romans.</p>
                     <p>Near three thou≈øand years pa≈ø≈øed away

from the Mo≈øaic account of the creation, till the Jews under a national delu≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øted a king. Till then, their form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (except in exraordinary ca≈øes where the Almighty interpo≈øed) was a kind of Republic admini≈øtred by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held ≈øinful to acknowledge any Being under that title but the Lord of Ho≈øts. And when a man ≈øeriou≈øly reflects on the idolatrous homage which is paid to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of kings, he need not wonder that the Almighty ever jealous of his honour, ≈øhould di≈øapprove of a form of government which ≈øo impiou≈øly invades the prerogative of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Monarchy is ranked in ≈øcripture as one of the ≈øins of the Jews, for which a cur≈øe in re≈øerve is denounced again≈øt them. The hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of that tran≈øaction is worth attending to.</p>
                     <p>The children of I≈ørael being oppre≈ø≈øed by the Midianites, Gideon marched again≈øt them with a ≈ømall army, and victory thro' the Divine interpo≈øition decided in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, The Jews elate with ≈øucce≈øs, and attributing it to the general≈øhip of Gideon, propo≈øed making him a king; ≈øaying <hi>Rule

Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honour, but denieth their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented declarations of his thanks, but in the po≈øitive ≈øtile of a prophet charges them with di≈øaffection to their proper Sovereign, the King of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>About one hundred and thirty years after this they fell again into the ≈øame error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous cu≈øtoms of the Heathens, is ≈øomething exceedingly unaccountable; but ≈øo it was, that laying hold of the mi≈øconduct of Samuel's two ≈øons who were entru≈øted with ≈øome ≈øecular concerns they came in an abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel ≈øaying, <hi>behold thou art old, and thy ≈øons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us like all the other nations.</hi> And here we cannot but ob≈øerve that their motives were bad, viz. that they might be <hi>like</hi> unto other

That the Almighty hath here entered his prote≈øt again≈øt monarchical government is true, or the ≈øcripture is fal≈øe. And a man
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014966_0026_0F954F1FC5C0F620"/>
hath good rea≈øon to believe that there is as much of king-craft, as prie≈øt-craft, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ≈øcripture from the public in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh countries. For monarchy in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance is the popery of government.</p>
                     <p>To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion; and as the fir≈øt is a degradation and le≈ø≈øening of our≈øelves, ≈øo the ≈øecond, claimed as a matter of right, is an in≈øult and an impo≈øition on po≈øterity. For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to ≈øet up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever, and tho' him≈øelf might de≈øerve ≈øome decent degree of honours of his cotempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet his de≈øcendants might be far too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to inherit them. One of the ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature di≈øapproves it, otherwi≈øe ≈øhe would not ≈øo frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an <hi>a≈øs for a lion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as no man at fir≈øt could po≈ø≈øe≈øs any other public honours than were be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, ≈øo the givers of tho≈øe honours could have no power to give away the right of po≈øterity, and though they might ≈øay "we choo≈øe you for our head" they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øuch an unwi≈øe, unju≈øt; unnatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact might (perhaps) in the next ≈øucce≈ø≈øion put them under the government of a rogue or a fool. Mo≈øt wi≈øe men in their private ≈øentiments have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of tho≈øe evils, which when once e≈øtabli≈øhed is not ea≈øily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: many ≈øubmit from fear, others from ≈øuper≈øtition, and the more powerful part ≈øhares with the king the plunder of the re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>This is ≈øuppo≈øing the pre≈øent race of kings in the world to have had an honorable ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: whereas it is more than probable, that could we take off the dark covering of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and trace them to their fir≈øt ri≈øe, that we ≈øhould find the fir≈øt of them nothing better than the principal ruffian of ≈øome re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs gang, who≈øe ≈øavage manners or pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in ≈øubtilty obtained him the title of chief among plunderers: and who by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing in power and extending his depredations, over-awed the quiet and defencele≈øs to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe their ≈øafety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his de≈øcendants, becau≈øe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014966_0028_0F954F2139056980"/>
≈øuch a perpetual exclu≈øion of them≈øelves was incompatible with the free and unre≈øtrained principles they profe≈ø≈øed to live by. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim, but as ≈øomething ca≈øual or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimental; but as few or no records were extant in tho≈øe days, and traditionary hi≈øtory ≈øtuff'd with fables, it was very ea≈øy after the lap≈øe of a few generations, to trump up ≈øome ≈øuper≈øtitious tale conveniently timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar. Perhaps the di≈øorders which threatened, or ≈øeemed to threaten, on the decea≈øe of a leader and the choice of a new one (for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at fir≈øt to favour hereditary preten≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by which means it happened, as it hath happened ≈øince, that what at fir≈øt was ≈øubmitted to as a convenience was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards claimed as a right.</p>
                     <p>England ≈øince the conque≈øt hath known ≈øome few good monarchs, but groaned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a much larger number of bad ones: yet no man in his ≈øen≈øes can ≈øay that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honourable one. A French Ba≈øtard

landing with an armed Banditti and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhing him≈øelf king of England again≈øt the con≈øent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry ra≈øcally original.‚ÄîIt certainly hath no divinity in it. However it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs to ≈øpend much time in expo≈øing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any ≈øo weak as to believe it, let them promi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuou≈øly wor≈øhip the A≈øs and Lion and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.

                     <p>Yet I ≈øhould be glad to a≈øk how they ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe kings came at fir≈øt? the que≈øtion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits but of three an≈øwers, viz. either by lot, by election or by u≈øurpation. If the fir≈øt king was taken by lot, it e≈øtabli≈øhes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion.

If the fir≈øt king of any country was by election that likewi≈øe e≈øtabli≈øhes a precedent for the next; for to ≈øay that the right of all future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations is taken away by the act of the fir≈øt electors in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of ≈øcripture but the doctrine
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014966_0030_0F954F24F6F57D10"/>
of original ≈øin, which ≈øuppo≈øes the free-will of all men lo≈øt in Adam: and from ≈øuch compari≈øon, and it will admit of no other, hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion can derive no glory. For as in Adam all ≈øinned, and as in the fir≈øt electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were ≈øubjected to Satan, and in the other to ≈øovereignty; as our innocence was lo≈øt in the fir≈øt, and our authority in the la≈øt; and as both di≈øable us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈ø≈øuming ≈øome former ≈øtate and privilege, it unan≈øwerably follow; that original ≈øin and hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion are parallels. Di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable rank! inglorious connection! yet the mo≈øt ≈øubtle ≈øophi≈øt cannot produce a ju≈øter ≈øimile.</p>
                     <p>As to u≈øurpation no man will be ≈øo hardy as to defend it; and that William the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer was an u≈øurper is a fact not to be contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engli≈øh monarchy will not bear looking into.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ≈øo much the ab≈øurdity as the evil of hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion which concerns mankind. Did it en≈øure a race of good and wi≈øe men it would have the ≈øeal of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh,</hi> the <hi>wicked,</hi> and the <hi>improper,</hi> it hath
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014966_0031_0F954F25501E4C08"/>
in it the nature of oppre≈ø≈øion. Men who look upon them≈øelves born to reign, and others to obey, ≈øoon grow in≈øolent‚Äî≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the re≈øt of Mankind their minds are ea≈øily poi≈øoned by importance; and the world they act in differs ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true intere≈øts, and when they ≈øucceed to the government are frequently the mo≈øt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unfit of any throughout the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                     <p>Another evil which attends hereditary ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion, is, that the throne is ≈øubject to be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by a minor at any age; all which time the regency acting under the cover of a king have every opportunity and inducement to betray their tru≈øt. The ≈øame national misfortune happens when a king worn out with age and infirmity enters the la≈øt ≈øtage of human weakne≈øs. In both the≈øe ca≈øes the public becomes a prey to every mi≈øcreant who can tamper ≈øucce≈øsfully with the follies either of age or infancy.</p>
                     <p>The mo≈øt plau≈øible plea which hath ever been offered in favour of hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, is, that it pre≈øerves a Nation from civil wars;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014966_0032_0F954F25DA0C78E8"/>
and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas it is the mo≈øt barefaced fal≈øity ever impo≈øed upon mankind. The whole hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of England di≈øowns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have reigned in that di≈øtracted kingdom ≈øince the conque≈øt, in which time there has been (including the Revolution) no le≈øs than eight civil wars and nineteen Rebellions. Wherefore in≈øtead of making for peace, it makes again≈øt it, and de≈øtroys the very foundation it ≈øeems to ≈øtand upon.</p>
                     <p>The conte≈øt for monarchy and ≈øucce≈ø≈øion between the hou≈øes of York and Lanca≈øter laid England in a ≈øcene of blood for many years. Twelve pitched battles be≈øides ≈økir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øhes and ≈øieges were fought between Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry pri≈øoner to Edward, who in his turn was pri≈øoner to Henry. And ≈øo uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a Nation, when nothing but per≈øonal matters are the ground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a pri≈øon to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land: Yet as ≈øudden tran≈øitions of temper are ≈øeldom la≈øting. Henry in his turn was driven from the throne and Edward

recalled to ≈øucceed him. The parliament always following the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øide.</p>
                     <p>This conte≈øt began in the reign of Henry the ≈øixth and was not entirely extingui≈øhed till Henry the ≈øeventh. in whom the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489.</p>
                     <p>In ≈øhort, monarchy and ≈øucce≈ø≈øion have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the world in blood and a≈øhes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears te≈øtimony again≈øt, and blood will attend it.</p>
                     <p>If we enquire into the bu≈øine≈øs of a King we ≈øhall find that in ≈øome countries they have none; and after ≈øauntering away their lives without plea≈øure to them≈øelves or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the nation, withdraw from the ≈øcene and leave their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to tread the ≈øame idle round. In ab≈øolute monarchies the whole weight of bu≈øine≈øs civil and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lies on the King; the children of I≈ørael in their reque≈øt for a King urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles." But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what is his bu≈øine≈øs.</p>

                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:014966_0034_0F954F27392D3500"/>The nearer any government approaches to a republic the le≈øs bu≈øine≈øs there is for a King. It is ≈øomewhat difficult to find a proper name for the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls it a Republic; but in its pre≈øent ≈øtate it is unworthy of the name, becau≈øe the corrupt influence of the Crown by having all the places in its di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal, hath ≈øo effectually ≈øwallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue of the Hou≈øe of Commons (the Republican part in the con≈øtitution) that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain. Men fall out with names wihout under≈øtanding them. For 'tis the republican and not the monarchical part of the con≈øtitution of England which Engli≈øhmen glory in, viz. the liberty of choo≈øing an hou≈øe of commons from out of their own body‚Äîand it is ea≈øy to ≈øee that when republican virtue fails, ≈ølavery en≈øues.

                     <p>In England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give away places; which in plain terms, is to impoveri≈øh the

                     <p>It hath been reported of the late Mr. Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (who tho' an able mini≈øter was not without his faults) that on his being attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Hou≈øe of Commons on the ≈øcore that his mea≈øures were only of a temporary kind, replied "<hi>they will la≈øt my time.</hi>" Should a thought ≈øo fatal and unmanly po≈ø≈øe≈øs the Colonies in the pre≈øent conte≈øt, the name of ance≈øtors will be remembered by future generations with dete≈øtation.</p>

                     <p>As much hath been ≈øaid of the advantages of reconciliation, which like an agreeable dream, hath pa≈ø≈øed away and left us as we were, it is but right, that we ≈øhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the contrary ≈øide of the argument, and enquire into ≈øome of the many material injuries which the≈øe Colonies ≈øu≈øtain, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will ≈øu≈øtain, by being connected with and dependant on Great Britain.

that connection and dependance on the principles of nature and common ≈øen≈øe, to ≈øee what we have to tru≈øt to if ≈øeparated, and what we are to expect if dependant.</p>
                     <p>I have heard it a≈ø≈øerted by ≈øome, that as America hath flouri≈øhed under her former connection with Great Britain, that the ≈øame connection is nece≈ø≈øary towards her future happine≈øs and will always have the ≈øame effect‚ÄîNothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument:‚Äîwe may as well a≈ø≈øert that becau≈øe a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat, or that the fir≈øt twenty years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty. But even this is admitting more than is true, for I an≈øwer, roundly, that America would have flouri≈øhed as much, and probably much more had no European power taken any notice of her.

                     <p>Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices and made large ≈øacrifices to ≈øuper≈øtition. We have boa≈øted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Great Britain, without con≈øidering, that her motive was <hi>intere≈øt</hi> not <hi>attachment</hi>; that ≈øhe did not protect us from <hi>our enemies</hi> on <hi>our account,</hi> but from <hi>her enemies</hi> on <hi>her own account,</hi> from tho≈øe who had no quarrel with us on any <hi>other account,</hi> and who will always be our enemies on the <hi>≈øame account.</hi> Let Britain wave her preten≈øions to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or the Continent throw off the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and we ≈øhould be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The mi≈øeries of Hanover la≈øt war ought to warn us again≈øt connections.</p>
                     <p>It hath lately been a≈ø≈øerted in parliament, that the Colonies have no relation to each other but through the Parent Country, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Penn≈øylvania and the Jer≈øeys and ≈øo on for the re≈øt, are ≈øi≈øter Colonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about way of proving relation≈øhip, but it is the neare≈øt and only true way of proving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

(or enemy≈øhip, if I may ≈øo call it.) France and Spain never were, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as <hi>Americans</hi> but as our being the <hi>≈øubjects of Great Britain.</hi>

                     <p>But Britain is the parent country ≈øay ≈øome. Then the more ≈øhame upon her conduct. Even brutes do not devour their young, nor ≈øavages make war upon their families; wherefore the a≈ø≈øertion if true, turns to her reproach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly ≈øo, and the phra≈øe, <hi>parent</hi> or <hi>mother country,</hi> hath been je≈øui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically adopted by the King and his para≈øites, with a low papi≈øtical de≈øign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakne≈øs of our minds. Europe and not England is the parent country of America. This new World hath been the a≈øylum for the per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from <hi>every part</hi> of Europe.

                     <p>It is plea≈øant to ob≈øerve by what regular gradations we ≈øurmount the force of local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice as we enlarge our acquaintance with the World.

Britain being now an open enemy, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes every other name and title: and to ≈øay that reconciliation is our duty, is truly farcical. The fir≈øt king of England, of the pre≈øent line (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of England are de≈øcendants from the ≈øame country; wherefore, by the ≈øame method of rea≈øoning, England ought to he governed by France.</p>
                     <p>Much hath been ≈øaid of the united ≈øtrength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is mere pre≈øumption, the ≈øate of war is uncertain, neither do the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014966_0043_0F954F2F6CD134A0"/>
mean any thing, for this Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent would never ≈øuffer it≈øelf to be drained of inhabitants, to ≈øupport the Briti≈øh Arms in either A≈øia, Africa, or Europe.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides, what have we to do with ≈øetting the world at defiance? Our plan is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and that well attended to, will ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us the peace and friend≈øhip of all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, becau≈øe it is the intere≈øt of all Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenne≈øs of gold and ≈øilver will ≈øecure her from invaders.</p>
                     <p>I challenge the warme≈øt advocate for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, to ≈øhew, a ≈øingle advantage that this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a ≈øingle advantage is derived. Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe and our imported goods mu≈øt be paid for buy them where we will.</p>
                     <p>But the injuries and di≈øadvantages we ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by that connection, are without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to our≈øelves, in≈øtruct us to renounce the alliance: becau≈øe any ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to, or dependance on Great Britain, tends directly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014966_0044_0F954F2F951552D8"/>
to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no political connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with any part of it. 'Tis the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt of America, to ≈øteer clear of European contentions, which ≈øhe never can do, while by her dependance on Britain, ≈øhe is made the make-weight in the ≈øcale of Briti≈øh politics.</p>
                     <p>Europe is too thickly planted with King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to be long at peace, and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the trade of America goes to ruin, <hi>becau≈øe of her connection with Britain.</hi> The next war may not turn out like the la≈øt, and ≈øhould it not, the advocates for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation now, will be wi≈øhing for ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration then, becau≈øe neutrality in that ca≈øe, would be a ≈øafer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleads for ≈øeparation. The blood of the ≈ølain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART. Even the di≈øtance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a ≈øtrong and natural proof, that the authority of the one over the other, was never the de≈øign of Heaven. The time likewi≈øe at which the Continent
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014966_0045_0F954F30577E30D0"/>
was di≈øcovered, adds weight to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the manner in which it was peopled encrea≈øes the force of it.‚ÄîThe Reformation was preceded by the di≈øcovery of America; As if the Almighty graciou≈øly meant to open a ≈øanctuary to the per≈øecuted in future years, when home ≈øhould afford neither friend≈øhip nor ≈øafety.</p>
                     <p>The authority of Great Britain over this Continent is a form of Government which ≈øooner or later mu≈øt have an end: And a ≈øerious mind can draw no true plea≈øure by looking forward, under the painful and po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conviction, that what he calls "the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent con≈øtitution," is merely temporary. As parents, we can have no joy, knowing that this government is not ≈øufficiently la≈øting to en≈øure any thing which we may bequeath to po≈øterity: And by a plain method of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we are running the next genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into debt, we ought to do the work of it, otherwi≈øe we u≈øe them meanly and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. In order to di≈øcover the line of our duty rightly, we ≈øhould take our children in our hand, and fix our ≈øtation a few years far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into life; that eminence will pre≈øent a pro≈øpect, which a few pre≈øent fears and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices conceal from our ≈øight.</p>

Intere≈øted men who are not to be tru≈øted, weak men who cannot ≈øee, prejudiced men who will not ≈øee, and a certain ≈øet of moderate men who think better of the European world than it de≈øerves; and this la≈øt cla≈øs, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the cau≈øe of more calamities to this Continent, than all the other three.</p>
                     <p>It is the good fortune of many to live di≈øtant from the ≈øcene of pre≈øent ≈øorrow; the evil is not ≈øufficiently brought to their doors to make them feel the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øne≈øs with which all American property is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.

                     <p>Men of pa≈ø≈øive tempers look ≈øomewhat lightly over the offences of Britain, and ≈øtill hoping for the be≈øt, are apt to call out. <hi>Come, come, we ≈øhall be friends again for all this.</hi> But examine the pa≈ø≈øions and feelings of mankind: bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touch≈øtone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully ≈øerve the power that hath carried fire and ≈øword into your land? If you cannot do all the≈øe, then are you only deceiving your≈øelves, and by your delay bringing ruin upon po≈øterity. Your future connection with Britain whom you can neither love nor honour, will be forced and unnatural, and being formed only on the plan of pre≈øent convenience, will in a little time, fall into a relap≈øe more wretched than the fir≈øt. But if you ≈øay, you can ≈øtill pa≈øs the violations over, then I a≈øk, hath your hou≈øe been burnt? Hath your property been de≈øtroyed before your face? Are your

                     <p>This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by tho≈øe feelings and affections which nature ju≈øtifies, and without which, we ≈øhould be incapable of di≈øcharging the ≈øocial duties of life, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the felicities of it.

'Tis not in the power of England or of Europe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer America, if ≈øhe doth not conquer her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf by delay and timidity.

will partake of the misfortune; and there is no puni≈øhment which that man doth not de≈øerve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of ≈øacrificing a ≈øea≈øon ≈øo precious and u≈øeful.</p>
                     <p>'Tis repugnant to rea≈øon, to the univer≈øal order of things; to all examples from former ages, to ≈øuppo≈øe, that this Continent can long remain ≈øubject to any external power. The mo≈øt ≈øanguine in Britain doth not think ≈øo.

                     <p>Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual.

                     <p>As to government matters 'tis not in the power of Britain to do this Continent ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: the bu≈øine≈øs of it will ≈øoon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power ≈øo di≈øtant from us, and ≈øo very ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. To be always running three or four thou≈øand miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an an≈øwer, which when obtained requires five or ≈øix more to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childi≈øhne≈øs‚ÄîThere was a time when it

was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cea≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Small i≈ølands not capable of protecting them≈øelves are the proper objects for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take under their care: but there is ≈øomething very ab≈øurd, in ≈øuppo≈øing a Continent to be perpetually governed by an i≈øland. In no in≈øtance hath nature made the ≈øatellite larger than its primary planet, and as England and America with re≈øpect to each other rever≈øe the common order of nature<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it is evident they belong to different ≈øy≈øtems. England to Europe: America to it≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>I am not induced by motives of pride, party or re≈øentment to e≈øpou≈øe the doctrine of ≈øeparation and independence; I am clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly po≈øitively, and con≈øcientiou≈øly per≈øuaded that 'tis the true intere≈øt of this Continent to be ≈øo; that every thing ≈øhort of that is mere patchwork, that it can afford no la≈øting felicity,‚Äîthat it is leaving the ≈øword to our children, and ≈øhrinking back at a time, when a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this Continent the glory of the earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:014966_0052_0F954F3577D2F460"/>As Britain hath not manife≈øted the lea≈øt inclination towards a compromi≈øe, we may be a≈ø≈øured that no terms can be obtained worthy the acceptance of the Continent, or any ways equal to the expence of blood and trea≈øure we have been already put to.</p>
                     <p>The object contended for, ought always to bear ≈øome ju≈øt proportion to the expence. The removal of North, or the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtable junto, is a matter unworthy the millions we have expended. A temporary ≈øtoppage of trade was an inconvenience, which would have ≈øufficiently ballanced the repeal of all the acts complained off, had ≈øuch repeals been obtained; but if the whole Continent mu≈øt take up arms, if every man mu≈øt be a ≈øoldier, 'tis ≈øcarcely worth our while to fight again≈øt a contemptible mini≈øtry only. Dearly, dearly, do we pay for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in a ju≈øt e≈øtimation, 'tis as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price for law as for land. As I have always con≈øidered the independancy of this Continent, as an event which ≈øooner or later mu≈øt arrive, ≈øo from the late rapid progre≈øs of the Continent to maturity, the event could not be far off. Wherefore on the breaking out of ho≈øtilities, it was not worth
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014966_0053_0F954F3749A4CFA0"/>
the while to have di≈øputed a matter, which time would have finally redre≈ø≈øed, unle≈øs we meant to be in earne≈øt: otherwi≈øe it is like wa≈øting an e≈øtate on a ≈øuit at law, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes of a tenant, who≈øe lea≈øe is ju≈øt expiring. No man was a warmer wi≈øher for reconciliation than my≈øelf, before the fatal 19th of April 1775, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened, ≈øullen tempered Pharoah of England for ever; and di≈ødain the wretch, that with the pretended title of FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE can unfeelingly hear of their ≈ølaughter, and compo≈øedly ≈øleep with their blood upon his ≈øoul.</p>
                     <p>But admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, the ruin of the Continent. And that for ≈øeveral rea≈øons<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                     <p>Fir≈øt. The powers of governing ≈øtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the hands of the King, he will have a negative over the whole legi≈ølation of this Continent: and as he hath ≈øhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ≈øuch an inveterate enemy to liberty, and di≈øcovered ≈øuch a thir≈øt for arbitrary power; is he, or is he not, a proper man to ≈øay to the≈øe Colonies, <hi>You ≈øhall make no laws but
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:014966_0054_0F954F37B72FEA18"/>
what I plea≈øe.</hi> And is there any inhabitant in America ≈øo ignorant, as not to know, that according to what is called the <hi>pre≈øent con≈øtitution,</hi> that this Continent can make no laws but what the king gives leave to; and is there any man ≈øo unwi≈øe, as not to ≈øee, that (con≈øidering what has happened) he will ≈øuffer no laws to be made here, but ≈øuch as ≈øuit his purpo≈øe. We may be as effectually en≈ølaved by the want of laws in America, as by ≈øubmitting to laws made for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called) can there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be exerted to keep this Continent as low and humble as po≈ø≈øible? in≈øtead of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we ≈øhall go backward, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually quarrelling or ridiculou≈øly petion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. ‚ÄîWe are already greater than the King wi≈øhes us to be, and will he not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after endeavour to make us le≈øs. To bring the matter to one point, is the power who is jealous of our pro≈øperity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever ≈øays <hi>no</hi> to this que≈øtion is an <hi>Independant,</hi> for independency means no more than whether we ≈øhall make our own laws, or, whether the King, the greate≈øt enemy this Continent hath, or can

have, ≈øhall tell us, <hi>there ≈øhall be no laws but ≈øuch as I like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the King you'll ≈øay, hath a negative in England; the people there can make no laws without his con≈øent. In point of right and good order, there is ≈øomething very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous that a youth of twenty-one (which hath often happened) ≈øhall ≈øay to ≈øix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people older and wi≈øer than him≈øelf, "I forbid this or that act of yours to be law." But in this place I decline this ≈øort of reply, though I will never cea≈øe to expo≈øe the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurdity of it, and only an≈øwer that England being the King's re≈øidence, and America not ≈øo, makes quite another ca≈øe. The King's negative here is ten times more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal than it can be in England, for there he will ≈øcarcely refu≈øe his con≈øent to a bill for putting England into as ≈øtrong a ≈øtate of defence as po≈ø≈øible, and here he would never ≈øuffer ≈øuch a bill to be pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
                     <p>America is only a ≈øecondary object in the ≈øy≈øtem of Briti≈øh politics. England con≈øults the good of this country, no farther, than it an≈øwers her own purpo≈øe. Wherefore her own intere≈øt leads her to ≈øuppre≈øs the growth of ours in every ca≈øe which doth not promote

her advantage, or in the lea≈øt interferes with it. A pretty ≈øtate we ≈øhould ≈øoon be in, under ≈øuch a ≈øecond hand government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering what has happened! Men do not change from enemies to friends by the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a name: And in order to ≈øhew that reconciliation now is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, <hi>that it would be policy in the King at this time, to repeal the acts for the ≈øake of rein≈øtating him≈øelf in the government of the provinces</hi>; In order that HE MAY ACCOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLISH BY CRAFT AND SUBTILTY, IN THE LONG RUN, WHAT HE CANNOT DO BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE IN THE SHORT ONE. Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi>‚ÄîThat as even the be≈øt terms which we can expect to obtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of goverment by guardian≈øhip, which can la≈øt no longer than till the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies come of age, ≈øo the general face and ≈øtate of things in the interim will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øettled and unpromi≈ø≈øing: Emigrants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty will not choo≈øe to come to a country who≈øe form of goverment hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering on the brink of commotion and di≈øturbance:
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014966_0057_0F954F39F82D8010"/>
And numbers of the pre≈øent inhabitants would lay hold of the interval to di≈øpo≈øe of their effects, and quit the Continent.</p>
                     <p>But the mo≈øt powerful of all arguments is, that nothing but independance i. e. a continental form of government, can keep the peace of the Continent and pre≈øerve it inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by a revolt ≈øome where or other, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain.</p>
                     <p>Thou≈øands are already ruined by Briti≈øh barbarity; (thou≈øands more will probably ≈øuffer the ≈øame fate;) Tho≈øe men have other feelings than us who having nothing ≈øuffered. All they now po≈ø≈øe≈øs is liberty, what they before enjoyed is ≈øacrificed to its ≈øervice, and having nothing more to lo≈øe, they di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. Be≈øides, the general tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Colonies towards a Briti≈øh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be like that of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very little about her: And a government which cannot pre≈øerve the peace, is no government at all, and in that ca≈øe we pay our money
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014966_0058_0F954F3AB74A9250"/>
for nothing; and pray what is it that Britain can do, who≈øe power will be wholly on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ≈øhould a civil tumult break out the very day after reconciliation? I have heard ≈øome men ≈øay, many of whom I believe ≈øpoke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance, fearing that it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce civil wars: It is but ≈øeldom that our fir≈øt thoughts are truly correct, and that is the ca≈øe here; for there are ten times more to dread from a patched up connection, than from independance. I make the ≈øufferers ca≈øe my own, and I prote≈øt, that were I driven from hou≈øe and home, my property de≈øtroyed, and my circum≈øtances ruined, that as a man ≈øen≈øible of injuries, I could never reli≈øh the doctrine of reconciliation, or con≈øider my≈øelf bound thereby.</p>
                     <p>The Colonies hath manife≈øted ≈øuch a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of good order and obedience to continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal government, as is ≈øufficient to make every rea≈øonable per≈øon ea≈øy and happy on that head. No man can a≈ø≈øign the lea≈øt pretence for his fears, on any other grounds, than ≈øuch as are truly childi≈øh and ridiculous, viz. that one colony will be ≈øtriving for ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:014966_0059_0F954F3B783E6060"/>Where there are no di≈øtinctions, there can be no ≈øuperiority; perfect equality affords no temptation. The Republics of Europe are all, (and we may ≈øay always) in peace. Holland and Swi≈ø≈øerland, are without wars, foreign or dome≈øtic: Monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is true, are never long at re≈øt; the crown it≈øelf is a temptation to enterpri≈øing ruffians at home; and that degree of pride and in≈øolence ever attendant on regal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ≈øwells into a rupture with foreign powers in in≈øtances, where a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by being formed on more natural principles, would negociate the mi≈øtake.</p>
                     <p>If there is any true cau≈øe for fear re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing independance, it is becau≈øe no plan is yet laid down.

                     <head>OF THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA, WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS REFLECTIONS.</head>
                     <p>I Have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confe≈ø≈øed his opinion, that a ≈øeparation between the countries, would take place one time or other: And there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, in which we have ≈øhewn le≈øs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; than in endeavouring to de≈øcribe what we call, the ripene≈øs or fitne≈øs of the Continent for independance,</p>
                     <p>As all men allow the mea≈øure, and vary only in their opinion of the time, let us in order to remove mi≈øtakes, take a general ≈øurvey of things, and endeavour if po≈ø≈øible, to find out the <hi>very</hi> time. But I need not go far, the enquiry cea≈øes at once, for, the <hi>time hath found us.</hi> The general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, the glorious union of all things, prove the fact.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not in numbers but in unity that our great ≈øtrength lies: yet our pre≈øent numbers are ≈øufficient to repel the force of all the world. The Continent hath at this time the large≈øt di≈øciplined army of any
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014966_0068_0F954F42F59DE808"/>
power under Heaven: and is ju≈øt arrived at that pitch of ≈øtrength, in which no ≈øingle Colony is able to ≈øupport it≈øelf, and the whole, when united, is able to do any thing. Our land force is more than ≈øufficient, and as to Naval affairs, we cannot be in≈øen≈øible that Britain would never ≈øuffer an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can man of war to be built, while the Continent remained in her hands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ≈øhould be no forwarder an hundred years hence, in that branch than we are now; but the truth is we ≈øhould be le≈øs ≈øo, becau≈øe the timber of the Country is every day dimini≈øhing.</p>
                     <p>Were the Continent crouded with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, her ≈øufferings under the pre≈øent circum≈øtances would be intolerable. The more ≈øea port Towns we had, the more ≈øhould we have both to defend and to lo≈øe. Our pre≈øent numbers are ≈øo happily propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to our wants, that no man need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and the nece≈ø≈øities of an army creates a new trade.</p>
                     <p>Debts we have none: and whatever we may contract on this account will ≈øerve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014966_0069_0F954F43B9153090"/>
but leave po≈øterity with a ≈øettled form of government, an independant con≈øtitution of it's own the purcha≈øe at any price will be cheap. But to expend millions for the ≈øake of getting a few vile acts repealed, and routing the pre≈øent mini≈øtry only, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the charge, and is u≈øing po≈øterity with the utmo≈øt cruelty; becau≈øe it is leaving them the great work to do and a debt upon their backs from which they derive no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Such a thought is unworthy a man of honour, and is the true characteri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of a narrow heart and a pidling politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</p>
                     <p>The debt we may contract doth not de≈øerve our regard if the work be but accompli≈øhed. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national debt is a national bond: and when it bears no intere≈øt is in no ca≈øe a grievance. Britain is oppre≈ø≈øed with a debt of upwards of one hundred and forty millions ≈øterling, for which ≈øhe pays upwards of four millions intere≈øt. And as a compen≈øation for her debt, ≈øhe has a large navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; but for the twentieth part of the Engil≈øh national debt, could have a navy as large again. The navy of England is not worth
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014966_0070_0F954F4477E14470"/>
at this time more than three millions and an half ≈øterling.</p>
                     <p>No country on the globe is ≈øo happily ≈øituated, or ≈øo internally capable of rai≈øing a fleet as America. Tar, timber, iron, and cordage are her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing. Whereas the Dutch, who make large profits by hiring out their ≈øhips of war to the Spaniards and Portugue≈øe, are obliged to import mo≈øt of the materials they u≈øe. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of commerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country. 'Tis the be≈øt money we can lay out. A navy when fini≈øhed is worth more than it co≈øt: And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce and protection are united. Let us build; if we want them not, we can ≈øell; and by that means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place our paper currency with ready gold and ≈øilver.</p>
                     <p>In point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great errors; it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary that one fourth part ≈øhould be ≈øailors. The Terrible Privateer, Capt. Death, ≈øtood the hotte≈øt engagement of any ≈øhip la≈øt war, yet had not twenty ≈øailors on board,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:014966_0071_0F954F45359EDE20"/>
though her complement of men was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two hundred. A few able and ≈øocial ≈øailors will ≈øoon in≈øtruct a ≈øufficient number of active landmen in the common work of a ≈øhip. Wherefore we never can be more capable to begin on maritime mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than now, while our timber is ≈øtanding, our fi≈øheries blocked up, and our ≈øailors and ≈øhipwrights out of employ. Men of war, of ≈øeventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in New England, and why not the ≈øame now? Ship building is Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica's greate≈øt pride, and in which, ≈øhe will in time excel the whole world. The great empires of the ea≈øt are mo≈øtly inland, and con≈øequently excluded from the po≈ø≈øibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a ≈øtate of barbari≈øm; and no power in Europe, hath either ≈øuch an extent of coa≈øt, or ≈øuch an internal ≈øupply of materials. Where nature hath given the one, ≈øhe has with-held the other; to America only hath ≈øhe been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of both. The va≈øt empire of Ru≈ø≈øia is almo≈øt ≈øhut out from the ≈øea; wherefore, her boundle≈øs forre≈øts, her tar, iron, and cordage are only articles of commerce.</p>
                     <p>In point of ≈øafety, ought we to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fleet? We are not the little people
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014966_0072_0F954F45F6F83078"/>
now, which we were ≈øixty years ago, at that time we might have tru≈øted our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the ≈øtreets, or fields rather, and ≈ølept ≈øecurely without locks or bolts to our doors and windows The ca≈øe now is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our methods of defence, ought to improve with our increa≈øe of property. A common pirate, twelve months ago, might have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Philadelphia under in≈øtant Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for what ≈øum he plea≈øed; and the ≈øame might have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow in a brig of 14 or 16 guns might have robbed the whole Continent, and carried off half a million of money. The≈øe are circum≈øtances which demand our attention and point out the nece≈ø≈øity of naval protection.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps will ≈øay, that after we have made it up with Britain that ≈øhe will protect us. Can we be ≈øo unwi≈øe as to mean that ≈øhe ≈øhall keep a navy in our Harbours for that purpo≈øe? Common ≈øen≈øe will tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to ≈øubdue us, is of all others, the mo≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to defend us. Conque≈øt may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected under the pretence of friend≈øhip; and our≈øelves, after a long and brave re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014966_0073_0F954F47C44304C8"/>
be at la≈øt cheated into ≈ølavery. And if her ≈øhips are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would a≈øk, how is ≈øhe to protect us? A navy three or four thou≈øand miles off can be of little u≈øe, and on ≈øudden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore if we mu≈øt hereafter protect our≈øelves, why not do it for our≈øelves? why do it for another?</p>
                     <p>The Engli≈øh li≈øt of ≈øhips of war, is long and formidable, but not a tenth part of them are at any one time fit for ≈øervice, numbers of them not in being; yet their names are pompou≈øly continued in the li≈øt if only a plank is left of the ≈øhip: and not a fifth part of ≈øuch as are fit for ≈øervice, can be ≈øpared on any one ≈øtation at one time. The Ea≈øt and We≈øt Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts over which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her navy. From a mixture of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and innatention, we have contracted a fal≈øe notion re≈øpecting the navy of England, and have talked as if we ≈øhould have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that rea≈øon, ≈øuppo≈øed, that we mu≈øt have one as large; which not being in≈øtantly practicable, have been made u≈øe of by a ≈øet of di≈øgui≈øed tories to di≈øcourage our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014966_0074_0F954F4837B89278"/>
thereon. Nothing can be farther from truth and this, for if America had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, ≈øhe would be by far an over match for her; becau≈øe as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coa≈øt, where we ≈øhould, in the long run, have two to one the advantage of tho≈øe who had three or four thou≈øand miles to ≈øail over, before they could attack us, and the ≈øame di≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to return in order to refit and recruit. And although Britain by her fleet hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the We≈øt Indies, which by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent lies entirely at its mercy.</p>
                     <p>Some method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of peace, if we ≈øhould not judge it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øupport a con≈øtant navy. If premiums were to be given to merchants to build and employ in their ≈øervice, ≈øhips mounted with 20 30, 40, or 50 guns (the premiums to be in proportion to the lo≈øs of bulk to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant) fifty or ≈øixty of tho≈øe ≈øhips, with a few guard ≈øhips on con≈øtant duty would keep up a ≈øufficient navy, and that without bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014966_0075_0F954F48F6969C00"/>
our≈øelves with the evil ≈øo loudly complained of in England, of ≈øuffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in the docks. To unite the ≈øinews of commerce and defence is ≈øound policy; for when our ≈øtrength and our riches, play into each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hand, we need fear no external ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>In almo≈øt every article of defence we abound. Hemp flouri≈øhes even to rankne≈øs, ≈øo that we need not want cordage. Our iron is ≈øuperior to that of other countries. Our ≈ømall arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can ca≈øt at plea≈øure. Salt-petre and gun powder we are every day produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Re≈øolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet for≈øaken us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what is it that we want? why is it that we he≈øitate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin. If ≈øhe is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øies will be always ari≈øing; in≈øurrections will be con≈øtantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? who will venture his life to reduce his own countrymen to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign obedience? the difference between

                     <p>Another rea≈øon why the pre≈øent time is preferable to all others, is, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet unoccupied, which in≈øtead of being lavi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the king on his worthle≈øs depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, may be hereafter applied, not only to the di≈øcharge of the pre≈øent debt, but to the con≈øtant ≈øupport of government.

                     <p>The infant ≈øtate of the Colonies, as it is called, ≈øo far from being again≈øt, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favour of independance. We are ≈øufficiently numerous, and were we more ≈øo, we might be le≈øs united. 'Tis a matter worthy of ob≈øervation, that the more a country is peopled, the ≈ømaller their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are. In military numbers the ancients far exceeded the moderns: and the rea≈øon is evident, for trade being the con≈øequence of population, men become too much absorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby to attend to any thing el≈øe.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014966_0077_0F954F4A777C9AE8"/>
Commerce dimini≈øhes the ≈øpirit both of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioti≈øm and military defence. And hi≈øtory ≈øufficiently informs us that the brave≈øt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements were always accompli≈øhed in the non age of a nation. With the encrea≈øe of commerce England hath lo≈øt its ≈øpirit. The city of London, notwith≈øtanding its numbers, ≈øubmits to continued in≈øults with the patience of a coward. The more men have to lo≈øe, the le≈øs willing are they to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The rich are in general ≈ølaves to fear, and ≈øubmit to courtly power with the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling duplicity of a ≈øpaniel.</p>
                     <p>Youth is the ≈øeed time of good habits as well in nations as in individuals. It might be difficult, if not impo≈ø≈øible to form the Continent into one Government half a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury hence. The va≈øt variety of intere≈øts occa≈øioned by an increa≈øe of trade and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation would create confu≈øion, Colony would be again≈øt Colony. Each being able would ≈øcorn each others a≈ø≈øi≈øtance: and while the proud and fooli≈øh gloried in their little di≈øtinctions, the wi≈øe would lament that the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the pre≈øent time is the true time for e≈øtabli≈øhing it. The intimacy which is contracted in infancy, and the friend≈øhip
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014966_0078_0F954F4B3678C748"/>
which is formed in misfortune, are of all others, the mo≈øt la≈øting and unalterable. Our pre≈øent union is marked with both the≈øe characters: we are young, and we have been di≈øtre≈ø≈øed; but our concord hath with≈øtood our troubles, and fixes a memorable Aera for po≈øterity to glory in.</p>
                     <p>The pre≈øent time likewi≈øe, is that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar time, which never happens to a nation but once, viz. the time of forming it≈øelf into a government. Mo≈øt nations have let ≈ølip the opportunity, and by that means have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors, in≈øtead of making laws for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves. Fir≈øt they had a king, and then a form of government; whereas the articles or charter of government ≈øhould be formed fir≈øt, and men delegated to execute them afterward: but from the errors of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let us learn wi≈ødom, and lay hold of the pre≈øent opportunity‚Äî<hi>To begin government at the right end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When William the Conqueror ≈øubdued England, he gave them law at the point of the ≈øword; and until we con≈øent that the ≈øeat of government in America be legally and authoritatively occupied; we ≈øhall be in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014966_0079_0F954F4BF86DC918"/>
danger of having it filled by ≈øome fortunate ruffian, who may treat us in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and then, where will be our freedom? where our property.</p>
                     <p>As to religion, I hold it to be the indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øible duty of government, to protect all con≈øcientious profe≈ø≈øors thereof, and I know of no other bu≈øine≈øs which government hath to do therewith: let a man throw a≈øide that narrowne≈øs of ≈øoul, that ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs of principle, which the niggards of all profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions are ≈øo unwilling to part with, and he will be delivered of his fears on that head. Su≈øpicion is the companion of mean ≈øouls and the bane of all good ≈øociety. For my≈øelf, I fully and con≈øcientiou≈øly believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there ≈øhould be diver≈øity of religious opinions among us. It affords a larger field for our Chri≈øtian kindne≈øs: were we all of one way of thinking, our religious di≈øpo≈øitions would want matter for probation: and on this liberal principle I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the ≈øame family differing only in what is called their Chri≈øtian names.</p>
                     <p>In page 54 I threw out a few thoughts on the propriety of a Continental charter,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:014966_0080_0F954F4CC404F9F8"/>
(for I only pre≈øume to offer hints, not plans,) and in this place I take the liberty of re-mentioning the ≈øubject, by ob≈øerving, that a charter is to be under≈øtood as a bond of ≈øolemn obligation, which the whole enters into, to ≈øupport the right of every ≈øeparate part, whether of religion, per≈øonal freedom, or property. A right reckoning makes long friends.</p>
                     <p>In a former page, I likewi≈øe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nece≈ø≈øity of a large and equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation; and there is no political mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which more de≈øerves our attention. A ≈ømall number of electors, or a ≈ømall number of repre≈øentatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number of the repre≈øentatives be not only ≈ømall, but unequal, the danger is encrea≈øed. As an in≈øtance of this I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the following; when the petition of the a≈ø≈øociators was before the Hou≈øe of A≈ø≈øembly of Penn≈øylvania, twenty eight members only were pre≈øent. All the Bucks county mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being eight, voted again≈øt it, and had ≈øeven of the Che≈øter members done the ≈øame, this whole Province had been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two counties only, and this danger it is always expo≈øed to. The unwarrantable
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:014966_0081_0F954F4D77630BF0"/>
≈øtretch likewi≈øe, which that hou≈øe made in their la≈øt ≈øitting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that Province, ought to warn the people at large, how they tru≈øt power out of their own hands. A ≈øet of in≈øtructions for the Delegates were put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which in point of ≈øen≈øe and bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs would have di≈øhonoured a ≈øchool-boy, and after being approved by a few, a very few without doors, were carried into the hou≈øe, and there pa≈ø≈øed <hi>in behalf of the whole Colony</hi>: whereas did the whole Colony know, with what ill-will that hou≈øe hath entered on ≈øome nece≈ø≈øary public mea≈øures, they would not he≈øitate a moment to think them unworthy of ≈øuch a tru≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Immediate nece≈ø≈øity makes many things convenient, which if continued would grow into oppre≈ø≈øions. Expedience and right, are different things. When the calamities of America required a con≈øultation, there was no method ≈øo ready, or at that time ≈øo proper, as to appoint per≈øons from the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly for that purpo≈øe; and the wi≈ødom with which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded hath pre≈øerved this Continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable that we ≈øhall never be without a CONGRESS,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014966_0082_0F954F4F43CBDCE0"/>
every well wi≈øher to good order, mu≈øt own, that the mode for choo≈øing members of that body, de≈øerves con≈øideration. And I put it as a que≈øtion to tho≈øe, who make a ≈øtudy of mankind, whether repre≈øentation and election is not too great a power for one and the ≈øame body of men to po≈ø≈øe≈øs? When we are planning for po≈øterity. we ought to remember, that virtue is not hereditary.</p>
                     <p>It is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are frequently ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øed into rea≈øon by their mi≈øtakes. Mr. Cornwall (one of the Lords of the Trea≈øury) treated the petition of the New York A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly with contempt, becau≈øe that hou≈øe he ≈øaid con≈øi≈øted but of twenty ≈øix mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which, trifling number he argued could not with decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his involuntary hone≈øty<note n="*" place="bottom">Tho≈øe who would fully under≈øtand of what great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence a large and equal repre≈øentation is to a State, ≈øhould read Burgh's Political Di≈øqui≈øitions.</note>.</p>
                     <p>TO CONCLUDE, however ≈øtrange it may appear to ≈øome, or however unwilling they may be to think ≈øo, matters not,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014966_0083_0F954F4FB82D4960"/>
but many ≈øtrong and ≈øtriking rea≈øons may be given to ≈øhew, that nothing can ≈øettle our affairs ≈øo expeditiou≈øly as an open and determined declaration for independance. Some of which are,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir≈øt</hi>‚ÄîIt is the cu≈øtom of Nations when any two are at war, for ≈øome other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to ≈øtep in as mediators and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: But while America calls her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf the ≈øubject of Great Britain, no power however well di≈øpo≈øed ≈øhe may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore in our pre≈øent ≈øtate we may quarrel on for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi>‚ÄîIt is unrea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe, that France or Spain will give us any kind of a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, if we mean only to make u≈øe of that a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, for the purpo≈øe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the breach, and ≈øtrengthening the connection between Britain and America; becau≈øe, tho≈øe powers would be ≈øufferers by the con≈øequences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi>‚ÄîWhile we profe≈øs our≈øelves the ≈øubjects of Britain, we mu≈øt in the eye of foreign nations be con≈øidered as Rebels. The precedent is ≈øome-what dangerous to
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:014966_0084_0F954F5076749510"/>
their peace, for men to be in arms under the name of ≈øubjects: we on the ≈øpot can ≈øolve the paradox; but to unite re≈øi≈øtance and ≈øubjection, requires an idea much too refined for common under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi>‚ÄîWere a manife≈øto to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed and di≈øpatched to foreign Counts, ≈øetting forth the mi≈øeries we have endured, and the peaceable methods we have ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually u≈øed for redre≈øs, declaring at the ≈øame time, that not being able any longer to live happily or ≈øafely, under the cruel di≈øpo≈øition of the Briti≈øh Court, we had been driven to the nece≈ø≈øity of breaking off all connections with her; at the ≈øame time, a≈ø≈øuring all ≈øuch Courts, of our peaceable di≈øpo≈øition towards them, and of our de≈øire of entering into trade with them: ≈øuch a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent, than if a ≈øhip were freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with petitions to Britain.</p>
                     <p>Under our pre≈øent denomination of Briti≈øh Subjects, we can neither be received nor heard abroad: the cu≈øtom of all Courts is again≈øt us, and will be ≈øo, until by an independance we take rank with other nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:014966_0085_0F954F5136D260C8"/>The≈øe proceedings may at fir≈øt appear ≈øtrange and difficult, but like all other ≈øteps which we have already pa≈ø≈øed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable: and until an independance is declared, the Continent will feel it≈øelf like a man who continues putting off ≈øome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øant bu≈øine≈øs from day to day, yet knows it mu≈øt be done, hates to ≈øet about it, wi≈øhes it over, and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its nece≈ø≈øity.</p>

                  <p>Dependance of one man, or ≈øtate, upon another is either ab≈øolute, or limited by ≈øome certain terms of agreement. The

dependance of the≈øe colonies which Great Britain calls <hi>con≈øtitutional,</hi> as declared by act of Parliament, is ab≈øolute. If the contrary of this be the bugbear ≈øo many have been declaiming again≈øt, I could wi≈øh my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen would con≈øider the con≈øequence of ≈øo ≈øtupid a profe≈ø≈øion. If a limited depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is intended, I would be much obliged to any one who will ≈øhew me the <hi>Britanno-American Magna Charta</hi> wherein the terms of our limited dependance are preci≈øely ≈øtated. If no ≈øuch thing can be found, and <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> dependance be accounted inadm≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ≈øound we are ≈øquabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If any ≈øay we mean that kind of dependance we acknowledged at and before the year 1763; I an≈øwer, <hi>vague and uncertain laws, and more e≈øpecially</hi> CONSTITUTIONS, are the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments of ≈ølavery. The Magna Charta of England was very explicit, con≈øidering the time it was formed, and yet much blood was ≈øpilt in di≈øputes concerning its meaning.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides the danger of an indefinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon an undetermined power, it might be worth while to con≈øider what the characters are on whom we are ≈øo ready to acknowledge our≈øelves dependant. The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries

bloody war, if we declare independance. On the contrary, I affirm it the only ≈øtep that can bring the conte≈øt to a ≈øpeedy and happy i≈ø≈øue. By declaring independance we place our≈øelves on a footing for an equal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation: Now we are called a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Indians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and the ≈øovereign fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, re≈øpecting freedom and property, <hi>to be at the King's will.</hi> Grant Almighty God that I may be numbered with the dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ≈øable day dawn on North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica!</p>
                  <p>All Europe knows the illegal and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man treatment we have received from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.

≈øtate has a right to interfere in the di≈øpute? But on the other hand, on our declaration of independance, the maritime ≈øtates at lea≈øt will find it their intere≈øt, which always ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the que≈øtion of inclination, to protect a people who can be ≈øo advantageous to them. So that tho≈øe ≈øhort-≈øighted politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who conclude that this ≈øtep will involve us in ≈ølaughter and deva≈øtation, may plainly perceive that no mea≈øure in our power will ≈øo naturally and effectually work our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The motion of a finger of the Grand Monarch would procure as gentle a temper in the Omnipotent Briti≈øh Mini≈øter as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Manilla ran≈øom and Falkland i≈ølands affairs. From without certainly we have every thing to hope, nothing to fear; from within, ≈øome tell us the Pre≈øbyterians, if freed from the re≈øtraining power of Great-Britain, would over-run the peaceable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in this government. For my own part, I de≈øpi≈øe and dete≈øt the bickerings of ≈øecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and am apprehen≈øive of no trouble from that quarter, e≈øpecially while no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar honors nor emoluments are annexed to either.

                  <p>Finally, with M.

                  <p>I readily grant that the delegates of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernmental power are too apt to con≈øider them≈øelves the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors of it <hi>in their own right,</hi> and that they therefore take every means in their power to become the <hi>ma≈øters</hi> in place of <hi>≈øervants</hi> to their <hi>con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>; and that the people in all civilized countries have been too inattentive to the u≈øurpations of their rulers: But I conceive of no cau≈øe in the nature of things which ≈øo ab≈øolutely counteracts the power of a wi≈øe, learned, and free community as to render it impo≈ø≈øible for them to pre≈øerve their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The arguments brought from the condition of other ≈øtates, are by no means conclu≈øive with re≈øpect to the North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies.

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:014966_0099_0F954E800E470780"/>
cultivation of the earth for the ≈øub≈øi≈øtance of its proprietor.</hi> Here was no feudal tenure from ≈øome military Lord; every cultivator being the lord of his own ≈øoil, and content with its produce, had no thoughts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon and ≈øubjecting his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to his ab≈øolute dominion. Hence a hand≈øome competency has enabled the bulk of the people to give their children ≈øuch education as enables them to read, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with the u≈øurpations of the deepe≈øt plotters of their ruin. The ≈øpirit of the people for obtaining this nece≈ø≈øary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is evident from the incredible number of news-papers and other periodical publications which they encourage, and the effect of ≈øuch in≈øtitutions never have been ≈øo great in any community, yet known, as in the≈øe <hi>pantaplebean (altogether</hi> Commons) colonies. How quickly the mo≈øt important revolution of the fundamentals of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy can pervade a continent, may be gue≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the progre≈øs of the idea of Coloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Independancy in three weeks or a month at farthe≈øt!

                  <head>A Review of the American Conte≈øt, with ≈øome <hi>STRICTURES ON</hi> the <hi>KING's</hi> ≈øpeech, and its con≈øequences. <hi>ADDRESSED</hi> to all <hi>PARENTS</hi> in the <hi>THIRTEEN UNITED COLONIES.</hi> By a Friend to Po≈øterity and Mankind.</head>
                  <p>NATURE in≈øtructs the brute creation to provide for, guard and protect their offspring until they are able to do for them≈øelves. The dam is never known to for≈øake her young while her care is nece≈ø≈øary for their ≈øafety, nor to do any thing which would involve them in di≈øtre≈øs and difficulty. Man, who has this principle in common with brutes, is endowed with others yet more valuable, but which to him are ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, whereby he is taught to provide for the future welfare of his de≈øcendants and to guard them from the encroachments of that power which civil ≈øociety con≈øtitutes for its own ≈øafety; but which, through the depravity of human nature is often turned again≈øt it. There are few parents who do not make it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant ≈øtudy and earne≈øt endeavour to leave ≈øome valuable inheritance to their children:

few who have been ≈øo lo≈øt to the feelings of nature and calls of parental affection, as to entail difficulty and di≈øtre≈øs on their children, when it was in their power to leave them a a fair and ea≈øy inheritance. And yet it has ≈øo happened, that by an ill timed attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the pre≈øent, without paying proper attention to the future, they have entailed mi≈øery upon them by the very means which were de≈øigned to pre≈øerve them from it.</p>
                  <p>It is now in your power to bequeath to your children the one or the other, and it becomes you to have an eye to them in all your proceedings. It is ≈øufficiently known to you, that riches in arbitrary ≈øtates are often the ruin of their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors, and that ≈øecurity to property is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øtamp their true value on wealth and po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øions. He therefore, who wi≈øhes to leave his children in flouri≈øhing circum≈øtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ought to be a zealous friend to tho≈øe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, and that plan of government which gives the greate≈øt ≈øecurity to property, and an active warm opppo≈øer of tho≈øe which leave it to the arbitrary di≈øpo≈øal of men, who find a greater advantage in making free with what does not belong to them, than in frugally u≈øing what is ju≈øtly their

own. Whig and Tory ≈øhould be out of the que≈øtion. Private pique, party faction and animo≈øity ought to ≈øub≈øide. He who thinks ≈øhould think for po≈øterity, and he who acts ≈øhould act for his children.</p>
                  <p>It is a great weakne≈øs to ≈øuffer our pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions to take place of our rea≈øon and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow their dictates, though to our manife≈øt hurt, rather than ≈øubject them to our better ≈øen≈øe. A fal≈øe pride, which will not acknowledge an error though ever ≈øo evident, an ob≈øtinate per≈øeverance in our own opinion without deigning to hear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or in≈øtruction, and an unrea≈øonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to party, have done much mi≈øchief to mankind, and may yet do more if not carefully avoided. I have directed this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to you in preference to others, becau≈øe your parental affection ≈øhould form more than a counterpoi≈øe to every fal≈øe principle, which can influence the human mind where the intere≈øt of your offspring is at ≈øtake.</p>
                  <p>Our pre≈øent conte≈øt is immen≈øely great, and every man mu≈øt ≈øee that it will affect po≈øterity. Its con≈øequences cannot end with it≈øelf; but the late≈øt generations mu≈øt feel its effects. The great Ruler of the univer≈øe

has permitted it for wi≈øe purpo≈øes, and has called every one of us to act our part in it. It becomes us, therefore, laying a≈øide all former prejudices, partiality and party at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, to act upon principles which will ju≈øtify us to him who has a≈ø≈øigned us our ≈øtations, and cau≈øe po≈øterity to ble≈øs the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their forefathers. We all agree in this, that Great-Britain is unju≈øt and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and we have hitherto principally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the mode of oppo≈øition, which ought to have been pur≈øued. I ≈øpeak not to tho≈øe who think one way and talk another. They act upon ≈øuch ba≈øe principles, that it is in vain to attempt to rouze in them any ju≈øt or generous ≈øentiments. We have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the conver≈øion of avaricious or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious hypocrites, and it would be wa≈øting time to u≈øe arguments to convince them, I direct my≈øelf to you who have ≈øincerity ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to examine the principles on which you proceed, and hone≈øty enough to pur≈øue that cour≈øe of conduct which appears to be right, and ≈øo much affection for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as to prefer their intere≈øt and happine≈øs to every other con≈øideration. For you I mean to throw together a few hints which may a≈ø≈øi≈øt you in finally fixing a right choice.</p>

                     <pb n="99" facs="unknown:014966_0107_0F954E85F89A95D8"/>The Briti≈øh admini≈øtration began its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks on our liberties with a Stamp act, but meeting with ≈øtrong oppo≈øition they thought fit to repeal it. This act threw the colonies into ≈øtrong convul≈øions, and we rejoiced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly on its repeal, and fondly hoped that we would enjoy future tranquillity. But we were mi≈øtaken. They never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relinqui≈øh the de≈øign, but only to change their ground, that which they fir≈øt pitched upon not ≈øeeming tenable. An Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican revenue granted by a Briti≈øh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the object, and they never lo≈øt ≈øight of it; for they ≈øoon renewed their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks upon principles which they thought more favourable to their intentions; but meeting with as little ≈øucce≈øs in that, as in the preceding attempt, they ≈øu≈øpended their mea≈øures for a time, in hopes of lulling us into a carele≈øs ≈øecurity. They accordingly once more returned to the charge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to effect by cunning and artifice what they had heretofore attempted in vain on every other peaceable plan. This not ≈øuccceding, they were reduced to their la≈øt ≈øhift of bullying and force; and this they re≈øolved upon. They levied armies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Generals of reputation to command, and ≈øent them among≈øt us, we may know
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:014966_0108_0F954E8EB8853D00"/>
their commi≈ø≈øion by their conduct; for after abu≈øing, brow-beating and in≈øulting, after ≈øtarving and tarring and feathering, after of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering every po≈ø≈øible injury which a free people could bear, without obtaining their ends, and every other mea≈øure failing, they drew the ≈øword, and at once reduced us to the dire alternative of ≈øubmitting to their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal claims of juri≈ødiction, or entering into the bloody conte≈øt. Like men determined to be free we cho≈øe the latter. It now re≈øts on the la≈øt argument, an argument which finally ≈øettles all controver≈øies of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The plan of operation is now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they who ≈øtand to it with the mo≈øt ≈øteady per≈øeverance mu≈øt finally ≈øucceed. This is the decree of Providence in all ca≈øes,
<q>he that per≈øevereth unto the end ≈øhall be ≈øaved.</q>
We have, by the ble≈ø≈øing of God, effectually baffled all their former attempts; but if we fail in this, all our former victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will only ≈øerve to make our fall the more con≈øpicuous and terrible.</p>
                  <p>I will not enquire what would have been the efficacy of any heretofore recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but untried means. The wor≈øt that can has happened, and it is with it we have now to deal; to relinqui≈øh it on our part,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:014966_0109_0F954E86B8DD82A8"/>
would be to give up the matter, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any means might once have done, cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice alone would now de≈øert the field, and ≈ølavery mu≈øt be the inevitable con≈øequence.</p>
                  <p>I do not wonder that war ≈øits heavy on us<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that we are ≈øomewhat re≈øtle≈øs and unea≈øy; but I ≈øhall be ≈øurprized, if we, who have ≈øo long and ≈øo ≈øucce≈øsfully oppo≈øed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppre≈ø≈øion ≈øhould all on a ≈øudden lo≈øe every de≈øire of retaining our liberties. I am forced into this remark by the artful, cunning and de≈øigning manner in which ≈øome men talk of a reconciliation with Great Britain, and the bug-bears they conjure up to frighten the timid, irre≈øolute and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, from a ≈øteady pro≈øecution of tho≈øe means, which alone can help us in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent circum≈øtances. Facts bear evidence from the beginning of the conte≈øt that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øcheme they ever recommended has, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial, proved inadequate to the end for which it was intended; yet they proceed. Beware of ≈øuch men, they love neither their country, nor their liberties, ≈øo much as ≈øomething el≈øe.</p>
                  <p>There are many I doubt not who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Tories by the more zealous

Whigs, who in their hearts wi≈øh ≈øucce≈øs to our mea≈øures, tho' they may be chagrined becau≈øe tho≈øe they propo≈øed did not go down with the people; the≈øe are uniform, open, and not very dangerous; but there are others, who under the cloke of friend≈øhip for the cau≈øe, harbour the bittere≈øt rancour and malice in their hearts. The≈øe talk fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably in general, though their di≈øcour≈øes mo≈øtly terminate with a <hi>doubt, ≈øu≈øpicion,</hi> or <hi>but,</hi> which gives tho≈øe with whom they conver≈øe, rea≈øon to dread ≈øome hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign, or approaching evil, which mo≈øt men have not properly attended to. They art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recal your attention to a certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, when all was peace and quietne≈øs, and by pathetically lamenting the unhappy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, endeavour to impre≈øs your minds with an opinion that all our troubles aro≈øe from our≈øelves. They carefully avoid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the iniquitous mea≈øures of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh government which produced them, and by keeping tho≈øe out of ≈øight, they gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead the unwary into the belief, that the men who have been mo≈øt active on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent occa≈øion in oppo≈øing the tyrannical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Great-Britain, and who have hazarded their all in defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have been actuated by ≈øini≈øter motives

in all they have done. If every man who hears ≈øuch in≈øinuations were to a≈øk tho≈øe who ca≈øt them out, what mea≈øures have not the men they condemn tried at one time or another to avoid the pre≈øent conte≈øt, and ≈øave our liberties? What advantages they can reap by a ≈øucce≈øsful end of it, which every other freeman on the continent will not reap equally with them? And in an un≈øucce≈øsful clo≈øe of it, all will allow they mu≈øt be the greate≈øt ≈øufferers. Their lives mu≈øt go, let who will el≈øe e≈øcape. The≈øe que≈øtions might recal them to facts, and the≈øe facts would enable men to judge aright.</p>
                  <p>Hone≈øty could not ≈øtand the force of a few pertinent que≈øtions, but the≈øe men have taken their leave of it, and like Mana≈ø≈øeh of old, have ≈øold them≈øelves to do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Were it not ≈øo, could it be po≈ø≈øible for them in the face of the ≈øun, to charge all our troubles on the New-England Pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, troubles which originally began and have all along been kept up by a wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration and a venal parliament. To make them the hatchers of mi≈øchiefs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned by uncon≈øtitutional acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the only fomenters of our ju≈øt

oppo≈øition, which a Penn≈øylvanian Quaker, a Maryland and a Virginian Churchman did more to effect than all the other men on the continent put together, is cruelty in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. My heart bleeds when I think of ≈øuch men; who would ≈øell the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and all the blood on it for private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and with whom a few thou≈øand guineas with a title would be e≈øteemed an equivalent for the lives, liberty and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the freemen of a colony. May that God who ≈øees how little they can gain, if ≈øucce≈øsful, open their eyes and turn their hearts, e'er they be convinced by fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that he who purcha≈øes the whole world at the price of his ≈øoul, is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe dealer, and makes but a poor bargain in the end. If the calls of virtue, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of religion, and dictates of patrioti≈øm cannot awaken them to a ≈øen≈øe of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet Norfolk might open their eyes. But let them do as they plea≈øe, we ought to act wi≈øely. If we do not make ≈øuch a ≈øettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now as will ≈øecure the privileges we contend for to po≈øterity, we entail either ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or a civil war on our children. This is certain, let what will be doubtful. Look round you then, view your offspring, and tell me, are you willing to leave them ≈øuch

a legacy? Do not trifle on this occa≈øion, all your other legacies mu≈øt derive their true value from the part you now take in this conte≈øt. Think not that the God who charges him with wor≈øe than infidelity who provides not for his own, and tho≈øe of his hou≈øhold, will ju≈øtify you in returning to the ≈øtate you were in when our troubles began, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by delivering over your offspring to the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous machinations of a power that from the beginning has ≈øet right, ju≈øtice, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at defiance, and in all her deliberations con≈øidered nothing but her ability to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
                  <p>Look to the year 1763, that happy peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, as many ≈øo fondly call it, and ≈øee what ≈øafety there is to America in ≈øuch a ≈øituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lord North has ≈øaid,
<q>If that is all they want, we are agreed;</q>
and the ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plea≈øes many of you.

Were he or his ma≈øter ≈øen≈øible of the inju≈øtice of their proceedings and the wrongs they have done us, they would both ≈øpeak a very different language. Why does he call you rebel?

Have you con≈øcience my Lord? If you have, I would not for the empire of a thou≈øand worlds, be Lord Dartmouth? But, my Lord, it is not to awaken your con≈øcience <hi>only</hi> that I write you this letter: the flame of civil war, by your management, hath extended far and wide in America; battles have been fought, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have been ≈ølain, and pri≈øoners taken on both ≈øides; the Americans have in their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion ten for one, and among them many men of rank, Pre≈øcot, Pre≈øton, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and others; they are all treated with tenderne≈øs and regard, while the pri≈øoners you have taken are treated with ≈øeverity, carried to England in irons, there, as it is ≈øaid, to be tried, and of cour≈øe condemned

                  <p>I CANNOT recal an idea to my mind more amazingly ab≈øurd and ≈øtupid than the idea of Lord North's ≈øecond attempt to gull the Coloni≈øts into a belief of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to hold out to them terms of a ≈øafe and amicable reconciliation, with Great Britain. No one is ignorant that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have offered every thing that can po≈ø≈øibly be devi≈øed to bury the injurious and en≈ølaving claim of admini≈øtration, in perpetual oblivion, and leave matters on the ≈øame footing they were before the pretence was held up. Tho≈øe generous propo≈øals, however often repeated, have as often been rejected with an in≈øolent contempt, and yet the profound politician tells his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents in the Briti≈øh Hou≈øe of Commons, that he is heartily inclined to a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Colonies, and willing to put them in the ≈øituation they ≈øo pa≈ø≈øionately de≈øire; that is, ≈øays he, to a courtier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding explanation, <hi>in a ≈øtate of ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependance on the Briti≈øh parliament in all ca≈øes what≈øoever</hi>; for, ≈øays his Lord≈øhip, they were unque≈øtionably thus dependant

in 1763, had his Lord≈øhip entirely forgot the ≈øucce≈øs of his former experiment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a trial of the ≈øame wretched <hi>trick</hi> over again, might have appeared le≈øs ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, I may indeed ≈øay, le≈øs in≈øulting to the lowe≈øt under≈øtanding. I would a≈øk the mo≈øt credulous votary for making up the di≈øpute, what po≈ø≈øible grounds they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to found their expectation of a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent reconciliation upon? Has any thing lately turned up, which has indicated a change of di≈øpo≈øition in the Prince or his favorites? Can a majority, which have been ≈øecured from one ≈øeven years to another, by pure force of corruption, be depended on to remain firm to a ≈ølaughtering, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and de≈øolating court, and ≈øhare the dete≈øtation of pre≈øent and future ages, for mere nothing? Has the court re≈øolved to ca≈øt Bernard, Hutchin≈øon and daughter, Richard≈øon the murderer, crazy John Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm, and Richard≈øon the recent volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, out on the common? I tell you, nay! You have a fre≈øh in≈øtance of the firmne≈øs of the cabinet, in adding another three thou≈øand pound pen≈øioner to the li≈øt, in a conjuncture, when all mankind will confe≈øs there is need of ≈øaving.

of the dominions! If Great Britain and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have conceived ≈øuch a mortal hatred to America, that they can hug her mo≈øt inveterate enemies in their bo≈øoms, and vote them ≈øuch munificent rewards for drawing her into ≈øo de≈øtructive a civil war, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øafe in the power of ≈øuch enemies. If they abound in re≈øources as largely as Mr. Wedderburne and others boa≈øt they do, let them cea≈øe complaining of their poverty, and contentedly di≈øcharge their own national debt, rather than go on aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting it by their efforts to ≈øaddle it, with an unlimited pen≈øion li≈øt on America. Does the nation bear the weight of the pre≈øent unnatural quarrel with America on other terms, than a firm a≈ø≈øurance of the Court, that millions of leading men's dependants ≈øhall be provided for in America, for whom places can by no means be found at home. Is not the very genius of the people of Great Britain and Ireland corrupted, in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the views of young fellows of education, or any connection with men of note, are altogether ≈øet on public money? Can our peaceable men indulge a gleam of hope, that this humour will alter, or that youths, bred in idlene≈øs and di≈ø≈øipation, will become indu≈øtrious and di≈øintere≈øted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots

If not, they mu≈øt then be ≈øo weak as to conceit, that mini≈øters will become le≈øs fond of fingering the public money, and ≈øecuring them≈øelves in places of power and profit by means of it; indeed, that they will become more hone≈øt and ≈øaving of the national money than tho≈øe the con≈øtitution has appointed as a check upon them. It is no wonder they tell of ≈øending a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleet and army to bring over their terms of reconciliation, when they are in no one article different from the terms they fir≈øt aimed to impo≈øe. Had the mini≈øter, or more properly the ob≈øtinate author of all our troubles, had the remote≈øt idea of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring us with a government of laws, which had any re≈øpect to the ≈øecurity of our lives and properties, he had long ≈øince granted with a good grace, petitions, made and repeated with the mo≈øt dutiful per≈øever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection, which a≈øked for nothing more! <hi>Sed aut Cae≈øar aut nullus,</hi> ≈øeems the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able determination of the man, who ≈øoothed our already elated expectations, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augural declaration, that he <hi>gloried</hi> in the name of Briton, at that time, a di≈øtinctive characteri≈øtic of the patrons of univer≈øal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

It is evident they have concluded on two things, viz. to make a bold pu≈øh for our entire ≈øubjection, as their ends would be thereby more readily an≈øwered; but that being found impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, we are to be tried with negociation, in which all the craft, duplicity and punic faith of admini≈øtration is to be expected. Pray God it may be wi≈øely and firmly guarded again≈øt!

melancholy lengths we find them. However, in the great and general plan of him who putteth down and ≈øetteth up ≈øtates, this is doubtle≈øs an indi≈øpen≈øable part, and therefore not to be complained of; but it has amazed me to contemplate the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in≈øtances of di≈øappointment our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have met with, in every plot they have laid for our de≈øtruction. How did Bernard and Hutchin≈øon flatter them≈øelves with the number of friends they had in ≈øeveral towns of the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts, and thought that a very trifling force, from the other ≈øide of the water, added to their minions, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and expectants, would cru≈øh a little tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent faction, who di≈øturbed their darling mea≈øures? Certainly men intoxicated with a lu≈øt of ab≈øolute power found ≈øomething in the appearance of things to tole them on to an object ≈øo grateful to their fonde≈øt wi≈øhes; other wi≈øe they would have been contented to augment and confirm their power by ≈øuch unperceived degrees that the <hi>happy days,</hi> many tell us we have enjoyed under a continually invading u≈øurpation, would not yet have been ≈øo ≈øen≈øibly interrupted. No le≈øs has the ≈øo often extolled Governor Tryon been di≈øappointed in his benevolent intentions re≈øpecting New-York. His band
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:014966_0127_0F954EAD05A93BE8"/>
on Long I≈øland, and on the ea≈øt ≈øide of Hud≈øon's river, with Sir John John≈øon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his va≈ø≈øals, and the Indians, gave him great hopes of having matters in a fine train before the invincible armada arrived in the ≈øpring; in≈øtead of which, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the active General Lee will ≈øo fortify that place, that all the force they can ≈øend again≈øt it, will be in≈øufficient to reduce it. Dunmore, with all his wanton ravage, has done little more than exa≈øperate the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, and convinced that brave Colony, that they can be formidable to ≈øavages on the ea≈øt, as well as we≈øt ≈øide of their dominion. Carleton's Canadians, make no ≈øuch figure in the harangues of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioner, as they did la≈øt year; and in ca≈øe foreigners are to be procured to be poured in upon us, the greate≈øt oppo≈øers of our total ≈øeparation from Britain acknowledge, they would then no longer defer a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of independancy, and application to other powers for their protection. To this the whole ≈øcene appears rapidly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, in my view, as ha≈øtily as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wi≈ødom thinks proper to conduct it; and if this be his mo≈øt gracious de≈øign, he will work, and none ≈øhall hinder. Amen, Beneficent Jehovah! Amen. <hi>Sic ≈øperat.</hi>

                  <head>APPENDIX TO COMMON SENSE. The nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>INDEPENDANCY.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SINCE the publication of the fir≈øt edition of this pamphlet, or rather on the ≈øame day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city. Had the ≈øpirit of prophecy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a more ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable juncture, or a more nece≈ø≈øary time. The bloody mindedne≈øs of the one, ≈øhew the nece≈ø≈øity of pur≈øuing the doctrine of the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, in≈øtead of terrifying, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a way for the manly principles of Independance.</p>
                  <p>Ceremony, and even ≈øilence, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever motive they may ari≈øe, have a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tendency, when they give the lea≈øt degree of countenance to ba≈øe and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:014966_0130_0F954EAF429BC538"/>
be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of fini≈øhed villainy, de≈øerved, and ≈øtill de≈øerves, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral execration, both by the Congre≈øs and the people. Yet, as the dome≈øtic tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of a nation, depends greatly on the <hi>cha≈øtity</hi> of what may properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to pa≈øs ≈øome things over in ≈øilent di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, than to make u≈øe of ≈øuch new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of di≈ølike, as might introduce the lea≈øt innovation, on that guardian of our peace and ≈øafety. And, perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech hath not, before now, ≈øuffered a public execution. The Speech, if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel again≈øt the truth, the common good, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to the pride of tyrants. But this general ma≈ø≈øacre of mankind, is one of the privileges, and the certain con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of King's; for as nature knows them <hi>not,</hi> they know <hi>not her,</hi> and although they are beings of our <hi>own</hi> creating, they know not <hi>us,</hi> and are become the Gods of their creators. The ≈øpeech hath one good
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:014966_0131_0F954EB109BBED98"/>
quality, which is, that it is not calculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived by it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us at no lo≈øs: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading, that he, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is le≈øs a Savage than the King of Britain.</p>
                  <p>Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining je≈øuitical piece, fallaciou≈øly called, "<hi>The addre≈øs of the people of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>to the Inhabitants of</hi> America," hath, perhaps, from a vain ≈øuppo≈øition, that the people <hi>here</hi> were to be frightened at the pomp and de≈øcription of a king, giving, (though very unwi≈øely on his part) the real character of the pre≈øent one: "But," ≈øays this writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an admini≈øtration which we do not complain of, (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp Act,) it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince <hi>by who≈øe</hi> NOD ALONE, <hi>they were permitted to do any thing.</hi>" This is toryi≈øm with a witne≈øs! Here is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry even without a ma≈øk: And he who can calmly hear and dige≈øt ≈øuch doctrine,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:014966_0132_0F954EB17877A0A0"/>
hath forfeited his claim to rationality‚Äî an apo≈øtate from the order of manhood, and ought to be con≈øidered‚Äîas one, who hath not only given up the proper dignity of man, but ≈øunk him≈øelf beneath the rank of animals, and contemptibly crawl through the world like a worm.</p>
                  <p>However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either ≈øays or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and human obligation, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nature and con≈øcience beneath his feet; and by a ≈øteady and con≈øtitutional ≈øpirit of in≈øolence and cruelty, procured for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf an univer≈øal hatred. It is <hi>now</hi> the intere≈øt of America to provide for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. She hath already a large and young family, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting away her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to ≈øupport a power, who is become a reproach to the names of men and chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. ‚ÄîYE, who≈øe office it is to watch over the morals of a nation, of what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ≈øect or denomination ye are of, as well as ye, who, are more immediately the guardians of the public liberty, if ye wi≈øh to pre≈øerve your native country uncontami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by European corruption, ye mu≈øt in ≈øecret wi≈øh a ≈øeparation.‚ÄîBut leaving
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:014966_0133_0F954EB23A020960"/>
the moral part to private reflection, I ≈øhall chiefly confine my farther remarks to the following heads:</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, That it is the intere≈øt of America, to be ≈øeparated from Britain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Which is the ea≈øie≈øt and mo≈øt practicable plan, RECONCILIATION or IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDANCE? with ≈øome occa≈øional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
                  <p>In ≈øupport of the fir≈øt, I could, If I judged it proper, produce the opinion of ≈øome of the able≈øt and mo≈øt experienced men on this continent; and who≈øe ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on that head, are not yet publicly known. It is in reality a ≈øelf evident po≈øition: For no nation, in a ≈øtate of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped and fettered in its legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølative powers, can ever arrive at any material eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the progre≈øs which ≈øhe hath made, ≈øtands unparalleled in the hi≈øtory of other nations, it is but childhood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with what ≈øhe would be capable of arriving at, had ≈øhe, as ≈øhe ought to have, the legi≈ølative powers in her own hands.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:014966_0134_0F954EB2F7B30498"/>
England, is at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were ≈øhe to accompli≈øh it; and the continent he≈øitating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected. It is the commerce, and not the conque≈øt of America, by which Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is to be benefited, and that would in a great mea≈øure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; becau≈øe in many articles, neither can go to a better market. But it is the independance of this country on Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths di≈øcovered by nece≈ø≈øity, will appear clear and ≈øtronger every day.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt. Becau≈øe it will come to that one time or other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe the longer it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, the harder it will be to accompli≈øh.</p>
                  <p>I have frequently amu≈øed my≈øelf both in public and private companies, with ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently remarking the ≈øpecious errors of tho≈øe who ≈øpeak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

≈øeems the mo≈øt general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, in≈øtead of now, the continent would have been more able to have ≈øhaken off the dependance. To which I reply, that our military ability <hi>at this time,</hi> ari≈øes from the experience gained in the la≈øt war, and which in forty or fifty years time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent would not, by that time, have had a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or even a military officer left; and we, or tho≈øe who may ≈øucceed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this ≈øingle po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, clo≈øely attended to, will unan≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prove, that the pre≈øent time is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all others: The argument turns thus: At the conclu≈øion of the la≈øt war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we ≈øhould have num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, mu≈øt be ≈øome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point between the two extremes, in which a ≈øufficiency of the former remains, and a proper encrea≈øe of the latter is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And that point of time is the pre≈øent time.</p>

head I fir≈øt ≈øet out with, and to which I again return by the following po≈øition, viz.</p>
                  <p>Should affairs be patched up with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ≈øhe to remain the governing and ≈øovereign power of America, (which as matters are now circum≈øtanced, is giving up the point entirely) we ≈øhall deprive our≈øelves of the very means of ≈øinking the debt we have, or may contract. The value of the back lands, which ≈øome of the provinces are clande≈øtinely deprived of, by the unju≈øt exten≈øion of the limits of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, valued only at five pounds ≈øterling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five millions, Penn≈øylvania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny ≈øterling per acre, to two millions yearly.</p>
                  <p>It is by the ≈øale of tho≈øe lands, that the debt may be ≈øunk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent re≈øerved thereon, will always le≈ø≈øen, and in time will wholly ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the yearly expence of government. It matters not how long the debt is in paying, ≈øo that the lands when ≈øold, be applied to the di≈øcharge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congre≈øs for the time being, will be the continental tru≈øtees.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:014966_0137_0F954EB539701DE8"/>I proceed now to the ≈øecond head, viz. Which is the ea≈øie≈øt and mo≈øt practicable plan, Reconciliation or Independance; with ≈øome occa≈øional remarks.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The pre≈øent ≈øtate of America is truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming to every man who is capable of reflection. Without law, without govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courte≈øy. Held together by an unexampled concurrence of ≈øentiment, which, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs ≈øubject to change, and which, every ≈øecret enemy is endeavouring to di≈ø≈øolve. Our pre≈øent condition, is, Legi≈ølation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law, wi≈ødom without a plan, a con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution without a name, and, what is ≈øtrangely a≈øtoni≈øhing, perfect independance contending for dependance. The in≈øtance
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:014966_0138_0F954EB5F8565148"/>
is without a precedent; the ca≈øe never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property of no man is ≈øecure in the pre≈øent unbraced ≈øy≈øtem of things. The mind of the multitude is left at random, and ≈øeeing no fixed object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they pur≈øue ≈øuch as fancy or opinion ≈øtarts. Nothing is criminal; there is no ≈øuch thing as trea≈øon; wherefore, every one thinks him≈øelf at liberty to act as he plea≈øes. The Tories would not have da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a≈ø≈øemble offen≈øively, had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the ≈øtate. A line of di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øhould be drawn, between Engli≈øh ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taken in battle, and inhabitants of America taken in arms. The fir≈øt are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, but the latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his head.</p>
                  <p>Notwith≈øtanding our wi≈ødom, there is a vi≈øible feeblene≈øs in ≈øome of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which gives encouragement to di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Continental Belt is too loo≈øely buckled: And if ≈øomething is not done in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we ≈øhall fall into a ≈øtate, in which, neither Reconciliation nor Independance will be practicable.

adherents are got at the old game of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Continent, and there are not wanting among us, Printers, who will be bu≈øy in ≈øpreading ≈øpecious fal≈øehoods. The artful and hypocritical letter, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a few months ago, in two of the New-York papers, and likewi≈øe in two others, is an evidence, that there are men who want either judgment or hone≈øty.</p>
                  <p>It is ea≈øy getting into holes and corners, and talking of reconciliation: But do ≈øuch men ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider, how difficult the ta≈øk is, and how dangerous it may prove, ≈øhould the Continent divide thereon. Do they take within their view, all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious orders of men, who≈øe ≈øituation and circum≈øtances, as well as their own, are to be con≈øidered therein. Do they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in the place of the ≈øufferer, who≈øe <hi>all</hi> is <hi>already</hi> gone, and of the ≈øoldier, who hath quitted <hi>all</hi> for the defence of his country.

                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:014966_0140_0F954EB776134AD0"/>Put us, ≈øay ≈øome, upon the footing we were on in ≈øixty-three: To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, the reque≈øt is not now in the power of Britain to comply with, neither will ≈øhe propo≈øe it, but if it were, and even ≈øhould be granted, I a≈øk, as a rea≈øonable que≈øtion, By what means is ≈øuch a corrupt and faithle≈øs court to be kept to its engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Another parliament, nay, even the pre≈øent, may hereafter repeal the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the pretence of its being violently obtained, or unwi≈øely granted; and in that ca≈øe, Where is our redre≈øs?‚ÄîNo going to law with nations; cannon are the barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of crowns; and the ≈øword, not of ju≈øtice, but of war, decides the ≈øuit. To be on the footing of ≈øixty three, it is not ≈øufficient, that the laws only be put on the ≈øame ≈øtate, but that our circum≈øtances, likewi≈øe be put on the ≈øame ≈øtate; our burnt and de≈øtroyed towns repaired or built up, our private lo≈ø≈øes made good, our public debts (contracted for defence) di≈øcharged, otherwi≈øe, we ≈øhall be millions wor≈øe, than we were at that enviable period.

The object, on either ≈øide, doth not ju≈øtify the means; for the lives of men are too valuable, to be ca≈øt away on ≈øuch trifles. It is the violence which is done and threatened to our per≈øons; the de≈øtruction of our property by an armed force; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va≈øion of our country by fire and ≈øword, which con≈øcientiou≈øly qualifies the u≈øe of arms: And the in≈øtant, in which ≈øuch a mode of defence became nece≈ø≈øary, all ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Britain ought to have cea≈øed; and the independancy of America, ≈øhould have been con≈øidered, as dating its aera from, and publi≈øhed by, <hi>the fir≈øt mu≈øket that was fired again≈øt her.</hi> This line is a line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtency; neither drawn by caprice, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ambition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall conclude the≈øe remarks, with the following timely and well intended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways by which an independancy
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:014966_0142_0F954EB8F9307CD8"/>
may hereafter be affected; and that <hi>one</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>three,</hi> will one day or other, be the fate of America, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Congre≈øs; by a military power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our ≈øoldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of rea≈øonable men; virtue, as I have already remarked, is not heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, neither is it perpetual. Should an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependancy be brought about by the fir≈øt of tho≈øe means, we have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noble≈øt pure≈øt con≈øtitution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A ≈øituation, ≈øimilar to the pre≈øent, hath not happened ≈øince the days of Noah until now. The birth day of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The reflection is awful, and in this point of view, how trifling, how ridiculous, do the little, paltry cavillings, of a few weak or intere≈øted men appear, when weighed again≈øt the bu≈øine≈øs of a world.</p>
                  <p>Should we neglect the pre≈øent favorable and inviting period, and an independance
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:014966_0143_0F954EBAC33B9360"/>
be hereafter effected by any other means, we mu≈øt charge the con≈øequence to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, or to tho≈øe rather, who≈øe narrow and prejudiced ≈øouls, are habitually oppo≈øing the mea≈øure, without either inquiring or reflecting. There are rea≈øons to be given in ≈øupport of independance, which men ≈øhould rather privately think of, than be publicly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we ≈øhall be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or not, but, anxious to accompli≈øh it on a firm, ≈øecure, and honorable ba≈øis, and unea≈øy rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its nece≈ø≈øity: Even the Tories (if ≈øuch beings yet remain among us) ≈øhould, of all men, be the mo≈øt ≈øolicitous to promote it; for as the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of committees at fir≈øt, protected them from popular rage, ≈øo, a wi≈øe and well e≈øtabli≈øhed form of government, will be the only certain means of continuing it ≈øecurely to them. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wi≈øh for Independance.</p>
                  <p>In ≈øhort, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together. We ≈øhall then ≈øee our object, and our ears will be legally ≈øhut again≈øt the ≈øchemes of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:014966_0144_0F954EBB3673F4E8"/>
as well, as a cruel enemy. We ≈øhall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for there is rea≈øon to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be le≈øs hurt by treating with the American ≈øtates for terms of peace, than with tho≈øe, whom ≈øhe denominates, "rebellious ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delaying in that, encourages her to hope for conque≈øt, and our backwardne≈øs tends only to prolong the war. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our trade to obtain a redre≈øs of our grievances, let us now try the alternative, by independantly redre≈ø≈øing them our≈øelves, and then offering to open the trade. The mercantile and rea≈øonable part in England, will be ≈øtill with us; becau≈øe, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it. And if this offer be not accepted, other courts may be applied to.</p>
                  <p>On the≈øe grounds I re≈øt the matter. And as no offer hath yet been made to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this pamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be refuted, or, that the party in favor of it are too nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be oppo≈øed. WHEREFORE, in≈øtead
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:014966_0145_0F954EBBF70459C0"/>
of gazing at each other with ≈øu≈øpicious or doubtful curio≈øity, let each of us hold out to his neighbour the hearty hand of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and unite in drawing a line, which, like an act of oblivion ≈øhall bury in forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs every former di≈ø≈øention.

                  <p>"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, ≈øince we were called to profe≈øs the light of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, manife≈øted in our con≈øciences unto this day, that the ≈øetting up and putting down kings and governments, is God's peculiar prerogative; for cau≈øes be≈øt known to him≈øelf: And that it is not our bu≈øine≈øs to have any hand or contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein; nor to be bu≈øy bodies above our ≈øtation, much le≈øs to plot and contrive the ruin, or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and ≈øafety of our nation, and good of all men: That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline≈øs and hone≈øty: <hi>under the government which God is plea≈øed to ≈øet over us</hi>"‚ÄîIf the≈øe are really your principles, why do you not abide by them? Why do you not leave that, which ye call God's work, to be managed by
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:014966_0152_0F954EBFC8647000"/>
him≈øelf? The≈øe very principles in≈øtruct you to wait with patience and humility, for the event of all public mea≈øures, and to recieve that event as the divine will towards you. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> what occa≈øion is there for your <hi>political te≈øtimony</hi> if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publi≈øhing it proves, that either, ye do not believe what ye profe≈øs, or have not virtue enough to practi≈øe what ye believe.</p>
                  <p>The principles of Quakeri≈øm have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffen≈øive ≈øubject of any, and every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is ≈øet over him. And if the ≈øetting up and putting down of kings and governments is God's peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he mo≈øt certainly will not be robbed thereof by us; wherefore the principle it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings as being his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you, Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and ≈øhould the pre≈øent proud Imitator of him, come to the ≈øame untimely end, the writers and publi≈øhers of the te≈øtimony, are bound by the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in government brought about by
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:014966_0153_0F954E74CF8071E0"/>
any other means than ≈øuch as are common and human; and ≈øuch as we are now u≈øing. Even the di≈øper≈øion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms. Wherefore, as ye refu≈øe to be the means on one ≈øide, ye ought not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on the other; but to wait the i≈ø≈øue in ≈øilence? and unle≈øs ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who hath created and placed this new world at the greate≈øt di≈øtance it could po≈ø≈øibly ≈øtand, ea≈øt and we≈øt, from every part of the old, doth, neverthele≈øs, di≈øapprove of its being independant of the corrupt and abandoned court of Britain, unle≈øs I ≈øay, ye can ≈øhew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, ju≈øtify the exciting and ≈øtirring up the people
<q>firmly to unite in the <hi>abhorrence</hi> of all ≈øuch <hi>writings,</hi> and <hi>mea≈øures,</hi> as evidence a de≈øire and de≈øign to break off the <hi>happy</hi> connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great Britain, and our ju≈øt and nece≈ø≈øary ≈øubordination to the king, and tho≈øe who are lawfully placed in authority under him.</q>
What a ≈ølap of the face is here! The men, who in the very paragraph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have quietly and pa≈ø≈øively re≈øigned up the ordering, altering, and di≈øpo≈øal of kings
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:014966_0154_0F954EC0809041B0"/>
and governments, into the hands of God, are now recalling their principles, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in for a ≈øhare of the bu≈øine≈øs. Is it po≈ø≈øible, that the conclu≈øion, which is here ju≈øtly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down? The incon≈øi≈øtency is too glaring not to be ≈øeen; the ab≈øurdity too great not to be laughed at; and ≈øuch as could only have been made by tho≈øe, who≈øe under≈øtandings were darkened by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and crabbed ≈øpirit of a de≈øpairing poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical party; for ye are not to be con≈øidered as the whole body of the Quakers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a factional and fractional part thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here ends the examination of your te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; (which I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I ≈øubjoin the following remark; "That the ≈øetting up and putting down of kings," mo≈øt certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not ≈øo, and the making him no king who is already one. And pray what hath this to do in the pre≈øent ca≈øe? We neither mean to <hi>≈øet up</hi> nor to <hi>pull down,</hi> neither to <hi>make</hi> nor to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make,</hi> but to have nothing to <hi>do</hi> with them. Wherefore, your te≈øtimony in whatever light it is viewed ≈øerves only to di≈øhonor your

judgment, and for many other rea≈øons had better have been let alone than publi≈øhed.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe it tends to the decrea≈øe and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmo≈øt danger to ≈øociety, to make it a party in political di≈øputes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom di≈øavow the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing political te≈øtomonies, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein and approvers thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becau≈øe it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip which your≈øelves by your late liberal and charitable donations hath lent a hand to e≈øtabli≈øh; and the pre≈øervation of which, is of the utmo≈øt con≈øequence to us all.</p>
                  <p>And here without anger or re≈øentment I bid you farewell. Sincerely wi≈øhing, that as men and chri≈øtians, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious right; and be in your turn, the means of ≈øecuring it to others; but that the example which ye have unwi≈øely ≈øet, of mingling religion with politics, <hi>may be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed and reprobated by every inhabitant of</hi> AMERICA.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>THE pamphlet of large ADDITIONS to Common Sen≈øe, containing ≈øeveral excellent pieces, written by ≈øome worthy and re≈øpectable citizens of Philadelphia, are in the opinion of ≈øome gentlemen, who are good judges of literary merit, thought worthy of pre≈øervation, in ≈øuch manner as to bind with other pamphlets in an octavo volume.‚ÄîTho≈øe that think as they do, will buy, and tho≈øe who do not think in that manner, will let them alone.</p>
                  <p>The judicious and di≈øcerning have perception ≈øufficient to ob≈øerve this, without the unnece≈ø≈øary intervention of the Fo≈øter-Father-Author's optics (who≈øe ≈øelf-imagined importance hath ≈øwelled him into contemptible con≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality) becau≈øe the Provedore to the Sentimentali≈øts doth not PRINT decent EDITIONS for ≈øuch ignoramus's as Lord Dunmore's NEGROES.</p>
                  <p>The envious Mr. ANONYMOUS, the ≈øhadow of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, with his murdering MASK and his DARK LAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORN, fully equipped for the ruffian bu≈øine≈øs of a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (like unto a villainous THIEF, who≈øe voracious cravings for PREY con≈øtrain him to forget the fears which forced him ≈øo lately to ≈øcamper away) hath once more crept into the field to ROB and to DESTROY the reputation of authors, who≈øe literary abilities OUT-SHINE his, as far as the blaze of a torch OUT-SHINETH the glimmering of a candle.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>Be≈øide their ≈øuperior talents in literature, they have thereto added (in his eyes) another mo≈øt grievous offence by their not employing him as a go-between, that he might thereby have an opportunity to in≈øinuate there is no WRITERS in America but the wou'd-be author of Common Sen≈øe‚ÄîThis ≈øtolen applau≈øe he is avariciou≈øly attached unto, although he certainly knoweth the tickli≈øh tenure of ≈øuch u≈øurped reputation‚ÄîFor if he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed only a ≈ømall ≈øhare of internal hone≈øty, he would be con≈øtrained to cry out in the emphatic words of the poor I≈øraelite, who lo≈øt the hatchet‚ÄîALAS! FOR IT WAS BORROWED.</p>
                  <p>P. S. The judicious part of the public know that the o≈øten≈øible author was, and ≈øtill is the aggre≈ø≈øor, yet the real book≈øeller, who hateth di≈ø≈øimulation, giveth the following true KEY to the whole di≈øpute.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>When the work was at a ≈øtand for want of a courageous Typographer, I was then recommended by a gentleman nearly in the following words, "There is Bell, he is a Republican Printer, give it to him, and I will an≈øwer for his courage to PRINT IT.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:014966_0158_0F954EC437DF63F8"/>This ≈øame Mr. ANONYMOUS, this Amanuen≈øis to a group of authors, on ≈øeeing the manly fortitude with which R.

                     <p>Your di≈øtance will only render your danger more imminent, and your ruin more irretrievable. Charters are no re≈øtraints again≈øt the lu≈øt of power. The only rea≈øon why you have e≈øcaped ≈øo long is, becau≈øe the trea≈øure of the nation has been employed for the≈øe 50 years in buying up the virtue of Britain and Ireland.

                     <p>But I fore≈øee many evils from the independance of the Colonies. Our trade will be ruined from the want of a navy to protect it. Each Colony will put in its claim for ≈øuperiority, and we ≈øhall have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øtic wars without end.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014966_0165_0F954ECA891A98D0"/>
Heaven has furni≈øhed you with greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øources for a navy than any nation in the world. Nothing but an ignorance of your ≈øtrength could have led you to ≈øacrifice your trade for the protection of a foreign navy. A freedom from the re≈øtraints of the acts of navigation I fore≈øee will produce ≈øuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe additions to the wealth of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that po≈øterity will wonder that ever you thought your pre≈øent trade worth its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. As to the ≈øuppo≈øed contentions between ≈øi≈øter colonies, they have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in truth. But ≈øuppo≈øing they have, will delaying the independance of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, 50 years, prevent them? No‚Äîthe weakne≈øs of the Colonies, which at fir≈øt produced their union, will always pre≈øerve it, 'till it ≈øhall be their intere≈øt to be ≈øeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Had the Colony of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øet's-bay been po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the military re≈øources which it would probably have had 50 years hence, would ≈øhe have held out the ≈øignal of di≈øtre≈øs to her ≈øi≈øter colonies, upon the news of the Bo≈øton port-bill? No‚Äî≈øhe would have with≈øtood all the power of Britain alone, and afterwards the neutral colonies might have ≈øhared the fate of the colony of Canada. Moreover, had the connection with Great-Britain
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014966_0166_0F954ECAF7B33F30"/>
been continued 50 years longer, the progre≈øs of Briti≈øh laws, cu≈øtoms, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (now totally corrupted) would have been ≈øuch that the Colonies would have been prepared to welcome ≈ølavery. But had it been otherwi≈øe, they mu≈øt have a≈ø≈øerted their independance with arms. This is nearly done already. It will be cruel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath another conte≈øt to your po≈øterity.</p>
