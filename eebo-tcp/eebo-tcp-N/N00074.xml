            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the reviving of this Root of Bitterness in the Quaker, after its being dead above an hundred years, caused the Translation and first Impression of this small Book under another Title; so the sprouting forth of its fruits of gall and wormwood, and the issuings from this corrupt fountain of those streams which make sad the City of God, have occasioned its second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, under the Name and Title put upon it by its Author <hi>Guy de Brez:</hi> whose <hi>praise in the Churches</hi> by his labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious planting, and faithful watering of them by his blood, is largely set forth in the famous Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the third <hi>Volume,</hi> in <hi>the Continuation of the History by Dr.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bulkly, <hi>pag. 37, 38, 41, 42, 43.</hi> where he is described to be not onely an eminent Witness of Christs Truth unto the death, but his Labours, Prayers and Sufferings are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to posterity; his rejoycing in God, when hands and feet were so laden with Iron Chains, as they eat through his Flesh to the very bones; his glorying in their ratling, more then if they had been Chains of Gold; his fulness of God, when shut up in the Dungeon, which for its darkness was called <hi>Brunain,</hi> where he had no more air but at one little hole, where drunkards vented their urine; even then his heart leaped for joy, provoking his wife to comfort, in that God had not onely given her a Husband who was a Minister of Christs Gospel, but to be honoured with Martyrdome; <hi>A Dignity</hi> (said he) <hi>which the Angels of Heaven are not

There also is mention made of this Book, he being <hi>engaged in an holy Conflict</hi> (as the Author calleth it) <hi>against the pestilent Sect of the Anabaptists, which as Cockle mingle themselves among the good Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Translation</hi> is a small part of the Book; the rest is Doctrinal, and a solid Conviction of their Tenents: which whosoever shall intelligently reade, and compare his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with those of our Worthies in these our dayes, he will finde that as <hi>Satan is the old Serpent,</hi> so <hi>Christ Jesus is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Character he giveth of them in his Epistle to his Book: <hi>1.</hi> That they multiplied quotations of Scripture against their true sense and meaning, to gain applause of the weak and unstable. <hi>2.</hi> That they gloried in their specious Holiness of Conversation. <hi>3.</hi> That they professed their readiness to suffer unto death.

            <head>The Rise, Spring and Foundation OF THE ANABAPTISTS.</head>
            <p>IN the year 1521 and the year insuing, there arose a certain number of mutinous and seditious persons, who secretly made Factions: they chiefly dwelt in the quarters of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which bordered upon the River <hi>Salah</hi>; among whom their chief was <hi>Nicholas Stork.</hi> They dreamed dreams, and said,<note place="margin">Nicholas Stork, <hi>and his accomplices, they preached dreams,</hi>
               </note> That they spake familiarly with God by Visions, they preached their dreams for truths and Divine Oracles; and because that there should come a <hi>new world, wherein should dwell righteousness:</hi> Therefore they ought to exterminate all the wicked, with all the Princes and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Magistrates,<note place="margin">

From out of this School came <hi>Thomas Muntzer,</hi> Dr. <hi>Balthazar Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Melchior Rink, John Hutt, John Deuter, Lodovike Het<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Muntzer</hi> (of whom we formerly spake) said, <hi>That whosoever would be saved must firstly flye all manifest vices,</hi>

and that without doubt being thus urged, he would declare himself by some evident sign, quenching the thirst of the spirit, and doing unto us as formerly unto the Fathers.</hi> He said moreover, That <hi>Gods will was declared by dreams, and there laid the foundations of his doctrine; insomuch that if the dream of any might be interpreted, he praised him greatly in his Sermons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that by this means he had by little and little gained some, he discovered what he had long before plotted in the City of <hi>Alsted,</hi> which is in the Marches of <hi>Turing:</hi> He began to enroll the names of those that were entred into league with him, and by solemn Oath they promised assistance,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Muntzer</hi> was somewhat more cool; though he preached with great violence, yet he would not run any hazard untill that the Neighbourhood had taken up Arms: and the more easily to bring about his enterprize, he wrote unto the Labourers in the Mynes of the Territories of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> admonishing them to fall upon the Princes without any respect or consideration; for these that were ready in <hi>Francony</hi> drew near unto <hi>Turing.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Phifer,</hi> who could not forbear, took the field with his, and sack'd the Country about <hi>Isfield,</hi> pillaged the Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Temples (or Churches) and slew divers Gentlemen, taking others Prisoners: which having done, he returned laden with plunder; and having so well sped, the popularity were encouraged: in the mean time they skirmished and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vined in the Country of <hi>Mansfield</hi>; wherefore <hi>Muntzer</hi> thinking that there was a revolt in all parts, came forth from <hi>Mulhuze</hi> with 300 seditious men.

Yet there were in the band some bold and desperate ones bent to do mischief: they being over-forward, and ready to do evil, were inflamed the more by reason of his Speech, especially the Rainbow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of did encouarge them; and they judged it as a most sure sign of Victory: there was this further to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that their Army was great (it being about 8000 men) and the place advantagious for their defence: these Varlets cried out, that all should take up their Arms, and with courage they came to close with the enemy, singing an Hymn, whereby they did implore the aid of the Holy Ghost. There was sent unto them to parly a young man of a Noble Family, whom <hi>Muntzer</hi> against the Law of Arms had slain; herewith the Princes being provoked, caused the Alarm to be sounded, and ordered their Battel in array.</p>

These being driven out, they fall upon pillaging their Estates: by this every one may know by what spirit these Anabaptistical Hypocrites were led: there is no act so fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, horrible, cruel and wicked, that ever was done, which they did not commit. In the beginning they talked of nothing but the Spirit and Holiness; they said, it was not lawful for a Christian to be a Magistrate, and that it was not lawful to bear Arms; but after they had brought all under their paw, and in their power, then it was lawful to take the Publick Arms, with the Town-house, and to chuse a Magistrate to their minde, yea, with rejection of him that was ordained of God; and thrust themselves into his place, and to make themselves Consuls and Senators as they have done: there is not need of much speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the world knoweth it. Where now are the fair spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of those Anabaptists? <hi>Do not resist evil: He that will take away thy coat, give him thy cloak also.</hi> These have not only pillaged and stript honest men of their clothes, but of all that they had, and have driven them miserable out of their houses, with their wives and little ones, and have exposed them to death by the Besiegers of the City.</p>
            <p>At that time there arose in the City of <hi>Munster</hi> a great number of Prophets (for they usurped that name) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of whom were <hi>John Matthews</hi> of <hi>Harling,</hi> and one <hi>Pistor,</hi>

               </note> who were both audacious, and prating fellows; they boasted of Visions, and of the Spirit of Prophecie. By Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Authority, this holy Prophet commanded all the City to bring in all their Gold, Silver, and other moveable goods

to be common, and that none upon pain of death, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any thing for his own private use: and to this end, there was a Publick house appointed. The people were very much astonished at the rigour of this Edict, yet notwithstanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed it: it was not possible to retain or conceal any portion; for there were two Maides Divineresses, who did reveal it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Divineresses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the goods and all books besides the Bible to be burnt.</hi>
               </note> if there were any that did retain any thing. Afterwards these Prophets commanded that none should keep any books except the Holy Bible; and that all others should publickly be brought forth and abolished: he said, that he received this Command from God; wherefore great numbers of books were brought together and consumed by fire.</p>
            <p>It came to pass that an Artificer named <hi>Hubert Trutelin,</hi>

but the King surprizing him, threw him down, and three dayes kept him in Prison.</p>
            <p>Is there not here to be seen a wonderfull rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Who could have believed that any bearing humane shape, should have been left to commit things so foolish, absurd, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and execrable? but it cannot be otherwise with such as violate, trample upon, and reject the Word of God; they are by Divine judgement smitten, so as to be an example to the Elect. But let us behold their goodly glorious King, now mounted with more then Royal Pomp: where is the spirit of these Anabaptists, who were so ready to reprove and reject others? At first they cried out against all; if they saw any Matron wear silk, or any man of fashion to wear a gold Ring, they cried down all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now their glorious King Taylor omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, that may set forth his Pomp and State. In the beginning they would not bear to hear, that any honest man should be a Bailiff, or Governour of a Village; but soon the wind is changed, and now by command from the Father, their King is not King of a Village, but of the whole World; for so he caused himself to be styled. During this Siege, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Munster</hi> published a Book, which they intituled, <hi>The Ristitution</hi>; wherein they maintained <hi>Muntzers</hi> damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and an infinite of Errours.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in the Moneth of <hi>August,</hi> on the day which is called S. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> the new Prophet called <hi>John Twiscoscar</hi> sounded the Trumpet through the streets, and cried out, that <hi>All should meet in Arms about the way to the great Church; for they must give a repulse to the Enemies of the City:</hi> being thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come, they finde a Supper ready, which the King had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; and by command the people did sit down, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four thousand: the King, Queen, and Courtiers wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Table.

Then he named them in order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the place whither each should go: Six were sent to <hi>Osemberg,</hi> as many to <hi>Warrendort</hi>; eight to <hi>Susar,</hi> and as many to <hi>Corsfield.</hi>

               </note> and those which were appointed to be sent forth. As they were at Supper, the King rose up, and said, <hi>That he had received a Commission from the Father:</hi> whereas upon an adventure there was a Souldier which had been taken, the King accused him that he was a Traitor as <hi>Judas,</hi> and with his own hands cut off his head. This being done, he returned to sit down at Table, and by way of merriment recited what he had done. After Supper within night, they caused the twenty eight above-mentioned, to depart out of the City; and over and above their expences, they gave to every one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> them certain pieces of Gold, to leave in such places where their Doctrine should not be received, in witness of their perdition, and eternal damnation, for their refusal of the peace and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And when they were arrived at the places assigned unto them, they began to run through the City with horrible cries, crying, <hi>Repent, repent, otherwise ye will suddenly perish:</hi> then they cast their garments upon the ground, and threw their pieces of Gold which were given unto them upon their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, assuring them that they were sent by the Father, to bring peace unto them if they would receive it: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to put all their goods in common; if they did refuse it, by this sign, and as by a mark, they did bear witness against their ingratitude, and evil deeds: for behold the time now is come, which was foretold by the Prophets, wherein the Lord God would, that Righteousness should reign through

all the earth: and after that the King shall have discharged his trust, and shall have so done, that Righteousness shall reign every where; Then Christ shall deliver up the Kingdome to the Father.</p>
            <p>Upon these words they were apprehended, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning fairly demanded, then by the Rack examined of their faith, life, and Ammunition of the City. They answered, that they alone had the true Doctrine, which they would unto the death maintain: for since the Apostles time the Gospel was not truly preached, and that there was no righteousness; that there were four Prophets, two of which were true, namely, <hi>David George,</hi> and <hi>John Becold</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi>; two were false, namely, the Pope, and <hi>Luther</hi> worse then the Pope. Being asked why they drave the honest people out of the City, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their faith and promise, and detained their Goods, Wives and Children; and by what Text of Scripture they could war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that unrighteousness? They answered, That the time was now come, wherein the Word of Christ should be fulfilled, <hi>that the meek should possess the earth</hi>; and that God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er gave the goods of the Egyptians unto the Israelites: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they declared their Ammunition and Victuals that was in the City, with their Garrison, some of whom had above five Wives. Moreover, that they looked for Souldiers from <hi>Frise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who being arrived, the King would take the Field with all his Army, to reduce the whole World under his power and subjection, after he had slain their Kings which did not righteousness. After they were questioned, and still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in their opinions, they were all beheaded, except one who escaped.</p>
            <p>At the same time there arose another Prophet, called <hi>Henry Hilvers,</hi> a wicked man, subtil and wary; he came to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King and the people, that the heavenly Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him, that three rich Cities with all their goods should be given unto them by God, namely, <hi>Amsterdam, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter,</hi> and <hi>Wesel.</hi> The King hearing this, set himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with his Council, by what means they might bring these


<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000119_0026_0FA02A5DB87F0728"/>
three Cities unto Anabaptism; and to this effect they sent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men unto these places. In the first place he sent <hi>James Campen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and commanded him to be Prince in that City, and ordered him <hi>John Matthews</hi> of <hi>Middleburg</hi> to be his consort: they went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and hid themselves at a Sectaries house, and there with their mischievous doctrine they impoysoned many, re-baptized their disciples, and secretly by night held Conventicles and Meetings; yea, also they scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their poyson in the neighbouring Cities: for in the City of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>January,</hi> in the year following, 1535, many were put to death for Anabaptism, and for their seditious counsels and enterprises. Moreover, in the end of the year 1534 the King sent into <hi>Friseland, John Gelen,</hi> a subtil man, and well vers'd in arms, he having formerly had charge in the Army; the King gave him good store of gold out of the spoil of the Churches, and gave him in charge to raise an Army in <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ise</hi>; and acted so by certain men that assisted him, that on the 30 of <hi>March</hi> 1535, he mustered up and raised an Army, and took a Monastery, and drave out the Friers, and there quartered his Camp, until his Army should augment and be compleated. <hi>George Schenck</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Frise,</hi> speedily assaulted them as seditious persons: they valliantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves, but he gained the Victory and defeated them; but not without great loss: they were all cut off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept sixty, who were brought to <hi>Leanard,</hi> and after were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished according to their deserts. Their Captain <hi>John Gelen</hi> escaped and fled to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to be the author of some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sedition; where he found many Anabaptists, whom <hi>James Campense</hi> had seduced; he promised them great matters, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalting the glory and liberty at <hi>Munster,</hi> magnificently preaching the new raign of righteousness upon earth. For by this time the renown of <hi>Munster</hi> was spread, which anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the courage of many; seeing so great an Army had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged them, yea, and had stormed them often, with the loss of many; and that they saw the Anabaptists to persist in their purpose: many who were desirous to be freed from their debts,


<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000119_0027_0FA02A5E75564048"/>
and to triumph, did greatly desire to enjoy the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Munster. Henry Gesbell</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a stout man, and of renown for Souldiery, was gained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, and was very familiar with <hi>John Gelen</hi>; who being drawn to their party by large promises, much was wrought by him: for in the conclusion 600 Anabaptists met together, with whom they intended and attempted to take <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to set up their new raign, as they had done at <hi>Munster</hi>: for upon the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> the first and the chiefest of them, assembled in the house of <hi>Peter Gale</hi>; where after consultation they came forth into the street; for that day the Citizens were merry, and had according to a custom among them been at a Game.</p>
            <p>About 10 a clock, the Anabaptists ran together in the streets, about the Cross, which was a publick place, crying out, <hi>Amend your lives,</hi> &amp;c. whosoever will this night be rich and happy, let him march along with us: and as the number of their people encreased more and more, they slew part of them who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> charge of the watch, and the other part they took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now the Citizens assembled themselves, and assaulted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists; but they carried the matter so ill, as that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul was slain, and the rest put to flight; but then they reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their strength, and gave battel unto the Anabaptists, who were then defeated, though with much blood which then was shed; among whom <hi>John Gelen,</hi> and <hi>Henry Gesbel</hi> were slain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Campense</hi> was taken, and executed by the hand of Justice. Afterwards in many parts of those places of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Anabaptists raised tumults and seditions; not without loss and great damage unto several honest people, for they could not keep themselves quiet: for when they were defeated in one part, they began in another; making in secret many disciples, who waited for the restoring of the Kingdom unto <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a certain man in the Town of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who being forced unto it by torments, confessed that the King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists dwelt in <hi>Vtricht</hi>; but that he was not yet crowned, but only designed to be Prince in the Kingdom of Israel: this prisoner was not only found possessed of vessels of silver and


<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000119_0028_0FA02A608A979028"/>
gold, which by evil practise he had stoln; but also guilty of several crimes, for which he was executed: there is no doubt, but that by this King they did intend <hi>David George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, although at <hi>Munster</hi> their King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had made unto the poor people most great and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent promises; yet now every day they were oppressed with great necessity, and chiefly through Famine, insomuch as many were starved, and died for want of bread.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants secretly resolved to apprehend the King, and to deliver him up unto the Bishop, and by this means to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase their peace: the King making doubt hereof, and not trusting to himself; he chose twelve men, whom he judged would be most faithful unto him, and appointed them to be Captains of each Quarter of the City, that he might be in the better rest and assurance; afterwards he promised the people, that by <hi>Easter</hi> they should be freed and delivered from this siege, and all their poverty: for he hoped that the Legates which he had sent into <hi>Frise</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Regions, having raised Souldiers, would make some stirs; and that by this means the siege would be raised before <hi>Munster</hi>: but he was deceived by his vain hopes, as we have heard (for there was a goodly dispatch of his Legates:) He promised great matters to the Captains which he had chosen; how when the Camp should be raised before the City, he would make them great Lords and Princes; and particularly he gave unto <hi>John Dents</hi> the Empire of <hi>Saxony</hi>: whereby appeared the bruitish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Diabolical rage of this pleasant and goodly King Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, to promise to give that which was none of his own; and to take it away from him, to whom God had given it.</p>
            <p>In the Moneth of <hi>February,</hi> the famine was so great, that many died through hunger and want. One of the Queens (for there were many) called <hi>Elisa,</hi> out of pity to the People, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally said, That she did not believe that it was pleasing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that the people should thus perish through famine: The King, who had store of good provision in his house, not only for necessity, but also to make good cheer; withal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000119_0029_0FA02A630DF5C2D0"/>
this, brought her into the Market place with all the other Queens, and commanded them all to fall down upon their knees about her; and unsheathing his sword he struck off her head from off her shoulders: and not being contented herewith, he reproached her as a bawd: the other wives fell a singing after this goodly deed, <hi>Glory be unto God in the highest</hi>; and gave thanks unto the heavenly Father: and then they fell a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; the King led the Gallia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and exhorted the poor people to leap, dance, and to rejoyce also, who had nought left but a little bread and salt.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Easter</hi> was come, and that there appeared no sign of deliverance, the people were, and that not without cause, much grieved: The King who all along fed them with fair promises, fell sick, and continued so six dayes together, that he might cover himself with some excuse: after those six dayes, he came into the Market place, and there shewing himself, he told the people, that he had promised them deliverance: but it must spiritually be understood, and behold this was the deliverance; he said, That he had rode the blinde Ass, and that the Father had laid upon him the sins of the multitude; and that he had born them, and taken them away: and that now they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all their sins; which was the deliverance that he had promised unto them. Thus must the poor and miserable people content themselves, to hear this execrable blasphemy. The blind Ass of this Gallant, whereupon this devillish and desperate man rode, was the poor people, that endured and did bear the enormities of such a villain, whom they adored.</p>
            <p>If we should reckon up the miseries, calamities, and other evils which those of the City endured, it were a miserable thing to hear: divers who would not bear the famine, fled to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; not so much looking for mercy, as that their pain might be expired by death: many crawled upon their bellies in the streets, and others dyed in the wayes: it was an horrible thing to see many walking quite stripped of flesh, nothing left but skin upon the bones. Their ears, lips, cheeks, and noses were so shrunk up, as one might almost see day-light through them, as

through a piece of Paper. Through feebleness, they could not carry their bodies: some went to the enemy disarmed, trailing a staff in their hands: whiles provision lasted, none talked of going to the enemy, but now when this was spent, then began their desolation and discontent: yet they helpt themselves as long as they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They sowed in the sides of the walls, and in all waste places, rapes, pease, and such seeds, and with this they made shift to pass the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But when this crop was spent, then it was as Venison to them to feed on dogs, rats and mice; and when the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was taken, there were but two horses left alive: many were so pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with hunger, as that they did eat the flesh of dead carcasses. Finally, they boiled shoes, old leather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and skins, and beat them together, and put them into a pot, and mingled all sorts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, which they could finde: this was instead of bread; and yet this villain and wicked cheater deceived them, telling them, God tried them, to see whether they would be faithful and constant; and that certainly the Father would deliver them in a short time. Now they that would depart out of the City, to be delivered from these mischiefs, were to present themselves before the King: and there this Robber took from them all that they had; and when they were ransacked, he said, Now get you gone to the Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The King had yet provision of Victuals in his Palace, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Moneths; but it was only for his Courtiers. They consulted how they might victual the City. Then there stood forth one named <hi>Hansken Vander Langke-strate,</hi> he was one of the Kings Secretaries, and one in whom he confided much: he undertook to re-victual the City, and to bring in three hundred Souldiers to their assistance, and all in fifteen dayes. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the City, and under this pretence went unto the enemy; and for a certain sum of money sold the City unto the Bishop, offering to lose his life if he did not accomplish i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: the time for this Plot to be put in execution, was the even of S. <hi>Johns</hi> day, at ten a clock in the night; and that he would open the Gate unto them, provided they came without noise, to the Gate


<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000119_0031_0FA02A6478D11EC8"/>
of the Cross. Then this Purveyour returned unto the City, and comforted the King, telling him, That he had well ordered his business; and that within fifteen dayes they should have a recruit of Victuals and Souldiers. When the day was come, he told the Watch, That this night their aid and victuals should come; and therefore when they saw them approach, that they should take heed that they made no noise, but be very quiet. At the very time appointed, at ten a clock in the night, the Gate was opened, and the enemy entred. They kill'd the Sentinels, and the <hi>Corps du Gard,</hi> having got the Word. Being thus entred into the City, the Trumpets sound an Alarm; suddenly the King and his men put themselves into a posture to fight, and to repulse the enemy back again to the Gate, which was now shut by some of the Citizens. The enemies without broke up the Gates; for they heard how they charged upon their people within: and being now entred in, they display their Colours. Those of the City abode the brunt a little at first, and were drawn up in the Market place: the Battel was very great. The King, <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> and <hi>Crechting,</hi> were taken: then <hi>Rotman</hi> seeing no hope to escape, thrust himself into the middle of the enemies, and there was run through, because he feared to be taken alive. But when the Anabaptists heard that their King was taken, their courage failed them, and they hid themselves here and there in Cellars, holes and Shop-bulks; yea, if it had been possible, would have ran into mouse-holes. They were ten dayes in pillaging the City, and they found in the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace provision for 200 men for two Moneths: whereas the poor people were for a long time starved. This was called, <hi>To have things in common</hi>; when as some had to eat, and others were starved. This was like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi>'s dealing before the Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the City of <hi>Munster</hi> taken, the 25 of <hi>June</hi> 1535. The King was three days after, by a guard of Souldiers brought to a Castle three leagues from the City, called <hi>Dulme.</hi> As soon as the Bishop perceived the King, he cried out, Oh thou wretch! how hast thou brought spoil and waste to me, and to my poor


<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000119_0032_0FA02A6522FA9AE8"/>
people! The King readily and proudly answered, lifting up himself, and despising the Bishop, said, <hi>Priest, we have not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thee one mite, but we have delivered a strong City into thine hands, which is able to stand out against all strength: yet if We have done thee damage, if thou wilt hearken unto us, we will make make thee rich.</hi> The Bishop hearing that, could not forbear laughing, and asked him, how he would do it? The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, <hi>Get Baskets made of Iron, and cover them over with Leather, and put me in one of them, and cause me to be carried through the Country, and let no man see me, but he that shall give thee a peny; and by this means, thou shalt receive more money then thou hast spent in the War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better and most holy Anabaptists hung about their necks the mark and ensign of their King engraven in Brass, marked with these three letters, <hi>D. W. E.</hi> which in their language signified, <hi>The Word was made Flesh.</hi> The King had for his Title, <hi>I John by the grace of God, and by vertue of the new Kingdome to come in the Temple of God, Minister of Righteousness, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the King with his two Companions were carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners here and there unto the Princes, by which means the Ministers of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> had opportunity to confer with the King, and to dispute with him about the principal Points, <hi>viz.</hi> The Kingdome of Christ, The Magistrate, Baptism, The Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Lord, The Lords Supper, Marriage: and by testimonies of Scripture unto them, so acted, as though in all things they changed not: notwithstanding all the oppositions they made to defend their opinions, yet they yielded somewhat; which the King did (as some thought) in hope to save his life: for at the second time of their return, he promised them, if they would grant him his liberty, to silence the Anabaptists, which were in great numbers in <hi>Holland, Brabant, England,</hi> and <hi>Friseland,</hi> and to bring them in subjection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
            <p>The 20 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1536. the King and his two Companions were brought back to <hi>Munster,</hi> and put in several Prisons; the two next dayes were spent in holy Remonstrances, to reduce


<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000119_0033_0FA02A658A643F70"/>
them from their errours. The King acknowledged his sin, and had recourse to Christ by prayer: the other two acknowledged not their faults, but stood out. The next day the King was brought forth upon a Scaffold, and tied to a post; where were two executioners with hot burning tongs: he indured the three first pinchings of the tongs, without speaking word; afterward he ceased not to call upon the mercy of the Lord. Thus for a whole hour and more, was he torn and dismembred; and to dispatch him out of the world, he was run through with a sword: his two Companions had the like end. Their bodies were put into iron Cages, and hung upon S. <hi>Lamberts</hi> Tower, for a perpetual memorial. Let none think we recite stories of the Anabaptists, which are not to be believed, by adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto of our own; God forbid that we should so do: for there are many yet living, who were eye-witnesses of these things, and present when they were done. I speak this, that none might be hindred from getting profit by this History, which is true and certain, and brought to light for the instruction of <hi>the people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1535. upon the 3 of <hi>February,</hi> in the City of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> in the street of the <hi>Salines,</hi> in the house of one <hi>John Silert,</hi> who then was far from home, there assembled seven men and five women, then called Anabaptists, among whom there was one called <hi>Theodore Sartor,</hi> who was there inspired; he lay stretched out flat upon the ground, for some space of time, before the other brethren and sisters: who in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened; and prayer being made with great gravity, or rather fair hypocrisie, he then said, That he had seen God in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; also that he had a vision of all things in heaven and in hell; and that the great day of Judgement was now come: Afterwards he pulled off all his garments, not leaving so much as to cover his shameful parts withall. He commanded the rest of his brethren and sisters to follow his example, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for said he, <hi>The children of God must strip themselves, and put off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoever is made and born of the earth; inasmuch as truth is naked, and cannot abide to be wrapped up in any thing:


<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000119_0034_0FA02A6646B1E9B8"/>
therefore, to shew themselves veritable and true, ought to unclothe themselves.</hi> The poor people hearing this, put off their clothes; and being no wayes ashamed, became quite naked. <hi>Theodore</hi> commanded them all to imitate him: he leapt out of doors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publick quite naked, as also did the rest of the men and women, who followed him, crying after an horrible manner, <hi>Wo, wo, wo, Divine vengeance, Divine vengeance, &amp;c.</hi> and in this manner they ran furiously through the City, like mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, crying out so hideously as never was known.</p>
            <p>Then the Citizens ran to take arms (for they knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City were surprized by enemies, or what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this stir.) Finally, these impudent people were taken being quite naked; and being questioned upon the 5 of <hi>March,</hi> these seven men were beaten and scourged: the first of them cried out, <hi>Praise the Lord for evermore</hi>: another said, <hi>Lord, avenge the blood of thine</hi>: the third, <hi>Open your eyes, &amp;c.</hi> the fourth said, <hi>Wo, wo.</hi> Afterwards the women were brought to punishment: when they were taken, they offered them gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but they rejected them, saying, <hi>That the truth ought to be naked.</hi> What men ever heard of such impudency or fury? In the ancient stories we reade of <hi>Adamites,</hi> who also went na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; but it was only among themselves, and at their Festival dayes: but these far surpass them.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> saw himself naked, he sought for covering; and finding nothing more fit then leaves, he made use of those of a Figtree: but these, when as garments were tendred unto them, they refused them; and like dogs ran without shame. Behold what befalleth those that leave the word of God, to cleave unto dreams and Satanical illusions! but behold their madness, in that they dare attribute so much villany unto the holy Spirit of God, and to make him the author of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness: they ought to have in remembrance, with what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth women to have their heads covered in the Church: what would he have said if he had seen or known women to run without shame quite naked like Bitches, who commanded that women apparel themselves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

habit, with shamefac'dness and modesty?</p>
            <p>The things which were done by these Anabaptists in the Towns of St. <hi>Gall</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> are not less hideous nor hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible then these, whereof we have already heard. For in the year 1526, two brethren which came out of the same womb, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Leonard Schitker,</hi> inhabiting neer unto the town called <hi>Mulleg</hi>; the 7. of <hi>February,</hi> by night there assembled a great number of Anabaptists in their Fathers house, who spent all the night in preaching and doing marvelous deeds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of visions: at Sun-rising, upon the 8 of <hi>February, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> took his brother <hi>Leonard,</hi> and set him in the midst of his kindred, and of all the company, commanding him to fall down upon his knees: now as the rest admonished him, to do no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming thing unto his Brother, he answered them, That they needed not to fear, for he should do nothing there, but the will of the Father: in the mean while unsheathing a Sword he cut off his brothers head, who was upon his knees before them all. As all the company were smitten with great fear, and made great and lamentable complaints, <hi>Thomas</hi> who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Murther, suddenly flyeth out of the Town, using horrible behaviours, as the custom of the Anabaptists is to do.</p>
            <p>This Enthusiast at that time came before the Consul in the town of St. <hi>Gall.</hi> Mr. <hi>Joachim Vadian,</hi> an excellent man and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for piety and learning, being present, this Anabaptist cryed out fearfully before him, <hi>The day of the Lord is at hand, the day of the Lord cometh:</hi> he added further, that at the break of day, there had been some great thing done, (but that he concealed the matter) and that the will of the Father was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and that it had been steeped in Gall and Vinegar: the Consul reproved him, and chid him sharply, because of his fury and immoderate cryes, commanding him to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to return to his house, and to behave himself peaceably. Suddenly his villanous murther was divulged, and he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and diligently examined by torture; and afterwards for his villanous fact, by the hand of the Magistrate executed and put to death. This poor Anabaptist had forgot the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine


<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000119_0036_0FA02A67C4645FD8"/>
of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12, &amp;c. but God by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement and providence, suffered such villanous and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable deeds to be committed by these persons, that these wayes may be abominated.</p>

            <p>That befalleth these persons, which is common to such as once stray, and turn aside from the right path, and the good old way: by how much further they are off and distant from the right path, and the more progress they make; so much the farther do they wander from the right way: after that they had built the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> God so confounded their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that they understood not one another; and they are divided among themselves, yea, they have damned and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated one another, and made divers Churches apart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out familiarity or communion together.

            <p>Firstly, He wrote and taught publickly, that the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel, were not sent of God: and that they preached not the true word of God, but were Scribes and Pharisees, preaching only the dead Letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he said, That the writing of the Old Testament, and the preaching of the eternal word, was not the word of God, but was only the testimony thereof: and that we must search for the word in the internal part, <hi>i. e.</hi> in our hearts, where God hath put it, that we need not go far to seek it from without us: The Scribe-Ministers (saith he) think that faith cometh by the Scriptures and preaching, but they are very far off: for all the Scriptures lead us hither, that we must be taught and learned of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Isai.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Jer</hi> 31.34.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>It was very needful for these Anabaptists, to begin here to set up their Sect and Faction: they must say and plainly affirm, that the Ministers are not sent of God, that they might the more withdraw the poor people from them. The Reasons which move them so to speak, as they pretend, are <hi>Pauls</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.12.</note> where he saith, <hi>Be an Example,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apostle sheweth it is needful for the Minister to approve his calling by purity of life,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.</note> otherwise it will be vain and false; also the Bishop must be unblameable. Our new Mennonists and Franniques are of the same opinion. But in the mean while, who seeth not that they endeavour above all things, to set up their own works and righteousnesses, and Pharisee-like to judge &amp; condemn all such as do not as many works as they? It is many times so, that Harlots will boast themselves more of their chastity then honest Matrons: so it was with the false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they might bring the true Apostles of Christ into disrepute; they so boasted of their own vertue and lowliness, as if the true Apostles were in no wise to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red


<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000119_0038_0FA02A6A47DED4E0"/>
with them. But the Apostle is in no wise astonished at their vain and foolish braggings; yea, he plainly derided them, saying, <hi>We dare not make ours of the number, nor compare our selves with some who commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise:</hi> as if the Apostle should have said, they so please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in themselves, that they think and esteem, that there are none in the World equal or to be compared with themselves: they consider not the gifts wherewith others are endued, but their sight is so fixed upon themselves and their own fair deeds, as that they are perswaded, that they are the only ones, and the None-such in the world. In the mean while, the Apostle lively upbraideth them, saying, Such false Apostles are deceitful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, disguising themselves into Apostles of Christ; and no marvel, saith he, for Satan transformeth himself into an Angel of light; it is no great matter then, if his Ministers trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves into the Ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works. Moreover, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not well, that Doctrine far surpasseth works? so as if the Doctrine be not sound, pure, and true; the works, how holy and fair soever they may be, will never prove the calling of a false Prophet, that he is sent from God.</p>
            <p>If it were lawful for us to boast, it should not be in our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, perfection, and mortification, as they do; but onely in the pure mercy of God through Jesus Christ: if so be that gravity and honesty of life, were the true sign of the vocation to the Ministry, it would follow, that all honest and good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be Ministers of the Church; but that is well known to be false, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. nor can it be; for there is a command for <hi>every one to walk in the calling wherein he is called,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.29. He asketh also, <hi>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> Every Christian may or ought to reade, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Scripture; it followeth not therefore that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are Preachers and Ministers of the Churches, but onely those which are lawfully called; nor doth the calling cease for any failing that may be found in the life of the Called (which is

It is well known our Ministers are called to Office by the voice and common consent of all the Church; and that after fasting and calling upon the Name of God, according to Apostolical institution, and are confirmed in their Office by imposition of hands: what reason is there for these Sectaries to say, That their Ministers are called of God, but ours onely by the world and men? if their Ministers have a special calling as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had, let them prove it by signs, miracles, gifts of tongues, and Apostolical Doctrine, as they did: The Church hath no need of your Ministers; for the Doctrine of Repentance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, and of Remission of sins in the Name of Christ, is abundantly declared in the Church of Christ: to teach the same thing is superfluous; if you teach any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then you and your Doctrine is accursed, and not to be heard.</p>
            <p>I shall say no other thing, then what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> before spake to the like glorious Ministers as theirs be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. If their spirit be so full of knowledge and light, so as they cannot contain themselves from preaching without calling; why do they not preach where the Gospel was never yet declared? they insinuate themselves into such places, where the Gospel hath been preached to the people, with great labour and hazard of life unto the poor Ministers. It is a marvel, how they will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to enjoy, and partake of the labours of those Ministers, whom they so much hate: they secretly by fraud and deceit se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and disturb in such places the poor sheep of Jesus Christ, which ought not to be withdrawn from their true Pastors. I pray all the Flock of Christ, not to give heed to such strangers, but rather hearken to the voice of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>These Sectaries do defame and reproach the Ministers, and speak all evil of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is because they touch them at the

quick; because they cry out upon these Wolves, and pluck the sheep-skins from off their backs, that none might be surprized by their fair appearance. Seeing the Gospel-Ministers are styled <hi>Salt of the earth,</hi> none must think strange that the Salt biteth and pricketh, and maketh it self to be Salt: the Salt biteth not where there is no wound, but it is felt where there is a raw place. It will appear then, that they have lost their spiritual senses, who say, That <hi>our Ministers are not called of God:</hi> God hath put singular honour upon the Ministers; yea, what greater could he put upon them, then by saying, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me?</hi> the Lord not only by words, hath recommended the Ministers unto the Church; but also by example, hath shewn what honour and reverence all ought to have them in.

they must needs grant us, that the Apostles and the faithful in the Primitive Church, were inspired by the Spirit of Christ; yet none of them durst contemn the Word of God, and the holy Scriptures, but rather each of them had them in very great reverence; as we may see it by their writings, which are furnished with many testimonies from the Old Testament: and certainly thus was it promised by God, through the mouth of the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. where we see, that the Lord joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these two together, his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Spirit:</hi> wherefore should we separate, what God hath by an inviolable bond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned?</p>

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.15.</note> falling upon soil tilled and well manured, it brings forth fruit in abundance. So the word of God, if it fall upon the hard and rebellious brain, it remaineth without fruit, as upon stony soil: but upon a heart prepared by the operation of the Holy Ghost, then it brings forth much fruit; and as the Husband-man when he hath sown his seed, he can do no more, he cannot make his grain to grow, but leaveth it to God: so must the Ministers do; when they have preached and sown the Word of God, they cannot make it grow, they must commend it unto God: as the Apostle saith, <hi>He that planteth is nothing,</hi>

I assure you on my part, I have learned more by seeing a Hen or a Capon killed, then ever I learned by all the Sermons and Lectures of the Books that ever I read. Unto whom I answered, It must needs be that you eat often of Hens and Capons, seeing you have learned so much by their death: but I pray you, said I, What good did you ever learn thereby? he answered, That he had learned to know, the obedience which Jesus Christ rendred unto God his Father upon the Cross: and that as the fowl was slain without making resistance, and that for the good and life of man; so was Jesus Christ slain for the life of mankinde: it was said then unto him, How do you know that ever there was such an one as Jesus Christ, and that he died for man? do you finde that written in the Capons belly? the Turks also do kill Capons, but they cannot reade there, that Christ was their Saviour. In the end they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, and like people deprived of their sences, when they were hampered by the word of God, and by their own reasons. What man is there that would not wonder at such foolish and irrational discourse? is it not just that such people should be so handled, seeing they have rejected the word of the living God, which the Angels themselves desire to pry into, that they should be sent to School unto the bruit beasts.</p>

Let notice be taken whether <hi>Muntzer</hi> and his companions be not of that number, who dare not plainly say as much, but they will say as we do; but being put unto it, they make Jesus Christ but an half Saviour, by bringing in good works.

with unbelievers, to be true marriages, though they were joyned together in the time of their unbelief? See how these poor people are become shameless, in laying open their filthiness before all the world! who would not wonder to see such spiritual people as these pretend themselves to be, to live upon the goods and riches of whore-mongers! this is the honour that they put upon their Fathers and Mothers, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat and brought them forth, yea, and upon themselves.</p>
               <p>As for the Apostolical Anabaptists, they are so called, because they follow (as they say) the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apostolical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists.</hi>
                  </note> and Apostolical Church step by step. They regard the naked letter of the Scripture, They walked as Vagabonds through the Country, and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without shoes, without staff, without girdle, and without money: they said, that they were sent by God; and because Christ saith, <hi>He that will enter into the Kingdom of heaven, must become as a little child,</hi> they said, We must play the children with Children, and therefore they so did: and because our Lord saith, He that leaveth not all that he possesseth, whether Wife, Children, Father, Mother, Lands and Inheritance, &amp;c. they often took slender occasions, and left their Country, leaving their wives and children, and went as spiritual Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneths: they said, that a Christian ought not possess any thing as his own, and that it was impossible for any to be both rich and a Christian.</p>
               <p>Who would not wonder to see the foolishness of these poor people! they would carry neither shoes, staff, nor money in their purses, like begging Friers: they consider not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Scripture. The use and practise of the Apostles declare fully, that our Lord said that, to prevent his disciples from being solicitous for things needful for their journey, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should not want, because the labourer is worthy of his hire: this Christ instructed them in, when he said, <hi>When I sent you without purse, without scrip, without shoes, lacked you any thing?</hi>

but that what he had told them in secret, they should preach openly. And as for washing of their feet, he would signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else thereby, but that out of love we should be helpful one unto another: for then they had other kind of shoes then we have now, so as their feet were soiled with travelling, and therefore they rightly washed their feet, which now we have no use of, being shod after another manner. Our Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists who practise this, I would have them to consider, how comely this is: for it may fall out through want of women, that men must wash their feet; which how seemly it would be, let them judge. When Christ saith, we must be as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is not said, We must be Children, and become foolish; but that we should imitate the plainness and integrity which is in little children; and that is it which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth, when he saith, <hi>Be not children in understanding, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, &amp;c.</hi> in understanding be men: and every where in the Scriptures, their wandrings and vagations are condemned; for he saith, <hi>Whosoever taketh not care of his own,</hi>

               <p>As for the community of Goods, whereof they make so much, <hi>Plato</hi> taught it; the <hi>Essenes</hi> had all things common; and this was sometimes practised in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>: but when it is said,<note place="margin">

We would not here let loose the reins to pomp and vanity, but we say, We are not to condemn him, who is clothed according to his Estate, and according to the custom of the Country; yong people &amp; all according to the received custom, Gentlemen according to their ranks, Merchants, and consequently all men of Estate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their qualities. We condemn, with the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> all sumptuousness, and vanities which are unprofitable: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we say, That when Princes and the like carry it magnificently, they are not to be condemned as Pagans; for Christ and his Apostles never gave us Rules for our garments. Let every one hold forth mediocrity, and cut off all superfluity, for the profit of the poor. Meat &amp; drink is not less free to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then garments, wherefore to forbid them, is to hold forth the Doctrine of Devils,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> saith. What hurt can be found therein? when God shall by his blessing give a Christian means, that he may make use of good meat and drink; and the faithful receive it with giving of thanks, without gluttony, but with sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: wherefore should any say, That this gift of God is a curse? Have not the servants of the Lord, praised the Lord for it? as <hi>David</hi> for the Lords filling of his Cup,<note place="margin">

and yet these men would banish all mirth and laughter. All civil mirth is not to be condemned, nay, rather their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical sighings, and their sad and melancholy looks, are to be censured, whereby they would, as more holy, extol them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above other men: the Kingdome of God consists not in these things; the Scripture no where condemneth honest mirth, but every where hypocrisies. In the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Israel held a Feast for fourteen dayes together, because of all the goodness of God vouchsafed to <hi>David</hi> his father. As mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeds from adversity, so joy from prosperity: which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> plainly holds forth, when he saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The joy of our heart is ceased, and our mirth is turned into mourning,</hi> &amp;c. They condemn also the honest banquets at Weddings, as unlawful and evil; and yet we see the Scripture speaketh often of the voice of the Spouse and espoused: we reade it no where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, either in the Old or New Testament. Our Lord was not onely at a Wedding being invited, but wrought there his first Miracle, by turning water into wine: he sate down there, and his Disciples.</p>

               <p>Some account Childrens Baptism so bad, as that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dismembred, and suffer, then to let their Children be baptized. Others suffer it as an Ordinance, which neither hindreth nor profiteth.

                  <hi>John Denk</hi> did not admit of swearing by way of witness. Some hold not the Trinity of persons in one Essence, saying, That the Son only is a person. Some esteem of the Sacrament of the Lords supper as we do; but they preach it up so highly, as that it will be very hard to finde so much as two fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate therein; and therefore some are of opinion not to do it until their death. In some places they banish and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all those, which will heare any Preacher or Minister preach: they speak all the evil of them that may be, calling them Scribes and Pharisees. Others endure that one may hear, see, and read any thing: but in the mean while the manner of Ministers living pleaseth them not.

And many times they break fair housholds by separating the parties, when one of the parties is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, the party which is not excommunicated must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the other party: and their excommunications are for very small matters; yea, when they are married one to another, they make them promise, that if one of them come to be cast out of the Church, that the innocent party shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the nocent; and by this means their marriages are all conditional: when one is thus separated, the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cannot be remarried, if the other party being married be not delivered by the death of his adjoynt: yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls out, that some who have been excommunicated, are received in again, and finde their party married to another;

               <p>They say also, That when a man hath sinned, though he doth repent, that he is to be excommunicated: and then if he doth persevere therein, he shall be received in again. Behold, the fair stir of Satan, how he playeth the game with these men, which follow not the true light of the Gospel. Our Lord be pleased to give eyes to all the World, that they may take heed of these Sects, which make men turn aside from the way of truth. So be it.</p>
