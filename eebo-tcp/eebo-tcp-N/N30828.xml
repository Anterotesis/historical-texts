            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THO' ſo many alarming Warnings, pathetick Exhortations, and ſuitable Directions, have already been given both from the Preſs and Pulpit, by Way of Preparitives to our late publick Day of Humiliation; yet ſhould one, who is leſs than the leaſt of all his Brethren, now that Solemnity is over, preſume to trouble his dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen with a ſhort Addreſs, by Way of Supplement to what hath already been offered, it is to be hoped none will be ſo unkind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>eedleſs, much leſs be ſo ungenerous as to cenſure it as proceeding from the Pride and Naughtineſs of his Heart.—But ſhould this be the Caſe, I ſhall make no other Apology (as I think there needs no other) than that which <hi>David</hi> the youngeſt of the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> made long ago upon a like Occaſion, "Is there not a Cauſe?"</p>
            <p>An inſulting, inraged, and perfidious Enemy is now advancing nearer and nearer to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Borders.—Not content with invading and ravaging our rightful Sovereign King <hi>George'</hi>s Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> our Popiſh Adverſaries have now the Ambition to attempt, at leaſt to threaten, an Invaſion of <hi>England</hi> itſelf; hoping, no doubt, thereby not only to throw us into Confuſion at Home, but alſo to divert us from more effectually defeating their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Deſigns Abroad.—That ſuch a Deſign (however chimerical it may ſeem) is now actually on foot, the Royal Proclamation lately iſſued forth renders it indiſputable.—Which Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, as it plainly beſpeaks his Majeſty's paternal Care, doth at the ſame Time loudly call upon all his faithful and loving Subjects, not only to ſtand upon their Guard, but alſo to exert their utmoſt Efforts, in Dependance on Divine Protection, to prevent and render abortive ſuch an unjuſt and daring Enterprize.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, as a profeſſing, tho' ſinful People, we have lately taken one effectual Step towards bringing about ſuch a ſalutary End.</p>
            <p>In Obedience to a Call from the Throne we have been humbling ourſelves in the moſt public and ſolemn Manner before the moſt High God—And 'tis to be hop'd that the many Tears that were that Day ſhed, and the thouſands and thouſands of Prayers that were then offer'd up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have long ſince been regarded by, and enter'd into the Ears of the Lord of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth—Infidels may perhaps laugh and make themſelves merry with ſuch an Inſinuation: But ſerious People (and to ſuch in a more peculiar Manner is this Addreſs directed) will account it no Ways enthuſiaſtic to affirm that ſolemn Humiliations, whether performed by public Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities in general, or Individuals in particular, have always met with ſuch a Divine Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as to obtain at leaſt a Reprieve from, if not a total Removal of, the threatned Evil.—The deferring of an impending Judgement only upon the hypocritical, but public Humiliation of a wicked <hi>Abe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I have heard, or read ſomewhere of a Turkiſh General, who being call'd to engage with a Chriſtian Army that had broken through the moſt ſolemn Ties, ſtood up at the Head of his Troops, and then drawing out the Treaty which they had broken out of his Boſom, and holding it up in the Air, thus addreſſed the Throne of Heaven:—<q>O Almighty Being, if Thou art, as they ſay Thou art, theſe Chriſtians God, Thou loveſt what is right, and hateſt Perfidy; look down therefore and behold this Treaty which they have broken; and, as thou canſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>avour what is wrong, render their Arms, O God, ſucceſsleſs, and make mine victorious.</q>—He ended—Immediately the Sword was drawn—The two Parties vigorouſly engaged, and the perfidious Chriſtians were beaten off the Field.—Thus may our Proteſtant Generals, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r at leaſt their Chaplains, deal with our Enemy's Forces, in Reſpect to the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi>—They, not we, have broken it.—They, not we, have been the Aggreſſors:—And therefore, notwithſtanding we are looked upon as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and they fight under the Banner of one who ſtiles himſelf <hi>His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty;</hi> a righteous God, we truſt, in Anſwer to Prayer, will humble <hi>France,</hi> and make the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arms both by Sea and Land more than Conquerers thro' his Love.—It is true, (and God knows, with Grief of Heart I ſpeak it) praying is become too unfaſhionable amongſt our People in general, and among our military Men in particular;—but wherein either the Piety, and conſequently true Policy, of ſuch a Procedure conſiſts, I believe will be very difficult to determine.—If we have Recourſe to Mr. <hi>Rollin'</hi>s Ancient Hiſtory, I believe we ſhall find that neither <hi>Darius, Cyrus, Alexander,</hi> or indeed ſcarce any of the <hi>Egyptian, Grecian, Perſian,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, ever undertook any hazardous Enterprize, without making ſome publick Acknowledgement of a Deity.—And if we conſult that Hiſtory of Hiſtories, that too much neglected Book (as Sir <hi>Richard Steel</hi> expreſſes himſelf) emphatically called the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> we may always remark that thoſe heroic Worthies, who by Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens, were Men of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as well as Men of Valour.—And if our Reſearches deſcend forwards down to our own Annals, we ſhall ſoon be ſatisfied, that the
<hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:040870_0005_101AFF6A1F629F48"/>
Britiſh</hi> Arms were never more formidable than when our Soldiers went forth in the Strength of the Lord, and with a Bible in one Hand, and a Sword in the other, chearfully fought under his Banner, who hath condeſcended to ſtile himſelf <hi>a Man of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an Appellation as this, methinks, may ſufficiently juſtify the Lawfulneſs of bearing Arms, and drawing the Sword in Defence of our civil and religious Liberties.—For if God himſelf is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf a Man of War, ſurely in a juſt and righteous Cauſe (ſuch as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> War at preſent is) we may as lawfully draw our Swords, in order to defend ourſelves againſt our common and public Enemy, as a civil Magiſtrate may ſit on a Bench, and condemn a public Robber to Death. Our excellent Reformers, ſenſible of this, in the thirty-ſecond Article of our Church, after having declared <q>that the Laws of the Realm may puniſh Chriſtian Men with Death, for heinous Offences;</q> immediately ſubjoins, <q>that it is lawful for Chriſtian Men, at the Commandment of the Magiſtrate, to wear Weapons and ſerve in the Wars.</q>—And therefore, what Biſhop <hi>Saunderſon</hi> ſays of Study, may be likewiſe ſaid of Fighting: <q>Fighting without Prayer, is Atheiſm, and Prayer without Fighting, is Preſumption.</q>—And I would be the more particular on this Point, becauſe through a fatal Scrupuloſity againſt bearing Arms, even in a defenſive War, his Majeſty hath been, and is not yet out of Danger of loſing that large, extenſive, and that lately moſt flouriſhing Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the very Centre and Garden of all <hi>North-America.</hi>—But whilſt I ſee ſuch very ſcrupulous Perſons graſping at every Degree of worldly Power, and by all the Arts of worldly Policy labouring to monopolize and retain in their own Hands all Parts both of the legiſlative and executive Branches of Civil Government; to ſpeak in the mildeſt Terms, we may honeſtly affirm, that they certainly act a moſt inconſiſtent, and if not prevented here at Home, to Thouſands of their Neighbours, I fear a very fatal Part.—For, ſay what we will to the contrary, if we ſearch to the Bottom of Things, we may ſoon be convinced, that Civil Magiſtracy and defenſive War muſt ſtand or fall together.—Both are built upon the ſame Baſis; and there cannot be ſo much as one ſingle Argument urged to eſtabliſh the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which doth not at the ſame Time corroborate and confirm the other.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me, who profeſs my ſelf a Diſciple and Miniſter of the Prince of Peace, to ſound a Trumpet for War: But when the Trumpet is already ſounded by a perfidious Enemy, and our King, our Country, our civil and religious Liberties are all, as it were, lying at Stake, did we not at ſuch a Seaſon lend our Purſes, our Tongues, our Arms, as well as our Prayers, in Defence of them, ſhould we not juſtly incur that Curſe which an inſpired <hi>Deborah,</hi> when under the immediate Influence of the Holy Spirit, once uttered, <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty?</hi>—Known unto God, and God alone, are all our Hearts.—Daily and repeated Experience convinceth us, that the greateſt Talkers are not always the greateſt Doers.—How therefore any of us may behave when put to the Trial, the Trial itſelf can only prove.—But, for my own Part, whatever my future Conduct may be, (and I know it will be downright cowardly, if left to myſelf) yet upon the matureſt Deliberation, I am at preſent ſo fully convinced of the Juſtice of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Cauſe, that ſuppoſing it ſhould be ſaid of me, as it is of <hi>Zwinglius, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Awful and tremendous are the Judgments that have lately been abroad.—Twice hath the Earth on which this great Metropolis ſtands, unable as it were, any longer to ſuſtain the Weight of its Inhabitants Sins, been made to tremble and totter under us.—Since that, how amazingly hath the Shock been extended!—<hi>Africa</hi> (nor hath <hi>America</hi> itſelf been exempted) hath in a moſt deſtructive Manner felt its dire Effects.—And what a dreadful Conſumption it hath made in various Parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and, in a more eſpecial Manner at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Portugal,</hi> is beyond Conception, and beyond the Power of the moſt maſterly Pen to deſcribe.—It is to be queſtioned, whether the like hath ever been heard of ſince the Deluge.—Surely nothing was wanting to figure out and realize to that diſtreſſed People the Horror of the laſt Day, but the Sound of the Trump, and the actual Appearance of the great Judge of Quick and Dead.—But awful and tremendous as ſuch Phaenomenas of Nature may be; yet, if we conſider the Conſequences of Things, was even the like Judgment (which may God avert) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o befal us, it would be but a ſmall one, in Compariſon of our hearing that a <hi>French</hi> Army, accompanied with a Popiſh Pretender, and Thouſands of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, was ſuffered to invade, ſubdue and deſtroy the Bodies and Subſtance, and, as the neceſſary Conſequences of both theſe, to blind, deceive, and tyrannize over the Souls and Conſciences of the People belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>happy</hi> Iſle.</p>
            <p>God forbid, that I ſhould give flattering Titles to any; for in ſo doing, I ſhould provoke him to take away my Soul.—But ſurely we muſt have Eyes that ſee not, and Ears that hear not, as well as Hearts that do not underſtand, if we do not know, and ſee, and feel, that in reſpect to our civil and religious Liberties, we are undoubtedly the freeſt People under Heaven.—And I dare appeal to the moſt ungrateful and malicious Malecontent, to produce any AEra in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Annals, wherein we have enjoyed ſuch a continued Series of civil and religious Liberty, as we have been favoured with for theſe Twenty-eight Years laſt paſt, under the mild and gentle Adminiſtration of our dread and rightful Sovereign King <hi>George.</hi>—Surely he hath been a Nurſing Father to People of all Denominations; and however he may be denied it, yet he may without a Complement, juſtly claim from the preſent, as well as future Age, the deſerved Title of <hi>GEORGE</hi> THE GREAT.—But notwithſtanding this ſuch is the Degeneracy of Human Nature, it muſt neceſſarily be expected, that in a Nation grown wanton with Liberty like ours, there is a great Multitude of unhappy Perſons, who being Men of lax Principles, looſe Lives, and broken Fortunes, may, and will be ſo abandon'd, as to break through all Reſtraints of Gratitude, Loyalty and Religion, and, like <hi>Cataline</hi> and his wicked Confederates, be fond of joining in any Change of Government, whereby they may entertain the moſt diſtant Proſpect of bettering their Fortunes, and gratifying their Ambition, tho' it be at the Expence of their Country's Blood.—This hath been, and no doubt ſtill continues to be, the Fate of all Civil Governments in the World, and conſequently is no more than what we may expect, in Times of Tumult and Danger, will be acted over again in our own Land by Men of ſuch corrupt Minds.—But how any ſerious and judicious, much leſs religious and devout Perſon, can be ſo ſtupid to all Principles of Self-Intereſt, and ſo dead even to all Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of common Senſe, as to prefer a <hi>French</hi> to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government; or a <hi>Popiſh Pretender,</hi> born, nurſed, and bred up in all the arbitrary and deſtructive Principles of the Court and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the preſent <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion</hi> ſettled in the illuſtrious Line of <hi>Hanover,</hi> muſt be imputed to nothing elſe but an <hi>awful infatuation.</hi>—</p>
