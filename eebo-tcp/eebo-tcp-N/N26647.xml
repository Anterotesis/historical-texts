            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Finally, brethren, farewell: Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>CORINTH was a famous city of Greece; in which the goſpel was introduced and eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtle Paul. There he exerciſed his miniſtry for a year and ſix months at one time, beſides his occaſional viſits afterward. There his miniſtry was attended with great ſucceſs. All this appears, as from other paſſages in the New-Teſtament, ſo particularly from Acts XVIII. 9, 10, 11. <q>Then ſpake the Lord to Paul in the night by a viſion. Be not afraid, but ſpeak, and hold not thy peace. For I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city. And he continued there a year and ſix months, teaching the word of God among them.</q> To this church planted by the apoſtle himſelf, he wrote two epiſtles, of which this from which our text is taken is the laſt. At the cloſe of this epiſtle, he takes his final leave of this church, in the affecting words of the text. As if he had ſaid, And now, brethren, after all my acquaintance with you, which has been mutually ſo agreeable and profitable; after all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours among you, which God has been pleaſed ſo greatly to bleſs; and after my repeated viſits and epiſtles to you; I bid you an affectionate and final farewell. I ardently wiſh you proſperity in every reſpect; and particularly that you may <q>be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and then the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT I propoſe in this diſcourſe, is to conſider the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of this farewell of the Apoſtle, to the Corinthians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HE wiſhes them to be perfect.—We are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand here abſolute, ſinleſs perfection. This is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life. "There is not" even <q>a juſt man upon earth; that doth good and ſinneth not.</q> Eccles. VII. 20. "And who can ſay, I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my ſin:" Prov. XX. 9. "Who can bring a clean thing, out of an unclean? Not one." Job. XIV. 4. But if any man has attained to perfection in this life, he is a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth not: he is pure from his ſin: he is a clean thing brought out of an unclean; in direct contradiction to the ſcriptures juſt quoted.</p>
            <p>IF any perſon ever has attained to perfection, in this life we may ſurely ſuppoſe, that ſome of the Saints mentioned
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035438_0003_1004C87776883480"/>
in ſcripture, were favored with this privilege. Therefore let us ſearch for perfection among the moſt diſtinguiſhed Saints of both the old Teſtament and the new. Noah, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel and Job are in ſcripture mentioned as eminent Saints and as peculiarly beloved of God. Let us attend to them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly. Noah, tho' diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world, in being ſaved from the flood and in being employed as a preacher of righteouſneſs to the old world; and tho in the main he walked with God; yet was overtaken with groſs intemperance, as you cannot but remember.—Job, was indeed an eminently good man, ſo that there was none like him in all the earth, and for a long time he perſevered in his patience, under various moſt diſtreſſing afflictions, brought on him in a rapid ſucceſſion, and for a long time he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in the moſt humble and pious manner, <q>falling down to the ground and worſhipping;</q> ſaying, "naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked ſhall I return.</p>
            <p>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be the name of the Lord:" and when he was inſulted by his own wife, becauſe he ſtill retained his integrity, and refuſed to curſe God and die, he made the following moſt proper and pious anſwer. <q>What? ſhall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and ſhall we not receive evil.</q> Yet to ſhow, that there is no man, upon earth, tho really juſt and upright, who liveth and ſinneth not; Job at laſt had his patience exhauſted, ſo that he "opened his mouth &amp; curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his day."</p>
            <p>WITH regard to Daniel, tho no particular groſs ſin, is in ſcripture recorded concerning him, yet we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that he was more perfect, than the other two ſaints, with whom he is claſſed in ſcripture, as a diſtinguiſhed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite of God.</p>
            <p>ABRAHAM was the father of the faithful, and the friend of God; yet he was not ſinleſs: he fell into polygamy and lived in it for a long time.—As to David, in general a man after God's own heart, you know the great ſins into which he fell.</p>
            <p>MOSES was a diſtinguiſhed ſaint, and the meekeſt of men: yet he tranſgreſſed at the waters of Meribah, ſo that he was ſhut out of the good land. But let us come to the new teſtament.</p>
            <p>THE eleven apoſtles, from their conſtant attendance on the preaching and miracles of our Lord, and from their daily conception and intimate intercourſe with him, were under great advantages for Chriſtian edification. Yet they fell ſhort of perfection. For when the multitudes from the chief
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035438_0004_1004C879457CB960"/>
prieſts and elders, came with ſwords and ſtones, to take Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his diſciples "all forſook him and fled."</p>
            <p>PAUL was the great Apoſtle of the gentiles, was <q>not a whit behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles;</q> was <q>a choſen veſſel to God, to bear his name before the gentiles, &amp; Kings, &amp; the children of Iſrael;</q> and appears to have done more to ſpread the goſpel in the world, than any of the other Apoſtles; yet according to his own teſtimony, he came ſhort of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Phil. III. 12—15. <q>Not as tho' I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, I count not myſelf to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</q> This you ſee is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs confeſſion of his own imperfection. The ſame thing is manifeſt from this, that when the Apoſtle <q>would do good, evil was preſent with him;</q> and that <q>he had a law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of ſin, which was in his member.</q>—This ſurely is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a perfect man.—If it ſhould be ſaid, as it has been ſaid, that the apoſtle is here deſcribing his ſtate before his converſion and not after; I anſwer, that in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and even in the next words he declares, that he <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the law of God, after the inward man; &amp; that with the mind he ſerved the law of God;</q> which no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man does; becauſe <q>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</q> And if it were otherwiſe; if an unconverted man could delight in the law of God, after the inward man, he could and would of courſe delight in God himſelf, &amp; love him ſincerely. And if he could ſerve the law of God; he would of courſe ſerve God himſelf. And what is there more difficult in any part of religion, or more diſtinguiſhing of its truth and genuineneſs, than the ſincere love and ſervice of the law and of God himſelf? Indeed this is the root of all true religion and virtually conſtitutes the whole.</p>
            <p>THUS we have taken a view of the moſt eminent Saints of ſcripture, and find none among them all, who profeſs to have attained to perfection; and concerning moſt of them, we find evident proofs of imperfection. They manifeſtly fell ſhort of ſinleſs perfection.</p>
            <p>IF this be ſo, it may be ſaid; if ſinleſs perfection be not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035438_0005_1004C87BC65E2C38"/>
attainable in this life; what does the apoſtle mean in our text; when he exhorts the Corinthians to be <hi>perfect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ANSWER, he doubtleſs means the ſame as is intended, when it is ſaid of Job, that <q>he was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eſchewed evil.</q> By what has been already obſerved, it appears, that Job was not ſinleſsly perfect, as he <hi>curſed his day.</hi> It muſt mean therefore, that he was a truly good man, a ſincere ſervant of God, a real ſaint.</p>
            <p>IN the ſame ſenſe we are told, <q>All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly finiſhed unto all good works.</q> This means either the ſame ſincerity, to which Job attained, or a perfection of furniture, a being <hi>thoroughly furniſhed</hi> to all good works: and the latter clauſe may be underſtood as explanatory of the former.</p>
            <p>IN this ſenſe the apoſtle Paul, after his expreſs renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfection, as to himſelf; yet aſſumes it to himſelf and ſome of his fellow Chriſtians; as you may ſee in Phil. III. 15. <q>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you:</q> plainly ſhewing, that the apoſtle uſes the word perfection in a very different ſenſe, when he aſſumes it to himſelf, from that in which he had uſed it, when he renounced it.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE when the apoſtle in the text exhorts us to be perfect, he exhorts as to the perfection of Job, to the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſincerity of vital Chriſtianity: he exhorts us to live up to our profeſſion, to live in Character, to be real and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>II. The apoſtle tells the Corinthians, to be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.—Good comfort naturally follows from the perfection before deſcribed. If we be real Chriſtians, humble penitents and cordial believers in Chriſt: If we live in character, and make proper proficiency in our Chriſtian courſe, leading an exemplary life, ſo as to adorn the doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; no doubt we ſhall enjoy comforts.—There is peace and comfort in the very exerciſe of Chriſtian grace. The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be. Therefore ſo long as we are in our native ſtate of depravity, we are in a ſtate of warfare and oppoſition to God. The carnal or native mind of man is oppoſition it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God: and ſuch a temper of mind is directly oppoſed to peace and comfort. Iſai, LVII. 20, 21. <q>The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035438_0006_1004C87E8DA04BE8"/>
caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</q> But no ſooner is the heart changed by divine grace, than inſtead of enmity, reconciliation, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and cordial and ſupreme love to God are introduced and eſtabliſhed in it. Of courſe then it enjoys peace and comfort. Cordial ſubmiſſion and reconciliation are in their very nature placid, peaceful and comfortable.</p>
            <p>AND as peace and comfort are implied in the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the new convert; ſo they increaſe as he increaſes in grace. The very knowledge of God, of his law and of divine truth, affords him delight and comfort, and the more his knowledge is increaſed, the more are his delight and comfort, increaſed. The ſame may be ſaid of his increaſe in humility, ſubmiſſion to God, complacency in him, faith in Chriſt, and every other grace. The very exiſtence of ſanctification in any perſon, and eſpecially as it will produce good fruit both in heart and life, is attended with comfort and happineſs. <q>The ways of wiſdom are, in their own nature, ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES this, ſanctification is the evidence of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in this view is attended with additional comfort. You are not to imagine, my brethren, that you are to obtain evidence of your pardon and juſtification, by any immediate revelation from heaven, by any ſuggeſtion thrown into your mind, that you are pardoned and accepted by God; or by any text of ſcripture brought to your thoughts however ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, unexpectedly &amp; undeſignedly by yourſelves. All ſuch grounds of comfort and belief that you are pardoned, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive. The word of God gives not the leaſt warrant to truſt to ſuch grounds of comfort. Where in all the ſcripture, do you find it ſaid, that they who have an involuntary ſuggeſtion, that they are converted &amp; pardoned, are in reality converted &amp; pardoned. Where do you find it ſaid, He that has a text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unexpectedly coming to his mind, importing that his ſins are forgiven, is really forgiven of God?—The ſcriptural eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of converſion &amp; forgiveneſs, are ſuch as theſe; "He that believeth &amp; is "baptized, ſhall be ſaved;" "repent ye therefore and be "converted, that your ſins may be blotted out;" <q>I love them that love me, &amp; thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me;</q> 
               <q>Hope maketh not aſhamed becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts;</q> 
               <q>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren;</q> 
               <q>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed;</q> 
               <q>Ye are my friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you.</q>—Theſe evidences imply

ſanctification of heart and life: and to depend on any thing elſe, than what implies ſanctification as an evidence of our juſtification, is unwarrantable and deluſive.</p>
            <p>I HAVE inſiſted the more particularly on this, becauſe it has pleaſed the great head of the church graciouſly to viſit you with the effuſions of his holy ſpirit, hopefully to bring ſome of you to the ſaving knowledge of the truth, and to awaken and convince others: and to be informed what is the proper evidence of a real converſion, is at ſuch a time peculiarly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. I wiſh you to apply what I have now ſaid on this ſubject to the faithful and candid trial of yourſelves.</p>
            <p>To be perfect, then in the ſenſe already deſcribed, affords comfort, not only as it implies a placid and peaceful temper of mind toward God, complacency in God &amp;c. but as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords evidence, and the only real evidence, of our acceptance with God, and of our ſure title, by the promiſes of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to the future eternal inheritance of heaven and glory.</p>
            <p>THIS muſt certainly be a great ſource of comfort to every Chriſtian. Thus he enjoys peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. On his part he is at peace with God, as by regeneration, his heart is reconciled to God and ſubjected to his will: and God on his part is at peace with him, as for Chriſts ſake he is reconciled to him, pardons his ſins adopts him and makes him an heir of himſelf.—What a ſource of comfort muſt theſe things be to the real Chriſtian!</p>
            <p>BESIDES, in this way he enjoys peace of conſcience. Juſt ſo far as a man is ſanctified, ſin, the very foundation of the accuſations of an angry conſcience, is prevented or removed: and to be ſure in conſequence of ſanctification, the foundation of accuſing and condemning himſelf as an enemy to God, a rejecter of Chriſt and an unconverted ſinner, is removed: Therefore in the ſame reſpects, he has a foundation to enjoy peace of conſcience and comfort in his own mind.</p>
            <p>NOR is this all: the true Chriſtian is comforted by all the promiſes of the goſpel, that Chriſt will never leave nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any of his real diſciples; that he will be with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that he will ſo defend them that none ſhall be able to pluck them out of his hand; that he will ſupport and protect his church even to the end of the world, ſo that the gates of hell ſhall not be able to prevail againſt it; that he will increaſe and promote true religion in the world; that Satan's kingdom ſhall be over thrown, that Chriſt ſhall generally reign on the earth and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt high God, that the whole earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035438_0008_1004C88214574A68"/>
the Lord as the waters cover the ſeas; and that finally the kingdom of grace, which took its original from heaven, ſhall be tranſplanted to heaven, its native ſoil, and ſhall, there eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally flouriſh in perfect reſt, peace, holineſs, and happineſs, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe conſiderations are replete with comfort to real Chriſtians. No wonder then they are exhorted to be of good comfort. They have reaſon of comfort, under the greateſt afflictions and perſecutions, that ever they are called to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
            <p>III. THE apoſtle exhorts the Corinthians to be of one mind.—This is of great importance in every community, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in every Chriſtian church or ſociety.—They ought to be of one mind in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>I. As to their articles of faith.—Articles of faith, or at beſt articles of infidelity will naturally govern the temper and practice. He who believes there is no God, will not love and worſhip him. He who believes that Chriſt is not the Saviour, will not truſt in him for ſalvation. He who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives not in a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, will not prepare for it. He who believes not the goſpel to be true, will not be anxious to comply with it. He who believes that there is nothing in religion, will not embrace, love and practiſe it. If then any people be not of one mind in theſe reſpects, how can they walk together?</p>
            <p>OR if they differ in things on which the very exiſtence of all religion does not depend; ſtill even this diverſity of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produces diſcord and is very hurtful. For inſtance, if ſome believe the total depravaty of human nature, but others believe that we naturally have ſome good principles in us: If ſome believe the ſovereignty of divine grace, that God has a right to caſt off all men &amp; would do them no injury, if he ſhould make them eternally miſerable; while others believe either that no man deſerves eternal miſery, or that thoſe who are moral &amp; attend on the means of grace, ought not to be finally rejected: If ſome believe the entire and total dependance of man upon God, and his grace; while others think we haven <hi>ſelf-determing power</hi> in our wills, which is entirely ſufficient for repentance and all the exerciſes of religion: If ſome believe the great importance, uſefulneſs and neceſſity of public worſhip on the ſabbath; while others think they can ſpend the ſabbath as profitably at their own homes: If ſome believe the neceſſity and indiſpenſable obligation of a virtuous and pious education of their children while others are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with no ſuch ideas: If ſome believe themſelves bound
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035438_0009_1004C8868329FF60"/>
to ſubmit cheerfully to the expence neceſſary to ſupport both the public worſhip of the ſabbath, and the ſchools neceſſary for the due education of their children, but others grudge every part of this expence: you cannot but ſee, that this diverſity of ſentiment muſt work diſorder and confuſion, and finally, tend to the ruin of any ſociety.</p>
            <p>II. THEY ought to be of one mind in their aims &amp; ends.—What if ſome aim at the glory of God, others at their own glory and applauſe? What if ſome aim at the promotion of true religion and the intereſt of Chriſt, and others, at the promotion of their own intereſt merely? What if ſome are willing to deny themſelves and their own intereſt or applauſe, for the ſake of Chriſt and his cauſe, but others ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſupreme, and make religion itſelf ſubſervient to their private ends? It is manifeſt, that the religious concerns of ſuch a people cannot proceed with ſucceſs. As ſoon as ever religion proves not to be ſubſervient to their applauſe, their ambition or their private ends, a part of them forſake and oppoſe it; they oppoſe therewith, oppoſe Chriſtianity and oppoſe Chriſt himſelf. And how can we expect any good to the cauſe of religion and virtue, in ſuch a courſe of things as this?—This ſhows the neceſſity of being of one mind.</p>
            <p>III. It is equally neceſſary that a people be united in their <hi>meaſures</hi> to ſupport or promote religion—ſuppoſe all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of any community are agreed to aim at the divine glory and the advancement of virtue and piety; yet if they purſue different paths and take different meaſures, to ſecure theſe ends; if one be of Paul, and another of Apollos; if while all are wiſhing to ſettle a miniſter, one chooſe to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this man and another that, and each be fixed in his own meaſures; what can be done in this caſe? The great end will doubtleſs be loſt.</p>
            <p>IN theſe things there muſt be mutual condeſcenſion; and hereby in the caſe now deſcribed there can be condeſcenſion. It is ſuppoſed, that all are ſeeking the ſame end: and when the generality are agreed in the meaſures to ſecure this end; for inſtance the ſettlement of a particular miniſter; and wiſe men in the ſociety and out of it, judge it beſt for the ſociety, that he ſhould be ſettled; hereby in this caſe one or two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals ſhould rather condeſcend and fall in with the wiſhes of the ſociety in general, than that the ſociety ſhould ſubmit to them, or be broken in pieces. Unleſs there be condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſome ſuch caſes, no people can enjoy peace and ſucceſs in their religious concerns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:035438_0010_1004C8880DA940E0"/>
IV. THE apoſtle exhorts the Corinthians to <hi>live in peace.</hi>—Peace follows of courſe from what the apoſtle had before enjoined. There is no danger, that they who agree in the articles of their faith and religious ſentiments, in their aims and ends, and in their meaſures to obtain thoſe ends; will fall into contention concerning religion. And how happy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious peace! How comfortable to the church and ſociety! How comfortable to their miniſter! How favorable to the advancement of the knowledge of the truth, to the love and practice of it! and to the increaſe of true and real religion! On the contrary, how diſagreeable is it to live in contention! How uncomfortable to the church, to the ſociety and to the miniſter! How unfavourable to the increaſe of religious knowledge, virtue and piety! It is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to both morality and piety, and cannot proceed from them, but from the want of them; or rather from that which is directly oppoſed to them. <q>Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even from your luſts which war againſt the ſpirit?</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT however uncomfortable and hurtful contention is, we may expect it, unleſs we be of one mind in the formentioned reſpects. If every one be ſtrenuous for his own peculiar opinions, his own ends and his own meaſures, there can be no peace in any ſociety. And there is great danger of this from various cauſes.—One ſource of danger is the natural liberty and independence of man. As every bleſſing and privilege is capable of abuſe, ſo this is true with regard to perſonal liberty. As men feel themſelves free and in many reſpects independent; ſome are apt to indulge this indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in adopting peculiar opinions, and in purſuing peculiar ends and peculiar meaſures. Some from vanity effect ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. They wiſh to diſtinguiſh themſelves, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it any other way ſo eaſily as by ſetting up for peculiar opinions, ends or meaſures. Thus they effect to ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer than other men—The head of a party is always diſtinguiſhed, and to be in ſuch a ſituation is flattering to human vanity. From this motive ſome put themſelves at the head of a party however erroneous: and to gratify their ambition, they will rend the ſociety to which they belong, in pieces, and deſtroy all peace, all order, and all good.</p>
            <p>V. On certain conditions, the apoſtle promiſes the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that the God of love and peace would be with them. The conditions are, that they be perfect, of good comfort, of one mind, and that they live in peace.—And if we comply with theſe conditions, God will be with us in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035438_0011_1004C88A8FA562E8"/>
I. He will be with us by the preſence of his grace in our hearts. All who comply with thoſe conditions, are truly gracious perſons, are the ſubject of divine grace communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſanctification, by the holy ſpirit of God, and God by his grace and Holy Spirit habitually dwells in them. In this reſpect he never leaves them nor forſakes them, but is with them to the end of their lives.</p>
            <p>II. If we comply with the forementioned conditions, God will be with us, in the way of divine conſolation. This is the natural conſequence of the former particular. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in what has been already ſaid, that divine grace is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting in its very nature, as it implies love to God, to the law of God, and to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as it implies faith, truth and hope in Chriſt, and as it implies love to mankind; all which are agreeable, pleaſant and comforting emotions; That it is comforting, as it implies the ſubduing of native de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, which is ever turbulent and oppoſed to peace and comfort; and as it gives evidence of future grace and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port here, and of eternal glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>III. ON the ſame conditions God will be with us in the way of protection. He will keep us even as the apple of his eye: he will never leave us nor forſake us, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us up into the hands of our ſpiritual foes, who ſeek our ruin. As he really is, ſo he will act as the captain of our ſalvation, and afford us the moſt effectual aid, in times of need. Nay, he will make all things to work together for our good; for this is his expreſs promiſe to them that love God. And tho' we may fall into various temporal evils, from theſe we ſhall be recovered, and thoſe evils themſelves ſhall be made to work together for our good.</p>
            <p>IV. GOD will be with us to build us up in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <q>The path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</q> We need the ſame communications of grace to build us up in holineſs, as in the firſt inſtance to regenerate our hearts: and this we ſhall receive on the conditions ſpecified in the text.</p>
            <p>V. GOD will be with us, to prepare us for glory and to receive us to it. He will never ſuffer any who are once the ſubjects of grace, to fail of glory. <q>Whom he did fore know, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; &amp; whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</q> 
               <q>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or fraud?
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035438_0012_1004C88D3305DFD8"/>
Nay in all theſe things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am perſuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, not height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL now apply theſe general obſervations to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion.—For ſeveral years paſt, I have been with you labouring in the miniſtry, endeavouring to inſtruct you in the great and moſt important doctrines of the goſpel, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the duties, to excite you to the practice of it, and to warn you againſt every error, ſin and vice. My connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you has been peaceful, agreeable, &amp; of late I hope ſucceſsful. I expected to continue &amp; ſpend the reſt of my days with you. And as the propoſal of my leaving you was no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my ſeeking; ſo it has been attended with great anxiety concerning my duty. As the beſt expedient in the caſe, and the moſt likely means of obtaining light as to my duty, the whole queſtion concerning my removal has, as you well know, been ſubmitted to a council mutually agreeable to us both. You know the reſult of the council; it was their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous opinion, that it was my duty to accept the call, which invites me to leave you, and your duty to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>HAD they decided, that I ought to continue with you, I ſhould have complied with their deciſion, in a conviction, that in that caſe I ſhould enjoy for more eaſe; more leiſure, more retirement and more opportunity to proſecute my favourite ſtudy of theology, to indulge many agreeable propenſities and to enjoy many of my moſt agreeable friends, whoſe ſociety muſt be loſt by my removal. And now that they have decided it to be my duty to accept a call to a diſtant place, I feel myſelf obligated to comply with their deciſion, tho' with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to leaving this dear people, eſpecially at the preſent juncture, at which it has pleaſed the great head of the church to afford his influences among us; and in the proſpect of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, anxiety, reſponſibility and perhaps difficulty, in the undertaking to which I am invited. Yet ſince it is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per judges decided to be my duty, I ſhall take upon me this arduous ſervice, and diſcharge the obligations of it, according to my beſt ability, looking to God to aſſiſt and ſupport me.</p>
            <p>SINCE we muſt part, what is more proper, than we part as Paul, and the Corinthians did? After the example of the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, I do certainly moſt ardently wiſh you to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind and to live in peace; and that you may be animated ſo
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035438_0013_1004C890A823E8D0"/>
to do, by the motive, that then the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</p>
            <p>You have heard what has been ſaid concerning the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of unanimity and peace among yourſelves. And I dare ſay you realize it. Formerly, you experienced the ill effects of diſſentions. Let this your experience warn and guard you againſt every thing of the like kind in future. <q>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering your affliction and your miſery, the worm wood and the gall; let your ſoul ſtill have them in remembrance, and be humbled in you.</q> Let me beſeech you to withſtand the beginning of diſſention. It is <q>like the letting out of water; once let out, it is hard to be ſtopped again, and the longer it runs, the deeper and wider channel it wears, Therefore leave off contention before it is meddled with.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR union among yourſelves, as well as your kind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me, ſince I have been connected with you, has been a ſource of happineſs to me. I ſhall always remember you with affection, gratitude and kindeſt benevolence. It is a moſt happy circumſtance, that ſince we muſt part, we part not only with peace, but with entire mutual friendſhip. This is a ſingular caſe of the diſmiſſion of a miniſter from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That you have acted in this whole affair with ſo much candour, with ſo many and ſo unequivocal teſtimonies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to me, and regard to the council which has diſſolved our connection, has been often noticed to your honor. I hope the mutual friendſhip, which has uninterruptedly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between us, will ever continue, and that we ſhall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely remember each other in our prayers.</p>
            <p>As your miniſter is now about to leave you, I ſincerely pray and hope that in due time God will ſend you a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghoſt; and that under his faithful miniſtry much people may be added unto the Lord. And as it has pleaſed God lately to viſit you with the influences of his Holy ſpirit, to the revival of true religion among you; I preſume you will not be contented to live long, without ſo important a bleſſing, as a Chriſtian miniſter. If you have taſted, that the Lord is gracious, you will not be willing to live without the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel and ſtated worſhip on the ſabbath. As new born babes you will deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</p>
            <p>I HOPE, Brethren, that in ſettling a miniſter, you will be attentive to two things, that he be found in the faith, &amp; that as far as you can judge, he be a man of true piety. If he be not found in the faith, he will lead you &amp; your children into
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035438_0014_1004C89231E963B8"/>
error and falſe religion: and this error and falſe religion will naturally deſcend to future generations, and may prove fatal to thouſands.—And if he be not a man of true piety, with what ſincerity can he act in any part of his miniſtry? As he will not be friendly to Chriſt or his cauſe, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the truth, nor heartily engage to promote it. If he do not directly oppoſe true religion, which is the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſuppoſition; ſtill being a blind leader of the blind, he &amp; his hearers will likely both fall into the ditch.</p>
            <p>BUT if you ſhall ſettle a good and faithful miniſter, you will, ſo far as you yourſelves are rightly diſpoſed, rejoice in him and in his miniſtrations; you will have peace and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified in the moſt holy faith; and you will have reaſon to hope, that God will bleſs his labours among you, and extend the good effects of ſuch a miniſtry to generations yet unborn.</p>
            <p>How happy will you be under ſuch a miniſter! How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will all your friends be on your behalf! And how happy ſhall I be, to hear of your proſperity!</p>
            <p>AND now, Brethren, I am to take my leave of you. When Paul took leave of the elders of the church of Ephaſus, <q>they all wept ſore, and fell on Pauls neck and kiſſed him, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing moſt of all for the words, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſpake, that <hi>they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi>
               </q> How it may be with us, brethren, whether we may ever be permitted to ſee each others face again in this world, God only knows. Therefore <q>final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, brethren, farewell.</q> It is my hearts deſire and prayer for you, that you may proſper in all your real intereſts; that you may proſper in your ſeveral lawful ſecular concerns; that you may proſper as a ſociety, increaſing in numbers, wealth and reputation, and be regarded as a truly reſpectable people, by all around you.—That you may be proſpered as a church, eſtabliſhed in the faith and order of the goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving "daily additions of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved."—And that you may proſper as individuals that every careleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner among you may be thoroughly awakened and convinced; that every unregenerate ſinner may be renewed by divine grace: and that every real Chriſtian may <q>grow in grace &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</q>—In one word, that your ſouls may be in health and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per".</p>
            <p>To this end, let me beſeech you all to improve the preſent favourable opportunity. Now God is ſhedding down his kind influences among you, to the awakening and conviction of many and the hopeful converſion of ſome. Now then is an happy opportunity to obtain the grace of God. <q>Now
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035438_0015_1004C893C6536A50"/>
is the accepted time; now is the day of ſalvation.</q> Should any of you live through ſuch a time as this, and reſiſt the peculiar and ſtrong motives, which are now exhibited, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reconciled to God; it is not likely, that the weaker mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ordinary times will have much effect upon you. But you are in the hands of a ſovereign God, to whom you have forfeited every bleſſing, and who therefore has a right to have mercy upon you, or to leave you to periſh in your ſins. You are dependent on his ſovereign grace. Own this your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and expect help from no other ſource. Accept the offered grace of God, and loſe not that infinite bleſſing, by neglect or delay.</p>
            <p>
               <q>TAKE heed to yourſelves, and to all the flock, which God hath purchaſed with his own blood.</q> Take heed, <q>that after my departing grievous wolves do not enter in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, not ſparing the flock; and that of your own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men do not ariſe, ſpeaking preverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them.</q>—<q>Brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them, which are ſanctified.</q> May the God of love and peace be with and bleſs both you and me reſpectively; may he watch over, protect and proſper us in our ſeveral lawful ways; and may he eſpecially repleniſh our hearts with his grace &amp; love. And when we ſhall have ſerved our generation according to his will; may we meet with joy and mutual congratulation before our common judge, be acquitted and accepted by him, and ſo may we be forever with the Lord.</p>
