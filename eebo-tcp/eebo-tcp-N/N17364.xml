            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I JOSEPH MOUNTAIN, was born on the 7th day of July, A. D. 1758, in the houſe of Samuel Mifflin, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> of Philadelphia, father of the preſent Governor of Pennſylvania. My father, Fling Mountain, is a Molat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and now lives at Philadelphia. My mother is a Negro and was a ſlave till ſhe was twenty-one years of age.—She now lives at Reading, in Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſeventeen years of my life were ſpent in Mr. Mifflin's family.—As a ſervant in the houſe I acquired the reputation of unuſual ſprightineſs and activity. My maſter was induſtrious to inſtruct me in the Preſbyterian religion which he profeſſed, teach me to read and write, and impreſs my mind with ſentiments of virtue.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for me, a ſcene began to open which will cloſe only in the ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p>One day, at an ale-houſe in London, I accidentally became acquainted with one Francis Hyde, originally from Middleſex, and one Thomas Wilſon, of Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in England. They were travelling the country, with a hand organ and various other muſical inſtruments, pretending to great art in numerous performance, and

Our landlord, who kept tavern at the ſign of the black horſe, at Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-croſs, furniſhed us with every requiſite for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> demanded of the paſſengers their money. There were four gentlemen and one lady in the coach. They denied having any money. Wilſon ſaid, "Deliver, or death." They then gave us a bank note of 50I. one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of 20l. and about 60 guineas in caſh. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to an unfrequented place, ſhifted our dreſſes, and prepared to proſecute our journey to Chatham in the county of Kent.</p>
            <p>In the day time, Hyde and Wilſon commonly played upon their inſtruments, and performed various ſeats of ſlight of hand, as tho' that was their ſole occupation. We were alſo very particular in making obſervations upon

all travellers, to learn if they might be <hi>touched</hi>; (for that was our word for <hi>robbed.</hi>)</p>
            <p>In four days after the former robbery, we met a Capt. Hill at the foot of Rocheſter bridge near Chatham—He was a captain of the marines, and we had ſeen him in the day time at Brumpton barracks, about half a mile from the bridge. We walked directly before his horſe. Wilſon aſked him the time of night. He made no reply. Hyde then caught the bridle. I, his left hand, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſented a piſtol to his breaſt, and ſaid, "Deliver, or death." He aſſured us that he had no money worth taking. Wilſon ſaid, "then give us your watch," which he did. The watch was gold, and valued at 50 guineas. We then walked off about 300 rods towards Graves-end, immediately tacked for Rocheſter, where we lodged at the mariner's inn. There was a great <hi>hue and cry</hi> for us; but the purſuers, ſuppoſing from Capt. Hill's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we had gone for Graves-end, entirely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took our rout. The next morning we took poſt-chaiſe for London, where we arrived about 6 o'clock in the evening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

There were alſo other brokers in different parts of England, with whom we had conſtant communication, and who were perfectly acquainted with our modes of acquiring property. After ſuch a jaunt we thought it adviſeable to recruit ourſelves by rioting on our ſpoils.</p>
            <p>In a few days, it was concluded that I ſhould go alone, and attempt to "touch" ſome gentlemen who frequented the plays at Covent Garden; this, conſidering my age and inexperience, was thought rather a bold ſtroke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing villain enough to attempt any thing, I did not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but poſted myſelf agreeably to direction. My ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, however, were wholly unſucceſful, and I returned empty. The next night I was placed at London bridge, while Hyde ſtood at Black-fryars, and Wilſon at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter.

At half paſt 11 o'clock I met a Captain Duffield, and aſked him the time of night. He told me. I ſaid, "You know my profeſſion; deliver or death."

men, who had aſſaulted Lord Garnick about 15 minutes before our engagement, one of whom was badly wounded. The next day we ſaw an advertiſement offering a reward of 60 guineas for the detection of the robbers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, that it was ſuppoſed three were killed. This ſpecimen of the enterprize of my new aſſociates convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that they were not adepts in their <hi>occupation,</hi> and induced me to quit their ſociety.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs which now ſeemed moſt alluring to me, was that of <hi>highway-men.</hi> Conſidering myſelf at the head of foot-pads, I aſpired for a more <hi>honorable</hi> employment and therefore determined to join myſelf to the gang of highway men, whoſe rendezvous were at Broad St. Giles's, up Holborne, at the ſign of the Hampſhire hog, and kept by a William Harriſon, a native of the Iſle of Man, Harriſon was the ſupport, the protector and the landlord of this whole company. The horſes and accoutrements were kept and furniſhed by him, and occaſionally ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adventurers. He enquired my name, and finding that I was Mountain who was conſederate with Hyde and Wilſon, he readily admitted me to the fraternity. He aſked if I dared take a jaunt alone; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> willing for any thing, he quickly furniſhed me with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipments proper for the expedition. Mounted on a very fleet horſe, and prepared with proper changes of dreſs, I ſat out for Coventry, about 90 miles from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I made great diſpatch in travelling, and about 10 o'clock the night after my departure, I met Richard Watts coming out of a lane about two miles from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry. I rode up to him, and enquired if he was not afraid of highway-men? He replied, "No, I have no property of value about me." I then told him that I was a man of the profeſſion, and that he muſt deliver or abide the conſequences. Upon this he gave me his gold watch: I inſiſted on his money, and cocked my piſtol, threatening him with inſtant death. He perceived that reſiſtance and perſuaſion were equally unavailing, and threw me his purſe containing 13 half guineas and some

pocket-pieces. The gold watch was valued at 40 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I then ordered him back down the lane, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished him thither, and ſled with the greateſt haſte into adjacent wood: Here I ſhifted my own and horſe's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, leaving them in a bye place, rode directly to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring town, and there put up for the night. Thence I took my courſe for Newcaſtle in Devonſhire, about 276 miles north of London, and thence to Warrington in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterſhire. Here about 7 o'clock in the evening I met with a gentleman who appeared an object of plunder. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To compleat the iniquity, and exhibit the extent of my villainy, I then took a prayer-book from my pocket, and ordered him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To inſult him in his diſtreſs, after committing the fact, I pulled off my hat, made a low bow, wiſhed him good night, and ſat out for Lancaſter in company with the ſage. It occurred to me, that riding as a guard to the ſage would ſecure me againſt ſuſpicion. Accordingly I accompanied it to Lancaſter, and there put up at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>wan and two necks." Here I continued three days, waiting a favourable opportunity to exerciſe my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the third evening at 8 o'clock, I ſtopped a Col.

Pritchard, took from him a gold watch valued at 44 guineas, a purſe of 30 guineas, 3 gold rings, and a pair of gold knee-buckles worth about 6l. The knee-buckles appeared ſo tempting, I told Pritchard, I could not avoid taking them. At 11 o'clock I left Lancaſter, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rode about one mile from town, I ſtopped, pulled off my hat, and bid them "good-bye."</p>
            <p>My courſe was now for Mancheſter, where I put up for about 24 hours at the "bull's-head." The evening following, about 11 miles from Mancheſter, I "touched" a Quaker. It was nearly 9 o'clock when I met him. I enquired if he was not afraid to ride alone. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No. I aſked him his religion; he replied "I am a Friend." I obſerved, "You are the very man I was looking for—you muſt deliver your money." He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very unwilling, and ſaid, "Thou art very hard with me." I replied, "You muſt not <hi>thou</hi> me." He then gave me his plain gold watch, 6 guineas, and four bank notes of 20l. each. I then preſented a prayer-book, and demanded an oath that he would make no diſcovery in 8 hours: He refuſed an oath, alledging that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his religion, but gave his word that my request ſhould be complied with. I then diſmiſſed him, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bank notes, and took a circuitous rout for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. The guineas which I had obtained in this jaunt, I concealed and carried in the ſoles of my boots, which were calculated for that purpoſe, and effetually anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The mare which I rode was trained for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſhe would put her head in at a coach window with the utmoſt eaſe, and ſtand like a ſtock againſt any thing. She would travel alſo with ſurprizing ſpeed. Upon my arrival at Harriſon's, (having been gone eleven days) I gave a faithful narrative of my tranſactions, and produced the plunder as undeniable proof. I never ſhall forget with what joy I was received. The houſe rang with the praiſes of Mountain. An elegant ſupper was provided, and he placed at the head of the table. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the darkneſs of his complexion, he was complimented

            <p>Fatigued with ſuch a jaunt, and fearing left too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent adventures might expoſe me, I determined on tarrying a while at home. My horſe was given to another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He was inadequate to the buſineſſ, and was therefore ordered to tarry at home, juſt to viſit the play-houſes, &amp; <hi>ſharp it</hi> among people who might eaſily be chouſed of their property. Each took his tour of duty in courſe; ſome ſucceeded; others, from misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or want of ſpirit, were diſgraced. One young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the party was about this time detected at Guilford <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A plan was now in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation to diſpatch two or three of the gang to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, to attack ſome of the navy officers: It was finally adopted, and one Billy Coats, a Londoner, and Mountain are ſelected as the moſt ſuitable for the expedition.

practiſing every ſpecies of impoſition which ingenuity could invent, or the moſt depraved heart execute.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of June 1780, I joined the mob head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lord George Gordon. This mob was the reſult of a diſpute between the Papiſts and Proteſtants. It was a matter of the moſt ſovereign indifference to me whether the rebellion was juſt or unjuſt: I eagerly joined the ſport, I rejoicing that an opportunity preſented whereby I might obtain conſiderable plunder in the general confuſion.—Lord Gordon repreſented to us in a ſpeech of ſome length, the open attempts upon the Proteſtant religion, and the manner in which the petitions of the injured had been treated by parliament. He exhorted us all to follow him to the houſe of commons, and protect him while he ſhould preſent, with his own hand, the parchment roll, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of thoſe who had ſigned the petition, to the amount of about 120,000 proteſtants. His ſpeech was anſwered with loud huzzas, and repeated aſſurances of our zeal to ſupport him and his cauſe. The whole body of us, in number about 50,000, left St. George's fields, and marched directly for the parliament houſe: We were in four ſeparate diviſions. A moſt tremendous ſhout was heard from all quarters, upon our arrival before both houſes. Lord Gordon moved that he might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the petition; but the houſe would not conſent that it ſhould be then taken up. The mob became greatly inflamed: they inſulted ſeveral members of the houſe of lords, who narrowly eſcaped with their lives. Several gentlemen of parliament reprobated the conduct of Lord George in the ſevereſt terms; and Col. Gordon, a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Lordſhip, threatened him with inſtant death the moment any of the rioters ſhould enter the houſe. At length, when the queſtion was put in the houſe of commons, in defiance of the menaces of the mob, only ſix out of two hundred voted for the petition. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oters now diſperſed themſelves into various parts of the city, deſtroying and burning the chapels of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics and their houſes. The five ſucceeding days were
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022441_0013_0FB8767EC9684788"/>
employed in demoliſhing the houſes of Sir George Saville, in burning Newgate, and relieving about 300 perſons confined in it, (ſome under ſentence of death) in ſetting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The bank was twice aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but was too well guarded for our attempts. On the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th day we were over-powered by ſuperior force, and obliged to diſperſe. During this confuſion, I provided for myself, by plundering, at various times, about 500l. ſterling.</p>
            <p>After leading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, an incident occurred which cauſed me, for ſome time, to abandon my former purſuit, and ſettle down in tolerable regularity. I became acquainted with a Miſs Nancy Allingame, a white girl of about 18 years of age. She was poſſeſſed of about 500l. in perſonal property and a houſe at Iſlington.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will pleaſe to recollect, that Negroes are conſidered in a different point of light in England, from what they are in America: The blacks have far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Her other and friends remonſtrated againſt this connexion; but ſhe quitted them all, and united herſelf to me. My whole reſidence with her was about three years; during which time I exhauſted all the property which came into my poſſeſſion by the marriage. We then ſeparated, and ſhe was received by her father.</p>
            <p>In June 1782 a, having joined Hyde and Wilſon, we determined to quit England, and ſee if the French gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen could bear "touching." We accordingly croſſed Dover, and at Dunkirk about 7 o'clock in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbed a gentleman of about 200 French crowns. We then proceeded to Paris by the way of Breſt. On the ſecond evening after our arrival in this city, we robbed Count Dillon, on his return from the plays, of a gold
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022441_0014_0FB876822B151938"/>
watch and 12 French guineas. The next day, about I o'clock in the afternoon, we attacked Governor Du Boyer, at his country ſeat about four miles from Paris, and took from him about 200l. in bank bills. Hyde and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon performed this, while I lay about 250 yards diſtant.</p>
            <p>Diſpatch ia travelling, after ſuch bold adventures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very neceſſary. We immediately quitted Paris, and rode all night for Havre-de-Grace, where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the evening of the next day. Here we found an advertiſement, which prevented our changing the notes, and induced us to burn them.</p>
            <p>Bayonne was the next object of our purſuit. At this place Hyde robbed two gentlemen in one night; Wilſon one, and Mountain one—the whole of that evening's plunder amounted to about 500l, ſterling. France now became dangerous, and therefore we puſhed with all poſ-ſible expedition for Spain, and arrived at Madrid, the capital, in a few days. The regulations of this city were ſuch, that we were obliged to quit the object of our purſuit. The city was ſtrongly walled in, and moſt ſcurpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly guarded. The gates were ſhut every evening at 8 o'clock, and every man compelled to be in his own habitation. After ſpending ſeveral months in rioting on our booty, we went to Gibraltar. We bribed the Spaniſh centinel, and entered the Britiſh lines. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Engliſh commander, General Elliott, and informed him we were Engliſhmen, and mechanics by profeſſion. The fleet commanded by Lord Howe, arrived there on the fourth day after us. Gen. Elliott conſented that we ſhould enter on board the fleet as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Accordingly I joined myſelf to the Magnificent of 74 guns, commanded by Capt. John Elverſton; Hyde entered the Victory, Lord Howe; and Wilſon a 74 gun ſhip, whoſe name I do not recollect. This was in the fall of the year 1782. I never ſaw Hyde and Wilſon again till ſince the peace took place between England and the United States. I tarried on board the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent about three months, during which time we had an
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022441_0015_0FB8768348E0B480"/>
engagement with the French and Spaniſh fleets. We drove them out of the Straits, ſunk their junk ſhips with hot ſhot, and captured the St. Michael, a Spaniſh ſhip of 74 guns. The Magnificent ſailed with the fleet for Spithead, where, direcly after my arrival, I made my eſcape from her by bribing the centinel with 5 guineas, &amp; ſwimming three quarters of a mile to the Iſle of Wight. From this place I went to London by the way of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. The landlord at the old place of reſort receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very cordially.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of robbing again ſolicited by attention, and in the fall of the year 1783, as I was walking in Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, in queſt of plunder, I accidentally fell in company with my old companions, Hyde and Wilſon. They had remained in the ſea ſervice ever ſince we left Gibraltar. We concluded it adviſeable to join ourſelves to the gang at Harriſon's, and reſume our occupations. Holland now appeared an object worth attention. In November 1783, we went to Oſtend, and thence to Amſterdam, On the road thro' Holland, we knocked an old Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man down, and took from him 1100 guilders. The next day about 4 o'clock in the morning, Hyde attacked a merchant, and obtained about 100 guilders; and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening following, we robbed four gentlemen of about 150l. ſterling, and three ſilver watches of ſmall value, we continued living very freely at Amſterdam 4 weeks, without effecting any thing: during which period we were preparing to aſſail a bank. At length, by the help of various inſtruments, we entered it about I o'clock at night. We found an iron cheſt which we could not open. We brought away two bags of gold, containing about 1100l. ſterling. We buried them about 2 miles diſtant, and ſuffered them to remain there two months. The noiſe, relative to the robbery having by this time ſubſided, we took our money, entered on board a veſſel bound for England, and were ſafely back in London in the ſpring of the year 1784. To inveſt our caſh, &amp;c. in real property, and quit a courſe of life attended with ſo
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022441_0016_0FB876870921B138"/>
much fatigue and hazard, was thought the moſt eligible plan. In purſuance of this idea, Hyde bought him an houſe and lot about 4 miles from London. My ſhare was joined with Hyde's. Wilſon purchaſed him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The rioters who were concerned in Lord Gordon's rebellion were now daily arreſted, tried and executed. Knowing myſelf deeply concerned in this mob, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it probable that Mountain's turn might come next. I quitted London, went on board an European veſſel, and made a voyage to Grenada. From this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod till Auguſt 1789, I was employed as a ſailor; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time I made two voyages to the Coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, and brought cargoes of Negroes to Jamaica; one voyage to Greenland; one to Leghorn and Venice; three to Philadelphia, and one to St. Kitts. Upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from voyages, I frequently went from Liverpool to London, and put up at Hyde's or Wilſon's. In Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1786, we committed a burglary upon the houſe of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold, who then reſided in London. We cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his houſe about 2 o'clock at night, with a dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>In the month of Auguſt 1789, I left New-York in the Briton, with a cargo of bread and flour owned by Mr. John Murray, jun. of New-York, and went to Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa in Spain. The veſſel proved leaky, and was ſold. Being diſcharged, I entered on board the brig Aunt, commanded by Capt. Thomas Moſeley, and owned by William Gray, of Boſton, failed from Bilboa the 7th day of March, and arrived in Boſton the 2d of May laſt. On the 14th of the ſame month I quitted Boſton on foot for New-York. On my journey, at East-Hartford, I ſtole five dollars from the cabin of a ſloop lying in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river.

There was every indulgence granted me which I could have wiſhed; and the court, jurors and ſpectators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very differently from thoſe I have ſeen at Old-Bailey. The jury had little heſitation; indeed the moſt compaſſionate hearer of this cauſe could have only pronounced me <hi>Guilty.</hi> I beheld with aſtoniſhment the lenity of the Court, and am ſure that in a country where ſuch a ſacred regard is had to the liberty of the ſubject, no man's life can be unjuſtly taken from him. On the Tueſday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Chief Juſtice pronounced Sentence of Death againſt me. I thought myſelf leſs moved with this pathetic addreſs than either of the court, or any ſpectator; and yet, I confeſs, I was more affected by it, than by any thing which had previouſly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in my life. On the next Sabbath I attended

meeting. The addreſs of the Rev. Dr. Dana on that day and the ſubſequent advice and admonitions which I have received from the Clergy of this and other places, were calculated to awaken every feeling of my heart. Much gratitude is due from me to thoſe gentlemen who have exhibited ſuch a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for my immortal intereſt.</p>
            <p>It now remains that I <hi>die</hi> a death juſtly merited by my crimes. "The cries of injured innocence have entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and called for vengeance." If the reader of this ſtory can acquieſce in my fate and view me "ſtumbling on the dark mountains of the ſhadow of death," with compoſure, he will yet compaſſionate a ſoul ſtained with the fouleſt crimes, juſt about to appear unimbodied before a God of infinite purity.</p>

            <p>THE writer of the foregoing narrative aſſures the public, that the facts related were taken from the mouth of the culprit. In no inſtance has any fact been ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally altered, or <hi>in the leaſt</hi> exaggerated.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of September the writer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to learn if he perſiſted in affirming the truth of the foregoing ſtory. By the direction of the criminal his name was then ſet to this hiſtory, and he declared, in preſence of the ſubſcribing witneſſes, that it contained nothing but the truth.</p>
