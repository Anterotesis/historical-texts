         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the great Utility of thoſe medical Directions, with which the following Treatiſe is thoroughly repleniſhed, will be ſufficiently evident to every plain and ſenſible Peruſer of it; and its extraordinary Reception on the Continent is recited in the very worthy Author's Preface; yet ſomething, it ſhould ſeem, may be pertinently added, with regard to this Tranſlation of it, by a Perſon who has been ſtrictly attentive to the Original: a Work, whoſe Purpoſe was truly neceſſary and benevolent; as the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in general, is very happily accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>It will be ſelf-evident, I apprehend, to every diſcerning Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that a radical knowledge of the Principles, and much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Exerciſe of their Profeſſion, were neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate ſuch a Work to the Comprehenſion of thoſe, for whom it was more particularly calculated. Such Gentlemen muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the certain Axiom of <hi>Nature's curing Diſeaſes,</hi> which is equally true in our Day, as it was in that of HIPPOCRATES, ſo habitually animates this Treatiſe, as not to require the leaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reference. This <hi>Hippocratic</hi> Truth as certain (though much leſs ſubject to general Obſervation) as that Diſeaſe, or Age, is finally prevalent over all ſublunary Life, the moſt attentive Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians diſcern the ſooneſt, the moſt ingenuous readily confeſs: and hence ſpring that wholeſome Zeal and Severity, with which Dr. TISSOT encounters ſuch Prejudices of poor illiterate Perſons, as either oppoſe, or very ignorantly precipitate, her Operations, in her Attainment of Health. Theſe Prejudices indeed may ſeem, from his Work, to be ſtill more numerous, and perhaps groſſer too, in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> than among ourſelves; though it is certain there is but too much Room for the Application of his ſalutary Cautions and Directions, even in this Capital; and doubtleſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more at a great Diſtance from it. It may be very juſtly ſuppoſed, for <hi>one</hi> Inſtance, that in moſt of thoſe Caſes in the ſmall Pocks, in which the Mother undertakes the Cure of her Child, or confides it to a Nurſe, that Saffron, in a greater or leſs Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and Sack or Mountain Whey, are generally ſtill uſed in the Sickening before Eruption; to accelerate that very Eruption, whoſe gradual Appearance, about the fourth Day, from that of Seizure incluſive, is ſo favourable and promiſing to the Patient; and the Precipitation of which is often ſo highly pernicious. Moſt of, or rather all, his other Cautions and Corrections ſeem equally neceſſary here, as often as the Sick are ſimilarly circumſtanced, under the different acute Diſeaſes in which he enjoins them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012243_0003_0F8A37A8E3BC50C0"/>Without the leaſt Detraction however from our excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, it may be admitted that a few others, in different Countries, might have ſufficient Abilities and Experience for the Production of a like Work, on the ſame good Plan. This, we find Dr. HIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZEL, principal Phyſician of <hi>Zurich,</hi> had in Meditation, when the preſent Treatiſe appeared, which he thought had ſo thoroughly fulfilled his own Intention, that it prevented his attempting to execute it. But the great Difficulty conſiſted in diſcovering a Phyſician, who, with equal Abilities, Reputation and Practice, ſhould be qualified with that <hi>much rarer</hi> Qualification, of caring ſo much more for the Health of thoſe, who could never pay him for it, than for his own Profit or Eaſe, as to determine him to project and to accompliſh ſo neceſſary, and yet ſo ſelf-denying a Work. For as the Simplicity he propoſed in the Style and Manner of it, (by condeſcending, in the plaineſt Terms, to the humbleſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities) obliged him to depreſs himſelf, by writing rather beneath the former Treatiſes, which had acquired him the Reputation of medical Erudition, Reaſoning and Elegance; we find that the Love of Fame itſelf, ſo ſtimulating even to many ingenuous Minds, was as impotent as that of Wealth, to ſeduce him from ſo benign, ſo generous a Purpoſe. Though, upon Reflection, it is by no Means ſtrange to ſee wiſe Men found their Happineſs, which all [however variouſly and even oppoſitely] purſue, rather in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than on Applauſe: and this naturally reminds us of that celebrated Expreſſion of CATO, or ſome other excellent Antient, "that he had rather <hi>be</hi> good, than <hi>be reputed</hi> ſo."</p>
            <p>However ſingular ſuch a Determination may now appear, the number of reputable medical Tranſlators into different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which this original Work has employed on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, makes it evident that real Merit will, ſooner or later, have a pretty general Influence; and induce many to imitate that Example, which they either could not, or did not, propoſe. As the truly modeſt Author has profeſſedly diſclaimed all Applauſe on the Performance, and contented himſelf with hoping an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Cenſure, through his Reader's Reflection on the peculiar Circumſtances and Addreſs of it; well may his beſt, his faithfulleſt Tranſlators, whoſe Merit and Pains muſt be of a very ſecondary Degree to his own, reſt ſatisfied with a ſimilar Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: eſpecially when joined to the Pleaſure, that muſt reſult from a Conſciouſneſs of their having endeavoured to extend the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their Author's Treatiſe, to Multitudes of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Language.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, when, after reading the Introduction to the Work, and much of the Sequel, I had determined to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it; to be as juſt as poſſible to the Author, and to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers, I determined not to interpolate any Sentiment of my own into the Text, nor to omit one Sentence of the Original, which, beſides its being <hi>Detraction</hi> in a literal Senſe, I thought might imply it in its worſt, its figurative one; for which there
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012243_0004_0F8A37A98C5C7978"/>
was no Room. To conform as fully as poſſible to the Plainneſs and Perſpicuity he propoſed I have been pretty often obliged in the anatomical Names of ſome Parts, and ſometimes of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as well as in ſome pretty familiar, though not entirely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Words, to explain all ſuch by the moſt common Words I have heard uſed for them; as after mentioning the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> to add, or <hi>Midriff</hi>—the <hi>Trachoea</hi>—or <hi>Windpipe—acrimonious,</hi> or <hi>very ſharp,</hi> and ſo of many others. This may a little, though but a little, have extended the Tranſlation beyond the Original; as the great Affinity between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and many <hi>Latin</hi> Words borrowed from the <hi>Greek,</hi> generally makes the ſame anatomical or medical Term, that is technical with us, vernacular or common with them. But this unavoidable Tautology, which may be irkſome to many Ears, thoſe medical Readers, for whom it was not intended, will readily forgive, from a Conſideration of the general Addreſs of the Work: while they reflect that a plain intelligible Style is eſſentially neceſſary in thoſe Books, which wholly conſiſt of very uſeful, and generally intereſting, Matter.</p>
            <p>As many of the Notes of the Editor of <hi>Lyons,</hi> as I have retained in this Verſion (this Tranſlation being made from that Edition) are ſubſcribed <hi>E. L.</hi> I have diſpenſed with ſeveral, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently leſs within Dr. TISSOT's Plan, from tending to theorize, however juſtly or practically, where he muſt have had his own Reaſons for omitting to theorize: a few others, as manifeſtly needleſs, from what the Author had either premiſed, or ſpeedily ſubjoined, on the very ſame Circumſtance: beſides, a very few, from their local Confinement to the Practice at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which lies in a Climate ſomewhat more different from our own than that of <hi>Lauſanne.</hi> It is probable, nevertheleſs, I have retained a few more of thoſe Notes, than were neceſſary in a profeſſed Tranſlation of the original Work: but wherever I have done this, I have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſubjoined my Motive for it; of whatever Conſequence that may appear to the Reader. I have retained all the Author's own Notes, with his Name annexed to them; and wherever the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator was uncertain to me, I have declared whoſe Note I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be.</p>
            <p>Such as I have added from my own Experience or Obſervation are ſubſcribed <hi>K.</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the former; and that the Demerit of any of them may neither be imputed to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author, nor to that Editor. Their principal Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Apology is, that whatever Facts I have mentioned are certainly true. I have endeavoured to be temperate in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Length, and to imitate that ſtrict Pertinence, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails throughout the <hi>Author</hi>'s Work. If any may have ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to conſider my Way of Writing, they will conceive this Reſtraint has coſt me at leaſt as much Pains, as a further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of my own Conceptions could have done. The few Preſcriptions I have included in ſome of them, have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012243_0005_0F8A37AA4E77BC40"/>
as not to give the Readers the leaſt Confuſion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe, which the Author has given in his Table of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and which are referred to by numerical Figures, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Courſe of this Book.</p>
            <p>The preſent Edition of this Tranſlation is taken from my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but with the Addition of ſome more Notes of my own, which ſeemed to me material, beſides a very few ſuggeſted by a learned and experienced Friend, which I have adopted. A new <hi>French</hi> Edition of this Work has lately appeared at <hi>Paris,</hi> though not under Dr. TISSOT's Direction; in which there are two or three Chapters on as many chronical Diſeaſes; but which our Author, who confined his valuable Work ſolely to acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, had of courſe excluded from his Plan. Theſe we have therefore, and we think very conſiſtently, omitted to tranſlate; as we deemed it rather improper and illiberal, to blend the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations of another Writer, (who is anonymous too) with Dr. TISSOT's original Work; theſe Interpolations being on ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles too, as he had for excellent Reaſons, which he ſpecifies in his own Preface, declined to treat of. Whether ſuch Additions then were officiouſly made by any Volunteer Phyſician, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a Bookſeller, doubtleſs the Intention was either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the intrinſic Value, or to extend the Sale of their new Edition of the <hi>Avis au Peuple</hi>: though it is much likelier theſe Additions may chance to be read, more in Conſequence of the Merit of his original Work, than on that of their own; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which however I confeſs I have very little enquired. But whatever that Merit may prove, it was certainly a probable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to introduce it; notwithſtanding the Ingraftment of theſe Chapters gives them the Air of a Tumour or Excreſcence<note n="*" place="bottom">This additional Paragraph to the Tranſlator's former Preface, favours him with an Opportunity of acknowledging his Obligations to the great Candour and indulgence of the Public, in regard to his Tranſlation of this Work.</note>.</p>
            <p>The moderate Number of Dr. TISSOT's Preſcriptions, in his Table of Remedies, amounting but to ſeventy-one, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Simplicity of many of them, may poſſibly diſguſt ſome Admirers of pompous and complex Preſcription. But his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in this important Reſpect, has been thoroughly conſiſtent with his Notion of Nature's curing Diſeaſes; which ſuggeſted to him the firſt, the eſſential Neceſſity of cautioning his Readers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt doing, giving or applying any thing, that might oppoſe her healing Operations (a moſt capital Purpoſe of his Work) which important Point being gained, the mildeſt, the ſimpleſt and leaſt hazardous Remedies would often prove ſufficient aſſiſtants to her. Nevertheleſs, under more ſevere and painful Conflicts, he is not wanting to direct the moſt potent and efficacious ones. The Circumſtances of the poor Subjects of his medical Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, became alſo a very natural Object to him; and was in no

wiſe unworthy the Regard of the humane Tranſlator of BIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUER <hi>on</hi> AMPUTATIONS, or rather <hi>againſt</hi> the crying Abuſe of them; an excellent Work, which does real Honour to them both; and which can be diſapproved by none, who do not prefer the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unneceſſary Mutilation of the Afflicted, to the ingroſſing a greater Portion of their Time; whence they may apprehend a Contraction of their Employment.</p>
            <p>Some Perſons may imagine that a Treatiſe of this Kind, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the benefit of labouring People in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> may be little applicable to thoſe of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſlands. This, in a very few Particulars, and in a ſmall Degree, may be true indeed. But as we find their common Prejudices are often the very ſame; as the <hi>Swiſs</hi> are the Inhabitants of a colder Climate than <hi>France,</hi> and generally, as Dr. TISSOT often obſerves, accuſtomed to drink (like ourſelves) more ſtrong Drink than the <hi>French</hi> Peaſantry; and to indulge more in eating Fleſh too, which the Religion of <hi>Berne,</hi> like our own, does not reſtrain; the Application of his Advice to them will pretty generally hold good here. Where he forbids them Wine and Fleſh, all Butchers Meat, and in moſt Caſes all Fleſh, and all ſtrong Drink ſhould be prohibited here: eſpecially when we conſider, that his Directions are confined to the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of acute Diſeaſes, of which the very young, the youthful, and frequently even the robuſt are more generally the Subjects. Beſides, in ſome few of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlator's Notes, he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Liberty of moderating the Coolers, or the Quantities of them (which may be well adapted to the great Heats and violent <hi>Swiſs</hi> Summers Dr. TISSOT talks of) according to the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our own Climate, and the general Habitudes of our own People. It may be obſerved too, that from the ſame Motive, I have ſometimes aſſumed the Liberty of diſſenting from the Text in a very few Notes; as for Inſtance, on the Article of Paſtry, which perhaps is generally better here than in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> (where it may be as bad as our coarſe vile Traſh that is hawked about and ſold to meer Children) as I have frequently, in preparing for Inoculation admitted the beſt Paſtry (but never of Meat, and very ſeldom any Cheeſecakes) into the limited Diet of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Inoculation, and conſtantly without the leaſt ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Thus alſo in Note * Page 145, 146, I have preſumed to affirm the Fact, that a ſtrong ſpirituous Infuſion of the Bark has ſucceeded more ſpeedily in ſome Intermittents, in particular Habits, than the Bark in Subſtance. This I humbly conceive may be owing to ſuch a <hi>Menſtruum's</hi> extracting the Reſin of the Bark more effectually (and ſo conveying it into the Blood) than the Juices of the Stomach and of the alimentary Canal did, or could. For it is very conceivable that the <hi>Craſis,</hi> the Conſiſtence, of the fibrous Blood may ſometimes be affected with a morbid Laxity or Weakneſs, as well as the general Syſtem of the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fibres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012243_0007_0F8A37ABCBC0ED28"/>Theſe and any other like Freedoms I am certain the Author's Candour will abundantly pardon; ſince I have never diſſented from him, for the ſake of diſſenting; and have the Honour of harmonizing very generally in Judgment with him. If <hi>one</hi> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hint or Obſervation occurs throughout my Notes, his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence will exult in that eſſential Adherence to his Plan, which ſuggeſted it to me: While an invariable echoing Aſſentation throughout ſuch Notes, when there really was any ſalutary Room for doubting, or for adding (with reſpect to ourſelves) would diſcover a Servility, that muſt have diſguſted a liberal manly Writer. One common good Purpoſe certainly ſprings from the generous Source, and repleniſhes the many Chanels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it is derived; all the Variety and little Deviations of which may be conſidered as more expanſive Diſtributions of its Benefits.</p>
            <p>Since the natural Feelings of Humanity generally diſpoſe us, but eſpecially the more tender and compaſſionate Sex, to adviſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to thoſe Sick, who are additionally miſerable, from their being poor; ſuch a Knowledge of their real Diſeaſe, as would prevent their Patrons, Neighbours and Aſſiſtants from adviſing a wrong Regimen, or an improper or ill-timed Medicine, is truly eſſential to relieving them: and ſuch we ſeriouſly think the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Work is capable of imparting, to all commonly ſenſible and conſiderate Peruſers of it. A Vein of unaffected Probity, of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe, and of great Philanthrophy, concur to ſuſtain the Work: and whenever the Prejudices of the ignorant require a forcible Eradication; or the crude Temerity and Impudence of Knaves and Impoſtors cry out for their own Extermination, a happy Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſtrong Argument; juſt Ridicule, and honeſt Severity, gives a poignant and pleaſant Seaſoning to the Work, which renders it occaſionally entertaining, as it is continually inſtructive.</p>
            <p>A general Reader may be ſometimes diverted with ſuch Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Notions of the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Peaſants, as are occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here: and poſſibly our meereſt Ruſtics may laugh at the brave ſimple <hi>Swiſs,</hi> on his introducing a Sheep into the Chamber of a very ſick Perſon, to ſave the Life of the Patient, by catching its own Death. But the Peaſantry of both Nations are agreed in ſuch a Number of their abſurd unhealthy Prejudices, in the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſeaſes, that it really ſeemed neceſſary to offer our own the Cautions and Counſels of this principal Phyſician, in a very reſpectable Proteſtant Republick, in order to prevent their Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. Nor is it unreaſonable to preſume, that under ſuch a Form of Government, (if honeſtly adminiſtred upon its juſteſt Principles) the People may be rather more tenderly regarded, than under the Pomp and Rage of Deſpotiſm, or the Oppreſſion of ſome tumultuous Ariſtocracies.</p>
            <p>Beſides the different Conditions of <note n="*" place="bottom">Of all theſe the Schoolmaſters, <hi>with us,</hi> may ſeem the moſt reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this Duty.</note> Perſons, to whom our

Author recommends the Patronage and Execution of his Scheme, in his Introduction, it is conceived this Book muſt be ſerviceable to many young Practioners, and to great Numbers of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by furniſhing them with ſuch exact and ſtriking Deſcriptions of each acute Diſeaſe and its Symptoms, as may prevent their miſtaking it for any other; a Deception which has certainly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been injurious, and ſometimes even fatal: for it is dreadful but to contemplate the Deſtruction or Miſery, with which Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Ignorance, ſo frequently combined, overwhelm the Sick. Thus (if better informed and inſtructed) more Succeſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, with the Enjoyment of a better Conſcience, would crown their Endeavours, by a more general Recovery of, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to, their Patients. To effect this, to improve every Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of eſchewing medical Evil, and of doing medical Good, was the Author's avowed Intention; which he informs us in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, he has heard, from ſome intelligent and charitable Perſons, his Treatiſe had effected, even in ſome violent Diſeaſes. That the ſame good Conſequences may every where attend the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tranſlations of it, muſt be the fervent Wiſh of all, except the Quacks and Impoſtors he ſo juſtly characteriſes in his thirty-third Chapter! and particularly of all, who may be diſtinguiſhably qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, like himſelf, to,

            <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF Vanity too often diſpoſes many to ſpeak of themſelves, there are ſome Occaſions, on which a total Silence might be ſuppoſed to reſult from a ſtill higher Degree of it: And the very general Reception of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the People</hi> has been ſuch, that there would be room to ſuſpect me of that moſt ſhocking Kind of Pride, which receives Applauſe with Indifference (as deeming its own Merit ſuperior to the greateſt) if I did not appear to be ſtrongly impreſſed with a juſt Senſe of that great Favour of the Publick, which has been ſo very obliging, and ſo highly agreeable, to me.</p>
            <p>Unfeignedly affected with the unhappy Situation of the poor Sick in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Places in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> where they are loſt from a Scarcity of the beſt Aſſiſtance, and from a fatal Superfluity of the worſt, my ſole Purpoſe in writing this Treatiſe has been to ſerve, and to comfort them. I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it only for a ſmall Extent of Country, with a moderate Number of Inhabitants; and was greatly ſurprized to find, that within five or ſix Months after its Publication, it was become one of the moſt extenſively pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Books in <hi>Europe</hi>; and one of thoſe Treatiſes, on a ſcientific Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which has been peruſed by the greateſt Number of Readers of all Ranks and Conditions. To conſider ſuch Succeſs with Indifference, were to have been unworthy of it, which Demerit, at leaſt on this Account, I cannot juſtly be charged with; ſince Indifference has not been my Caſe, who have felt as I ought this Gratification of ſelf-love; which, under juſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reſtrictions, may perhaps be even politically cheriſhed: as the Delight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſing from having been approved, is a Source of that laudable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, which has ſometimes produced the moſt eſſential good Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Society itſelf. For my own particular, I can truly aver, that my Satisfaction has been exquiſitely heightened on this Occaſion, as a Lover of my Species: ſince judging from the Succeſs of this Work (a Succeſs which has exceeded my utmoſt Expectations) of the Effects that may reaſonably be hoped for from it, I am happily conſcious of that Satisfaction, or even Joy, which every truly honeſt Man muſt receive, from rendering eſſential good Offices to others. Beſides which, I have enjoyed, in its utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that Satisfaction which every grateful Man muſt receive, from the Approbation and Beneficence of his Sovereign, when I was diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:012243_0012_0F8A37B050CD0680"/>
with the precious Medal, which the illuſtrious Chamber of Health of the Republick of <hi>Berne</hi> honoured me with, a few Months after the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Treatiſe; together with a Letter ſtill more eſtimable, as it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me of the extraordinary Satisfaction the Republick had teſtified on the Impreſſion of it; a Circumſtance, which I could not avoid this publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of, without the greateſt Vanity and Ingratitude. This has alſo been a very influencing Motive with me, to exert my utmoſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ties in perfecting this new Edition, in which I have made many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that render it greatly preferable to the firſt; and of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall give a brief Account, after ſaying ſomewhat of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> which have appeared elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that, which Meſſrs. <hi>Heidegger,</hi> the Bookſellers, publiſhed in the <hi>German</hi> Language at <hi>Zurich,</hi> about a year ſince. I ſhould have been highly delighted with the meer Approbation of <hi>M. HIRZEL,</hi> firſt Phyſician of the Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe ſuperior and univerſal Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; whoſe profound Knowledge in the Theory of Phyſick; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Succeſs of whoſe Practice have juſtly elevated him among the ſmall Number of extraordinary Men of our own Times; he having lately obtained the eſteem and the Thanks of all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the Hiſtory of one of her <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Le Socrate ruſtique,</hi> a Work, which every Perſon ſhould read.</note> Sages. But I little expected the Honour this Gentleman has done me, in tranſlating the <hi>Advice to the People</hi> into his own Language. Highly ſenſible nevertheleſs as I am of this Honour, I muſt always reflect with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that he has conſumed that important Time, in rendering my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intelligible, to his Countrymen, which he might have employed much more uſefully, in obliging the World with his own.</p>
            <p>He has enriched his Tranſlation with an excellent Preface, which is chiefly employed in a juſt and beautiful Portrait and Contraſt of the true, and of the falſe Phyſician; with which I ſhould have done myſelf the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have adorned the preſent <note n="†" place="bottom">This Preface is indeed premiſed to this <hi>French</hi> Edition, but a Tranſlation of it was omitted, to avoid extending the Bulk and Price of the Work. Dr. TISSOT muſt then have been ignorant of this Addition, when firſt publiſhed at <hi>Lyons.</hi>
               </note> Edition; if the Size of this Volume, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too large, had not proved an Obſtacle to ſo conſiderable an Addition; and if the Manner, in which <hi>Mr. HIRZEL</hi> ſpeaks of its Author, had permitted me with Decency to publiſh his Preface. I have been informed by ſome Letters, that there have been two other <hi>German</hi> Tranſlations of it; but I am not informed by whom. However, <hi>Mr. HIRZEL's</hi> Preface, his own Notes, and ſome Additions with which I have furniſhed him, render his Edition preferable to the firſt in <hi>French,</hi> and to the other <hi>German</hi> Tranſlations already made.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Edition is that, which the younger <hi>DIDOT,</hi> the Bookſeller, publiſhed towards the End of the Winter at <hi>Paris.</hi> He had requeſted me to furniſh him with ſome Additions to it, which I could not readily comply with.</p>
            <p>The third Edition is a <hi>Dutch</hi> Tranſlation of it, which will be very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily publiſhed by <hi>M. RENIER AREMBERG,</hi> Bookſeller at <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> He had begun the Tranſlation from my firſt Edition; but having wrote to
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:012243_0013_0F8A37B10D284170"/>
know whether I had not ſome Additions to make, I deſired him to wait for the Publication of this. I have the good Fortune to be very happy in my Tranſlators: it being <hi>M. BIKKER,</hi> a celebrated Phyſician at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> (ſo very advantageouſly known in other Countries, by his beautiful <hi>Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on Human Nature</hi>: throughout which Genius and Knowledge proceed Hand in Hand) who will preſent his Countrymen with the <hi>Advice to the People,</hi> in their own Language: and who will improve it with ſuch Notes, as are neceſſary for a ſafe and proper Application of its Contents in a Climate, different from that in which it was wrote. I have alſo heard, there has been an <hi>Italian</hi> Tranſlation of it.</p>
            <p>After this Account of the foreign Editions, I return to the preſent one, which is the ſecond of the original <hi>French</hi> Treatiſe. I ſhall not affirm it is greatly corrected, with reſpect to fundamental Points: for as I had advanced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the firſt, that was not eſtabliſhed on Truth and Demonſtration, there was no Room for Correction, with regard to any eſſential Matters. Nevertheleſs, in this I have made, <hi>1,</hi> a great Number of ſmall Alterations in the Diction, and added ſeveral Words, to render the Work ſtill more ſimple and perſpicuous. <hi>2,</hi> The typographical Execution of this is conſiderably improved in the Type, the Paper and Ink, Spelling, Pointing, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the Work. <hi>3,</hi> I have made ſome conſiderable Additions, which are of three Kinds. Not a few of them are new Articles on ſome of the Subjects formerly treated of; ſuch as the Articles concerning Tarts and other Paſtry Ware; the Addition concerning the Regimen for Perſons, in a State of Recovery from Diſeaſes; the Preparation for the Small Pocks; a long Note on the Jeſuits Bark; another on acid Spirits; one on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Hemlock, beſides ſome new Matter which I have inſerted; ſuch as an Article with regard to proper Drinks; one on the Convulſions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; one on Chilblains; another on Punctures from Thorns; one upon the Reaſon of the Confidence repoſed in Quacks, and the thirty-firſt Chapter entirely: in which I have extended the Conſideration of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Articles, that ſeemed to me a little too ſuccinct and ſhort. There are ſome Alterations of this laſt, this additional, Kind, interſperſed almoſt throughout the whole Subſtance of this Edition; but eſpecially in the two Chapters relating to Women and Children.</p>
            <p>The objects of the <hi>XXXI</hi> Chapter are ſuch as require immediate Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>viz.</hi> Swoonings, Haemorrhages, that is, large ſpontaneous Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the Attacks of Convulſions, and of Suffocations; the Conſequences of Fright and Terror; Diſorders occaſioned by unwholeſome or deadly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; the Effects of Poiſon, and the ſudden Invaſions of exceſſive Pain.</p>
            <p>The Omiſſion of this Chapter was a very material Defect in the original Plan of this Work. The Editor of it at <hi>Paris</hi> was very ſenſible of this Chaſm, or Blank, as it maybe called, and has filled it up very properly: and if I have not made uſe of his Supplement, inſtead of enlarging myſelf upon the Articles of which he has treated, it has only been from a Purpoſe of rendering the whole Work more uniform; and to avoid that odd Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſeems ſcarcely to be avoided in a Treatiſe compoſed by two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Beſides which, that Gentleman has ſaid nothing of the Articles,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:012243_0014_0F8A37B1CD6732B8"/>
which employ the greateſt Part of that Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Swoonings, the Conſequences of great Fear, and of noxious Vapours.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I ought to juſtify myſelf, as well as poſſible, to a great Number of very reſpectable Perſons, both here and abroad, (to whom I can refuſe nothing without great Chagrin and Reluctance) for my not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſuch Additions as they deſired of me. This however was impoſſible as the Objects, in which they concurred, were ſome chronical Diſtempers, that are entirely out of the Plan, to which I was ſtrictly attached, for many Reaſons. The firſt is, that it was my original Purpoſe to oppoſe the Errors incurred in Country Places, in the Treatment of acute Diſeaſes; and to diſplay the beſt Method of conducting ſuch, as do not admit of waiting for the Arrival of diſtant Succour; or of removing the Patients to Cities, or large Towns. It is but too true indeed, that chronical Diſeaſes are alſo liable to improper Treatment in ſmall Country Places: but then there are both Time and Convenience to convey the Patients within the Reach of better Advice; or for procuring them the Attendance of the beſt Adviſers, at their own Places of Reſidence. Beſides which, ſuch Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are conſiderably leſs common than thoſe, to which I had reſtrained my Views: and they will become ſtill leſs frequent, whenever acute Diſeaſes, of which they are frequently the Conſequences, ſhall be more rationally and ſafely conducted.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon, which, if alone, would have been a ſufficient one, is, that it is impoſſible to ſubject the Treatment of chronical Diſtempers to the Capacity and Conduct of Perſons, who are not Phyſicians. Each acute Diſtemper generally ariſes from one Cauſe, and the Treatment of it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and uniform; ſince thoſe Symptoms, which manifeſt the Malady, point out its Cauſe and Treatment. But the Caſe is very Differently cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced in tedious and languid Diſeaſes; each of which may depend on ſo many and various Cauſes (and it is only the real, the true Cauſe, which ought to determine us in ſelecting its proper Remedies) that though the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper and its Appellation are evidently known, a meer By-ſtander may be very remote from penetrating into its true Cauſe; and conſequently be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of chuſing the beſt Medicines for it. It is this preciſe and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcernment of the real particular Cauſe [<hi>or of the contingent Concurrence of more than one</hi>] that neceſſarily requires the Preſence of Perſons converſant in the Study and the Practice of all the Parts of Phyſick; and which Knowledge it is impoſſible for People, who are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to ſuch Studies, to arrive at. Moreover, their frequent Complexneſs; the Variety of their Symptoms; the different Stages of theſe tedious Diſeaſes [not exactly attended to even by many competent Phyſicians] the Difficulty of aſcertaining different Doſes of Medicines, whoſe Activity may make the ſmalleſt Error highly dangerous, &amp;c. &amp;c. are really ſuch trying Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as render the fitteſt Treatment of theſe Diſeaſes ſufficiently difficult and embarraſſing to the moſt experienced Phyſicians, and unattainable by thoſe who are not Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>A third Reaſon is, that, even ſuppoſing all theſe Circumſtances might be made ſo plain and eaſy, as to be comprehended by every Reader, they would require a Work of an exceſſive Length; and thence be diſproportioned to
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:012243_0015_0F8A37B28D45F300"/>
the Faculties of thoſe, for whom it was intended. One ſingle chronical Diſeaſe might require as large a Volume as the preſent one.</p>
            <p>But finally, were I to acknowledge, that this Compliance was both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and practicable, I declare I find it exceeds my Abilities; and that I am alſo far from having ſufficient Leiſure for the Execution of it. It is my Wiſh that others would attempt it, and may ſucceed in accompliſhing it; but I hope theſe truly worthy Perſons, who have honoured me by propoſing the Atchievement of it to myſelf, will perceive the Reaſons for my not complying with it, in all their Force; and not aſcribe a Refuſal, which ariſes from the very Nature of the thing, either to Obſtinacy, or to any Want of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to oblige them.</p>
            <p>I have been informed my Citations, or rather References, have puzzled ſome Readers. It was difficult to foreſee this, but is eaſy to prevent it for the future. The Work contains Citations only of two Sorts; one, that points to the Remedies preſcribed; and the other, which refers to ſome Paſſage in the Book itſelf, that ſerve to illuſtrate thoſe Paſſages in which I cite. Neither of theſe References could have been omitted. The firſt is marked thus, <hi>No.</hi> with the proper Figure to it, as <hi>1, 2,</hi> &amp;c. This ſignifies, that the Medicine I direct is deſcribed in the Table of Remedies, according to the Number annexed to that Character. Thus when we find directed, in any Page of the Book, the warm Infuſion <hi>No. 1,</hi> in ſome other, the Ptiſan <hi>No. 2</hi>; or in a third, the Almond Milk, or Emulſion <hi>No. 4,</hi> it ſignifies, that ſuch Preſcriptions will be found the Numbers <hi>1, 2,</hi> and 4; and this Table is printed at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> thus referring to the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their Numbers, I had repeated each Preſcription as often as I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it, this Treatiſe muſt have been doubled in Bulk, and inſufferably tireſome to peruſe. I muſt repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ere, that what I have already ſaid in the former Edition, that the <note n="*" place="bottom">The Reaſons for omitting the Prices <hi>here,</hi> may be ſeen Page 12 of this Tranſlation.</note> Prices of the Medicines, or of a great Number of them, are thoſe at which the Apothecaries may afford them, without any Loſs, to a Peaſant in humble Circumſtances. But it ſhould he remembered, that they are not ſet down at the full Prices which they may honeſtly demand; ſince that would be unjuſt for ſome to inſiſt on them at. Beſides, there is no Kind of Tax in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> and I have no Right to impoſe one.</p>
            <p>The Citations of the ſecond Kind are very plain and ſimple. The whole Work is divided into numbered Paragraphs diſtinguiſhed by the Mark §. And not to ſwell it with needleſs Repetitions, when in one Place I might have even pertinently repeated ſomething already obſerved, inſtead of ſuch Repetition at Length, I have only referred to the Paragraph, where it had been obſerved. Thus, for Example, when we read Page <hi>40, § 50— When the Diſeaſe is ſo circumſtanced as we have deſcribed, § 46.</hi>—this imports that, not to repeat the Deſcription already given, I refer the Reader to that laſt § for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:012243_0016_0F8A37B34C7C6170"/>The Uſe of theſe Citations is not the leaſt Innovation, and extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modius and eaſy: but were there only a ſingle Reader likely to be puzzled by them I ought not to omit this Explanation of them, as I can expect to be generally uſeful, only in Proportion as I am clear: and it muſt be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that a Deſire of being extenſively uſeful is the ſole Motive of this Work. I have long ſince had the Happineſs of knowing, that ſome charitable and intelligent Perſons have applied the Directions it contains, with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Succeſs, even in violent Diſeaſes: And I ſhall arrive at the Height of my Wiſhes, if I continue to be informed, that it contributes to alleviate the Sufferings, and to prolong the Days, of my rational Fellow Creatures.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Decreaſe of the Number of Inhabitants, in moſt of the States of Europe, is a Fact, which impreſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reflecting Perſon, and is become ſuch a general Complaint, as is but too well eſtabliſhed on plain Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. This Decreaſe is moſt remarkable in Country Places. It is owing to many Cauſes; and I ſhall think myſelf happy, if I can contribute to remove one of the greateſt of them, which is the pernicious Manner of treating ſick People in Country Places. This is my ſole Object, tho' I may be excuſed perhaps for pointing out the other concurring Cauſes, which may be all included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe two general Affirmations; That greater Numbers than uſual emigrate from the Country; and that the People increaſe leſs every where.</p>
            <p>There are many Sorts of Emigration. Some leave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to enliſt in the Service of different States by Sea and Land; or to be differently employed abroad, ſome as Traders, others as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Military Service, by Land or Sea, prevents Population in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſpects. In the firſt Place, the Numbers going abroad are always more, often <hi>much</hi> more, than thoſe who return. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Battles, with all the Hazards and Fatigues of War; detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Encounters, bad Proviſions, Exceſs in drinking and eating; Diſeaſes that are the Conſequences of Debauches, the Diſorders that are peculiar to the Country; epidemical, peſtilential or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſtempers, cauſed by the unwholeſome Air of Flanders, Holland, Italy and Hungary; long Cruiſes, Voyages to the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, to Guinea, &amp;c. deſtroy a great Number of Men. The Article of Deſertion alſo, the Conſequences of which they dread on returning home, diſpoſes many to abandon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for ever. Others, on quitting the Service, take up with ſuch Eſtabliſhments, as it has occaſionally thrown in their Way; and which neceſſarily prevent their Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n. But in the ſecond Place, ſuppoſing they were all to come back, their Country ſuffers equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Abſence; as thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ery generally happens during that Period of Life, when they are beſt adapted for Propagation; ſince that Qualification on their Return is impaired by Age, by Infirmities and Debauches: and even when they do marry, the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012243_0022_0F8A37B88BAE99C0"/>
Children often periſh as Victims to the Exceſſes and Irregularities of their Fathers: they are weak, languiſhing, diſtempered, and either die young, or live incapable of being uſeful to Society. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the prevailing Habit of Libertinage, which many have contracted, prevents ſeveral of them from marrying at all. But notwithſtanding all theſe inconvenient Conſequences are real and notorious; yet as the Number of thoſe, who leave their Country on theſe Accounts, is limited, and indeed rather inconſiderable, if compared with the Number of Inhabitants which muſt remain at home: as it may be affirmed too, that this relinquiſhing of their Country may have been even neceſſary at ſome times, and may become ſo again, if the Cauſes of Depopulation ſhould ceaſe, this Sort of Emigration is doubtleſs the leaſt grievous of any, and the laſt which may require a ſtrict Conſideration.</p>
            <p>But that abandoning of their Country, or <hi>Expatriation,</hi> as it may be termed, the Object of which is a Change of the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant's Condition, is more to be conſidered, being more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. It is attended with many and peculiar Inconveniences, and is unhappily become an epidemical Evil, the Ravages of which are ſtill increaſing; and that from one ſimple and ridiculous Source, which is this; that the Succeſs of one Individual determines a hundred to run the ſame Riſque, ninety and nine of whom may probably be diſappointed. They are ſtruck with the apparent Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of one, and are ignorant of the Miſcarriage of others. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a hundred Perſons might have ſet out ten Years ago, to <hi>ſeek their Fortune,</hi> as the Saying is, at the End of ſix Months they are all forgotten, except by their Relations; but if one ſhould return the ſame Year, with more Money than his own Fortune, more than he ſet out with; or if one of them has got a moderate Place with little Work, the whole Country rings with it, as a Subject of general Entertainment. A Croud of young People are ſeduced by this and ſally forth, becauſe not one reflects, that of the ninety-nine, who ſet out with the hundredth Perſon, one half has periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many are miſerable, and the Remainder come back, without having gained any thing, but an Incapacity to employ themſelves uſefully at home, and in their former Occupations: and having deprived their Country of a great many Cultivators, who, from the Produce of the Lands, would have attracted conſiderable Sums of Money, and many comfortable Advantages to it. In ſhort, the very ſmall Proportion who ſucceed, are continually talked of; the Croud that ſink are perpetually forgot. This is a very great and real Evil, and how ſhall it be prevented? It would be ſufficient perhaps to publiſh the extraordinary Riſque, which may be eaſily demonſtrated: It would require nothing more, than to keep an exact yearly Regiſter of all theſe Adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and, at the Expiration of ſix, eight, or ten Years, to publiſh the Liſt, with the Fate of every Emigrant. I am greatly deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at the End of a certain Number of Years, we ſhould not ſee ſuch Multitudes forſake their native Soil, in which they might
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012243_0023_0F8A37B94D60F128"/>
live comfortably by working, to go in Search of Eſtabliſhments in others; the Uncertainty of which ſuch Liſts would demonſtrate to them; and alſo prove, how preferable their Condition in their own Country would have been, to that they have been reduced to. People would no longer ſet out, but on almoſt certain Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: fewer would undoubtedly emigrate, more of whom, from that very Circumſtance, muſt ſucceed. Meeting with fewer of their Country-men abroad, theſe fortunate few would oftener re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. By this Means more Inhabitants would remain in the Country, more would return again, and bring with them more Money to it. The State would be more populous, more rich and happy; as the Happineſs of a People who live on a fruitful Soil, depends eſſentially on a great Number of Inhabitants, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Quantity of pecuniary Riches.</p>
            <p>But the Population of the Country is not only neceſſarily leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, merely in Conſequence of the Numbers that leave it; ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe who remain increaſe leſs, than an equal Number for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did. Or, which amounts to the ſame thing, among the ſame Number of Perſons, there are fewer Marriages than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the ſame Number of Marriages produce fewer Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I do not enter upon a Detail of the Proofs, ſince merely looking about us muſt furniſh a ſufficient Conviction of the Truth of them. What then are the Cauſes of this? There are two capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ones, Luxury and Debauchery, which are Enemies to Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on many Accounts.</p>
            <p>Luxury compels the wealthy Man, who would make a Figure; and the Man of a moderate Income, but who is his Equal in every other Reſpect, and who <hi>will</hi> imitate him, to be afraid of a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family; the Education of which muſt greatly contract that Expence he had devoted to Parade and Oſtentation: And beſides, if he muſt divide his Eſtate among a great many Children, each of them would have but a little, and be unable to keep up the State and the Train of the Father's. Since Merit is unjuſtly eſtimated by exterior Shew and Expence, one muſt of courſe endeavour to attain for himſelf, and to leave his Children in, a Situation capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſupporting that Expence. Hence the fewer Marriages of People who are not opulent, and the fewer Children among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who marry.</p>
            <p>Luxury is further prejudicial to the Increaſe of the People, in another Reſpect. The irregular Manner of Life which it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, depreſſes Health; it ruins the Conſtitutions, and thus ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affects Procreation. The preceding Generation counted ſome Families with more than twenty Children: the living one counts leſs than twenty Couſins. Very unfortunately this Way of thinking and acting, ſo preventive of Increaſe, has extended it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even into Villages: and they are no longer convinced there; that the Number of Children makes the Riches of the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Perhaps the next Generation will ſcarcely be acquainted with the Relation of Brotherhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:012243_0024_0F8A37BA0D99EB18"/>A third Inconvenience of Luxury is, that the Rich retreat from the Country to live in Cities; and by multiplying their Domeſtics there, they drain the former. This augmented Train is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Country, by depriving it of Cultivaters, and by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Population. Theſe Domeſtics, being ſeldom ſufficiently employed, contract the Habit of Lazineſs; and they prove inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of returning to that Country Labour, for which Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them. Being deprived of this Reſource they ſcarcely ever marry, either from apprehending the Charge of Children, or from their becoming Libertines; and ſometimes, becauſe many Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will not employ married Servants. Or ſhould any of them marry, it is often in the Decline of Life, whence the State muſt have the fewer Citizens.</p>
            <p>Idleneſs of itſelf weakens them, and diſpoſes them to thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches, which enfeeble them ſtill more. They never have more than a few Children, and theſe ſickly; ſuch as have not Strength to cultivate the Ground; or who, being brought up in Cities, have an Averſion to the Country.</p>
            <p>Even thoſe among them who are more prudent, who preſerve their Morals, and make ſome Savings, being accuſtomed to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Life, and dreading the Labour of a Country one (of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of which they are alſo ignorant) chuſe to become little Merchants, or Tradeſmen; and this muſt be a Drawback from Population, as any Number of Labourers beget more Children than an equal Number of Citizens; and alſo by Reaſon, that out of any given Number, more Children die in Cities, than in the Country.</p>
            <p>The ſame Evils alſo prevail with Regard to Female Servants. After ten or twelve Years Servitude, the Maid-Servants in Cities cannot acquit themſelves as good Country Servants; and ſuch of them as chuſe this Condition, quickly fail under that Kind or Quantity of Work, for which they are no longer conſtituted. Were we to ſee a Woman married in the Country, a Year after her leaving Town, it would be eaſy to obſerve, how much that Way of living in the Country has broke her. Frequently their firſt Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in which Term they have not all the Attendance their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy demands, proves the Loſs of their Health; they remain in a State of Langour, of Feebleneſs, and of Decay; they have no more Children; and this renders their Huſbands unuſeful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Population of the State.</p>
            <p>Abortions, Infants carried out of their Country after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Pregnancy, and the Impoſſibility of their Mother's getting Huſbands afterwards, are frequently the Effects of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinage.</p>
            <p>It is to be apprehended too theſe bad Effects are rather increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us; ſince, either for want of ſufficient Numbers, or from oeconomical Views, it has become a Cuſtom, inſtead of Women Servants, to employ Children, whoſe Manners and whoſe Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are not yet formed; and who are ruined in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012243_0025_0F8A37BACDCA51B8"/>
by their Reſidence in Town, by their Lazineſs, by bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and bad Company.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs much remains ſtill unſaid on theſe important Heads; but beſides my Intention not to ſwell this Treatiſe immoderately, and the many Avocations, which prevent me from launching too far into what may be leſs within the Bounds of Medicine, I ſhould be fearful of digreſſing too far from my Subject. What I have hitherto ſaid, however, I think cannot be wholly foreign to it; ſince in giving Advice to the People, with Regard to their Health, it was neceſſary to diſplay to them the Cauſes which impaired it; though what I might be able to add further on this Head, would probably be thought more remote from the Subject.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add then but a ſingle Hint on the Occaſion. Is it not practicable, in order to remedy thoſe Evils which we cannot prevent, to ſelect ſome particular Part or Canton of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein we ſhould endeavour by Rewards, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Irremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably to fix all the Inhabitants? 2<hi>dly.</hi> To encourage them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rewards to a plentiful and legitimate Increaſe? They ſhould not be permitted to go out of it, which muſt prevent them from being expoſed to the Evils I have mentioned. They ſhould by no Means intermarry with any Strangers, who might introduce ſuch Diſorders among them. Thus very probably this Canton, after a certain Time, would become even overpeopled, and might ſend out Colonies to the others.</p>
            <p>One Cauſe, ſtill more conſiderable than thoſe we have already mentioned, has, to this very Moment, prevented the Increaſe of the People in France. This is the Decay of Agriculture. The Inhabitants of the Country, to avoid ſerving in the Militia; to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the Days-Service impoſed by their Lords, and the Taxes; and being attracted to the City by the Hopes of Intereſt, by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs and Libertinage, have left the Country nearly deſerted. Thoſe who remain behind, either not being encouraged to work, or not being ſufficient for what there is to do, content themſelves with cultivating juſt as much as is abſolutely neceſſary for their Subſiſtence. They have either lived ſingle, or married but late; or perhaps, after the Example of the Inhabitants of the Cities, they have refuſed to fulfil their Duty to Nature, to the State, and to a Wife. The Country deprived of Tillers, by this Expatria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inactivity, has yielded nothing; and the Depopulation of the State has daily increaſed, from the reciprocal and neceſſary Proportion between Subſiſtence and Population, and becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture alone can increaſe Subſiſtence. A ſingle Compariſon will ſufficiently evince the Truth and the Importance of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to thoſe who have not ſeen them already divulged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the Works of the <note n="*" place="bottom">The Marquis of Mirabeau.</note> Friend of Man.</p>

               <q>An old Roman, who was always ready to return to the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of his Field, ſubſiſted himſelf and his Family from one Acre of Land. A Savage who neither ſows nor cultivates, conſumes, in his ſingle Perſon, as much Game as require fifty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012243_0026_0F8A37BB94E021A8"/>
Acres to feed them. Conſequently <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Acres, might have five thouſand Subjects; while a Savage Chief, limited to the ſame Extent of Territory, could ſcarcely have twenty: ſuch an immenſe Diſproportion does A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture furniſh, in favour of Population. Obſerve theſe two great Extremes. A State becomes diſpeopled or peopled in that Proportion, by which it recedes from one of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and approaches to the other.</q>
Indeed it is evident, that wherever there is an Augmentation of Subſiſtence, an Increaſe of Population will ſoon follow; which again will ſtill further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Increaſe of Proviſions. In a State thus circumſtanced Men will abound, who, after they have furniſhed ſufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for the Service of War, of Commerce, of Religion, and for Arts and Profeſſions of every kind, will further alſo furniſh a Source for Colonies, who will extend the Name and the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Nation to diſtant Regions. There will enſue a Plenty of Commodities, the Superfluity of which will be exported to other Countries, to exchange for other Commodities, that are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at home; and the Balance, being received in Money, will make the Nation rich, reſpectable by its Neighbours, and happy. Agriculture, vigorouſly purſued, is equal to the Production of all theſe Benefits; and the preſent Age will enjoy the Glory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring it, by ſavouring and encouraging Cultivaters, and by forming Societies for the Promotion of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>I proceed at length to the fourth Cauſe of Depopulation, which is the Manner of treating ſick People in the Country. This has often affected me with the deepeſt Concern. I have been a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Maladies, which, in themſelves, would have been gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, have proved mortal from a pernicious Treatment: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that this Cauſe alone makes as great a Havock as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and certainly it requires the utmoſt Attention of Phyſicians, whoſe Duty it is to Labour for the Preſervation of Mankind. While we are employing our aſſiduous Cares on the more poliſhed and faſhionable Part of them in Cities, the larger and more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Moiety periſh in the Country; either by particular, or by highly epidemical, Diſeaſes, which, within a few Years paſt, have appeared in different Villages, and made no ſmall Ravage. This afflicting Conſideration has determined me to publiſh this little Work, which is ſolely intended for thoſe Patients, who, by their Diſtance from Phyſicians, are deprived of their Aſſiſtance. I ſhall not give a Detail of my Plan, which is very ſimple, in this Part; but content myſelf with affirming, I have uſed my utmoſt Care to render it the moſt uſeful I poſſibly could: and I dare hope, that if I have not fully diſplayed its utmoſt Advantages, I have at leaſt ſufficiently ſhewn thoſe pernicious Methods of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes, that ſhould inconteſtably be avoided. I am tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, the Deſign might be accompliſhed more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly than I have done it; but thoſe who are ſo capable of, do not attempt, it: I happen to be leſs timid; and I hope that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012243_0027_0F8A37BC4D54EEF0"/>
thinking Perſons will rather take it in good part of me, to have publiſhed a Book, the compoſing of which is rather diſagreeable from its very Facility; from the minute Details, which however are indiſpenſable; and from the Impoſſibility of diſcuſſing any Part of it (conſiſtently with the Plan) to the Bottom of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; or of diſplaying any new and uſeful Proſpect. It may be Compared, in ſome Reſpects, to the Works of a ſpiritual Guide, who was to write a Catechiſm for little Children.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time I am not ignorant there have already been a few Books calculated for Country Patients, who are remote from Succour: but ſome of theſe though publiſhed with a very good Purpoſe, produce a bad Effect. Of this kind are all Collections of Receipts or Remedies, without the leaſt Deſcription of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and of courſe without juſt Directions for the Exhibition, or Application, of them. Such, for Example, is the famous Collection of Madam FOUQUET, and ſome more in the ſame manner. Some others approach towards my Plan; but many of them have taken in too many Diſtempers, whence they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too voluminous. Beſides, they have not dwelt ſufficiently upon the Signs of the Diſeaſes; upon their Cauſes; the general Regimen in them, and the Miſmanagement of them. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are not generally as ſimple, and as eaſy to prepare, as they ought to be. In ſhort, the greater Part of their Writers ſeem, as they advanced, to have grown tired of their melancholy Taſk, and to have hurried them out too expeditiouſly. There are but two of them, which I muſt name with Reſpect; and which being propoſed on a Plan very like my own, are executed in a ſuperior Manner, that merits the higheſt Acknowledgements of the Publick. One of theſe Writers is M. ROSEN, firſt Phyſician of the Kingdom of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>; who, ſome Years ſince, employed his juſt Reputation to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the beſt Services to his Country Men. He has made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench from the Almanacs thoſe ridiculous Tales; thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Adventures; thoſe pernicious aſtrological Injunctions, which there, as well as here, anſwer no End but that of keeping up Ignorance, Credulity, Superſtition, and the falſeſt Prejudices on the intereſting Articles of Health, of Diſeaſes, and of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. He has alſo taken Care to publiſh ſimple plain Treatiſes on the moſt popular Diſtempers; which he has ſubſtituted in the Place of the former Heap of Abſurdities. Theſe conciſe Works however, which appear annually in their Almanacs, are not yet tranſlated from the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> ſo that I was unqualified to make any Extracts from them. The other is the Baron VAN SWEITEN, firſt Phyſician to their Imperial Majeſties, who, about two Years ſince, has effected for the Uſe of the Army, what I now attempt for ſick People in the Country. Though my Work was greatly advanced, when I firſt ſaw his, I have taken ſome Paſſages from it: and had our Plans been exactly alike, I ſhould imagine I had done the Public more Service, by endeavouring to extend the Reading of his Book, than by publiſhing a new one. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012243_0028_0F8A37BE27C1FE68"/>
as he is ſilent on many Articles, of which I have treated dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſively; as he has treated of many Diſtempers, which did not come within my Plan; and has ſaid nothing of ſome others which I could not omit; our two Works, without entering into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſuperior Merit of the Baron's, are very different, with Regard to the Subject of the Diſeaſes: tho' in ſuch as we have both conſidered, I account it an Honour to me to find, we have almoſt conſtantly proceeded upon the ſame Principles.</p>
            <p>The preſent Work is by no means addreſſed to ſuch Phyſicians, as are thoroughly accompliſhed in their Profeſſion; yet poſſibly, beſides my particular medical Friends, ſome others may read it. I beg the Favour of all ſuch fully to conſider the Intention, the Spirit, of the Author, and not to cenſure him, as a Phyſician, from the Compoſition of this Book. I even adviſe them here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forbear peruſing it; as a Production that can teach them nothing. Such as read, in order to criticize, will find a much greater Scope for exerciſing that Talent on the other Pamphlets I have publiſhed. It were certainly unjuſt that a Performance, whoſe ſole abſtracted Object is the Health and Service of my Countrymen, ſhould ſubject me to any diſagreeable Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and a Writer may fairly plead an Exemption from any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Cenſure, who has had the Courage to execute a work, which cannot pretend to a Panegyric.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed thus much in general, I muſt; enter into ſome Detail of thoſe Means, that ſeem the moſt likely to me, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the beneficial Conſequences, which, I hope, may reſult to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from my preſent Endeavours. I ſhall afterwards give an Explanation of ſome Terms which I could not avoid uſing, and which, perhaps, are not generally underſtood.</p>
            <p>The Title of <hi>Advice to the People,</hi> was not ſuggeſted to me by an Illuſion, which might perſuade me, this Book would become a Piece of Furniture, as it were, in the Houſe of every Peaſant. Nineteen out of twenty will probably never know of its Exiſtence. Many may be unable to read, and ſtill more unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, it, plain and ſimple as it is. I have principally calculated it for the Peruſal of intelligent and charitable Perſons who live in the Country; and who ſeem to have, as it were, a Call from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to aſſiſt their leſs intelligent poor Neighbours with their Advice.</p>
            <p>It is obvious, that the firſt Gentlemen I have my Eye upon, are the Clergy. There is not a ſingle Village, a Hamlet, nor even the Houſe of an Alien in the Country, that has not a Right to the good Offices of ſome one of this Order: And I aſſure myſelf there are a great Number of them, who, heartily affected with the Diſtreſs of their ailing Flocks, have wiſhed many hundred times, that it were in their Power to give their Pariſhoners ſome bodily Help, at the very time they were diſpoſing them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death; or ſo far to Delay the Fatality of the Diſtemper, that the Sick might have an Opportunity of living more religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012243_0029_0F8A37BEAF92A660"/>
afterwards. I ſhall think myſelf happy, if ſuch truly reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eccleſiaſtics ſhall find any Reſources in this Performance, that may conduce to the Accompliſhment of their beneficent Intentions. Their Regard, their Love for their People; their frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to viſit their principal Neighbours; their Duty to root out all unreaſonable Prejudices, and Superſtition; their Charity, their Learning; the Facility, with which their general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Phyſics, qualifies them to comprehend thoroughly all the medical Truths, and Contents of this Piece, are ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convince me, that they will have the greateſt Influence to procure that Reformation, in the Adminiſtration of Phyſick, to poor Country People, which is ſo neceſſary, ſo deſirable an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, I dare aſſure myſelf of the Concurrence of Gentlemen of Quality and Opulence, in their different Pariſhes and Eſtates, whoſe Advice is highly regarded by their Inferiors; who are ſo powerfully, adapted to diſcourage a wrong, and to promote a right Practice, of which they will eaſily diſcern all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The many Inſtances I have ſeen of their entering, with great Facility, into all the Plan and Conduct of a Cure; their Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and even Earneſtneſs to comfort the Sick in their Villages; and the Generoſity with which they prevent their Neceſſities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to hope, from judging of thoſe I have not the Pleaſure to know, by theſe whom I have, that they will eagerly embrace an Opportunity of promoting a new Method of doing good in their Neighbourhood. Real Charity will apprehend the great Probability there is of doing Miſchief, tho' with the beſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for want of a proper Knowledge of material Circumſtances; and the very Fear of that Miſchief may ſometimes ſuſpend the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſuch Charity; notwithſtanding it muſt ſeize, with the moſt humane Avidity, every Light that can contribute to its own beneficent Exertion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Perſons who are rich, or at leaſt in eaſy Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom their Diſpoſition, their Employments, or the Nature of their Property, fixes in the Country, where they are happy in doing good, muſt be delighted to have ſome proper Directions, for the Conduct and Effectuation of their charitable Intentions.</p>
            <p>In every Village, where there are any Perſons, of theſe three Conditions, they are always readily apprized of the Diſtempers in it, by their poor Neighbours coming to intreat a little Soup, Venice Treacle, Wines, Biſcuits, or any thing they imagine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their ſick Folks. In Conſequence of ſome Queſtions to the Byſtanders, or of a Viſit to the ſick Perſon, they will judge at leaſt of <hi>what kind</hi> the Diſeaſe is; and by their prudent Advice they may be able to prevent a Multitude of Evils. They will give them ſome Nitre inſtead of Venice Treacle; Barley, or ſweet Whey, in lieu of Soup. They will adviſe them to have Recourſe to Glyſters, or Bathings of their Feet, rather than to Wine; and order them Gruel rather than Biſcuits. A Man would ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012243_0030_0F8A37BF4C902BD8"/>
'till after the Expiration of a few Years, how much Good might be effected by ſuch proper Regards, ſo eaſily comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and often repeated. At firſt indeed there may be ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in eradicating old Prejudices, and inveterately bad Cuſtoms; but whenever theſe were removed, good Habits would ſtrike forth full as ſtrong Roots, and I hope that no Perſon would be inclined to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>It may be unneceſſary to declare, that I have more Expectation from the Care and Goodneſs of the Ladies, than from thoſe of their Spouſes, their Fathers or Brothers. A more active Charity, a more durable Patience, a more domeſtic Life; a Sagacity, which I have greatly admired in many Ladies both in Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that diſpoſes them to obſerve, with great Exactneſs; and to unravel, as it were, the ſecret Cauſes of the Symptoms, with a Facility that would do Honour to very good Practitioners, and with a Talent adapted to engage the Confidence of the Patient: —All theſe, I ſay, are ſo many characteriſtical Marks of their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this important and neighbourly Duty; nor are they a few, who fulfil it with a Zeal, that merits the higheſt Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renders them excellent Models for the Imitation of others.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are entruſted with the Education of Youth, may alſo be ſuppoſed ſufficiently intelligent to take ſome Part in this Work; and I am ſatisfied that much Good might reſult from their undertaking it. I heartily wiſh they would not only ſtudy to <hi>diſtinguiſh the Diſtemper</hi> (in which the principal, but by no means an inſuperable, Difficulty conſiſts; and to do which I hope I have conſiderably put them in the Way) but I would have them learn alſo the Manner of applying Remedies. Many of them ſhave; I have known ſome who bleed, and who have given Glyſters very expertly. This however all may eaſily learn; and perhaps it would not be imprudent, if the Art of bleeding well and ſafely were reckoned a neceſſary Qualification, when they are examined for their Employment. Theſe Faculties, that of eſtimating the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Fever, and how to apply and to dreſs Bliſters, may be of great Uſe within the Neighbourhood of their Reſidence. Their Schools, which are not frequently over-crouded, employ but a few of their daily Hours; the greater Part of them have no Land to cultivate; and to what better Uſe can they apply their Leiſure, than to the Aſſiſtance and Comfort of the Sick? The moderate Price of their Service may be ſo aſcertained, as to incommode no Perſon; and this little Emolument might render their own Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the more agreeable: beſides which, theſe little Avocations might prevent their being drawn aſide ſometimes, by Reaſon of their Facility and frequent Leiſure, ſo as to contract a Habit of drinking too often. Another Benefit would alſo accrue from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming them to this kind of Practice, which is, that being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the Care of ſick People, and having frequent Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to write, they would be the better qualified, in difficult Caſes,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012243_0031_0F8A37C00B998738"/>
to adviſe with thoſe, who were thought further neceſſary to be conſulted.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, even among Labourers, there may be many, for ſome ſuch I have known, who being endued with good natural Senſe and Judgment, and abounding with Benevolence, will read this Book with Attention, and eagerly extend the Maxims and the Methods it recommends.</p>
            <p>And finally I hope that many Surgeons, who are ſpread about the Country, and who practice Phyſic in their Neighbourhood, will peruſe it; will carefully enter into the Principles eſtabliſhed in it, and will conform to its Directions; tho' a little different perhaps from ſuch as they may have hitherto practiſed. They will perceive a Man may learn at any Age, and of any Perſon; and it may be hoped they will not think it too much Trouble, to reform ſome of their Notions in a Science, which is not properly within their Profeſſion (and to the Study of which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inſtituted) by thoſe of a Perſon, who is ſolely employed in it, and who has had many Aſſiſtances of which they are deprived.</p>
            <p>Midwives may alſo find their Attendance more efficacious, as ſoon as they are thoroughly diſpoſed to be better informed.</p>
            <p>It were heartily to be wiſhed, that the greater Part of them had been better inſtructed in the Art they profeſs. The Inſtances of Miſchief that might have been avoided, by their being better qualified, are frequent enough to make us with there may be no Repetition of them, which it may be poſſible to prevent. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems impoſſible, when Perſons in Authority are zealouſly inclined to prevent every ſuch Evil; and it is time they ſhould be properly informed of one ſo eſſentially hurtful to Society.</p>
            <p>The Preſcriptions I have given conſiſt of the moſt ſimple Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and I have adjoined the Manner of preparing them ſo fully, that I hope no Perſon can be at any Loſs in that Reſpect. At the ſame time, that no one may imagine they are the leſs uſeful and efficacious for their Simplicity, I declare, they are the ſame I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the City for the moſt opulent Patients. This Simplicity is founded in Nature: the Mixture, or rather the Confuſion, of a Multitude of Drugs is ridiculous. If they have the very ſame Virtues, for what Purpoſe are they blended? It were more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to confine ourſelves to that, which is the moſt effectual. If their Virtues are different, the Effect of one deſtroys, or leſſens, the Effect of the other; and the Medicine ceaſes to prove a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>I have given no Direction, which is not very practicable and eaſy to execute; nevertheleſs it will be diſcernible, that ſome few are not calculated for the Multitude, which I readily grant. However I have given them, becauſe I did not loſe Sight of ſome Perſons; who, tho' not ſtrictly of the Multitude, or Peaſantry, do live in the Country, and cannot always procure a Phyſician as ſoon, or for as long a Time, as they gladly would.</p>
            <p>A great Number of the Remedies are entirely of the Country
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012243_0032_0F8A37C0CCF0CA38"/>
Growth, and may be prepared there; but there are others which muſt be had from the Apothecaries. I have ſet down the Price,<note n="*" place="bottom">This oeconomical Information was doubtleſs very proper, where our judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and humane Author publiſhed it; but notwithſtanding his excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for giving it, we think it leſs neceſſary here, where many Country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen furniſh themſelves with larger or ſmaller Medicine Cheſts, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their poor ſick Neighbours; and in a Country, where the ſettled parochial Poor are provided with Medicines, as well as with other Neceſſaries, at a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Expence. Beſides, tho' we would not ſuppoſe our Country Apothecaries leſs conſiderate or kind than others, we acknowledge our Apprehenſion, that ſuch a Valuation of their Drugs (ſome of which often vary in their Price) might diſpoſe a few of them, rather to diſcountenance the Extenſion of a Work, ſo well intended and excuted as Dr. TISSOT's; a Work, which may not be wholly unuſeful to ſome of the moſt judicious among them, and will he really neceſſary for the reſt. <hi>K.</hi>
               </note> at which I am perſuaded all the Country Apothecaries will retail them to a Peaſant, who is not eſteemed a rich one. I have marked the Price, not from any Apprehenſion of their being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on in the Purchaſe, for this I do not apprehend: but that, ſeeing the Cheapneſs of the Preſcription, they may not be afraid to buy it. The neceſſary Doſe of the Medicine, for each Diſeaſe, may generally be purchaſed for leſs Money than would be expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Meat, Wine, Biſcuit, and other improper things. But ſhould the Price of the Medicine, however moderate, exceed the Circumſtances of the Sick, doubtleſs the Common Purſe, or the Poors-Box will defray it. Moreover there are in many Country Places Noblemens Houſes, ſome of whom charitably contribute an annual Sum towards buying of Medicines for poor Patients; without adding to which Sum, I would only intreat the Favour of each of them to alter the Objects of it, and to allow their ſick Neighbours the Remedies and the Regimen directed here, inſtead of ſuch as they formerly diſtributed among them.</p>
            <p>It may ſtill be objected, that many Country Places are very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from large Towns; from which Circumſtance a poor Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is incapable of procuring himſelf a ſeaſonable and neceſſary Supply in his Illneſs. I readily admit, that in fact, there are many Villages very remote from ſuch Places as Apothecaries reſide in. Yet, if we except a few among the Mountains, there are but very few of them above three or four Leagues from ſome little Town, where there always lives ſome Surgeon, or ſome Vender of Drugs. Perhaps however, even at this Time, indeed, there may not be many thus provided; but they will take Care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with ſuch Materials, as ſoon as they have a good Proſpect of ſelling them, which may conſtitute a ſmall, but new, Branch of Commerce for them. I have carefully ſet down the Time, for which each Medicine will keep, without ſpoiling. There is a very frequent Occaſion for ſome particular ones, and of ſuch the School-maſters may lay in a Stock. I alſo imagine, if they heartily enter into my Views, they will furniſh themſelves with ſuch Implements, as may be neceſſary in the Courſe of their Attendance. If any of them were unable to provide themſelves
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012243_0033_0F8A37C18D468F40"/>
with a ſufficient Number of good Lancets, an <hi>Apparatus</hi> for Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and a Glyſter Syringe (for want of which laſt a Pipe and Bladder may be occaſionally ſubſtituted) the Pariſh might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them, and the ſame Inſtruments might do for the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing School-maſter. It is hardly to be expected, that all Perſons in that Employment would be able, or even inclined, to learn the Way of uſing them with Addreſs; but one Perſon who did, might be ſufficient for whatever Occaſions ſhould occur in this Way in ſome contigious Villages; with very little Neglect of their Functions among their Scholars.</p>
            <p>Daily Inſtances of Perſons, who come from different Parts to conſult me, without being capable of anſwering the Queſtions I aſk them, and the like Complaints of many other Phyſicians on the ſame Account, engaged me to write the laſt Chapter of this Work. I ſhall conclude this Introduction with ſome Remarks, neceſſary to facilitate the Knowledge of a few Terms, which were unavoidable in the Courſe of it.</p>
            <p>The Pulſe commonly beats in a Perſon in good Health, from the Age of eighteen or twenty to about ſixty-ſix Years, between ſixty and ſeventy Times in a Minute. It ſometimes comes ſhort of this in old Perſons, and in very young Children it beats quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: until the Age of three or four Years the Difference amounts at leaſt to a third; after which it diminiſhes by Degrees.</p>
            <p>An intelligent Perſon, who ſhall often touch and attend to his own Pulſe, and frequently to other People's, will be able to judge, with ſufficient Exactneſs, of the Degree of a Fever in a ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If the Strokes are but one third above their Number in a healthy State, the Fever is not very violent: which it is as often as it amounts to half as many more as in Health. It is very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, and may be generally pronounced mortal, when there are two Strokes in the Time of one. We muſt not however judge of the Pulſe ſolely by its Quickneſs, but by its Strength or Weakneſs; its Hardneſs or Softneſs; and the Regularity or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of it.</p>
            <p>There is no Occaſion to define the ſtrong and the feeble Pulſe. The Strength of it generally affords a good Prognoſtic, and, ſuppoſing it too ſtrong, it may eaſily be lowered. The weak Pulſe is often very menacing.</p>
            <p>If the Pulſe, in meeting the Touch, excites the Notion of a dry Stroke, as though the Artery conſiſted of Wood, or of ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, we term it <hi>hard</hi>; the oppoſite to which is called <hi>ſoft,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally promiſes better. If it be ſtrong and yet ſoft, even though it be quick, it may be conſidered as a very hopeful Circumſtance. But if it is ſtrong and hard, that is commonly a Token of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and indicates Bleeding and the cooling Regimen. Should it be, at the ſame time, ſmall, quick and hard, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is indeed very preſſing.</p>
            <p>We call that Pulſe regular, a continued Succeſſion of whoſe Strokes are made in equal Intervals of Time; and in which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012243_0034_0F8A37C24D7A64C8"/>
not a ſingle Stroke is wanting (ſince if that is its State, it is called an intermitting Pulſe.) The Beats or Pulſations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuppoſed to reſemble each other ſo exactly in Quality too, that one is not ſtrong, and the next alternately feeble.</p>
            <p>As long as the State of the Pulſe is promiſing, and Reſpiration or Breathing is free; when the Brain does not ſeem to be greatly affected; while the Patient takes his Medicines, and they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Conſequence that was expected; and he both preſerves his Strength pretty well, and continues ſenſible of his Situation, we may reaſonably hope for his Cure. As often as all, or the greater Number of theſe characterizing Circumſtances are wanting, he is in very conſiderable Danger.</p>
            <p>The Stoppage of Perſpiration is often mentioned in the Courſe of this Work. We call the Diſcharge of that Fluid which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually paſſes off through the Pores of the Skin, <hi>Tranſpiration</hi>; and which, though inviſible, is very conſiderable. For if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Health eats and drinks to the Weight of eight Pounds daily, he does not diſcharge four of them by Stool and Urine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Remainder paſſing off by inſenſible Tranſpiration. It may eaſily be conceived, that if ſo conſiderable a Diſcharge is ſtopt, or conſiderably leſſened; and if this Fluid, which ought to tranſpire through the Skin, ſhould be transferred to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Part, it muſt occaſion ſome dangerous Complaint. In fact this is one of the moſt frequent Cauſes of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>To conclude very briefly—All the Directions in the following Treatiſe are ſolely deſigned for ſuch Patients, as cannot have the Attendance of a Phyſician. I am far from ſuppoſing, they ought to exclude one, even in thoſe Diſeaſes, of which I have treated in the fulleſt Manner: and the Moment a Phyſician arrives, they ought to be laid aſide. The Confidence repoſed in him ſhould be entire, or there ſhould be none: the Succeſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is founded in that. It is his Province to judge of the Diſeaſe, to ſelect Medicines againſt it; and it is eaſy to foreſee the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that may follow, from propoſing to him to conſult with any others, preferably to thoſe he may chuſe to conſult with; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have ſucceeded in the Treatment of another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, whoſe Caſe they ſuppoſe to have been nearly the ſame with the preſent Caſe. This were much the ſame, as to order a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to make a Shoe for one Foot by the Pattern of another Shoe, rather than by the Meaſure he has juſt taken.<note place="bottom">N. B. Though a great Part of this judicious Introduction is leſs applicable to the political Circumſtances of the Britiſh Empire, than to thoſe of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for which it was calculated; we think the good Senſe and the unaffected Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm which animate it, will ſupercede any Apology for our tranſlating it. — The ſerious Truth is this, that a thorough Attention to Population ſeems never to have been more expedient for ourſelves, than after ſo bloody and expenſive, though ſuch a glorious and ſucceſsful War, while our enterprizing Neighbours, who will never be our Friends, are ſo earneſt to recruit their Numbers; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Agriculture; and to force a Vent for their Manufactures, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſiderably effected, without a ſenſible Detriment to our own. Beſides which, the unavoidable Drain from the People here, towards an effectual Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, Improvement, and Security of our Conqueſts, demands a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. <hi>K.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER I. Of the moſt uſual Cauſes of popular Maladies.</head>
               <p>SECT. 1. THE moſt frequent Cauſes of Diſeaſes commonly incident to Country People are, 1. Exceſſive La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, continued for a very conſiderable Time.— Sometimes they ſink down at once in a State of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtion and Faintneſs, from which they ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: but they are oftener attacked with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Diſeaſe, as a Quinſey, a Pleuriſy, or an Inflammation of the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>There are two Methods of preventing theſe Evils: one is, to avoid the Cauſe which produces them; but this is frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Another is, when ſuch exceſſive Labour has been una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, to allay their Fatigue, by a free Uſe of ſome temperate refreſhing Drink; eſpecially by ſweet Whey, by Butter-milk, or by <note n="*" place="bottom">This ſuppoſes they are not greatly heated, as well as fatigued, by their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Exerciſe, in which Circumſtance free and ſudden Draughts of cooling Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors might be very pernicious; and it evidently alſo ſuppoſes thoſe Drinks to be thus given, rather in Summer than in very cold Weather, as the Juice of the unripe Grapes, and the other freſh Fruits ſufficiently aſcertain the Seaſon of the Year. We think the Addition of Vinegar to their Water will ſcarcely ever be neceſſary in this or the adjoining Iſland, on ſuch Occaſions. The Caution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in this Note is indeed abundantly enforced by Dr. TISSOT, § 4: but conſidering the Perſons to whom this Work is more particularly addreſſed, we were willing to prevent every Poſſibility of a Miſtake, in ſo neceſſary, and ſometimes ſo vital, a Point. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Water, to a Quart of which a Wine-glaſs of Vinegar may
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012243_0036_0F8A37C3CEB993B8"/>
be added; or inſtead of that, the expreſſed Juice of Grapes not fully ripe, or even of Gooſberies or Cherries: which wholeſome and agreeable Liquors are refreſhing and cordial. I ſhall treat a little lower, of inflammatory Diſorders. The Inanition or Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, though accompanied with Symptoms different from the former, has yet ſome Affinity to them, with Reſpect to their Cauſe, which is a kind of general Exſiccation or Dryneſs. I have known ſome cured from this Cauſe by Whey, ſucceeded by tepid Baths, and afterwards by Cow's Milk; for in ſuch Caſes hot Medicines and high Nouriſhment are fatal.</p>
               <p>§ 2. There is another Kind of Exhauſtion or Emptineſs, which may be termed real Emptineſs, and is the Conſequence of great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, the Want of ſufficient Nouriſhment, bad Food, unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Drink, and exceſſive Labour. In Caſes thus circumſtances, good Soups and a little Wine are very proper. Such hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n however very ſeldom in this Country: I believe they are frequent in ſome others, eſpecially in many Provinces of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. A ſecond and very common Source of Diſorders ariſes, from Peoples' lying down and repoſing, when very hot, in a cold Place. This at once ſtops Perſpiration, the Matter of which being thrown upon ſome internal Part, proves the Cauſe of many violent Diſeaſes, particularly of Quinſeys, Inflammations of the Breaſt, Pleuriſies, and inflammatory Cholics. Theſe Evils, from this Cauſe, may always be avoided by avoiding the Cauſe, which is one of thoſe that deſtroy a great Number of People. However, when it has occurred, as ſoon as the firſt Symptoms of the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are perceivable, which ſometimes does not happen till ſeveral Days after, the Patient ſhould immediately be bled; his Legs ſhould be put into Water moderately hot, and he ſhould drink plentifully of the tepid Infuſion marked No. 1. Such Aſſiſtances frequently prevent the Increaſe of theſe Diſorders; which, on the contrary, are greatly aggravated, if hot Medicines are given to ſweat the Patient.</p>
               <p>§ 4. A third Cauſe is drinking cold Water, when a Perſon is extremely hot. This acts in the ſame Manner with the ſecond; but its Conſequences are commonly more ſudden and violent. I have ſeen moſt terrible Examples of it, in Quinſeys, Inflammations of the Breaſt, Cholics, Inflammations of the Liver, and all the Parts of the Belly, with prodigious Swellings, Vomitings, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Urine, and inexpreſſible Anguiſh. The moſt availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remedies in ſuch Caſes, from this Cauſe, are, a plentiful
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012243_0037_0F8A37C5A8D3F720"/>
Bleeding at the Onſet, a very copious Drinking of warm Water, to which one fifth Part of Whey ſhould be added; or of the Ptiſan No. 2, or of an Emulſion of Almonds, all taken warm. Fomentations of warm Water ſhould alſo be applied to the Throat, the Breaſt and Belly, with Glyſters of the ſame, and a little Milk. In this Caſe, as well as in the preceding one, (§ 3.) a <hi>Semicupium,</hi> or Half-bath of warm Water has ſometimes been attended with immediate Relief. It ſeems really aſtoniſhing, that labouring People ſhould ſo often habituate themſelves to this pernicious Cuſtom, which they know to be very dangerous even to their Beaſts. There are none of them, who will not prevent their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from drinking while they are hot; eſpecially if they are juſt going to put them up. Each of them knows that if he lets them drink in that State, they might poſſibly burſt with it; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he is not afraid of incurring the like Danger himſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is not the only Caſe, in which the Peaſant ſeems to have more Attention to the Health of his Cattle, than to his own.</p>
               <p>§ 5. The fourth Cauſe, which indeed affects every Body, but more particularly the Labourer, is, the Inconſtancy of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We ſhift all at once, many times a Day, from Heat to Cold, and from Cold to Heat, in a more remarkable Manner, and more ſuddenly, than in moſt other Countries. This makes Diſtempers from Defluction and Cold ſo common with us: and it ſhould make us careful to go rather a little more warmly cloathed, than the Seaſon may ſeem to require; to have Recourſe to our Winter-cloathing early in Autumn, and not to part with it too early in the Spring. Prudent Labourers, who ſtrip while they are at Work, take care to put on their Cloaths in the Evening when they return home.<note n="*" place="bottom">This good Advice is enforced in a Note, by the Editor of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who obſerves, it ſhould be ſtill more cloſely attended to, in Places, where Rivers, Woods, or Mountains retain, as it were, a conſiderable Humidity; and where the Evenings are, in every Seaſon, cold and moiſt. It is a very proper Caution too in our own variable Climate, and in many of our Colonies in North <hi>America. K.</hi>
                  </note> Thoſe, who from Negligence, are ſatisfied with hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon their Country Tools, frequently experience, on their Return, the very unhappy Effects of it. There are ſome, tho' not many Places, where the Air itſelf is unwholeſome, more from its particular (Quality, than from its Changes of Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as at <hi>Villeneuve,</hi> and ſtill more at <hi>Noville,</hi> and in ſome other Villages ſituated among the Marſhes which border on the <hi>Rhone.</hi> Theſe Countries are particularly ſubject to intermitting Fevers, of which I ſhall treat briefly hereafter.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Such ſudden Changes are often attended with great Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Rain, and even cold Rain, in the middle of a very hot day; when the Labourer who was bathed, as it were, in a hot Sweat, is at once moiſtened in cold Water; which occaſions the ſame Diſtempers, as the ſudden Tranſition from Heat to Cold, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the ſame Remedies. If the Sun or a hot Air ſucceed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012243_0038_0F8A37C6244F9BC8"/>
to ſuch a Shower, the Evil is conſiderably lighter: but if the Cold continues, many are often greatly incommoded by it.</p>
               <p>A Traveller is ſometimes thoroughly and unavoidably wet with Mud; the ill Conſequence of which is often inconſiderable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he changes his Cloaths immediately when he ſets up. I have known fatal Pleuriſies enſue from omitting this Caution. Whenever the Body or the Limbs are wet, nothing can be more uſeful than bathing them in warm Water. If the Legs only have been wet, it may be ſufficient to bath them. I have radically, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, cured Perſons ſubject to violent Cholics, as often as their Feet were wet, by perſuading them to purſue this Advice. The Bath proves ſtill more effectual, if a little Soap be diſſolved in it.</p>
               <p>§ 7. A fifth Cauſe, which is ſeldom attended to, probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed becauſe it produces leſs violent Conſequences, and yet is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hurtful, is the common Cuſtom in all Villages, of having their Ditches or Dunghills directly under their Windows. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Vapours are continually exhaling from them, which in time cannot fail of being prejudicial, and muſt contribute to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce putrid Diſeaſes. Thoſe who are accuſtomed to the Smell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſenſible of it: but the Cauſe nevertheleſs, does not ceaſe to be unwholeſomely active; and ſuch as are unuſed to it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Impreſſion in all its Force.</p>
               <p>§ 8. There are ſome Villages, in which, after the Curtain Lines are eraſed, watery marſhy Places remain in the Room of them. The Effect of this is ſtill more dangerous, becauſe that putrified Water, which ſtagnates during the hot Seaſon, ſuffers its Vapours to exhale more eaſily, and more abundantly, than that in the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lines did. Having ſet out for <hi>Pully le Grand</hi> in 1759, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of an epidemical putrid Fever which raged there, I was ſenſible, on traverſing the Village, of the Infection from thoſe Marſhes; nor could I doubt of their being the Cauſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as well as of another like it, which had prevailed there five Years before. In other Reſpects the Village is wholeſomly ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It were to be wiſhed ſuch Accidents were obviated by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſtagnated Places: or, at leaſt, by removing them and the Dunghills, as far as poſſible from the Spot, where we live and lodge.</p>
               <p>§ 9. To this Cauſe may alſo be added the Neglect of the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to air their Lodgings. It is well known that too cloſe an Air occaſions the moſt perplexing malignant Fevers; and the poor Country People breath no other in their own Houſes. Their Lodgings, which are very ſmall, and which notwithſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, (both Day and Night) the Father, Mother, and ſeven or eight Children, beſides ſome Animals, are never kept open during ſix Months in the Year, and very ſeldom during the other ſix. I have found the Air ſo bad in many of theſe Houſes, that I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if their Inhabitants did not often go out into the free open Air, they muſt all periſh in a little time. It is eaſy, however, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all the Evils ariſing from this Source, by opening the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012243_0039_0F8A37C6CF9AACB8"/>
daily: ſo very practicable a Precaution muſt be followed with the happieſt Conſequences.</p>
               <p>§ 10. I conſider Drunkenneſs as a ſixth Cauſe, not indeed as producing epidemical Diſeaſes, but which deſtroys, as it were, by Retail, at all times, and every where. The poor Wretches, who abandon themſelves to it, are ſubject to frequent Inflammations of the Breaſt, and to Pleuriſies, which often carry them off in the Flower of their Age. If they ſometimes eſcape through theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Maladies, they ſink, a long time before the ordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of old Age, into all its Infirmities; and eſpecially into an Aſthma, which terminates in a Dropſy of the Breaſt. Their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies worn out by Exceſs, do not comply and concur, as they ought, with the Force or Operation of Remedies; and Diſeaſes of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reſulting from this Cauſe, are almoſt always incurable. It ſeems happy enough, that Society loſes nothing in parting with theſe Subjects, who are a Diſhonour to it; and whoſe brutal Souls are, in ſome Meaſure, dead, long before their Carcaſes.</p>
               <p>§ 11. The Proviſions of the common People are alſo frequently one Cauſe of popular Maladies. This happens 1ſt, whenever the Corn, not well ripened, or not well got in, in bad<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus I have ventured to tranſlate <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </hi> (<hi>Summers</hi>) to apply it to this and the neighbouring Iſlands. Their Harveſts in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> perhaps are earlier, and may occur in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that of ſome particular Grain, probably ſtill earlier. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Harveſts,</hi> has contracted an unwholeſome Quality. Fortunately however this is ſeldom the Caſe; and the Danger attending the Uſe of it may be leſſened by ſome Precautions, ſuch as thoſe of waſhing and drying the Grain compleatly; of mixing a little Wine with the Dough, in kneading it; by allowing it a little more Time to ſwell or riſe, and by baking it a little more. 2dly, The fairer and better ſaved Part of the Wheat is ſometimes damaged in the Farmer's Houſe: either becauſe he does not take due Care of it, or becauſe he has no convenient Place to preſerve it, only from one Summer to the next. It has often happened to me, on enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of theſe bad Houſes to be ſtruck with the Smell of Wheat that has been ſpoiled. Nevertheleſs, there are known and eaſy Methods to provide againſt this by a little Care; though I ſhall not enter into a Detail of them. It is ſufficient to make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſenſible, that ſince their chief Suſtenance conſiſts of Corn, their Health muſt neceſſarily be impaired by what is bad. 3dly, That Wheat, which is good, is often made into bad Bread, by not letting it riſe ſufficiently; by baking it too little, and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too long. All theſe Errors have their troubleſome Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences on thoſe who eat it; but in a greater Degree on Children and Valetudinarians, or weakly People.</p>
               <p>Tarts or Cakes may be conſidered as an Abuſe of Bread, and this in ſome Villages is increaſed to a very pernicious Height. The Dough is almoſt conſtantly bad, and often unleavened, ill
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012243_0040_0F8A37C78D3BB5E8"/>
baked, greaſy, and ſtuffed with either Fat or ſour Ingredients, which compound one of the moſt indigeſtible Aliments imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Women and Children conſume the moſt of this Food, and are the very Subjects for whom it is the moſt improper: little Children eſpecially, who live ſometimes for many ſucceſſive Days on theſe Tarts, are, for the greater Part, unable to digeſt them perfectly. Hence they receive a <note n="*" place="bottom">The Abuſe juſt mentioned can ſcarcely be intended to forbid the moderate Uſe of good Paſtry, the Dough of which is well raiſed and well baked, the Flour and other Ingredients found, and the Paſte not overcharged with Butter, even though it were ſweet and freſh. But the Abuſe of Alum and other pernicious Materials introduced by our Bakers, may too juſtly be conſidered as one horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Source of thoſe Diſeaſes of Children, &amp;c. which our humane and judicious Author mentions here. What he adds, concerning the Paſtries being rendered ſtill more unwholeſome by the ſour Fruits ſometimes baked in it, is true with Reſpect to thoſe Children and others, who are liable to Complaints from Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abounding in the Bowels; and for all thoſe who are ricketty or ſcrophulous, from a cold and viſcid State of their Humours. But as to healthy ſanguine Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are advanced and lively, and others of a ſanguine or bilious Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, we are advanced and lively, and others of a ſanguine or bilious Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, we are not to ſuppoſe a moderate Variety of this Food injurious to them; when we conſider, that the Sharpneſs and Crudity of the Fruit is conſiderably corrected by the long Application of Fire; and that they are the Produce of Summer, when Bilious Diſeaſes are moſt frequent. This ſuggeſts however no bad Hint againſt making them immoderately ſweet. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Source of Obſtructions in the Bowels of the Belly, and of a ſlimy Viſcidity or Thickiſhneſs, throughout the Maſs of Humours, which throws them into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſes from Weakneſs; ſlow Fevers, a Hectic, the Rickets, the King's Evil, and Feebleneſs, for the miſerable Remainder of their Days. Probably indeed there is nothing more unwholeſome than Dough not ſufficiently leavened, ill baked, greaſy and ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Addition of Fruits. Beſides, if we conſider theſe Tarts in an oeconomical View, they muſt be found inconvenient for the Peaſant, on that Account too.</p>
               <p>Some other Cauſes of Maladies may alſo be referred to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Food, tho' leſs grievous and leſs frequent, into a full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of which it is very difficult to enter: I ſhall therefore conclude that Article with this general Remark; that it is the Care which Peaſants uſually take in eating ſlowly, and in chewing very well, that very greatly leſſens the Dangers from a bad Regimen: and I am convinced they conſtitute one of the greateſt Cauſes of that Health they enjoy. We may further add indeed the Exerciſe which the Peaſant uſes, and his long abiding in the open Air, where he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes three fourths of his Life; beſides (which are alſo conſiderable Advantages) his happy Cuſtom of going ſoon to Bed, and of riſing very early. It were to be wiſhed, that in theſe Reſpects, and perhaps on many other Accounts, the Inhabitants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were effectually propoſed as Models for reforming the Citizens.</p>
               <p>§ 12. We ſhould not omit, in enumerating the Cauſes of Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies among Country People, the Conſtruction of their Houſes, a great many of which either lean, as it were, cloſe to a higher Ground, or are ſunk a little into the Earth. Each of theſe Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012243_0041_0F8A37C84B8A0290"/>
ſubjects them to conſiderable Humidity; which is certain greatly to incommode the Inhabitants, and to ſpoil their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if they have any Quantity in Store; which, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is another, and not the leaſt important, Source of their Diſeaſes. A hardy Labourer is not immediately ſenſible of the bad Influence of this moiſt and marſhy Habitation; but they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at the long Run, and I have abundantly obſerved their moſt evident bad Effects, eſpecially on Women in Child-bed, on Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and in Perſons recovering of a preceding Diſeaſe. It would be eaſy to prevent this Inconvenience, by raiſing the Ground on which the Houſe ſtood, ſome or ſeveral Inches above the Level of the adjacent Soil, by a Bed of Gravel, of ſmall Flints, pounded Bricks, Coals, or ſuch other Materials; and by avoiding to build immediately cloſe to, or, as it were, under a much higher Soil. This Object, perhaps, may well deſerve the Attention of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and I earneſtly adviſe as many as do build, to obſerve the neceſſary Precautions on this Head. Another, which would coſt ſtill leſs Trouble, is to give the Front of their Houſes an Expoſure to the South-Eaſt. This Expoſure, ſuppoſing all other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Building and its Situation to be alike, is both the moſt wholeſome and moſt advantageous. I have ſeen it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, very often neglected, without the leaſt Reaſon being aſſigned for not preferring it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Admonitions may poſſibly be thought of little Conſequence by three fourths of the People. I take the Liberty of reminding them, however that they are more important than they may be ſuppoſed; and ſo many Cauſes concur to the Deſtruction of Men, that none of the Means ſhould be neglected, which may contribute to their Preſervation.</p>
               <p>§ 13. The Country People in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> drink, either 1, pure Water, 2, ſome Wine, 3, Perry, made from wild Pears, or ſometimes Cyder from Apples, and, 4, a ſmall Liquor which they call <hi>Piquette,</hi> that is, Water, which has fermented with the Cake or Huſks of the Grapes, after their Juice has been expreſſed. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter however is their moſt general Drink, Wine rarely falling in their way, but when they are employed by rich Folks; or when they can ſpare Money enough for a Debauch. Fruit-Wines and the <note n="*" place="bottom">This Word's occurring in the plural Number will probably imply, the <hi>Swiſs</hi> make more than one Species of this ſmall Drink, by pouring Water on the Cake or Remainder of their other Fruits, after they have been expreſſed; as our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Cyder, and perhaps in the Perry, Counties, make what they call <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkin, Perki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> It ſhould ſeem too from this Section, that the labourious Countrymen in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> drink no Malt-Liquor, though the Ingredients may be ſuppoſed to grow in their Climate. Now Beer, of different Strength, making the greater Part of our moſt common Drink, it may be proper to obſerve here, that when it is not ſtrong and heatly, but a middling well-brewed Small-beer, neither too new, nor hard or ſour, it is full as wholeſome a Drink for labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People in Health as any other, and perhaps generally preferable to Water for ſuch; which may be too thin and light for thoſe who are unaccuſtomed to it; and more dangerous too, when the labouring Man is very hot, as well as thirſty. The holding a Mouthful of any weak cold Liquor in the Mouth, without ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it, 'till it becomes warm there, and ſpurting it out before a Draught is taken down would be prudent; and in Caſe of great Heat, to take the requiſite Quantity afterwards, rather at two Draughts, with a little Interval between them, than to ſwallow the whole precipitately at one, would be more ſafe, and equally refreſhing, though perhaps leſs grateful. <hi>K.</hi>

                     <p>The bad Quality of Water is another common Cauſe of Country Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; either where the Waters are unwholeſome, from the Soils in which they are found, as when they flow through, or ſettle, on Banks of Shells; or where they become ſuch, from the Neighbourhood of, or Drainings from, Dunghills and Marſhes.</p>
                     <p>When Water is unclean and turbid, it is generally ſufficient to let it ſettle in order to clear itſelf, by dropping its Sediment. But if that is not effected, or if it be ſlimy or muddy, it need only be poured into a large Veſſel, half filled with fine Sand, or, for want of that, with Chalk; and then to ſhake and ſtir it about heartily for ſome Minutes. When this Agitation is over, the Sand, in falling to the Bottom of the Veſſel, will attract ſome of the Foulneſs ſuſpended in the Water. Or, which is ſtill better, and very eaſy to do, two large Veſſels may be ſet near together, one of which ſhould be placed conſiderably higher than the other. The higheſt ſhould be half filled with Sand. Into this the turbid, or ſlimy muddy Water is to be poured; whence it will filter itſelf through the Body of Sand, and paſs off clear by an Opening or Orifice made at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel; and fall from thence into the lower one, which ſerves as a Reſervoir. When the Water is impregnated with Particles from the Beds of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenites,</hi> or of any Spar (which Water we call hard, becauſe Soap will not eaſily diſſolve in it, and <hi>Puls</hi> and other farinacious Subſtances grow hard inſtead of ſoft, after boiling in it) ſuch Water ſhould be expoſed to the Sun, or boiled with the Addition of ſome <hi>Puls,</hi> or leguminous Vegetables, or Bread toaſted or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toaſted. When Water is in its putrid State, it may be kept till it recovers its natural ſweet one: but if this cannot be waited for, a little Sea Salt ſhould be diſſolved in it, or ſome Vinegar may be added, in which ſome grateful aromatic Plant has been infuſed. It frequently happens, that the public Wells are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by foul Mud at the Bottom, and by different Animals which tumble in and putrify there. Drinking Snow-Water ſhould be avoided, when the Snow is but lately fallen, as it ſeems to be the Cauſe of thoſe ſwelling wenny Throats in the Inhabitants of ſome Mountains, and of epidemic Cholics in many Perſons. As Water is ſo continually uſed, great Care ſhould be taken to have what is good. Bad Water, like bad Air, is one of the moſt general Cauſes of Diſeaſes; that which produces the greater Number of them, the moſt grievous ones; and often introduces ſuch as are epidemical, <hi>E.

               <p>SECT. 14. THE Cauſes already enumerated in the firſt Chapter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Diſeaſes; and the bad Regimen, or Conduct of the People, on the Invaſion of them, render them ſtill more perplexing, and very often mortal.</p>
               <p>There is a prevailing Prejudice among them, which is every Year attended with the Deaths of ſome Hundreds in this Country, and it is this —That all Diſtempers are cured by Sweat; and that to procure Sweat, they muſt take Abundance of hot and heating things, and keep themſelves very hot. This is a Miſtake in both Reſpects, very fatal to the Population of the State; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much inculcated into Country People; that by thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to force Sweating, at the very Beginning of a Diſeaſe, they are, with great Probability, taking Pains to kill themſelves. I have ſeen ſome Caſes, in which the continual Care to provoke this Sweating, has as manifeſtly killed the Patient, as if a Ball had been ſhot through his Brains; as ſuch a precipitate and untimely Diſcharge carries off the thinner Part of the Blood, leaving the Maſs more dry more viſcid and inflamed. Now as in all acute Diſeaſes (if we except a very few, and thoſe too much leſs frequent) the Blood is already too thick; ſuch a Diſcharge muſt evidently increaſe the Diſorder, by co-operating with its Cauſe. Inſtead of forcing out the watery, the thinner Part of the Blood, we ſhould rather endeavour to increaſe it. There is not a ſingle Peaſant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps who does not ſay, when he has a Pleuriſy, or an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Breaſt, that his Blood is too thick, and that it cannot circulate. On ſeeing it in the Baſon after Bleeding, he finds it
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012243_0044_0F8A37CA8B6E9ED8"/>
                  <hi>black, dry, burnt</hi>; theſe are his very Words. How ſtrange is it then, that common Senſe ſhould not aſſure him, that, far from forcing out the <hi>Serum,</hi> the watery Part, of ſuch a Blood by ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is a Neceſſity to increaſe it?</p>
               <p>§ 15. But ſuppoſing it were as certain, as it is erroneous, that Sweating was beneficial at the Beginning of Diſeaſes, the Means which they uſe to excite it would not prove the leſs fatal. The firſt Endeavour is, to ſtifle the Patient with the Heat of a cloſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and a Load of Covering. Extraordinary Care is taken to prevent a Breath of freſh Air's getting into the Room; from which Circumſtance, the Air already in it is ſpeedily and extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted; and ſuch a Degree of Heat is procured by the Weight of the Patient's Bed-cloaths, that theſe two Cauſes alone are ſufficient to excite a moſt ardent Fever, and an Inflammation of the Breaſt, even in a healthy Man. More than once have I found myſelf ſeized with a Difficulty of breathing, on entering ſuch Chambers, from which I have been immediately relieved, on obliging them to open all the Windows. Perſons of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt find a Pleaſure, I conceive, in making People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand on theſe Occaſions, which are ſo frequent, that the Air being more indiſpenſibly neceſſary to us, if poſſible, than Water is to a Fiſh, our Health muſt immediately ſuffer, whenever that ceaſes to be pure; and in aſſuring them alſo, that nothing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it ſooner than thoſe Vapours, which continually ſteam from the Bodies of many Perſons incloſed within a little Chamber, from which the Air is excluded. The Abſurdity of ſuch Conduct is a ſelf-evident Certainty: let in a little freſh Air on theſe miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Patients, and leſſen the oppreſſing Burthen of their Coverings, and you generally ſee upon the Spot, their Fever and Oppreſſion, their Anguiſh and Raving, to abate.</p>
               <p>§ 16. The ſecond Method taken to raiſe a Sweat in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients is, to give them nothing but hot things, eſpecially Venice Treacle, Wine, or ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">This Word, which muſt be of <hi>German,</hi> not of <hi>French,</hi> Extraction, ſtrictly ſignifies, <hi>Drink for a Fall,</hi> as we ſay <hi>Pulvis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A healthy Perſon would certainly be ſeized with an inflammatory Fever, on taking the ſame Quantity of Wine, of Venice Treacle, or of <hi>Faltranc,</hi> which the Peaſant takes now and then, when he is attacked by one of theſe Diſorders.

                  </gap> he <hi>generally</hi> does, and ſometimes with aſtoniſhing Speed. I have publiſhed ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtances of ſuch Fatality ſome Years ſince, in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. In fact they ſtill daily occur, and unhappily every Perſon may obſerve ſome of them in his own Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>§ 17. But I ſhall be told perhaps, that Diſeaſes are often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off by Sweat, and that we ought to be guided by Experience. To this I anſwer, it is very true, that Sweating cures ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſorders, as it were, at their very Onſet; for Inſtance, thoſe Stitches that are called ſpurious or falſe Pleuriſies, ſome rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Pains, and ſome Colds or Deſtructions. But this only happens when the Diſorders depend ſolely and ſimply on ſtopt or abated Perſpiration, to which ſuch Pain inſtantly ſucceeds; where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, before the Fever has thickened the Blood, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Humours; and where before any internal Infarction, any Load is formed, ſome warm Drinks are given, ſuch as <hi>Faltranc</hi> and Honey; which, by reſtoring Tranſpiration, remove the very Cauſe of the Diſorder. Nevertheleſs, even in ſuch a Caſe, great Care ſhould be had not to raiſe too violent a Commotion in the Blood, which would rather reſtrain, than promote Sweat; to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which Elder-flowers are in my Opinion preferable to <hi>Faltranc.</hi> Sweating is alſo of Service in Diſeaſes, when their Cauſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, as it were, by plentiful Dilution: then indeed it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, by drawing off, with itſelf, ſome Part of the diſtempered Humours; which being affected, their groſſer Parts have paſſed off by Stool and by Urine: beſides which, the Sweat has alſo ſerved to carry off that extraordinary Quantity of Water, we were obliged to convey into the Blood, and which was become ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous there. Under ſuch Circumſtances, and at ſuch a Juncture, it is of the utmoſt Importance indeed, not to check the Sweat, whether by Choice, or for Want of Care. There might often be as much Danger in doing this, as there would have been in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to force a Sweat, immediately upon the Invaſion of the Diſorder; ſince the arreſting of this Diſcharge, under the preceding Circumſtances, might frequently occaſion a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſtemper, by repelling the Humours on ſome inward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Part. As much Care therefore ſhould be taken not to check, imprudently, that Evacuation by the Skin, which naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs towards the Concluſion of Diſeaſes, as not to force it at their Beginning; the former being almoſt conſtantly beneficial, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as conſtantly pernicious. Beſides, were it even neceſſary, it might be very dangerous to force it violently; ſince by heating the Patients greatly, a vehement Fever is excited; they become ſcorched up in a Manner, and the Skin proves extremely dry. Warm Water, in ſhort, is the beſt of Sudorifics.</p>
               <p>If the Sick are ſweated very plentifully for a Day or two, which may make them eaſier for ſome Hours, theſe Sweats ſoon terminate, and cannot be excited again by the ſame Medicines. The Doſe thence is doubled, the Inflammation is increaſed, and the Patient
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012243_0046_0F8A6B47A11A2EA0"/>
expires in terrible Anguiſh, with all the Marks of a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. His Death is aſcribed to his Want of Sweating; when it really was the Conſequence of his Sweating too much at firſt; and of his taking Wine and hot Sudorifics. An able <hi>Swiſs</hi> Phyſician had long ſince aſſured his Countrymen that Wine was fatal to them in Fevers; I take leave to repeat it again and again, and wiſh it may not be with as little Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Our Country Folks, who in Health, naturally diſlike red Wine, prefer it when Sick; which is wrong, as it binds them up more than white Wine. It does not promote Urine as well; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the Force of the circulating Arteries, and the Thickneſs of the Blood, which were already too conſiderable.</p>
               <p>§ 18. Their Diſeaſes are alſo further aggravated by the Food that is generally given them. They muſt undoubtedly prove weak, in Conſequence of their being ſick; and the ridiculous Fear of the Patient's dying of Weakneſs, diſpoſes their Friends to force them to eat; which, increaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir Diſorder, renders the Fever mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>al. This Fear is abſolutely chimerical; never yet did a Perſon in a Fever die merely from Weakneſs. They may be ſupported, even for ſome Weeks, by Water only; and are ſtronger at the End of that Time, than if they had taken more ſolid Nouriſhment; ſince, far from ſtrengthening them, their Food increaſes their Diſeaſe, and thence increaſes their Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>§ 19. From the firſt Invaſion of a Fever, Digeſtion ceaſes. Whatever ſolid Food is taken corrupts, and proves a Source of Putridity, which adds nothing to the Strength of the Sick, but greatly to that of the Diſtemper. There are in fact a thouſand Examples to prove, that it becomes a real Poiſon: and we may ſenſibly perceive that theſe poor Creatures, who are thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to eat, loſe their Strength, and fall into Anxiety and Rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in Proportion as they ſwallow.</p>
               <p>§ 20. They are alſo further injured by the Quality, as well as the Quantity of their Food. They are forced to ſup ſtrong gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Soups, Eggs, Biſcuits, and even Fleſh, if they have but juſt Strength and Reſolution to chew it. It ſeems abſolutely impoſſible for them to ſurvive all this Traſh. Should a Man in perfect Health be compelled to eat ſtinking Meat, rotten Eggs, ſtale ſour Broth, he is attacked with as violent Symptoms, as if he had taken real Poiſon, which, in Effect, he has. He is ſeized with Vomiting, Anguiſh, a violent Purging, and a Fever, with Raving and erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spots, which we call the Purple Fever. Now when the very ſame Articles of Food, in their ſoundeſt State, are given to a Perſon in a Fever, the Heat and the morbid Matter already in his Stomach, quickly putrify them; and after a few Hours produce all the above mentioned Effects. Let any Man judge then, if the leaſt Service can be expected from them.</p>
               <p>§ 21. It is a Truth eſtabliſhed by the firſt of Phyſicians, above two thouſand Years paſt, and ſtill further ratified by his Succeſſors, that as long as a ſick Perſon has a bad Humour or Ferment in his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012243_0047_0F8A6B499812D780"/>
Stomach, his Weakneſs increaſes, in Proportion to the Food he receives. For this being corrupted by the infected Matter it meets there, proves incapable of nouriſhing, and becomes a conjunct or additional Cauſe of the Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>The moſt obſerving Perſons conſtantly remark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t whenever a feveriſh Patient ſups, what is commonly called ſome good Broth, the Fever gathers Strength and the Patient Weakneſs. The giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Soup or Broth, though of the freſheſt ſoundeſt Meat, to a Man who has a high Fever, or putrid Humours in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, is to do him exactly the ſame Service, as if you had given him (two or three Hours later) ſtale putrid Soup.</p>
               <p>§ 22. I muſt alſo affirm, that this fatal Prejudice, of keeping up the Patient's Strength by Food, is ſtill too much propagated, even among thoſe very Perſons, whoſe Talents and whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might be expected to exempt them from any ſuch groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. It were happy for Mankind, and the Duration of their Lives would generally be more extended, if they could be thoroughly perſuaded of this medical, and ſo very demonſtrable, Truth;— —That the only things which can ſtrengthen ſick Perſons are thoſe which are able to weaken their Diſeaſe; but their Obſtinacy in this Reſpect is inconceivable; it is another Evil ſuperadded to that of the Diſeaſe, and ſometimes the more grievous one. Out of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſick Perſons, who are loſt in the Country, more than two Thirds might often have been cured, if being only lodged in a Place defended from the Injuries of the Air, they were ſupplied with Abundance of good Water. But that moſt miſtaken Care and Regimen I have been treating of, ſcarcely ſuffers one of the twenty to ſurvive them.</p>
               <p>§ 23. What further increaſes our Horror at this enormous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to heat, dry up, and cram the Sick is, that it is totally oppoſite to what Nature herſelf indicates in ſuch Circumſtances. The burning Heat of which they complain; the Dryneſs of the Lips, Tongue and Throat; the flaming high Colour of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; the great Longing they have for cooling things; the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſenſible Benefit they enjoy from freſh Air, are ſo many Signs or rather Proofs, which cry out with a loud Voice, that we ought to attemperate and cool them moderately, by all means. Their ſoul Tongues, which ſhew the Stomach to be in the like Condition; their Loathing, their Propenſity to vomit, their utter Averſion to all ſolid Food, and eſpecially to Fleſh; the diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stench of their Breath; their Diſcharge of fetid Wind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, and frequently the extraordinary Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of their Excrements, demonſtrate that their Bowels are full of putrid Contents, which muſt corrupt all the Aliments ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to them: and that the only thing which can prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done, is to dilute and attemper them by plentiful Draughts of refreſhing cooling Drinks, which may promote an eaſy Diſcharge of them. I affirm it again, and I heartily wiſh it may be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly attended to, that as long as there is any Taſte of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012243_0048_0F8A6B49E636CA88"/>
or of Putreſence; as long as there is a <hi>Nauſea</hi> or Loathing, a bad Breath, Heat and Feveriſhneſs, with fetid Stools, and little and high coloured Urine; ſo long all Fleſh and Fleſh-Soup, Eggs, and all kinds of Food compoſed of them, or of any of them, and all Venice Treacle, Wine, and all heating things are ſo many abſolute Poiſons.</p>
               <p>§ 24. I may poſſibly be cenſured as extravagant and exceſſive on theſe Heads by the Publick, and even by ſome Phyſicians: but the true and enlightened Phyſicians, thoſe who attend to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of every Particular, will find on the contrary, that far from exceeding in this Reſpect, I have rather feebly expreſſed their own Judgment, in which they agree with that of all the good ones, who have exiſted within more than two thouſand Years; that very Judgment which Reaſon approves, and continual Experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. The Prejudices I have been contending againſt have coſt <hi>Europe</hi> ſome Millions of Lives.</p>
               <p>§ 25. Neither ſhould it be omitted, that even when a Patient has very fortunately eſcaped Death, notwithſtanding all this Care to obtain it, the Miſchief is not ended; the Conſequences of the high Aliments and heating Medicines being, to leave behind the Seed, the Principle, of ſome low and chronical Diſeaſe; which increaſing inſenſibly, burſts out at length, and finally procures him the Death he has even wiſhed for, to put an End to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Sufferings.</p>
               <p>§ 26. I muſt alſo take Notice of another dangerous common Practice; which is that of purging, or vomiting a Patient, at the very Beginning of a Diſtemper. Infinite Miſchiefs are occaſioned by it. There are ſome Caſes indeed, in which gently evacuating Medicines, at the Beginning of a Diſeaſe, are convenient, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neceſſary. Such Caſes ſhall be particularly mentioned in ſome other Chapters: but as long as we are unacquainted with them, it ſhould be conſidered as a general Rule, that they are hurtful at the Beginning; this being true very often; and always, when the Diſeaſes are ſtrictly inflammatory.</p>
               <p>§ 27. It is hoped by their Aſſiſtance, at that Time, to remove the Load and Oppreſſion of the Stomach, the Cauſe of a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vomit, of a dry Mouth, of Thirſt, and of much Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to leſſen the Leaven or Ferment of the Fever. But in this Hope they are very often deceived; ſince the Cauſes of theſe Symptoms are ſeldom of a Nature to yield to theſe Evacuations. By the extraordinary Viſcidity or Thickneſs of the Humours, that ſoul the Tongue, we ſhould form our Notions of thoſe, which line the Stomach and the Bowels. It may be waſhed, gargled and even ſcraped, to very little good Purpoſe. It does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen until the Patient has drank for many Days, and the Heat, the Fever, and the great Sizineſs of the Humours are abated, that this Filth can be thoroughly removed, which by Degrees ſeparates of itſelf. The State of the Stomach being conformable to that of the Tongue, no Method can effectually ſcour and clean it at the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012243_0049_0F8A6B4AADA12700"/>
Beginning: but by giving refreſhing and diluting Remedies plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, it gradually frees itſelf; and the Propenſity to vomit, with its other Effects and Uneaſineſſes, go off naturally and without Purges.</p>
               <p>§ 28. Neither are theſe Evacuations only negatively wrong, merely from doing no Good; for conſiderable Evil poſitively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from the Application of thoſe acrid irritating Medicines, which increaſe the Pain and Inflammation; drawing the Humours upon thoſe Parts that were already overloaded with them; which by no means expel the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, that not being at this Time fitted for Expulſion, as not ſufficiently concocted or ripe: and yet which Evacuations, at the ſame Time, diſcharge the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Part of the Blood, whence the Remainder becomes more thick; in ſhort which carry off the uſeful, and leave the hurtful Humours behind.</p>
               <p>§ 29. The Vomit eſpecially, being given in an inflammatory Diſeaſe, and even without any Diſtinction in all acute ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Humours have been diminiſhed by Bleeding, and diluted by plentiful ſmall Drinks, is productive of the greateſt Evils; of Inflammations of the Stomach, of the Lungs and Liver, of Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Frenzies. Purges ſometimes occaſion a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Guts, which <note n="*" place="bottom">It is pretty common to <hi>bear</hi> of Perſons recovering from Inflammations of the Bowels, or Guts, which our Author more juſtly and ingenuouſly conſiders as general Paſſports to Death: for it is difficult to conceive, that a real and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi> Inflammation of ſuch thin, membranous, irritable Parts, lined with ſuch putreſcent Humours and Contents, and in ſo hot and cloſe a Situation, could be reſtored to a ſound and healthy State <hi>as often</hi> as Rumour affirms it. This makes it ſo important a Point, to avert every Tendency to an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe feculent Parts, as to juſtify a Bleeding directed, ſolely, from this Precaution; and which might have been no otherwiſe indicated by a Diſeaſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any Symptom, that threatened ſuch an Inflammation. But when a Perſon recovers, there can be no anatomical Search for ſuch Inflammations, or their Effects, the real or imaginary Cure of which may well amaze the Patient, and muſt greatly redound to the Honour of his Preſcriber; ſo that there may be Policy ſometimes in giving a moderate Diſeaſe a very bad Name. <hi>K.</hi>

The Effect of ſuch Medicines, in theſe Circumſtances, are much the ſame with thoſe we might reaſonably expect, from the Application of Salt and Pepper to a dry, inflamed and foul Tongue, in order to moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and clean it.</p>
               <p>§ 30. Every Perſon of ſound plain Senſe is capable of percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Truth of whatever I have advanced in this Chapter: and there would be ſome Degree of Prudence, even in thoſe who do not perceive the real good Tendency of my Advice, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy nor oppoſe it too hardily. The Queſtion relates to a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Object; and in a matter quite foreign to themſelves, they undoubtedly owe ſome Deference to the Judgment of Perſons, who have made it the Study and Buſineſs of their whole Lives.

It is not to myſelf that I hope for their Attention, but to the greateſt Phyſicians, whoſe feeble Inſtrument and Eccho I am.— What Intereſt have any of us in forbidding ſick People to eat, to be ſtifled, or to drink ſuch heating things as heighten their Fever? What Advantage can accrue to us from oppoſing the fatal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which ſweeps them off? What Arguments can perſuade People, that ſome thouſand Men of Genius, of Knowledge, and of Experience, who paſs their Lives among a Croud and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Patients; who are entirely employed to take Care of them, and to obſerve all that paſſes, have been only amuſing and deceiving themſelves, on the Effects of Food, of Regimen and of Remedies? Can it enter into any ſenſible Head, that a Nurſe, who adviſes Soup, an Egg, or a Biſcuit, deſerves a Patient's Confidence, better than a Phyſician who forbids them? Nothing can be more diſagreeable to the latter, than his being obliged to diſpute continually in Behalf of the poor Patients; and to be in conſtant Terror, leſt this mortally officious Attendance, by giving ſuch Food as augments all the Cauſes of the Diſeaſe, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Efficacy of all the Remedies he adminiſters to remove it; and ſhould feſter and aggravate the Wound, in Proportion to the Pains he takes to dreſs it. The more ſuch abſurd People love a Patient, the more they urge him to eat, which, in Effect, verifies the Proverb of <hi>killing one with Kindneſs.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER III. Of the Means that ought to be uſed at the Beginning of Diſeaſes; and of the Diet in acute Diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>SECT. 31. I Have clearly ſhewn the great Dangers of the Regimen, or Diet, and of the principal Medicines too generally made Uſe of by the Bulk of the People on theſe Occaſions. I muſt now point out the actual Method they may purſue, without any Riſque, on the Invaſion of ſome acute Diſeaſes, and the general Diet which agrees with them all. As many as are deſirous of reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Benefit from this Treatiſe, ſhould attend particularly to this Chapter; ſince, throughout the other Parts of it, in order to avoid Repetitions, I ſhall ſay nothing of the Diet, except the particular Diſtemper ſhall require a different one from that, of which I am now to give an exact Detail. And whenever I ſhall ſay in general, that a Patient is to be put upon a <hi>Regimen,</hi> it will ſignify, that he is to be treated according to the Method preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this Chapter; and all ſuch Directions are to be obſerved, with Regard to Air, Food, Drink and Glyſters; except when I expreſsly order ſomething elſe, as different Ptiſans, Glyſters, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012243_0051_0F8A6B4C88670040"/>§ 32. The greater Part of Diſeaſes (by which I always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand acute and feveriſh ones) frequently give ſome Notice of their Approach a few Weeks, and, generally, ſome Days before their actual Invaſion; ſuch as a light Laſſitude, or Wearineſs, Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Numbneſs; leſs Activity than uſual, leſs Appetite, a ſmall Load or Heavineſs at Stomach; ſome Complaint in the Head: a profounder Degree of Sleep, yet leſs compoſed, and leſs refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than uſual; leſs Gaiety and Livelineſs; ſometimes a light Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Breaſt, a leſs regular Pulſe; a Propenſity to be cold; an Aptneſs to ſweat; and ſometimes a Suppreſſion of a former Diſpoſition to ſweat. At ſuch a Term it may be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to prevent, or at leaſt conſiderably to mitigate the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Diſorders, by carefully obſerving the four following Points.</p>
               <p>1. To omit all violent Work or Labour, but yet not ſo, as to diſcontinue a gentle eaſy Degree of Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>2. To bring the Complainant to content himſelf without any, or with very little, ſolid Food; and eſpecially to renounce all Fleſh, Fleſh-broth, Eggs and Wine.</p>
               <p>3. To drink plentifully, that is to ſay, at leaſt three Pints, or even four Pints daily, by ſmall Glaſſes at a Time, from half hour to half hour, of the Ptiſans No. 1 and 2, or even of warm Water, to each Quart of which may be added half a Glaſs of Vinegar. No Perſon can be deſtitute of this very attainable Aſſiſtance. But ſhould there be a Want even of Vinegar, a few Grains of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note n="*" place="bottom">This Direction of our Author's, which may ſurprize ſome, probably ariſes from his preferring a ſmall Quantity of the marine Acid to <hi>no</hi> Acid at all: For though a great Proportion of Salt, in ſaving and ſeaſoning Fleſh and other Food, generally excites Thirſt, yet a little of it ſeems to have rather a different Effect, by gently ſtimulating the ſalivary Glands: And we find that Nature very ſeldom leaves the great diluting Element wholly void of this quickening, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putreſcent Principle, <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Salt may be added to a Quart of warm Water for Drink. Thoſe who have Honey will do well to add two or three Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of it to the Water. A light Infuſion of Elder-flowers, or of thoſe of the Linden, the Lime-tree, may alſo be advantageouſly uſed, and even well ſettled and clear ſweet Whey.</p>
               <p>4. Let the Perſon affected with ſuch previous Complaints, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Glyſters of warm Water, or the Glyſter No. 5. By pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing theſe Precautions ſome grievous Diſorders have often been happily rooted out: and although they ſhould not prove ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly efficacious, as to prevent their Appearance, they may at leaſt be rendered more gentle, and much leſs dangerous.</p>
               <p>§ 33. Very unhappily People have taken the directly contrary Method. From the Moment theſe previous, theſe forerunning Complaints are perceived, they allow themſelves to eat nothing but groſs Meat, Eggs, or ſtrong Meat-Soups. They leave off Garden-Stuff and Fruits, which would be ſo proper for them; and they drink heartily (under a Notion of ſtrengthening the Stomach and expelling Wind) of Wine and other Liquors, which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012243_0052_0F8A6B4D083B48D8"/>
ſtrengthen nothing but the Fever, and expel what Degree of Health might ſtill remain. Hence all the Evacuations are reſtrained; the Humours cauſing and nouriſhing the Diſeaſes are not at all attempered, diluted, nor rendered proper for Evacuation. Nay, on the very contrary, they become more ſharp, and more difficult to be diſcharged: while a ſufficient Quantity of diluting refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquor aſſwages and ſeparates all Matters foreign to the Blood, which it purifies; and, at the Expiration of ſome Days, all that was noxious in it is carried off by Stool, by Urine, or by Sweat.</p>
               <p>§ 34. When the Diſtemper is further advanced, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is already ſeized with that Coldneſs or Shuddering, in a greater or leſs Degree, which uſhers in all Diſeaſes; and which is commonly attended with an univerſal Oppreſſion, and Pains over all the Surface of the Body: the Patient, thus circumſtanced, ſhould be put to Bed, if he cannot keep up; or ſhould ſit down as quietly as poſſible, with a little more Covering than uſual: he ſhould drink every Quarter of an Hour a ſmall Glaſs of the Ptiſan, No. 1 or 2, warm: or, if that is not at Hand, of ſome one of thoſe Liquids I have recommended § 32.</p>
               <p>§ 35. Theſe Patients earneſtly covet a great Load of Covering, during the Cold or Shivering; but we ſhould be very careful to lighten them as ſoon as it abates; ſo that when the ſucceeding Heat begins, they may have no more than their uſual Weight of Covering. It were to be wiſhed, <hi>perhaps,</hi> they had rather leſs. The Country People lie upon a Feather-bed, and under a downy Coverlet, or Quilt, that is commonly extremely heavy; and the Heat which is heightened and retained by Feathers, is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly troubleſome to Perſons in a Fever. Nevertheleſs, as it is what they are accuſtomed to, this Cuſtom may be complied with for one Seaſon of the Year: but during our Heats, or whenever the Fever is very violent, they ſhould lie on a Pallet (which will be infinitely better for them) and ſhould throw away their Coverings of Down, ſo as to remain covered only with Sheets, or ſomething elſe, leſs injurious than Feather-Coverings. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could ſcarcely believe, who had not been, as I have, a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, how much Comfort a Patient is ſenſible of, in being eaſed of his former Coverings. The Diſtemper immediately puts on a different Appearance.</p>
               <p>§ 36. As ſoon as the Heat after the <hi>Rigor,</hi> or Coldneſs and Shuddering, approaches, and the Fever is manifeſtly advanced, we ſhould provide for the Patient's Regimen. And</p>
               <p>1, Care ſhould be taken that the Air, in the Room where he lies, ſhould not be too hot, the mildeſt Degree of Warmth being very ſufficient; that there be as little Noiſe as poſſible, and that no Perſon ſpeak to the Sick, without a Neceſſity for it. No ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Circumſtance heightens the Fever more, nor inclines the Patient more to a <hi>Delirium</hi> or Raving, than the Perſons in the Chamber, and eſpecially about the Bed. They leſſen the Spring, the elaſtic and refreſhing Power, of the Air; they prevent a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012243_0053_0F8A6B4F134D8740"/>
of freſh Air; and the Variety of Objects occupies the Brain too much. Whenever the Patient has been at Stool, or has made Urine, theſe Excrements ſhould be removed immediately. The Windows ſhould certainly be opened Night and Morning, at leaſt for a Quarter of an Hour each time; when alſo a Door ſhould be opened, to promote an entire Renovation or Change of the Air in the Room. Nevertheleſs, as the Patient ſhould not be expoſed at any time to a Stream or Current of Air, the Curtains of his Bed ſhould be drawn on ſuch Occaſions; and, if he lay without any, Chairs, with Blankets or Cloaths hung upon them, ſhould be ſubſtituted in the Place of Curtains, and ſurround the Bed, while the Windows continue open, in order to defend the Patient from the Force of the ruſhing Air. If the Seaſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be rigidly cold, it will be ſufficient to keep the Windows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but for a few Minutes each time. In Summer, at leaſt one Window ſhould be ſet open Day and Night. The pouring a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vinegar upon a red-hot Shovel alſo greatly conduces to reſtore the Spring, and to correct the Putridity, of the Air. In our greateſt Heats, when that in the Room ſeems nearly ſcorching, and the ſick Perſon is ſenſibly and greatly incommoded by it, the Floor may be ſprinkled now and then; and Branches of Willow or Aſh-trees, dipt a little in Pails of Water, may be placed about the Room.</p>
               <p>§ 37. 2. With Reſpect to the Patient's Nouriſhment, he muſt entirely abſtain from all Food; but he may always be allowed, and have daily prepared, the following Suſtenance, which is one of the wholeſomeſt, and indiſputably the ſimpleſt one. Take half a Pound of Bread, a Morſel of the freſheſt Butter about the Size only of a Hazel Nut (which may even be omitted too) three Pints and one quarter of a Pint of Water. Boil them 'till the Bread be entirely reduced to a thin Conſiſtence. Then ſtrain it, and give the Patient one eighth Part of it every three, or every four, Hours; but ſtill more rarely, if the Fever be vehemently high. Thoſe who have Groats, Barley, Oatmeal, or Rice, may boil and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them in the ſame Manner, with ſome Grains of Salt.</p>
               <p>§ 38. The Sick may alſo be ſometimes indulged, in lieu of theſe different Spoon-meats, with raw Fruits in Summer, or in Winter with Apples baked or boiled, or Plumbs and Cherries dried and boiled. Perſons of Knowledge and Experience will be very little, or rather not at all, ſurprized, to ſee various Kinds of Fruit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in acute Diſeaſes; the Benefit of which they may here have frequently ſeen. Such Advice can only diſguſt thoſe, who remain ſtill obſtinately attached to old Prejudices. But could they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on themſelves to reflect a little, they muſt perceive that theſe Fruits which allay Thirſt; which cool and abate the Fever; which correct and attemper the putrid and heated Bile; which gently diſpoſe the Belly to be rather open, and promote the Secretion and Diſcharge of the Urine, muſt prove the propereſt Nouriſhment for Perſons in acute Fevers. Hence we ſee, as it were by a ſtrong
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012243_0054_0F8A6B4FC93B7EB0"/>
Admonition from Nature herſelf, they expreſs an ardent Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them; and I have known ſeveral who would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but for their eating ſecretly large Quantities of thoſe Fruits they ſo paſſionately deſired, and were refuſed. As many however, as are not convinced by my Reaſoning in this Reſpect, may at leaſt make a Trial of my Advice, on my Affirmation and Experience; when I have no Doubt but their own will ſpeedily convince them of the real Benefit received from this Sort of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. It will then be evident, that we may ſafely and boldly allow, in all continual Fevers, Cherries red and black, Strawberries, the beſt cured Raiſins, Raſpberries, and Mulberries; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that all of them be perfectly ripe. Apples, Pears and Plumbs are leſs melting and diluting, leſs ſucculent, and rather leſs proper. Some Kinds of Pears however are extremely juicy, and even watery almoſt, ſuch as the Dean or Valentia Pear, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds of the Buree Pear; the St. Germain, the Virgoleuſe, the green ſugary Pear, and the Summer Royal, which may all be allowed; as well as a little Juice of very ripe Plumbs, with the Addition of Water to it. This laſt I have known to aſſwage Thirſt in a Fever, beyond any other Liquor. Care ſhould be taken at the ſame time, that the Sick ſhould never be indulged in a great Quantity of any of them at once, which would overload the Stomach, and be injurious to them; but if they are given a little at a time and often, nothing can be more ſalutary. Thoſe whoſe Circumſtances will afford them China Oranges, or Lemons, may be regaled with the Pulp and Juice as ſucceſsfully: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating any of their Peel, which is hot and inflaming.</p>
               <p>§ 39. 3. Their Drink ſhould be ſuch as allays Thirſt, and abates the Fever; ſuch as dilutes, relaxes, and promotes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations by Stool, Urine and Perſpiration. All the Liquids which I have recommended in the preceding Chapters, jointly and ſeverally poſſeſs theſe Qualities. A Glaſs or a Glaſs and a half of the Juice of ſuch Fruit as I have juſt mentioned, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be added to three full Pints of Water.</p>
               <p>§ 40. The Sick ſhould drink at leaſt twice or thrice that Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity daily, often, and a little at once, between three and four Ounces, every Quarter of an Hour. The Coldneſs of the Drink ſhould juſt be taken off.</p>
               <p>§ 41. 4. If the Patient has not two Motions in the 24 Hours; if the Urine be in ſmall Quantity and high coloured; if he rave, the Fever rage, the Pain of the Head and of the Loins be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, with a Pain in the Belly, and a Propenſity to vomit, the Glyſter No. 5 ſhould be given at leaſt once a Day. The People have generally an Averſion to this Kind of Remedy; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is not any more uſeful in feveriſh Diſorders, eſpecially in thoſe I have juſt recounted; and one Glyſter commonly gives more Relief, than if the Patient had drank four or five times the Quantity of his Drinks. The Uſe of Glyſters, in different Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, will be properly aſcertained in the different Chapters which
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012243_0055_0F8A6B52AE56CB00"/>
treat of them. But it may be obſerved in this Place, that they are never to be given at the very time the Patient is in a Sweat, which ſeems to relieve him.</p>
               <p>§ 42. 5. As long as the Patient hath ſufficient Strength for it, he ſhould ſit up out of Bed one Hour daily, and longer if he can bear it; but at leaſt half an Hour. It has a Tendency to leſſen the Fever, the Head-ach, and a Light-headineſs or Raving. But he ſhould not be raiſed, while he has a hopeful Sweating; though ſuch Sweats hardly ever occur, but at the Concluſion of Diſeaſes, and after the Sick has had ſeveral other Evacuations.</p>
               <p>§ 43. 6. His Bed ſhould be made daily while he ſits up; and the Sheets of the Bed, as well as the Patient's Linen, ſhould be changed every two Days, if it can be done with Safety. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prejudice has eſtabliſhed a contrary, and a really danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Practice. The People about the Patient dread the very Thought of his riſing out of Bed; they let him continue there in naſty Linen loaden with putrid Steams and Humours; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute not only to keep up the Diſtemper, but even to heighten it into ſome Degree of Malignity. I do again repeat it here, that nothing conduces more to continue the Fever and Raving, than confining the Sick conſtantly to Bed, and withholding him from changing his foul Linen: by relieving him from both of which Circumſtances I have, without the Aſſiſtance of any other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, put a Stop to a continual Delirium of twelve Days uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Duration. It is uſually ſaid, the Patient is too weak, but this is a very weak Reaſon. He muſt be in very nearly a dying Condition, not to be able to bear theſe ſmall Commotions, which, in the very Moment when he permits them, increaſe his Strength, and immediately after abate his Complaints. One Advantage the Sick gain by ſitting up a little out of Bed, is the increaſed Quantity of their Urine, with greater Facility in paſſing it. Some have been obſerved to make none at all, if they did not riſe out of Bed.</p>
               <p>A very conſiderable Number of acute Diſeaſes have been radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, effectually cured by this Method, which mitigates them all. Where it is not uſed, as an Aſſiſtance at leaſt, Medicines are very often of no Advantage. It were to be wiſhed the Patient and his Friends were made to underſtand, that Diſtempers are not to be expelled at once with rough and precipitate Uſage; that they muſt have their certain Career or Courſe; and that the Uſe of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Methods and Medicines they chuſe to employ, might indeed abridge the Courſe of them, by killing the Patient, yet never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhortened the Diſeaſe; but, on the contrary, rendered it more perplexing, tedious and obſtinate; and often entailed ſuch unhappy Conſequences on the Sufferer, as left him feeble and languid for the reſt of his Life.</p>
               <p>§ 44. But it is not ſufficient to treat, and, as it were, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Diſtemper properly. The Term of Recovery from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe requires conſiderable Vigilance and Attention, as it is always a State of Feebleneſs, and, thence, of Depreſſion and Faintneſs.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012243_0056_0F8A6B52D119DA78"/>
The ſame Kind of Prejudice which deſtroys the Sick, by compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to eat, during the Violence of the Diſeaſe, is extended alſo into the Stage of Convaleſcence, or Recovery; and either renders it troubleſome and tedious; or produces fatal Relapſes, and often chronical Diſtempers. In Proportion to the Abatement, and in the Decline of the Fever, the Quantity of Nouriſhment may be gradually increaſed: but as long as there are any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it, their Qualities ſhould be thoſe I have already recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Whenever the Fever is compleatly terminated, ſome different Foods may be entered upon; ſo that the Patient may venture upon a little white Meat, provided it be tender; ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">The moſt allowable of theſe are Whitings, Flounders, Plaice, Dabbs, Smelts, or Gudgeons; eſpecially ſuch of the laſt as are taken out of clear cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Streams with gravelly Bottoms. Salmon, Eels, Carp, all the Skate Kind, Haddock, and the like, ſhould not be permitted, before the Sick return to their uſual Diet when in Health. It is beſt to begin with Fiſh boiled. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Fiſh; a little Fleſh-Soup, a few Eggs at times, with Wine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diluted. It muſt be obſerved at the ſame time, that theſe very proper Aliments which reſtore the Strength, when taken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, delay the perfect Cure, if they exceed in Quantity, tho' but a little; becauſe the Action of the Stomach being extremely weakened by the Diſeaſe and the Remedies, is capable only, as yet, of a ſmall Degree of Digeſtion; and if the Quantity of its Contents exceed its Powers, they do not digeſt, but become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid: frequent Returns of the Fever ſupervene; a continual Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs; Head-achs; a heavy Drowſineſs without a Power of ſleeping comfortably; flying Pains and Heats in the Arms and Legs; Inquietude; Peeviſhneſs; Propenſity to vomit; Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Obſtructions, and ſometimes a ſlow Fever, with a Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humours that comes to Suppuration.</p>
               <p>All theſe bad Conſequences are prevented, by the recovering Sick contenting themſelves, for ſome time, with a very moderate Share of proper Food. We are not nouriſhed in Proportion to the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we ſwallow, but to that we digeſt. A Perſon on the mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand, who eats moderately, digeſts it and grows ſtrong from it. He who ſwallows abundantly does not digeſt it, and inſtead of being nouriſhed and ſtrengthened, he withers inſenſibly away.</p>
               <p>§ 45. We may reduce, within the few following Rules, all that is moſt eſpecially to be obſerved, in order to procure a compleat, a perfect Termination of acute Diſeaſes; and to prevent their leaving behind them any Impediments to Health.</p>
               <p>1. Let thoſe who are recovering, as well as thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſick, take very little Nouriſhment at a time, and take it often.</p>
               <p>2. Let them take but one ſort of Food at each Meal, and not change their Food too often.</p>
               <p>3. Let them chew whatever ſolid Victuals they eat, very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:012243_0057_0F8A6B53A7DBFEA8"/>4. Let them diminiſh their Quantity of Drink. The beſt for them in general is Water <note n="*" place="bottom">I have known many who had an Averſion to Water, and with whom, on that very Account, it might probably agree leſs, find Water very grateful, in which a thoroughly baked and hot, not burnt, Slice of Bread had been infuſed, until it attained the Colour of fine clear Small-beer, or light Amber coloured Beer; and I never ſaw any Inconvenience reſult from it.

Too great a Quantity of Liquids at this time prevents the Stomach from recovering its Tone and Strength; it impairs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; keeps up Weakneſs; increaſes the Tendency to a Swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Legs; ſometimes even occaſions a flow Fever; and throws back the Perſon recovering into a languid State.</p>
               <p>5. Let them go abroad as often as they are able, whether on Foot, in a Carriage, or on Horſeback. This laſt Exerciſe is the healthieſt of all, and three fourths of the labouring People in this Country, who have it in their Power to procure it without Expence, are in the wrong to neglect it. They, who would practiſe it, ſhould mount before their principal Meal, which ſhould be about Noon, and never ride after it. Exerciſe taken before a Meal ſtrengthens the Organs of Digeſtion, which is promoted by it. If the Exerciſe is taken ſoon after the Meal, it impairs it.</p>
               <p>6. As People in this State are ſeldom quite as well towards Night, in the Evening they ſhould take very little Food. Their Sleep will be the leſs diſturbed for this, and repair them the more, and ſooner.</p>
               <p>7. They ſhould not remain in Bed above ſeven or eight Hours.</p>
               <p>8. The ſwelling of the Legs and Ancles, which happens to moſt Perſons at this time, is not dangerous, and generally diſappears of itſelf; if they live ſoberly and regularly and take moderate Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>9. It is not neceſſary, in this State, that they ſhould go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly every Day to Stool; though they ſhould not be without one above two or three. If their Coſtiveneſs exceeds this Term, they ſhould receive a Glyſter the third Day, and even ſooner, if they are heated by it, if they feel puffed up, are reſtleſs, and have any Pains in the Head.</p>
               <p>10. Should they, after ſome time, ſtill continue very weak; if their Stomach are diſordered; if they have, from time to time, a little irregular Fever, they ſhould take three Doſes daily of the Preſcription No. 14. which fortifies the Digeſtions, recovers the Strength, and drives away the Fever.</p>
               <p>11. They muſt by no means return to their Labour too ſoon. This erroneous Habit daily prevents many Peaſants from ever getting perfectly well, and recovering their former Strength. From not having been able to confine themſelves to Repoſe and Indolence for ſome Days, they never become as hearty hardy

Workmen as they had been: and this premature haſty Labour makes them loſe in the Conſequence, every following Week of their Lives, more time than they ever gained, by their over-early reſuming of their Labour. I ſee every Day weakly Labourers, Vineroons, and other Workmen, who date the Commencement of their Weakneſs from that of ſome acute Diſeaſe, which, for want of proper Management through the Term of their Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was never perfectly cured. A Repoſe of ſeven or eight Days, more than they allowed themſelves, would have prevented all theſe Infirmities; notwithſtanding it is very difficult to make them ſenſible of this. The Bulk, the Body of the People, in this and in many other Caſes, look no further than the preſent Day; and never extend their Views to the following one. They are for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no Sacrifice to Futurity; which nevertheleſs muſt be done, to render it favourable to us.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV. Of an Inflammation of the Breaſt.</head>
               <p>SECT. 46. THE Inflammation of the Breaſt, or Peripneumony, or a Fluxion upon the Breaſt, is an Inflammation of the Lungs, and moſt commonly of one only, and conſequently on one Side. The Signs by which it is evident are a Shivering, of more or leſs Continuance, during which the Perſon affected is ſometimes very reſtleſs and in great Anguiſh, an eſſential and inſeparable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and which has helped me more than once to diſtinguiſh this Diſeaſe certainly, at the very Inſtant of its Invaſion. Beſides this, a conſiderable Degree of Heat ſucceeds the Shivering, which Heat, for a few enſuing Hours, is often blended as it were, with ſome Returns of Chillineſs. The Pulſe is quick, pretty ſtrong, moderately full, hard and regular, when the Diſtemper is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violent; but ſmall, ſoft and irregular, when it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. There is alſo a Senſation of Pain, but rather light and tolerable, in one Side of the Breaſt; ſometimes a Kind of Strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Preſſure on the Heart; at other times Pains through the whole Body, eſpecially along the Reins; and ſome Degree of Oppreſſion, at leaſt very often; for ſometimes it is but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. The Patient finds a Neceſſity of lying almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon his Back, being able to lie but very rarely upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Sides. Sometimes his Cough is dry, and is then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moſt Pain; at other times it is accompanied with a Spitting or Hawking up, blended with more or leſs Blood, and ſometimes with pure ſheer Blood. There is alſo ſome Pain, or
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012243_0059_0F8A6B55E8940BD8"/>
at leaſt a Senſation of Weight and Heavineſs in the Head; and frequently a Propenſity to rave. The Face is almoſt continually fluſhed and red; though ſometimes there is a Degree of Paleneſs and an Air of Aſtoniſhment, at the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, which portend no little Danger. The Lips, the Tongue, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the Skin are all dry; the Breath hot; the Urine little and high coloured in the firſt Stage; but more plentiful, leſs flaming, and letting fall much Sediment afterwards. There is a frequent Thirſt, and ſometimes an Inclination to vomit; which impoſing on the ignorant Aſſiſtants, have often inclined them to give the Patient a Vomit, which is mortal, eſpecially at this Juncture. The Heat becomes univerſal. The Symptoms are heightened almoſt every Night, during which the Cough is more exaſperated, and the Spitting or Expectoration is in leſs Quantity. The beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration is of a middling Conſiſtence, neither too thin, nor too hard and tough, like thoſe which are brought up at the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Cold; but rather more yellow, and mixed with a little Blood, which gradually becomes ſtill leſs, and commonly diſappears entirely before the ſeventh Day. Sometimes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation aſcends along the Wind-pipe, and in ſome Meaſure ſuffocates the Patient, paining him conſiderably in ſwallowing, which makes him think he has a ſore Throat.</p>
               <p>§ 47. Whenever the Diſeaſe is very violent at firſt, or increaſes to be ſuch, the Patient cannot draw his Breath, but when he fits up. The Pulſe becomes very ſmall and very quick; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance livid, the Tongue black; the Eyes ſtare wildly; and he ſuffers inexpreſſible Anguiſh, attended with inceſſant Reſtleſſneſs and Agitation in his Bed. One of his Arms is ſometimes affected with a ſort of Palſy; he raves without Intermiſſion, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoroughly wake nor ſleep. The Skin of his Breaſt and of his Neck is covered (eſpecially in cloſe ſultry Weather, and when the Diſtemper is extremely violent) with livid Spots, more or leſs remarkable, which ſhould be called <hi>petechial</hi> ones, but are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed the <hi>pourpre,</hi> or purple. The natural Strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes exhauſted; the Difficulty of breathing increaſes every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he ſinks into a Lethargy, and ſoon dies a terrible Death in Country Places, by the very Effects of the inflaming Medicines they employ on ſuch Occaſions. It has been known in fact, that the Uſe of them has raiſed the Diſtemper to ſuch a Height, that the very Heart has been rent open, which the Diſſection of the Body has demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>§ 48. If the Diſeaſe ruſhes on at once, with a ſudden and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Attack; if the Horror, the Cold and Shivering laſt many Hours, and are followed with a nearly ſcorching Degree of Heat; if the Brain is affected from the very Onſet; if the Patient has a ſmall Purging, attended with a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> or ſtraining to Stool, often termed a <hi>Needy</hi>; if he abhors the Bed; if he either ſweat exceſſively, or if his Skin be extremely dry; if his natural Manner
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012243_0060_0F8A6B5705814188"/>
and Look are conſiderably changed; and if he ſpits up with much Difficulty, the Diſeaſe is extremely dangerous.</p>
               <p>§ 49. He muſt directly, from the firſt Seizure in this State, be put upon a Regimen, and his Drink muſt never be given cold. It ſhould either be the Barley Water No. 2, the Almond Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion No. 4, or that of No. 7. The Juices of the Plants, which enter into the laſt of theſe Drinks, are excellent Remedies in this Caſe; as they powerfully attenuate, or melt down, the viſcid thick Blood, which cauſes the Inflammation.</p>
               <p>As long as the Fever keeps up extremely violent; while the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient does not expectorate ſufficiently; continues raving; has a violent Head-ach, or raiſes up pure Blood, the Glyſter No. 5 muſt be given thrice, or at leaſt twice, in twenty four Hours. However the principal Remedy is Bleeding. As ſoon as ever the preceding cold Aſſault is over, twelve Ounces of Blood muſt be taken away at once; and, if the Patient be young and ſtrong, fourteen or even ſixteen. This plentiful Bleeding gives him more Eaſe, than if twenty four Ounces had been drawn, at three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times.</p>
               <p>§ 50. When the Diſeaſe is circumſtanced as deſcribed (§ 46) that firſt Bleeding makes the Patient eaſy for ſome Hours; but the Complaint returns; and to obviate its Violence, as much as poſſible, we muſt, except things promiſe extremely well, repeat the Bleeding four Hours after the firſt, taking again twelve Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Blood, which pretty often proves ſufficient. But if, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Expiration of eight or ten Hours, it appears to kindle up again, it muſt be repeated a third, or even a fourth Time. Yet, with the Aſſiſtance of other proper Remedies, I have ſeldom been obliged to bleed a fourth time, and have ſometimes found the two firſt Bleedings ſufficient.</p>
               <p>If the Diſeaſe has been of ſeveral Days Duration, when I have firſt been called; if the Fever is ſtill very high; if there be a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Breathing; if the Patient does not expectorate at all, or brings up too much Blood; without being too ſolicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Day of the Diſeaſe, the Patient ſhould be bled, though it were on the tenth. <note n="‡" place="bottom">We ſhould however, with the greater Circumſpection (of how much the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtanding the Diſeaſe has been, and by how much the more difficult the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Humours are to be melted down and diſlodged) attend to the Coction of the Matter of Expectoration; which Nature does not often eaſily effect, and which the effects the more imperfectly and ſlowly, the weaker ſhe is. Her laſt Efforts have often been attended with ſuch high Paroxyſms, as have impoſed even upon very competent Phyſicians, and have made them open a Vein a few Hours before the Patient's Death, from their Pulſes being ſtrong, hard and frequent. Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Weakneſs is the Sign, by which we may diſcover ſuch unavailing Efforts to be the laſt. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>§ 51. In this, and in all other inflammatory Diſeaſes, the Blood is in a very thick viſcid State: and almoſt immediately on its being drawn, a white tough Skin, ſomewhat like Leather, is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012243_0061_0F8A6B575CA95760"/>
formed on its Top, which moſt People have ſeen, and which is called the <hi>pleuritic Cruſt.</hi> It is thought a promiſing Appearance, when at each Bleeding it ſeems leſs hard, and leſs thick, than it was at the preceding ones: and this is very generally true, if the Sick feels himſelf, at the ſame time, ſenſibly better: but whoever ſhall attend <hi>ſolely</hi> to the Appearance of the Blood, will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf often deceived. It will happen, even in the moſt violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Breaſt, that this Cruſt is not formed, which is ſuppoſed to be a very unpromiſing Sign. There are alſo, in this Reſpect, many odd Appearances, which ariſe from the ſmalleſt Circumſtances; ſo that we muſt not regulate the Repetitions of our bleeding ſolely by this Cruſt: and in general we muſt not be over credulous in ſuppoſing, that the Appearances in the Blood, received into the Baſon, can enable us to determine, with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, of its real State in the Body.</p>
               <p>§ 52. When the ſick Perſon is in the Condition deſcribed (§ 47) the Bleeding is not only unattended with Eaſe; but ſometimes it is alſo pernicious, by the ſudden Weakneſs to which it reduces him. Generally in ſuch a Caſe all Medicines and Means are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant: and it is a very bad Sign in this Diſeaſe, when this Diſcharge is not attended with Eaſe and Benefit to the Sick; or when there are ſome Circumſtances, which oblige us to be ſparing of it.</p>
               <p>§ 53. The Patient's Legs ſhould every Day, for one half Hour, be put into a Bath of warm Water, wrapping him up cloſely; that the Cold may not check that Perſpiration, which the Bath promotes.</p>
               <p>§ 54. Every two Hours he ſhould take two Spoonfuls of the Mixture No. 8, which promotes all the Diſcharges, and chiefly that of Expectoration.</p>
               <p>§ 55. When the Oppreſſion and Straitneſs are conſiderable, and the Cough dry, the Patient may receive the Vapour of boiling Water, to which a little Vinegar has been added. There are two ways of affecting this; either by placing below his Face, after ſetting him up, a Veſſel filled with ſuch boiling hot Water, and covering the Patient's Head and the Veſſel with a Linen Cloth, that may incloſe the Steam; or elſe by holding before his Mouth a Spunge dipped in the ſame boiling Liquor. This laſt Method is the leaſt effectual, but it fatigues the Patient conſiderably leſs. When this bad Symptom is extremely preſſing, Vinegar alone ſhould be uſed without Water; and the Vapour of it has often ſaved Patients, who ſeemed to have one Foot in the Grave; but it ſhould be continued for ſeveral Hours.</p>
               <p>§ 56. The outward Remedies directed in No. 9. are alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Succeſs to the Breaſt, and to the Throat.</p>
               <p>§ 57. When the Fever is extremely high, the Sick ſhould take every Hour, a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 10. in a Cup of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012243_0062_0F8A6B5809CA4D48"/>
Ptiſan <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Uſe of Acids, in Inflammations of the Breaſt, requires no little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Whenever the ſick Perſon has an Averſion to them; when the Tongue is moiſt, the Stomach is heavy and diſordered, and the Habit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Patient is mild and ſoft; when the Cough is very ſharp without great Thirſt, we ought to abſtain from them. But when the Inflammation is joined to a dry Tongue, to great Thirſt, Heat and Fever, they are of great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Slices of China Oranges ſprinkled with Sugar may be given firſt; a light Lemonade may be allowed afterwards; and at laſt ſmall Doſes of the Mixture No. 10. if it becomes neceſſary. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have choſen to retain this Note of the Editor of <hi>Lyons,</hi> from having fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen the Inefficacy, and ſometimes, I have even thought, the ill Effects of Acids in Peripneumonies and Pleuriſies, in a Country far ſouth of <hi>Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and where theſe Diſeaſes are very frequent, acute and fatal. On the other hand I ſhall add the Subſtance of what Dr. TISSOT ſays on this Head in a Note to his Table of Remedies, wherein he affirms, that he has given in this Diſeaſe very large Doſes of them, riſing gradually from ſmall ones, and always with great Succeſs; intreating other Phyſicians to order this Acid (the Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur) in the ſame large Doſes which he directs in this Chapter, and aſſuring himſelf of their Thanks, for its good Conſequences.—Now the only ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect I can ſurmize here, from ſhewing this Diverſity of Opinion in theſe two learned Phyſicians, and my own Doubts, is, that the Subjects of this Diſeaſe in Country Places may prove ſomewhat confuſed and irreſolute by it, in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in ſuch Caſes. But as all of us certainly concur in the great Intention of doing all poſſible Good, by the extenſive Publication of this Treatiſe, I ſhall take Leave to obſerve that in this Diſeaſe, and in Pleuriſies, more ſolid Benefit has been received in <hi>Carolina, Virginia,</hi> &amp;c. from the Uſe of the <hi>Seneka</hi> Rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnake Root, than from any other Medicine whatever. Bleeding indeed is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily premiſed to it; but it has often ſaved the Neceſſity of many repeated Bleedings. This Medicine, which is termed in Latin, the <hi>Polygala Virginiana,</hi> is certainly rather of a ſaponaceous attenuating Quality, and betray not any Marks of Acidity, being rather moderately acrid. There will be occaſion to mention it more particularly in the ſubſequent chapter, as ſuch a liberty can need no Apology to any philoſophical Phyſician. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> but without diminiſhing on this Account the uſual Quantity of his other Drinks, which may be taken immediately after it.</p>
               <p>§ 58. As long as the Patient ſhall grow worſe, or only continue equally bad, the ſame Medicines are to be repeated. But if on the third Day (though it rarely happens ſo ſoon) or fourth, or fifth, the Diſeaſe takes a more favourable Turn; if the Exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion returns with leſs Violence; the Cough be leſs ſevere; the Matter coughed up leſs bloody: if Reſpiration becomes eaſier; the Head be leſs affected; the Tongue not quite ſo dry; if the high Colour of the Urine abates, and its Quantity be increaſed, it may be ſufficient then to keep the Patient carefully to his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to give him a Glyſter every Evening. The Exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that occurs the fourth Day is often the higheſt.</p>
               <p>§ 59. This Diſtemper is moſt commonly terminated and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off by Expectoration, and often by Urine, which on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the ninth, or the eleventh Day, and ſometimes on the Days between them, begins to let fall a plentiful Sediment, or Settling, of a pale red Colour, and ſometimes real <hi>Pus</hi> or ripe Matter. Theſe Diſcharges are ſucceeded by Sweats, which are
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012243_0063_0F8A6B58DA90EF10"/>
as ſerviceable then, as they were injurious at the Beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>§ 60. Some Hours before theſe Evacuations appear, there come on, and not ſeldom, ſome very alarming Symptoms, ſuch as great Anguiſh; Palpitations; ſome Irregularity in the Pulſe; an increaſed Oppreſſion, convulſive Motions (this being what is called the <hi>Criſis,</hi> the Height, or Turn of the Diſtemper) but they are no ways dangerous, provided they do not occaſion any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Treatment. Theſe Symptoms depend on the morbid and purulent Matter, which, being diſlodged, circulates with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and irritates different Parts, until the Diſcharge of it has fairly begun; after which all ſuch Symptoms diſappear, and Sleep generally enſues. However I cannot too ſtrongly inſiſt on the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of great Prudence in ſuch Circumſtances. Sometimes it is the Weakneſs of the Patient, and at other times Convulſions, or ſome other Symptoms, that terrify the By-ſtanders. If, which is moſt generally the Caſe, the abſurd Practice of directing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Remedies for ſuch Accidents takes place, ſuch as ſpirituous Cordials, Venice Treacle, Confections, Caſtor and Rue; the Conſequence is, that Nature being diſturbed in her Operations, the <hi>Criſis</hi> or Turn is not effected; the Matter which ſhould be diſcharged by Stool, by Urine or by Sweat, is not diſcharged out of the Body; but is thrown upon ſome internal or external part of it. Should it be on ſome inward part, the Patient either dies at once; or another Diſtemper ſucceeds, more troubleſome and incurable than the firſt. Should it be expelled to ſome outward part, the Danger indeed is leſs; and as ſoon as ever ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour appears, ripening Poultices ſhould be applied to bring it to a Head, after which it ſhould immediately be opened.</p>
               <p>§ 61. In order to prevent ſuch unhappy Conſequences, great Care muſt be taken, whenever ſuch terrifying Symptoms come on, [about the Time of the <hi>Criſis</hi>] to make no Change in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, nor in the Treatment of the Patient; except in giving him the looſening Glyſter No. 5; and applying every two Hours a Flanel, ſqueezed out of warm Water, which may cover all the Belly, and in a Manner go round the Body behind the Reins. The Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Drink may alſo be increaſed a little; and that of his Nouriſhment leſſened, as long as the high and violent State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
               <p>§ 62. I have not ſpoken of Vomits or Purges, as being directly contrary to the Nature of this Diſeaſe; Anodynes, or Opiates, to procure Sleep are alſo, in general, very improper. In a few Caſes, however, they may poſſibly be uſeful; but theſe Caſes are ſo very difficult to be ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed, that Opiates ſhould never be admitted in this Diſeaſe, without the Preſence and Advice of a Phyſician. I have ſeen many Patients who have been thrown into an incurable Hectic, by taking them improperly. When the Diſeaſe is not received in a mortal Degree, nor has been injudiciouſly treated, and proceeds in a benign regular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012243_0064_0F8A6B598AA80700"/>
the Patient may be called very well and ſafe by the fourteenth Day; when he may, if he has an Appetite, be put upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of People who are recovering. But if he ſtill retains an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Food; if his Mouth is foul and furred, and he is ſenſible of ſome Heavineſs in his Head, he ſhould take the purging Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. II.</p>
               <p>§ 63. Bleedings from the Noſe occur ſometimes naturally in this Diſeaſe, even after repeated Bleedings by Art; theſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry benign and favourable, and are commonly attended with more Eaſe and Relief than artificial Bleedings. Such voluntary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges may ſometimes be expected, when the Patient is ſenſibly mended in many Reſpects after the Uſe of the Lancet; and yet complains of a great Pain in his Head, accompanied with quick ſparkling Eyes, and a Redneſs of the Noſe. Nothing ſhould be done to ſtop theſe voluntary Bleedings, ſince it would be very dangerous; for when Nature has fulfilled her Intention by them, they ceaſe of themſelves. At other times, but more rarely, the Diſtemper is carried off by a natural Purging, attended with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Pain, and the Diſcharge of bilious Matter.</p>
               <p>§ 64. If the Expectoration, or hawking up of Matter, ſtops very ſuddenly, and is not ſpeedily attended with ſome other Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation; the Oppreſſion and Anguiſh of the Patient immediately return, and the Danger is great and preſſing. If the Diſtemper, at this Juncture, is not of many Days ſtanding; if the Patient is a ſtrong Perſon; if he has not as yet been plentifully bled; if there be ſtill ſome Blood mixed with the Humour he expectorates; or if the Pulſe be ſtrong and hard, he ſhould be bled immediately in the Arm; and conſtantly receive the Steam of hot Water and Vinegar by the Mouth, and drink plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 2, ſomething hotter than ordinary. But if his Circumſtances, after this Suppreſſion, are different from theſe juſt mentioned; inſtead of bleeding him, two Bliſters ſhould be applied to the Legs; and he ſhould drink plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 12.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes which ofteneſt produce this Suppreſſion of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration are, 1, a ſharp and ſudden cold Air. 2, too hot a one. 3, over hot Medicines. 4, exceſſive Sweating. 5, a Purge prematurely and injudiciouſly timed. And 6, ſome immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Paſſion of the Mind.</p>
               <p>§ 65. When the Sick has not been ſufficiently bled, or not ſoon enough; and even ſometimes, which I have ſeen, when he has been greatly weakened by exceſſive Bleeding; ſo that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges by Stool, Urine, Expectoration and Perſpiration, have not been ſufficiently made; when theſe Diſcharges have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by ſome other Cauſes; or the Diſeaſe has been injudiciouſly treated; then the Veſſels that have been inflamed, do not unload themſelves of the Humours which ſtuff up and oppreſs them; but there happens in the Subſtance of the affected Lung, the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance we ſee daily occur on the Surface of the Body. If an inflammatory Tumour or Swelling does not diſperſe itſelf, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012243_0065_0F8A6B5ABB582F38"/>
inſenſibly, it forms an Impoſthume or Abſceſs. Thus exactly alſo in the inflamed Lung, if the Inflammation is not diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, it forms an Abſceſs, which, in that part, is called a <hi>Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>: and the Matter of that Abſceſs, like the external ones, remains often long incloſed in its Sac or Bag, without burſting open its Membrane or Caſe, and diſcharging the Matter it contains.</p>
               <p>§ 66. If the Inflammation was not very deeply ſeated in the inward Subſtance of the diſeaſed Lung; but was extended to its Surface, that is very near the Ribs, the Sac will burſt on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Lung; and the Matter contained in it muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged into the Cavity, or Hollowneſs of the Breaſt, between the Lung, the Ribs, and the Diaphragm or Midriff, which is the Membrane that divides the Breaſt and the Belly. But when the Inflammation is conſiderably deeper, the Impoſthume burſts with-inſide of the Lung itſelf. If its Orifice, or Opening is ſo ſmall, that but little can get out at once; if the Quantity of all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be inconſiderable, and the Patient is at the ſame time pretty ſtrong, he coughs up the Matter, and is very ſenſibly relieved. But if this <hi>Vomica</hi> be large, or if its Orifice is wide, and it throws out a great Quantity of Matter at once; or if the Patient is very weak, he dies the Moment it burſts, and that ſometimes when it is leaſt expected. I have ſeen one Patient ſo circumſtanced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as he was conveying a Spoonful of Soup to his Mouth; and another while he was wiping his Noſe. There was no preſent Symptom in either of theſe Caſes, whence a Phyſician might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them likelier to die at that Inſtant, than for ſome Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The <hi>Puſ,</hi> or Matter, is commonly diſcharged through the Mouth after Death, and the Bodies very ſoon become putrified.</p>
               <p>§ 67. We call that <hi>Vomica</hi> which is not burſt, an <hi>occult</hi> or hidden, and that which is, an evident or open one. It is of conſiderable Importance to treat exactly and clearly of this Topic; as a great Number of Country People die of theſe Impoſthumes, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Suſpicion of the Cauſe of their Death. I had an Inſtance of it ſome Days ſince, in the School-maſter of a Village. He had an occult and very conſiderable <hi>Vomica</hi> in the left Lung, which was the Conſequence of an Inflammation of the Breaſt, that had been treated improperly at the Beginning. He ſeemed to me not likely to live twenty four Hours; and in fact died in the Night, after inexpreſſible Anguiſh. It is highly probable he died as ſoon as the <hi>Vomica</hi> burſt, a large Quantity of Matter being diſcharged from his Mouth after his Death.</p>
               <p>§ 68. Whatever Diſtemper is included within the Breaſt of a living Patient, is neither an Object of the Sight nor Touch; whence theſe <hi>Vomicas,</hi> theſe inward Tumours, are ſo often unknown, and indeed unſuſpected. The Evacuations that were neceſſary for the Cure, or ſometimes for the Prevention, of them, have not taken Place during the firſt fourteen Days. At the End of this Term, the Patient, far from being cured, is not very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly relieved; but, on the contrary, the Fever continues to be
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012243_0066_0F8A6B5B4918B470"/>
pretty high, with a Pulſe continually quick; in general ſoft and weak; though ſometimes pretty hard, and often fluctuating, or, as it were, waving. His Breathing is ſtill difficult and oppreſſed; with ſmall cold Shudderings from time to time; an Exaſperation of the Fever; fluſhed Cheeks, dry Lips, and Thirſt.</p>
               <p>The Increaſe of theſe Symptoms declares, that <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter is thoroughly formed: the Cough then becomes more continual, being exaſperated with the leaſt Motion; or as ſoon as ever the Patient has taken any Nouriſhment. He can repoſe only on the Side affected. It often happens indeed that he cannot lie down at all; but is obliged to be ſet up all Day; ſometimes even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to lean a little upon his Loins, for fear of increaſing the Cough and Oppreſſion. He is unable to ſleep; has a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fever, and his Pulſe frequently intermits.</p>
               <p>The Fever is not only heightened every Evening; but the ſmalleſt Quantity of Food, the gentleſt Motion, a little Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the lighteſt Agitation of the Mind, a little more than uſual Heat in the Chamber, Soup either a little too ſtrong, or a little too ſalt, increaſe the Quickneſs of his Pulſe the Moment they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, or are given. He is quite reſtleſs, has ſome ſhort Attacks of the moſt terrible Anguiſh, accompanied and ſucceeded by Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on his Breaſt, and from his whole Countenance. He ſweats ſometimes the whole Night; his Urine is reddiſh, now frothy, and at other times oily, as it were. Sudden Fluſhings, hot as Flames, riſe into his whole Viſage. The greater Number of the Sick are commonly ſenſible of a moſt diſagreeable Taſte in their Mouths; ſome of old ſtrong Cheeſe; others of rotten Eggs; and others again of ſtinking Meat, and fall greatly away. The Thirſt of ſome is unquenchable; their Mouths and Lips are parched; their Voice is weak and hoarſe; their Eyes are hollow, with a Kind of Wildneſs in their Looks. They have a general Diſguſt to all Food: and if they ſhould aſk for ſome particular Nouriſhment without ſeeing it, they reject it the Moment it is brought them; and their Strength at length ſeems wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Symptoms, a little Inflation, or <hi>Bloatedneſs,</hi> as it were, is ſometimes obſerved on the Breaſt, towards the Side af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; with an almoſt inſenſible Change of Colour. If the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica</hi> be ſituated at the Bottom of the affected Lobe of the Lungs, and in its internal Part, that is, nearly in the Middle of the Breaſt, ſome <hi>Puffineſs</hi> or light Swelling may be perceived in ſome Bodies, by gently preſſing the Pit of their Stomach; eſpecially when the Patient coughs. In ſhort, according to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a <hi>German</hi> Phyſician, if one ſtrike the open Hand on the Breaſt, covered only with a Shirt, it retains in the Spot, which is directly oppoſite to the <hi>Vomica,</hi> a flat heavy Sound, as if one ſtruck a Piece of Fleſh; while in ſtriking on the other Side it gives a clear loud Sound, as from a Drum. I ſtill doubt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether this Obſervation will generally hold true; and it
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012243_0067_0F8A6B5D4616AB88"/>
would be hazardous to affirm there is no Abſceſs in a Breaſt, which does not return this heavy Sound.</p>
               <p>§ 69. When a <hi>Vomica</hi> is formed, as long as it is not emptied, all the Symptoms I have already enumerated increaſe, and the <hi>Vomica</hi> grows in Size: the whole Side of the Lung affected ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becomes a Bag or Sac of Matter. The ſound Side is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and the Patient dies after dreadful Anguiſh, with the Lungs full of <hi>Pus,</hi> and without having ever brought up any.</p>
               <p>To avoid ſuch fatal Conſequences, it is neceſſary to procure the Rupture and Diſcharge of this inward Abſceſs, as ſoon as we are certain of its Exiſtence: And as it is ſafer it ſhould break within the Lobe affected, from whence it may be diſcharged by hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up; than that it ſhould burſt and void itſelf into the Cavity of the Breaſt, (for Reaſons I ſhall give hereafter) we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that this Rupture may be affected within the internal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>§ 70. The moſt effectual Methods to procure this are, 1. To make the Patient continually receive, by his Mouth, the Vapour of warm Water. 2. When by this Means that part of the Sac or Abſceſs is ſoftened, where we could wiſh the Rupture of it to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the Patient is to ſwallow a large Quantity of the moſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Liquid; ſuch as Barley Water, Almond Milk, light Veal Broth, or Milk and Water. By this Means the Stomach is kept always full: ſo that the Reſiſtance to the Lungs being conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on that Side, the Abſceſs and its Contents will naturally be preſſed towards the Side of the Wind-pipe, as it will meet with leſs Reſiſtance there. This Fulneſs of the Stomach will alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Patient to cough, which may concur to produce a good Event. Hence, 3, we ſhould endeavour to make the Patient cough, by making him to ſmell ſome Vinegar, or even to ſnuff up a little; or by injecting into his Throat, by the Means of a ſmall Syringe or Pipe, ſuch as Children make out of ſhort Pieces of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der boughs, a little Water or Vinegar. 4. He ſhould be adviſed to bawl out aloud, to read loud, or to laugh heartily; all which Means contribute to burſt open the Abſceſs, as well as the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ones. 5. Let him take every two Hours a Soup-Ladle of the Potion No. 8. 6. He ſhould be put into a Cart, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Carriage; but not before he has drank plentifully of ſuch Liquors as I have juſt mentioned: after which the Shaking and Jolting in the Carriage have ſometimes immediately procured that Rupture, or breaking of the Bag or Abſceſs, we wiſhed for.</p>
               <p>§ 71. Some Years ſince I ſaw a Country Maid Servant, who was left in a languiſhing Condition after an Inflammation of the Breaſt; without any Perſon's ſuſpecting her Ailment. This Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being put into a Cart that was ſent for a Load of Hay, one of the Wheels ran violently againſt a Tree: ſhe ſwooned away, and at the ſame time brought up a great Quantity of digeſted Matter: She continued to bring up more; during which I was informed of her Caſe, and of the Accident, which effectually cured her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:012243_0068_0F8A6B5D687E1E90"/>A <hi>Swiſs</hi> Officer, who ſerved in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had been in a languid State of Health for ſome Months; and returned home to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down as eaſily as he could, without conceiving any conſiderable Hopes of Recovery. Upon entering into his own Country, by the Way of <hi>Mount Bernard</hi>; and being obliged to go ſome Paces on Foot, he fell down, and remained in a Swoon above a Quarter of an Hour: during which time he threw up a large Quantity of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and found himſelf that very Moment very greatly relieved. I ordered him a proper Diet, and ſuitable Medicines: his Health became perfectly eſtabliſhed; and the Preſervation of his Life was principally owing to this lucky Fall.</p>
               <p>Many Perſons afflicted with a <hi>Vomica,</hi> faint away the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it breaks. Some ſharp Vinegar ſhould be directly held to their Noſe. This ſmall Aſſiſtance is generally ſufficient, where the burſting of it is not attended with ſuch Appearances as ſhew it to be mortal, in which Caſe every Application is inſignificant.</p>
               <p>§ 72. If the ſick Perſon was not extremely weak before the burſting of the Abſceſs; if the Matter was white, and well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; if the Fever abates after it; if the Anguiſh, Oppreſſion and Sweats terminate; if the Cough is leſs violent; if the Patient is ſenſibly eaſier in his Situation or Poſture; if he recovers his Sleep and Appetite; if his uſual Strength returns; if the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he expectorates, or brings up, becomes daily and gradually leſs; and if his Urine is apparently better, we may have room to hope, that by the Aſſiſtance of the Remedies I ſhall immediately direct, he may be radically, compleatly cured.</p>
               <p>§ 73. But if on the contrary; when his Strength is exhauſted before the burſting of the Abſceſs; when the Matter is too thin and tranſparent, brown, green, yellow, bloody and of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Smell; if the Pulſe continues quick and weak; if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Appetite, Strength and Sleep do not improve, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no Hope of a Cure, and the beſt Medicines are ineffectual: Nevertheleſs we ought to make ſome Trial of them.</p>
               <p>§ 74. They conſiſt of the following Medicines and Regulations. I. Give every four Hours a little Barley or Rice Cream. 2. If the Matter brought up is thick and glewy, ſo that it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be looſened and diſcharged, give every two Hours a Soup-ladle of the Potion No. 8; and between the giving theſe two, let the Patient take every half Hour a Cup of the Drink No. 13.— 3. When the Conſiſtence of the Matter is ſuch, that there is no Occaſion for theſe Medicines to promote the Diſcharge of it, they muſt be omitted; tho' the ſame Sort and Quantity of Food are to be continued; but with the Addition of an equal Quantity of Milk: or, which would be ſtill more beneficial, inſtead of this Mixture, we ſhould give the ſame Quantity of New-Milk, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a good Cow, which, in ſuch a Caſe, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the whole Nouriſhment of the Patient. 4. He ſhould take four times a Day, beginning early in the Morning, and at the Diſtance of two Hours, a Doſe of the Powder No. 14, diluted
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012243_0069_0F8A6B5E12679BE0"/>
in a little Water, or made into a <hi>Bolus,</hi> or Morſel, with a little Syrup or Honey. His common Drink ſhould be Almond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulſion, commonly called Almond Milk, or Barley Water, or freſh Water with a fourth Part Milk. 5. He ſhould air and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe every Day on Horſeback, or in a Carriage, according as his Strength and his Circumſtances will allow him. But of all Sorts of Exerciſe, that upon a trotting Horſe is, beyond all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, the very beſt, and the eaſieſt to be procured by every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; provided the Diſeaſe be not too far advanced; ſince in ſuch a Situation, any Exerciſe that was only a little violent, might prove pernicious.</p>
               <p>§ 75. The Multitude, who are generally illiterate, ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider any thing as a Remedy, except they ſwallow it. They have but little Confidence in Regimen, or any Aſſiſtance in the Way of Diet, and conſider riding on Horſeback as wholly uſeleſs to them. This is a dangerous Miſtake, of which I ſhould be glad to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: ſince this Aſſiſtance, which appears ſo inſignificant to them, is probably the moſt effectual of any: it is that, in fact, without which they can ſcarcely expect a Cure, in the higheſt Degrees of this Diſeaſe: it is that, which perhaps alone may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, provided they take no improper Food. In brief it is conſidered, and with Reaſon, as the real Specific for this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>§ 76. The Influence of the Air is of more Importance in this Diſorder, than in any others; for which Reaſon great Care ſhould be taken to admit the beſt, into the Patient's Chamber. For this Purpoſe it ſhould often be ventilated, or have an Admiſſion of freſh Air; be ſweetened from time to time, tho' very lightly, by ſprinkling about a little good Vinegar; and in the Seaſon it ſhould be plentifully ſupplied with agreeable Herbs, Flowers and Fruits. Should the Sick be unfortunately ſituated, and confined in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Air, there can be but little Proſpect of curing him, without altering it.</p>
               <p>§ 77. Out of many Perſons affected with theſe Diſorders, ſome have been cured by taking nothing whatſoever but Butter-milk; others by Melons and Cucumbers only; and others again by Summer Fruits of every Sort. Nevertheleſs, as ſuch Caſes are ſingular, and have been but few, I adviſe the Patient to obſerve the Method I have directed here, as the ſureſt.</p>
               <p>§ 78. It is ſufficient if he have a Stool once in two, or even in three Days. Hence there is no Reaſon for him, in this Caſe, to accuſtom himſelf to Glyſters: they may excite a Looſeneſs, which would be very dangerous.</p>
               <p>§ 79. When the Diſcharge of the Matter from the Breaſt diminiſhes, and the Patient is perceivably mended in every Reſpect, it is a Proof that the Wound in the Abſceſs is deterged, or clean, and that it is diſpoſed to heal up gradually. If the Suppuration, or Diſcharge, continues in great Quantity; if it ſeems but of an indifferent Conſiſtence; if the Fever returns every Evening, it may
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012243_0070_0F8A6B6076CDDC88"/>
be apprehended that the Wound, inſtead of healing, may degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into an Ulcer, which muſt prove a moſt embarraſſing Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Under ſuch a Circumſtance, the Patient would fall into a confirmed Hectic, and die after ſome Months Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>§ 80. I am not acquainted with any better Remedy, in ſuch a dangerous Caſe, than a Perſeverance in theſe already directed, and eſpecially in moderate Exerciſe on Horſeback. In ſome of them indeed, Recourſe may be had to the ſweet Vapours of ſome vulnerary Herbs in hot Water, with a little Oil of Turpentine, as directed No. 15. I have ſeen them ſucceed; but the ſafeſt Way is to conſult a Phyſician, who may examine and conſider, if there is not ſome particular Circumſtance combined with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that proves an Obſtacle to the Cure of it. If the Cough prevents the Patient from Sleeping, he may take in the Evening two or three Table Spoonfuls of the Preſcription No. 16, in a Glaſs of Almond Milk or Barley Water.</p>
               <p>§ 81. The very ſame Cauſes which ſuddenly ſuppreſs the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, in an Inflammation of the Breaſt, may alſo check the Expectoration from a <hi>Vomica</hi> already begun: in which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Patient is ſpeedily afflicted with an Oppreſſion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, a Fever and evident Feebleneſs. We ſhould immediately endeavour to remove this Stoppage, by the Vapour of hot Water; by giving a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 3. every Hour; by a large Quantity of the Ptiſan No. 12, and by a proper Degree of Motion or Exerciſe. As ſoon as ever the Expectoration returns, the Fever and the other Symptoms diſappear. I have ſeen this Suppreſſion in ſtrong Habits quickly followed with an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the Seat of the <hi>Vomica,</hi> that has obliged me to bleed, after which the Expectoration immediately returned.</p>
               <p>§ 82. It happens ſometimes, that the <hi>Vomica</hi> is entirely cleanſed; the Expectoration is entirely finiſhed, or drained off, the Patient ſeems well, and thinks himſelf compleatly cured: but ſoon after the Uneaſineſs, Oppreſſion, Cough and Fever are renewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Membrane or Bag of the <hi>Vomica</hi> fills again: again it empties itſelf, the Patient expectorates for ſome Days, and ſeems to recover. After ſome time however, the ſame Scene is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this Viciſſitude, or Succeſſion of moderate and of bad Health, often continues for ſome Months and even ſome Years. This happens when the <hi>Vomica</hi> is emptied and is gradually deterged; ſo that its Membranes, or Sides, touch or approach each other; but without cicatrizing or healing firmly; and then there drops or leaks in very gradually freſh Matter. For a few Days this ſeems no ways to incommode the Patient; but as ſoon as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Quantity is accumulated, he is viſited again with ſome of the former Symptoms, 'till another Evacuation enſues. People thus circumſtanced, in this Diſeaſe, ſometimes appear to enjoy a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Share of Health. It may be conſidered as a Kind of internal Iſſue, which empties and cleanſes itſelf from time to time; pretty frequently in ſome Conſtitutions, more ſlowly in others; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012243_0071_0F8A6B615540D778"/>
which ſome may attain a good middling Age. When it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives however at a very conſiderable Duration, it proves incurable. In its earlieſt State it gives way ſometimes to a Milk-diet, to rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Horſeback, and to the Medicine No. 14.</p>
               <p>§ 83. Some may be ſurprized, that in treating of an Abſceſs of the Lungs, and of the Hectic, which is a Conſequence of it, I ſay nothing of thoſe Remedies, commonly termed <hi>Balſamics,</hi> and ſo frequently employed in them, for inſtance, Turpentines, Balſam of Peru, of Mecca, Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Myrrh, Storax and Balſam of Sulphur. I ſhall however ſay briefly here (becauſe it is equally my Deſign to deſtroy the Prejudices of the People, in favour of improper Medicines, and to eſtabliſh the Reputation of good ones) that I never in ſuch Caſes made uſe of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; becauſe I am convinced, that their Operation is generally hurtful in ſuch Caſes; becauſe I ſee them daily productive of real Miſchief, that they protract the Cure, and often change a ſlight Diſorder into an incurable Diſeaſe. They are incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Digeſtion, they obſtruct the fineſt Veſſels of the Lungs, whoſe Obſtructions we ſhould endeavour to remove; and evidently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, except their Doſe be extremely ſmall, Heat and Oppreſſion. I have very often ſeen to a Demonſtration, that Pills compounded of Myrth, Turpentine and Balſam of Peru, have, an Hour after they were ſwallowed, occaſioned a Tumult and Agitation in the Pulſe, high Fluſhings, Thirſt and Oppreſſion. In ſhort, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable to every unprejudiced Perſon, that theſe Remedies, as they have been called, are truly prejudicial in this Caſe; and I heartily wiſh People may be diſabuſed with reſpect to them; and that they may loſe that Reputation ſo unhappily aſcribed to them.</p>
               <p>I know that many Perſons, very capable in other Reſpects, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of them in theſe Diſtempers: ſuch however cannot fail of diſuſing them, as ſoon as they ſhall have obſerved their Effects, abſtracted from the Virtues of the other Medicines to which they add them, and which mitigate the Danger of them. I ſaw a Patient, whom a foreign Surgeon, living at <hi>Orbe,</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cure of a Hectic with melted Bacon, (much the ſame as Hog's Lard) which aggravated the Diſeaſe. This Advice ſeemed, and certainly was, abſurd; nevertheleſs the Balſamics ordered in ſuch Caſes are probably not more digeſtible than fat Bacon. The Powder No. 14 poſſeſſes whatever theſe Balſamics pretend to: it is attended with none (of the Inconveniences they produce; and has all the good Qualities aſcribed to them. Notwithſtanding which, it muſt not be given while the Inflammation exiſts; nor when it may revive again; and no other Aliment ſhould be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Milk.</p>
               <p>The famous Medicine called the <hi>Antihectic, (Antihecticum Poterii)</hi> has not, any more than theſe Balſamics, the Virtues aſcribed to it in ſuch Caſes. I very often give it in ſome obſtinate Coughs to Infants with their Milk, and then it is very uſeful: but I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen it attended with conſiderable Effects in grown Perſons; and in the preſent Caſes I ſhould be fearful of its doing Miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:012243_0072_0F8A6B61CCA5ABC0"/>§ 84. If the <hi>Vomica,</hi> inſtead of breaking within the Subſtance of the Lungs affected, ſhould break without it, the Pus muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Cavity of the Breaſt. We know when that has happened, by the Senſation or Feeling of the Patient; who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an uncommon, a ſingular Kind of Movement, pretty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally accompanied with a Fainting. The Oppreſſion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ceaſe at once; the Fever abates; the Cough however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly continues, tho' with leſs Violence, and without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration. But this ſeeming Amendment is of a ſhort Duration, ſince from the daily Augmentation of the Matter, and its growing more acrid or ſharp, the Lungs become oppreſſed, irritated and eroded. The Difficulty of Breathing, Heat, Third, Wakeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Diſtaſte, and Deafneſs return, with many other Symptoms unneceſſary to be enumerated, and eſpecially with frequent Sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Weakneſs. The Patient ſhould be confined to his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to retard the Increaſe of the Diſeaſe as much as poſſible; notwithſtanding no other effectual Remedy remains, except that of opening the Breaſt between two of the Ribs, to diſcharge the Matter, and to ſtop the Diſorder it occaſions. This is called the Operation for the <hi>Empyema.</hi> I ſhall not deſcribe it here, as it ſhould not be undertaken but by Perſons of Capacity and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for whom this Treatiſe was not intended. I would only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it is leſs painful than terrifying; and that if it is delayed too long, it proves uſeleſs, and the Patient dies miſerably.</p>
               <p>§ 85. We may daily ſee external Inflammations turn gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or mortify. The ſame thing occurs in the Lungs, when the Fever is exceſſive, the Inflammation, either in its own Nature, extremely violent, or raiſed to ſuch a Height by hot Medicines. Intolerable Anguiſh, extreme Weakneſs, frequent Faintings, Coldneſs of the Extremities, a livid and foetid thin Humour brought up inſtead of concocted Spitting, and ſometimes black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Stripes on the Breaſt, ſufficiently diſtinguiſh this miſerable State. I have ſmelt in one Caſe of this Kind, where the Patient had been attacked with this Diſeaſe (after a forced March on Foot, having taken ſome Wine with Spices to force a Sweat) his Breath ſo horribly, ſtinking, that his Wife had many Sinkings from attending him. When I ſaw him, I could diſcern neither Pulſe nor Intellect, and ordered him nothing. He died an Hour afterwards, about the Beginning of the third Hour.</p>
               <p>§ 86. An Inflammation may alſo become hard, when it forms what we call a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> which is a very hard Tumour, indolent, or unpainful. This is known to occur, when the Diſeaſe has not terminated in any of thoſe Manners I have repreſented; and where, tho' the Fever and the other Symptoms diſappear, the Reſpiration, or Breathing, remains always a little oppreſſed; the Patient ſtill retains a troubleſome Senſation in one Side of his Breaſt; and has from time to time a dry Cough, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes after Exerciſe, and after eating, This Malady is but ſeldom

cured; though ſome Perſons attacked with it laſt many Years without any other conſiderable Complaint. They ſhould avoid all Occaſions of over-heating themſelves; which might readily produce a new Inflammation about this Tumour, the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which would be highly dangerous.</p>
               <p>§ 87. The belt Remedies againſt this Diſorder, and from which I have ſeen ſome good Effects, are the medicated Whey No. 17, and the Pills No. 18. The Patient may take twenty Pills, and a Pint and a half of the Whey every Morning for a long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and receive inwardly, now and then, the Vapour of hot Water.</p>
               <p>§ 88. Each Lung, in a perfect State of Health, touches the <hi>Pleura,</hi> the Membrane, that lines the Inſide of the Breaſt; though it is not connected to it. But it often happens, after an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Breaſt, after a Pleuriſy, and in ſome other Caſes, that theſe two Parts adhere cloſely to each other, and are never afterwards ſeparated. However this is ſcarcely to be conſidered as a Diſeaſe; and remains commonly unknown, as the Health is not impaired by it, and nothing is ever preſcribed to remove it. Nevertheleſs I have ſeen a few Caſes, in which this Adheſion was manifeſtly prejudicial.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V. Of the Pleuriſy.</head>
               <p>SECT. 89. THE Pleuriſy, which is chiefly known by theſe four Symptoms, a ſtrong Fever, a Difficulty of Breathing, a Cough, and an acute Pain about the Breaſt; the Pleuriſy, I ſay, is not a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Malady from the Peripneumony, or Inflammation of the Breaſt, the Subject of the preceding Chapter; ſo that I have very little to ſay of it, particularly, or apart.</p>
               <p>§ 90. The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe then is exactly the ſame with that of the former, that is, an Inflammation of the Lungs; but an Inflammation, that ſeems rather a little more external. The only conſiderable Difference in the Symptoms is, that the Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is accompanied with a moſt acute Pain under the Ribs, and which is commonly termed a <hi>Stitch.</hi> This Pain is felt indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over every Part of the Breaſt; though more commonly about the Sides, under the more fleſhy Parts of the Breaſt, and ofteneſt on the right Side. The Pain is greatly increaſed whenever the Patient coughs, or draws in the Air in breathing; and hence a Dread of increaſing it, (making ſome Patients forbear to cough or reſpire, as much as they poſſibly can) which aggravates the Diſeaſe, by ſtopping the Courſe of the Blood in the Lungs, that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012243_0074_0F8A6B635461C218"/>
are ſoon overcharged with it. Hence the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>flammation of this Bowel becomes general; the Blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounts up to the Head; the Countenance looks deeply red, or as it were livid; the Patient becomes nearly ſuffocated, and falls into the State deſcribed § 47.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Pain is ſo extremely violent, that if the Cough is very urgent at the ſame time, and the Sick cannot ſuppreſs or reſtrain it, they are ſeized with Convulſions, of which I have ſeen many Inſtances, but theſe occur almoſt always to Women; though they are much leſs ſubject than Men to this Diſeaſe, and indeed to all inflammatory ones. It may be proper however to obſerve here, that if Women ſhould be attacked with it, during their monthly Diſcharges, that Circumſtance ſhould not prevent the repeated and neceſſary Bleedings, nor occaſion any Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Treatment of the Diſeaſe. And hence it appears that the Pleuriſy is really an Inflammation of the Lungs, accompanied with acute Pain,</p>
               <p>§ 91. I am ſenſible that ſometimes an Inflammation of the Lungs is communicated alſo to that Membrane, which, lining the Inſide of the Breaſt, is called the <hi>Pleura</hi>; and from thence to the Muſcles, the fleſhy Parts, over and between the Ribs. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not very frequently the Caſe.</p>
               <p>§ 92. Spring is commonly the Seaſon moſt productive of Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies: in general there are few in Summer: notwithſtanding that in the Year 1762, there were a great many during the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Seaſon, which then was exceſſively ſo. The Diſeaſe uſually begins with a violent Shivering, ſucceeded by a conſiderable Heat, with a Cough, and Oppreſſion, and ſometimes with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Straitning, or Contraction, as it were, all over the Breaſt; and alſo with a Head-ach, a Redneſs of the Cheeks, and with Reachings to vomit. The Stitch does not always happen at the very firſt Onſet; often not till ſeveral Hours from the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; ſometimes not before the ſecond or even the third Day. Sometimes the Patient feels two Stitches, in different Parts of the Side; though it ſeldom happens that they are equally ſharp, and the lighteſt ſoon ceaſes. Sometimes alſo the Stitch ſhifts its Place, which promiſes well if the Part firſt attacked by it continues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from Pain: but it has a bad Appearance, if, while the firſt is preſent, another alſo ſupervenes, and both continue. The Pulſe is uſually very hard in this Diſtemper; but in the dreadful Caſes deſcribed § 47 and 90, it becomes ſoft and ſmall. There often occurs at, or very quickly after, the Invaſion, ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, or hawking up, as happens in an Inflammation of the Breaſt; at other Times there is not the leaſt Appearance of it, whence ſuch are named dry Pleuriſies, which happen pretty often. Sometimes the Sick cough but little or not at all. They often lie more at Eaſe upon the Side affected, than on the ſound one. The Progreſs of this Diſeaſe advances exactly like that deſcribed in the preceding Chapter; for how can they differ conſiderably? and the Treatment of both is the ſame. Large Haemorrhages,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012243_0075_0F8A6B642E278958"/>
or Bleedings from the Noſe, frequently happen, to the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Patient; but ſometimes ſuch Diſcharges conſiſt of a kind of corrupted Blood, when the Patient is very ill, and theſe portend Death.</p>
               <p>§ 93. This Diſtemper is often produced by drinking cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, while a Perſon is hot; from which Cauſe it is ſometimes ſo violent, as to kill the Patient in three Hours. A young Man was found dead at the Side of the Spring, from which he had quenched his Thirſt: neither indeed is it uncommon for Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to prove mortal within three Days.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Stitch diſappears, whence the Patient complains leſs; but at the ſame Time his Countenance changes; he grows pale and ſad; his Eyes look dull and heavy, and his Pulſe grows feeble. This ſignifies a Tranſlation of the Diſeaſe to the Brain, a Caſe which is almoſt conſtantly fatal.</p>
               <p>There is no Diſeaſe in which the critical Symptoms are more violent, and more ſtrongly marked, than in this. It is proper this ſhould be known, as it may prevent or leſſen our exceſſive Terror. A perfect Cure ſupervenes ſometimes, at the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when Death was expected.</p>
               <p>§ 94. This Malady is one of the moſt common and the moſt deſtroying kind, as well from its own violent Nature, as through the pernicious Treatment of it in Country Places That Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which inſiſts on curing all Diſeaſes by Sweating, entirely regulates their Conduct in treating a Pleuriſy; and as ſoon as a Perſon is afflicted with a Stitch, all the hot Medicines are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet to work. This mortal Error deſtroys more People than Gunpowder; and it is by ſo much the more hurtful, as the Diſtemper is of the moſt violent kind; and becauſe, as there is commonly not a Moment to be loſt, the whole depends on the Method immediately recurred to.</p>
               <p>§ 95. The proper Manner of treating this Diſeaſe is exactly the ſame in all Reſpects, with that of the Peripneumony; becauſe, I again affirm, it is the very ſame Diſeaſe. Hence the Bleedings, the ſoftening and diluting Drinks, the Steams, the Glyſters, the Potion No. 8, and the emolient Poultices are the real Remedies. Theſe laſt perhaps are ſtill more effectual in the Pleuriſy; and therefore they ſhould be continually applied over the very Stitch.</p>
               <p>The firſt Bleeding, eſpecially if there has been a conſiderable Diſcharge, almoſt conſtantly abates the Stitch, and often entirely removes it: though it more commonly returns after an Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Hours, either in the ſame Spot, or ſometimes in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. This ſhifting of it is rather favourable, eſpecially if the Pain, that was firſt felt under the Breaſt, ſhifts into the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Back, the Shoulder-blade, or the Nape of the Neck.</p>
               <p>When the Stitch is not at all abated, or only a little; or if, after having abated, it returns as violently as at firſt, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it returns in the ſame Spot, and the Height of the other Symptoms continues, Bleeding muſt be repeated. But if a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012243_0076_0F8A6B64CF404048"/>
Abatement of the Stitch continues; and if, though it returns, it ſhould be in a ſmaller Degree, and by Intervals, or in thoſe Places I have mentioned above; if the Quickneſs, or the Hardneſs of the Pulſe, and all the other Symptoms are ſenſibly diminiſhed, this repeated Bleeding may ſometimes be omitted. Nevertheleſs, in a very ſtrong Subject, it ſeems rather prudent not to omit it, ſince in ſuch Circumſtances it can do no Miſchief; and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Hazard may ſometimes be incurred by the Omiſſion. In very high and dangerous Pleuriſies a frequent Repetition of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neceſſary; except ſome Impediment to it ſhould ariſe from the particular Conſtitution of the Patient, from his Age, or ſome other Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>If, from the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, the Pulſe is but a little quicker and harder than in a healthy State; if it is not manifeſtly ſtrong; if the Head-ach and the Stitch are ſo moderate as to prove ſupportable; if the Cough is not too violent; if there is no ſenſible Oppreſſion or Straitneſs, and the Patient expectorate, or cough up, Bleeding may be omitted.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the adminiſtering of other Remedies, the ſame Directions are to be exactly followed, which have been already given in the preceding Chapter, to which the Reader is referred from § 53 to 66.</p>
               <p>§ 96. When the Diſeaſe is not very acute or preſſing, I have often cured it in a very few Days by a ſingle Bleeding, and a large Quantity of a Tea or Infuſion of Elder-flowers, ſweetened with Honey. It is in ſome Caſes of this Kind, that we often find the Water <hi>Faltranc</hi> to ſucceed, with the Addition of ſome Honey, and even of Oil: though the Drink I have juſt directed is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably preferable. That Drink which is compounded of equal Quantities of Wine and Water, with the Addition of much Venice Treacle, annually deſtroys a great Number of People in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>§ 97. In thoſe dry Pleuriſies, in which the Stitch, the Fever, and the Head-ach are ſtrong and violent; and where the Pulſe is very hard and very full, with an exceſſive Dryneſs of the Skin and of the Tongue, Bleeding ſhould be frequently repeated, and at ſmall Intervals from each other. This Method frequently cures the Diſeaſe effectually, without uſing any other Evacuation.</p>
               <p>§ 98. The Pleuriſy terminates, like any other inward Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, either by ſome Evacuation; by an Abſceſs; in a Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; or in a Scirrhoſity or hard Tumour; and it often leaves Adheſions in the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The Gangrene or Mortification ſometimes appears on the third Day, without having been preceded by very vehement Pains. In ſuch Caſes the Body after Death often looks very black, eſpecially in the Parts near the Seat of the Diſeaſe; and in ſuch the more ſuperſtitious aſcribe it to ſome ſupernatural Cauſe; or draw ſome unhappy Preſage from it, with reſpect to thoſe who are yet unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by it. This Appearance however is purely a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012243_0077_0F8A6B6590312440"/>
quite ſimple, and cannot be otherwiſe; and the hot Regimen and Medicines are the moſt prevailing Cauſes of it. I have ſeen it thus circumſtanced in a Man in the Flower of his Age, who had taken Venice Treacle in Cherry Water, and the Ingredients of <hi>Faltranc</hi> infuſed in Wine.</p>
               <p>§ 99. <hi>Vomicas</hi> are ſometimes the Conſequence of Pleuriſies; but their particular Situation diſpoſes them more to break <note n="*" place="bottom">This is, undoubtedly, Baron <hi>Van Swieten,</hi> with whom he had premiſed, he agreed conſiderably, in all the Diſeaſes they had both treated of. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; which is the moſt frequent Cauſe of an <hi>Empyema</hi> § 84.
<q>To prevent this, it is highly proper to apply, at the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Diſeaſe, to the Spot where the Pain chiefly rages, a ſmall Plaiſter, which may exactly fit it; ſince if the Pleuriſy ſhould terminate in an Abſceſs or Impoſthume, the purulent Matter will be determined to that Side.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As ſoon then as it is foreſeen that an Abſceſs is forming (ſee § 68) we ſhould erode, by a light Cauſtic, the Place where it is expected; and as ſoon as it is removed, Care ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to promote Suppuration there. By this Means we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a reaſonable Hope, that the Maſs of Matter will incline its Courſe to that Spot, where it will meet with the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and be diſcharged from thence. For this Heap of Matter is often accumulated between the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and the Parts which adhere to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Advice of a very great <note n="†" place="bottom">That is, into the Cavity of the Breaſt, rather than within the Subſtance of the Lungs.</note> Phyſician; but I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader, there are many Caſes, in which it can be of no Service; neither ought it to be attempted, but by Perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Abilities.</p>
               <p>With Regard to Scirrhoſity, or Hardneſs, and to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Adheſions, I can add nothing to what I have ſaid in § 86 and 87.</p>
               <p>§ 100. It has been obſerved that ſome Perſons, who have been once attacked by this Diſeaſe, are often liable to Relapſes of it, eſpecially ſuch as drink hard. I knew one Man who reckoned up his Pleuriſies by Dozens. A few Bleedings, at certain proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, might prevent theſe frequent Returns of it; which, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their exceſſive Drinking, make them languid and ſtupid, in the very Flower of their Age. They generally fall into ſome Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of an Aſthma, and from that into a Dropſy, which proves the melancholly, though not an improper Concluſion of their Lives. Such as can confine themſelves to ſome proper Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may alſo prevent theſe frequent Returns of this Diſeaſe, even without Bleeding; by a temperate Regimen; by abſtaining from time to time, from eating Fleſh and drinking Wine; at which times they ſhould drink Whey, or ſome of thoſe Diet-drinks, No. 1. 2.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012243_0078_0F8A6B6794B6E310"/>
4; and by bathing their Legs ſometimes in warm Water; eſpecially in thoſe Seaſons when this Diſeaſe is the moſt likely to return.</p>
               <p>§ 101. Two Medicines greatly eſteemed in this Diſeaſe among the Peaſantry, and even extolled by ſome Phyſicians, are the Blood of a wild He-Goat, and the <note n="*" place="bottom">This, with great Probability, means that ſmall black Subſtance often viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a rotten Egg, which is undoubtedly of a violent, or even poiſonous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Dr. TISSOT terms it expreſsly—<hi>la ſuie dans un Oetif. K.</hi>
                  </note> Soot of an Egg. I do not conteſt the Cure or Recovery of many Perſons, who have taken theſe Remedies; notwithſtanding it is not leſs true, that both of them, as well as the Egg in which the Soot is taken, are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for which Reaſon it is prudent, at leaſt, never to make uſe of them; as there is great Probability, they may do a little Miſchief; and a Certainty that they can do no good. The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipi,</hi> or <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who has not taken Notice of this Species of Wormwood in his Improvement of <hi>Quincy</hi>'s Diſpenſatory, has mentioned it in his late <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> K.</note> Wormwood of the Alps, has alſo acquired great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this Diſeaſe, and occaſioned many Diſputes between ſome very zealous Eccleſiaſtics, and a juſtly celebrated Phyſician. It ſeems not difficult however to aſcertain the proper Uſe of it. This Plant is a powerful Bitter; it heats and excites Sweat: it ſeems clear, that from ſuch Conſequences, it ſhould never be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a Pleuriſy, while the Veſſels are full, the Pulſe hard, the Fever high, and the Blood inflamed. In all ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it muſt aggravate the Diſeaſe; but towards the Concluſion of it, when the Veſſels are conſiderably emptied, the Blood is dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fever abated, it may then be recurred to; but with a conſtant Recollection that it is hot, and not to be employed without Reflection and Prudence. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This being a proper Place for directing the Seneka Rattle Snake Root, I ſhall obſerve, that the beſt Way of exhibiting it is in Decoction, by gradually ſimmering and boiling two Ounces of it in groſs Powder, in two Pints and a half of water, to a Pint and a Quarter; and then giving three Spoonfuls of it to a grown Perſon, every ſix Hours. If the Stitch ſhould continue, or return, after taking it, Bleeding, which ſhould be premiſed to it, muſt be occaſionally repeated; though it ſeldom proves neceſſary, after a few Doſes of it. It great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promotes Expectoration, keeps the Body gently open, and ſometimes operates by Urine and by Sweat; very ſeldom proving at all emetic in Decoction. The Regimen of Drinks directed here in Pleuriſies is to be obſerved as uſual Dr. <hi>Tennant,</hi> the Introducer of this valuable Medicine, confided ſolely in it, in Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Peripneumonies, without Bleeding, Bliſtering, or any other Medicines. <hi>K.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER VI. Of the Diſeaſes of the Throat.</head>
               <p>SECT. 102. THE Throat is ſubject to many Diſeaſes: one of the moſt frequent and the moſt dangerous, is that Inflammation of it, commonly termed a Quinſey. This in Effect is a Diſtemper of the ſame Nature with an Inflammation of the Breaſt; but as it occurs in a different Part, the Symptoms, of courſe, are very different. They alſo vary, and not a little, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of the Throat which are inflamed.</p>
               <p>§ 103. The general Symptoms of an Inflammation of the Throat are, the Shivering, the ſubſequent Heat, the Fever, the Head-ach, red high-coloured Urine, a conſiderable Difficulty, and ſometimes even an Impoſſibility, of ſwallowing any Thing whatſoever. But if the neareſt Parts to the <hi>Glottis,</hi> that is, of the Enterance into the Windpipe or Conduit through which we breath, are attacked, Breathing becomes exceſſively difficult; the Patient is ſenſible of extreme Anguiſh, and great Approaches to Suffocation; the Diſeaſe is then extended to the <hi>Glottis,</hi> to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Wind-pipe, and even to the Subſtance of the Lungs, whence it becomes ſpeedily fatal.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation of the other Parts is attended with leſs Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and this Danger becomes ſtill leſs, as the Diſeaſe is more extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the outward and ſuperficial parts. When the Inflammation is general, and ſeizes all the internal Parts of the Throat, and particularly the Tonſils or Almonds, as they are called, the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula,</hi> or Proceſs of the Palate, and the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or remoteſt, deepeſt Part of the Tongue, it is one of the moſt dangerous and dreadful Maladies. The Face is then ſwelled up and enflamed; the whole Inſide of the Throat is in the ſame Condition; the Patient can get nothing down; he breathes with a Pain and Anguiſh, which concur, with a Stuffing or Obſtruction in his Brain, to throw him into a Kind of furious <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Raving. His Tongue is bloated up, and is extended out of his Mouth; his Noſtrils are dilated, as tho' it were to aſſiſt him in his Breathing; the whole Neck, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Beginning of the Breaſt, is exceſſively tumified or ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; the Pulſe is very quick, very weak, and often intermits; the miſerable Patient is deprived of all his Strength, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dies the ſecond or third Day. Very fortunately this Kind, or Degree of it, which I have often ſeen in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> happens very rarely in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> where the Diſeaſe is leſs violent: and where I have only ſeen People die of it, in Conſequence of its being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouſly treated; or by reaſon of ſome accidental Circumſtances,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012243_0080_0F8A6B69C85C9448"/>
which were foreign to the Diſeaſe itſelf. Of the Multitude of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients I have attended in this Diſorder, I have known but one to fail under it, whoſe Caſe I ſhall mention towards the Cloſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>§ 104. Sometimes the Diſeaſe ſhifts from the internal to the external Parts: the Skin of the Neck and Breaſt grows very red, and becomes painful, but the Patient finds himſelf better.</p>
               <p>At other Times the Diſorder quits the Throat, but is transferred to the Brain, or upon the Lungs. Both theſe Tranſlations of it are mortal, when the beſt Advice and Aſſiſtance cannot be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately procured; and it muſt be acknowledged, that even the beſt are often ineffectual.</p>
               <p>§ 105. The moſt uſual Kind of this Diſeaſe is that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects only the Tonſils (the Almonds) and the Palate, or rather its Proceſs, the <hi>Uvula, commonly called</hi> the Palate. It generally firſt invades one of the Tonſils, which becomes enlarged, red and painful, and does not allow the afflicted to ſwallow, but with great Pain. Sometimes the Diſorder is confined to one Side; but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is extended to the <hi>Uvula,</hi> (the Palate) from whence it is extended to the other Tonſil. If it be of a mild Kind, the Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil firſt affected is generally better, when the ſecond is attacked. Whenever they are both attacked at once, the Pain and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the Patient are very conſiderable; he cannot ſwallow, but with great Difficulty and Complaint, and the Torment of this is ſo vehement, that I have ſeen Women affected with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, as often as they endeavoured to ſwallow their Spittle, or any other Liquid. They continue, even for ſeveral Hours ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, unable to take any thing whatever; all the upper inward Part of the Mouth, the Bottom of the Palate, and the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of the Tongue become lightly red, or inflamed.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable Proportion of Perſons under this Diſeaſe ſwallow Liquids more difficultly than Solids; by reaſon that Liquids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater Action of ſome Part of the Muſcles, in order to their being properly directed into their Conduit or Chanel. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition (the Swallowing) of the Spittle is attended with ſtill more Uneaſineſs than that of other Liquids; becauſe it is a little more thick and viſcid, and flows down with leſs Eaſe. This Difficulty of ſwallowing, joined to the Quantity thence accumulated, produces that almoſt continual hawking up, which oppreſſes ſome Patients ſo much the more, as the Inſide of their Cheeks, their whole Tongue, and their Lips are often galled, and even ſtead as it were. This alſo prevents their Sleeping, which however ſeems no conſiderable Evil; Sleep being <hi>ſometimes</hi> but of little Service in Diſeaſes attended with a Fever; and I have often ſeen thoſe, who thought their Throats almoſt entirely well in the Evening, and yet found them very bad after ſome Hours Sleep.</p>
               <p>The Fever in this Species of the Diſeaſe, is ſometimes very high; and the Shivering often endures for many Hours. It is ſucceeded by conſiderable Heat, and a violent Head-ach, which
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012243_0081_0F8A6B6A56646818"/>
yet is ſometimes attended with a Drowſineſs. The Fever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pretty high in the Evening, though ſometimes but inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and by the Morning perhaps there is none at all.</p>
               <p>A light Invaſion of this Diſeaſe of the Throat often precedes the Shivering; though moſt commonly it does not become manifeſt 'till after it, and at the ſame time when the Heat comes on.</p>
               <p>The Neck is ſometimes a little inflated, or puffed up; and many of the Sick complain of a pretty ſmart Pain in the Ear of that Side, which is moſt affected. I have but very ſeldom obſerved that they had it in both.</p>
               <p>§ 106. The Inflammation either diſappears by Degrees, or an Abſceſs is formed in the Part which was chiefly affected. It has never happened, at leaſt within my Knowledge, that this Sort of the Diſeaſe, prudently treated, has ever terminated either in a Mortification, or a Scirrhus: but I have been a Witneſs to either of theſe ſupervening, when Sweating was extorted in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, by hot Medicines.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very rare to meet with thoſe highly dangerous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this Diſeaſe upon the Lungs, ſuch as are deſcribed in that Species of it from § 103, 104. It is true indeed they do not occur more frequently, even in that Species there deſcribed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Diſeaſe is thrown out upon the more external Parts.</p>
               <p>§ 107. The Treatment of the Quinſey, as well as of all other inflammatory Diſeaſes, is the ſame with that of an Inflammation of the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The Sick is immediately to be put upon a Regimen; and in that Sort deſcribed § 103, Bleeding muſt be repeated four or five Times within a few Hours; and ſometimes there is a Neceſſity to recur ſtill oftner to it. When it aſſaults the Patient in the moſt vehement Degree, all Medicines, all Means, are very generally ineffectual: they ſhould be tried however. We ſhould give as much as can be taken of the Drinks No. 2. and 4. But as the Quantity they are able to ſwallow is often very inconſiderable; the Glyſter No. 5 ſhould be repeated every three Hours; and their Legs ſhould be put into a Bath of warm Water, thrice a Day.</p>
               <p>§ 108. Cupping Glaſſes, with Scarification, applied about the Neck, after bleeding twice or thrice, have often been experienced to be highly uſeful. In the moſt deſperate Caſes, when the Neck is exceſſively ſwelled, one ot two deep Inciſions made with a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, on this external Tumour, have ſometimes ſaved a Patient's Life.</p>
               <p>§ 109. In that Kind, and thoſe Circumſtances, of this Diſeaſe deſcribed § 105, we muſt have very frequent Recourſe to Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it ſhould never be omitted, when the Pulſe is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably hard and full. It is of the utmoſt Conſequence to do it inſtantly; ſince it is the only Means to prevent the Abſceſs, which forms very readily, if Bleeding has been neglected, only for a
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012243_0082_0F8A6B6C6D2B9558"/>
few Hours. Sometimes it is neceſſary to repeat it a ſecond time, but very rarely a third.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is frequently ſo gentle and mild, as to be cured without Bleeding, by the Means of much good Management. But as many as are not Maſters of their own time, nor in ſuch an eaſy Situation as to be properly attended, ought, without the leaſt Heſitation, to be bled directly, which is ſometimes ſufficient to remove the Complaint; eſpecially if, after Bleeding, the Patient drinks plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 2.</p>
               <p>In this light Degree of the Diſeaſe, it may ſuffice to bath the Legs, and alſo to receive a Glyſter, once a Day; the firſt to be uſed in the Morning, and the laſt in the Evening. Beſides the general Remedies againſt Inflammations, a few particular ones, calculated preciſely for this Diſeaſe, may be applied in each Kind or Degree of it. The bell are, firſt the emollient Poultices, No. 9, laid over the whole Neck. <note n="(1)" place="bottom">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> avail themſelves conſiderably in this Diſeaſe, of a Mixture of equal Parts of Sallad Oil and Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, or of Oil and Spirit of Hartſhorn, as a Liniment and Application round the Neck. This Remedy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with many Indications; and deſerves, perhaps, the firſt Place amongſt local Applications againſt the inflammatory Quinſey. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                  </note> Some have highly extolled the Application of Swallows Neſts in this Diſeaſe; and though I make no Objection to it, I think it certainly leſs efficacious than any of thoſe which I direct.</p>
               <p>2. Of the Gargariſms (No. 19) a great Variety may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, of pretty much the ſame Properties, and of equal Efficacy. Thoſe I direct here are what have ſucceeded beſt with me, and they are very ſimple. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Pringle</hi> is apprehenſive of ſome ill Effects from Acids in Gargariſms [<hi>which is probably from their ſuppoſed repelling Property</hi>] and prefers a Decoction of Figs in Milk and Water, to which he adds a ſmall Quantity of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac. <hi>E.

               </p>
               <p>3. The Steam of hot Water, as directed § 55, ſhould be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five or ſix times a Day; a Poultice ſhould be conſtantly kept on, and often renewed; and the Patient ſhould frequently gargle.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Perſons, beſides Children, who cannot gargle themſelves: and in fact the Pain occaſioned by it makes it the more difficult. In ſuch a Caſe, inſtead of gargling, the ſame Gargariſm (No. 19.) may be injected with a ſmall Syringe. The Injection reaches farther than Gargling, and often cauſes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to hawk up a conſiderable Quantity of glairy Matter (which has grown ſtill thicker towards the Bottom of the Throat) to his ſenſible Relief. This Injection ſhould be often repeated. The little hollowed Pipes of Elder-Wood, which all the Children in the Country can make, may be conveniently employed for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Patient ſhould breathe out, rather than inſpire, during the Injection.</p>
               <p>§ 110. Whenever the Diſeaſe terminates without Suppuration, the Fever, the Head-ach, the Heat in the Throat, and the Pain in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012243_0083_0F8A6B6D10094D08"/>
ſwallowing, begin to abate from the fourth Day, ſometimes from the third, often only from the fifth; and from ſuch Period that Abatement increaſes at a great Rate, ſo that at the End of two, three, or four Days, on the ſixth, ſeventh, or eighth, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is entirely well. Some few however continue to feel a light Degree of Pain, and that only on one Side, four or five Days longer, but without a Fever, or any conſiderable Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>§ 111. Sometimes the Fever and the other Symptoms abate, after the Bleeding and other Remedies; without any ſubſequent Amendment in the Throat, or any Signs of Suppuration. In ſuch Caſes we muſt chiefly perſiſt in the Gargariſms and the Steams; and where an experienced and dexterous Surgeon can be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it were proper he ſhould ſcarify the inflamed Tonſils. Theſe diſcharge, in ſuch Caſes, a moderate Quantity of Blood; and this Evacuation relieves, very readily, as many as make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>§ 112. If the Inflammation is in no ways diſpoſed to diſperſe, ſo that an Abſceſs is forming, which almoſt ever happens, if it has not been obviated at the Invaſion of the Diſeaſe; then the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms attending the Fever continue, though raging a little leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fourth Day: the Throat continues red, but of a leſs florid and lively Redneſs: a Pain alſo continues, though leſs acute, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied ſometimes with Pulſations, and at other times entirely without any, of which it is proper to take Notice: the Pulſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grows a little ſofter; and on the fifth or ſixth Day, and ſometimes ſooner, the Abſceſs is ready to break. This may be diſcovered by the Appearance of a ſmall white and ſoft Tumour, when the Mouth is open, which commonly appears about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Middle of the Inflammation. It burſts of itſelf; or, ſhould it not, it muſt be opened. This is effected by ſtrongly ſecuring a Lancet to one End of a ſmall Stick or Handle, and enveloping, or wrapping up the whole Blade of it, except the Point and the Length of one fourth or a third of an Inch, in ſome Folds of ſoft Linen; after which the Abſceſs is pierced with the Point of this Lancet. The inſtant it is opened, the Mouth is filled with the Diſcharge of a Quantity of <hi>Pus,</hi> of the moſt intolerable Savour and Smell. The Patient ſhould gargle himſelf, after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it, with the deterſive, or cleanſing Gargariſm No. 19. It is ſurprizing ſometimes to ſee the Quantity of Matter diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Impoſthumation. In general there is but one; tho' ſometimes I have ſeen two of them.</p>
               <p>§ 113. It happens, and not ſeldom, that the Matter is not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected exactly in the Place, where the Inflammation appeared, but in ſome leſs expoſed and leſs viſible Place; whence a Facility of ſwallowing is almoſt entirely reſtored; the Fever abates; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſleeps; he imagines he is cured, and that no Inconvenience remains, but ſuch as ordinarily occurs in the earlieſt Stage of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. A Perſon who is neither a Phyſician, nor a Surgeon, may eaſily deceive himſelf, when in this State: but the following Signs may enable him to diſcover that there is an Abſceſs, viz. A
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012243_0084_0F8A6B7023B5A1D0"/>
certain Inquietude and general Uneaſineſs; a Pain throughout the Mouth; ſome Shiverings from time to time: frequently ſharp, but ſhort and tranſient, Heat; a Pulſe moderately ſoft, but not in a natural State; a Senſation of Thickneſs and Heavineſs in the Tongue; ſmall white Eruptions on the Gums, on the Inſide of the Cheek, on the Inſide and Outſide of the Lips, and a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Taſt and Odour.</p>
               <p>§ 114. In ſuch Caſes Milk or warm Water ſhould frequently be retained in the Mouth; the Vapour of hot Water ſhould be conveyed into it; and emollient Cataplaſms may be applied about the Neck. All theſe Means concur to the ſoftening and breaking of the Abſceſs. The Finger may alſo be introduced to feel for its Situation, and when diſcovered, the Surgeon may eaſily open it. I happened once to break one under my Finger, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the leaſt Effort to do it. Warm Water may be injected pretty forcibly, either by the Mouth or the Noſtrils: this ſometimes occaſions a Kind of Cough, or certain Efforts which tend to break it, and which I have ſeen happen even from laughing. As to the reſt, the Patient ſhould not be too anxious or uneaſy about the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. I never ſaw a ſingle Inſtance of a Perſon's dying of a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey of this Kind, after the Suppuration is truly effected; neither has it happened perhaps after the Time it is forming for Suppuration.</p>
               <p>§ 115. The glairy Matter with which the Throat is overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the very Inflammation of that Part, which, from its Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, produces the ſame Effect as the Introduction of a Finger into it, occaſions ſome Patients to complain of inceſſant Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities to vomit. We muſt be upon our Guard here, and not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this Heart-Sickneſs, as ſome have called it, reſults from a Diſorder of, or a Load within, the Stomach, and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a Vomit for its Removal. The giving one here would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prove a very unfortunate Miſtake. It might, in a high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, further aggravate it; or we might be obliged (even during the Operation of the Vomit) to bleed, in order to leſſen the Violence of the Inflammation. Such Imprudence with its bad Conſequences, often leaves the Patient, even after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is cured, in a State of Langour and Weakneſs for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time. Nevertheleſs, there are ſome particular Diſorders of the Throat, attended with a Fever, in which a Vomit may be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently given. But this can only be, when there is no Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or after it is diſperſed; and there ſtill remains ſome putrid Matter in the firſt Paſſages. Of ſuch Caſes I ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">In Diſeaſes of the Throat, which have been preceded by ſuch Exceſſes in Food or ſtrong Drink, as occur too often in many Countries, when the Patient has very ſtrong Reachings to vomit, and the Tongue is moiſt at the ſame time; we ſhould not heſitate, after appeaſing the firſt Symptoms of the Inflammation [by ſufficient Bleedings, &amp;c.] to aſſiſt the Efforts of Nature, and to give a ſmall Doſe of Tartar emetic, diſſolved in ſome Spoonfuls of Water. This Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this Caſe, promotes the Diſperſion of the Inflammation, beyond any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>E. L.</hi>

                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:012243_0085_0F8A6B7223427188"/>§ 116. We often ſee in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> a Diſorder different from theſe of the Throat, of which we have juſt treated; though, like theſe, attended with a Difficulty of ſwallowing. It is termed in <hi>French</hi> the <hi>Oreillons,</hi> and often the <hi>Ourles,</hi> or ſwelled Ears. It is an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Obſtruction of thoſe Glands and their Tubes, which are to furniſh the <hi>Saliva</hi> or Spittle; and particularly of the two large Glands which lie between the Ear and the Jaw, which are called the <hi>Parotides</hi>; and of two under the Jaw, called the <hi>Maxil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares.</hi> All theſe being conſiderably ſwelled in this Diſeaſe, do not only produce a great Difficulty of ſwallowing, but alſo prevent the Mouth from opening; as an Attempt to do it is attended with violent Pain. Young Children are much more liable to this Diſeaſe than grown Perſons. Being ſeldom attended with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there is no Occaſion for Medicines: It is ſufficient to defend the Part affected from the external Air; to apply ſome proper Poultice over them; to leſſen the Quantity of their Food conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably, denying them Fleſh and Wine; but indulging them plentifully in ſome light warm Liquid, to dilute their Humours and reſtore Perſpiration. I cured myſelf of this Diſorder in 1754, by drinking nothing, for four Days, but Bawm Tea, to which I added one fourth part Milk, and a little Bread. The ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen has often cured me of other light Complaints of the Throat.</p>
               <p>§ 117. In the Spring of 1761, there were an aſtoniſhing Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons attacked with Diſorders of the Throat, of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds. Some of them were ſeized with that common Sort which I have already deſcribed. Without adding any thing more particularly, in reſpect to this Species, it happened frequently to grown Perſons, who were perfectly cured by the Method already recited. The other Species, on which I ſhall be more particular in this Place (becauſe I know they have abounded in ſome Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and were very fatal) invaded Adults, or grown Perſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; but eſpecially Children, from the Age of one Year, and even under that, to the Age of twelve or thirteen.</p>
               <p>The firſt Symptoms were the ſame with thoſe of the common Quinſey, ſuch as the Shivering, the enſuing Heat or Fever, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and a Complaint of the Throat: but the following Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms diſtinguiſhed theſe from the common inflammatory Quinſeys.</p>
               <p>1. The Sick had often ſomething of a Cough, and a little Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>2. The Pulſe was quicker, but leſs hard, and leſs ſtrong, than uſually happens in Diſeaſes of the Throat.</p>
               <p>3. The Patients were afflicted with a ſharp, ſtinging and dry Heat, and with great Reſtleſſneſs.</p>
               <p>4. They ſpat leſs than is uſual in a common Quinſey: and their Tongues were extremely dry.</p>
               <p>5. Though they had ſome Pain in ſwallowing, this was not the principal Complaint, and they could drink ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>6. The Swelling and Redneſs of the Tonſils, of the Palate, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012243_0086_0F8A6B73ADB848E0"/>
of its Proceſs were not conſiderable; but the parotid and maxil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Glands, and eſpecially the former, being extremely ſwelled and inflamed, the Pain they chiefly complained of, was this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one.</p>
               <p>7. When the Diſeaſe proved conſiderably dangerous, the whole Neck ſwelled; and ſometimes even the Veins, which return the Blood from the Brain, being overladen, as it were, the Sick had ſome Degree of Drowſineſs, and of a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Raving.</p>
               <p>8. The Paroxyſms, or Returns, of the Fever were conſiderably irregular.</p>
               <p>9. The Urine appeared to be leſs inflamed, than in other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Throat.</p>
               <p>10. Bleeding and other Medicines did not relieve them, as ſoon as in the other Kind; and the Diſeaſe itſelf continued a longer time.</p>
               <p>11. It did not terminate in a Suppuration like other Quinſeys, but ſometimes the Tonſils were ulcerated.</p>
               <p>12. <note n="*" place="bottom">This ſeems to have been the ſame kind of Quinſey, of which Drs. <hi>Huxham, Fothergil, Cotton,</hi> and others wrote, tho' under different Appelations. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Almoſt every Child, and indeed a great many of the grown Perſons aſſaulted with this Diſeaſe, threw out, either on the firſt Day, or on ſome ſucceeding one, within the firſt ſix Days, a certain Effloreſcence, or Eruptions, reſembling the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles conſiderably in ſome, but of a leſs lively Colour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Elevation, or riſing above the Skin. It appeared firſt in the Face, next in the Arms, and deſcended to the Legs, Thighs and Trunk diſappearing gradually at the End of two or three Days, in the ſame Order it had obſerved in breaking out. A few others (I have ſeen but five Inſtances of it) ſuffered the moſt grievous Symptoms before the Eruption: and threw out the genuine <hi>purpura,</hi> or white miliary Eruption.</p>
               <p>13. As ſoon as theſe Effloreſcences or Eruptions appeared, the Sick generally found themſelves better. That, laſt mentioned, continued four, five, or ſix Days, and frequently went off by Sweats. Such as had not theſe Ebullitions, which was the Caſe of many Adults, were not cured without very plentiful Sweats towards the Termination of the Diſeaſe; thoſe which occurred at the Invaſion of it being certainly unprofitable, and always hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>14. I have ſeen ſome Patients, in whom the Complaint of the Threat diſappeared entirely, without either Eruption or Sweats: but ſuch ſtill remained in very great Inquietude and Anguiſh, with a quick and ſmall Pulſe. I ordered them a ſudorific Drink, which being ſucceeded by the Eruption, or by Sweating, they found themſelves ſenſibly relieved.</p>
               <p>15. But whether the Sick had, or had not, theſe external Redneſſes or Eruptions, every one of them parted with their Cuticle or Scarf Skin, which fell off, in large Scales, from the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012243_0087_0F8A6B73D0F0DE48"/>
whole Surface of the Body: ſo great was the Acrimony or Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Matter, which was to be diſcharged through the Skin.</p>
               <p>16. A great Number ſuffered a ſingular Alteration in their Voice, different from that which occurs in common Quinſeys, the Inſides of their Noſtrils being extremely dry.</p>
               <p>17. The Sick recovered with more Difficulty after this, than after the common Quinſeys: and if they were negligent or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, during their Recovery; particularly if they expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too ſoon to the Cold, a Relapſe enſued, or ſome different Symptoms; ſuch as a Stuffing with Oppreſſion, a Swelling of the Belly, windy Swellings in different Parts; Weakneſs, Loathings, Ulcerations behind the Ears, and ſomething of a Cough and Hoarſeneſs.</p>
               <p>18. I have been ſent for to Children, and alſo to ſome young Folks, who, at the End of ſeveral Weeks, had been taken with a general Inflammation of the whole Body, attended with great Oppreſſion, and a conſiderable Abatement of their Urine, which was alſo high-coloured and turbid, or without Separation. They ſeemed alſo in a very ſingular State of Indifference, or Diſregard, with reſpect to any Object or Circumſtance. I recovered every one of them entirely by Bliſters, and the Powder No. 25. The firſt Operation of this Medicine was to vomit them: to this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a Diſcharge by Urine, and at laſt very plentiful Sweating, which compleated the Cure. Two Patients only, of a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, who were a little ricketty, and diſpoſed to glandular Scirrhoſity or Knottineſs, relapſed and died, after being recovered of the Diſeaſe itſelf for ſome Days.</p>
               <p>§ 118. I have bled ſome adult Perſons, and made Uſe of the cooling Regimen, as long as there was an evident Inflammation: it was neceſſary after this to unload the firſt Paſſages; and at laſt to excite moderate Sweats. The ſame Powders No. 25 have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten effected both theſe Diſcharges, and with entire Succeſs. In other Caſes I have made uſe of Ipecacuanha, as directed No. 35.</p>
               <p>In ſome Subjects there did not appear any inflammatory Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and the Diſtemper was ſolely owing to a Load of putrid Matter in the firſt Paſſages. Some Patients alſo diſcharged Worms. In ſuch Caſes I never bled; but the Vomit had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Effect, at the very Onſet of the Diſeaſe; it produced a perceivable Abatement of all the Symptoms; Sweating enſued very kindly and naturally, and the Patient recovered entirely a few Hours after.</p>
               <p>§ 119. There were ſome Places, where no Symptom or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Inflammation appeared; and in which Caſes it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to omit Bleeding, that having been attended with bad Conſequences.</p>
               <p>I never directed Infants to be bled. After opening the firſt Paſſages, Bliſters and diluting Drinks proved their only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012243_0088_0F8A6B7495DF3288"/>
A ſimple Infuſion of Elder-flowers, and thoſe of the Lime Tree, has done great Service to thoſe who drank plentifully of it.</p>
               <p>§ 120. I am ſenſible that in many Villages a great Number of Perſons have died, with a prodigious Inflation or Swelling of the Neck. Some have alſo died in the City, and among others a young Woman of twenty Years of Age, who had taken nothing but hot ſweating Medicines and red Wine, and died the fourth Day, with violent Suffocations, and a large Diſcharge of Blood from the Noſe. Of the great Number I have ſeen in Perſon, only two died. One was a little Girl of ten Months old. She had an Effloreſcence which very ſuddenly diſappeared: at this time I was called in; but the Humour had retreated to the Breaſt, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Death inevitable. The other was a ſtrong Youth from ſixteen to ſeventeen Years old, whoſe ſudden Attack of the Diſeaſe manifeſted, from the very Beginning, a violent Degree of it. Nevertheleſs, the Symptoms ſubſiding, and the Fever near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terminating, the Sweats which approached would probably have ſaved him: but he would not ſuffer them to have their Courſe, continually ſtripping himſelf quite naked. The Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was immediately repelled upon the Lungs, and deſtroyed him within the Space of thirty Hours. I never ſaw a Perſon die with ſo very dry a Skin. The Vomit affected him very little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and brought on a Purging.

               <head>CHAPTER VII. Of Colds.</head>
               <p>SECT. 123. THERE are many erroneous Prejudices, with regard to Colds, all of which may be attended with pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. The firſt is, that a Cold is never dangerous; an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which daily deſtroys the Lives of many. I have already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it for many Years paſt; and I have ſince beheld a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſuch Examples of it, as have but too ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted my Complaints.</p>
               <p>No Perſon however, it is certain, dies merely of a Cold, as long as it is nothing but a Cold ſimply; but when, from Inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Neglect, it is thrown upon, and occaſions Diſtempers of the Breaſt, it may, and often does, prove mortal. <hi>Colds deſtroy more than Plagues,</hi> was the Anſwer of a very ſagacious and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Phyſician to one of his Friends, who, being aſked, how he was in Health, replied, Very well, I have nothing but a Cold.</p>
               <p>A ſecond erroneous Prejudice is, that Colds require no Means, no Medicines, and that they laſt the longer for being nurſed or tampered with. The laſt Article may be true indeed with reſpect to the Method, in which the Perſon affected with them, treats them, but the Principle itſelf is falſe. Colds, like other Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, have their proper Remedies; and are removed with more or leſs Facility, as they are conducted better or worſe.</p>
               <p>§ 124. A third Miſtake is, that they are not only conſidered as not dangerous, but are even ſuppoſed wholeſome too. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Man had better have a Cold than a more grievous Diſeaſe; though it muſt be ſtill better to have neither of them. The moſt that can reaſonably be ſaid and admitted on this Point, is, that when a checked, or an obſtructed Perſpiration becomes the Cauſe of a Diſtemper, it is fortunate that it produces rather a Cold, than any very dreadful Diſeaſe, which it frequently does: though it were to be wiſhed, that neither the Cauſe, nor its Effect exiſted. A Cold conſtantly produces ſome Diſorder or Defect in the Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome Part or Parts of the Body, and thus becomes the Cauſe of a Diſeaſe. It is indeed a real Diſorder itſelf, and which, when in a violent Degree, makes a very perceivable Aſſault upon our whole Machine. Colds, with their Defluctions, conſiderably weaken the Breaſt, and ſooner or later conſiderably impair the Health. Perſons ſubject to frequent Colds are never robuſt or ſtrong; they often ſink into languid Diſorders; and a frequent Aptitude to take Cold is a Proof, that their Perſpiration may be eaſily checked and reſtrained; whence the Lungs become op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012243_0090_0F8A6B761620D738"/>
preſſed and obſtructed, which muſt always be attended with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Danger.</p>
               <p>§ 125. We may be convinced of the Weakneſs and Fallacy of theſe Prejudices, by conſidering attentively the Nature of Colds; which are nothing elſe than the very Diſeaſes already deſcribed in the three preceding Chapters, though in the lighteſt Degree only of ſuch Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>A Cold in truth is almoſt conſtantly an inflammatory Diſeaſe; a light Inflammation of the Lungs, or of the Throat; of the Membrane or very thin Skin, which lines the Noſtrils, and the Inſide of certain Cavities in the Bones of the Checks and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Theſe Cavities communicate with the Noſe in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that when one Part of this Membrane is affected with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, it is eaſily communicated to the other Parts.</p>
               <p>§ 126. It is ſcarcely neceſſary to deſcribe the Symptoms of a Cold, and it may be ſufficient to remark, 1, That their chief Cauſe is the ſame with that, which moſt commonly produces the Diſeaſes already treated of, that is, an obſtructed Perſpiration, and a Blood ſomewhat inflamed. 2, That whenever theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes affect great Numbers, many Colds prevail at the ſame time. 3, That the Symptoms which manifeſt a violent Cold, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe which precede or uſher in theſe Diſeaſes. People are rarely attacked by great Colds, without a Shivering and Fever; which laſt ſometimes continues for many Days. There is a Cough, a dry Cough, for ſome time; after which ſome Expectoration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, which allays the Cough, and lightens the Oppreſſion: at which time the Cold may be ſaid to be maturated, or ripe. There are pretty often flight Stitches, but unfixed or flying about, with a little Complaint of the Throat. When the Noſtrils happen to be the Seat of the Diſorder, which is then very improperly termed a Cold of the Brain, it is often attended with a vehement Head-ach, that ſometimes depends on an Irritation of the Membrane, which lines the Cavities in the Bone of the Forehead, or the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illary Sinuſes, that is, the Cavities in the Jaws. At firſt the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Noſe is very clear, thin and ſharp; afterwards, in Proportion to the Abatement of the Inflammation, it becomes thicker; and the Conſiſtence and Colour of it reſemble thoſe of what others cough up. The Smell, the Taſt, and the Appetite are commonly impaired by it.</p>
               <p>§ 127. Colds ſeem to be of no certain Duration or Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Thoſe of the Head or Brain generally laſt but a few Days; of the Breaſt longer. Some Colds nevertheleſs terminate in four or five Days. If they extend beyond this Term they prove really hurtful. 1, Becauſe the Violence of the Cough diſorders the whole Machine; and particularly, by forcing up the Blood to the Head. 2, By depriving the Perſon afflicted of his uſual Sleep, which is almoſt conſtantly diminiſhed by it. 3, By im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Appetite, and confuſing the Digeſtion, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably leſſened by it. 4, By weakening the Lungs themſelves
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012243_0091_0F8A6B76D1ECE9B8"/>
through the continual Agitation from Coughing; whence all the Humours being gradually determined towards them, as the weak eſt Part, a continual Cough ſubſiſts. Hence alſo they become o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged with Humours, which grow viſcid there; the Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is overloaded and oppreſſed; a flow Fever appears; Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition almoſt ceaſes; the Patient becomes very weak; ſinks into a Waſting, an obſtinate Wakefulneſs and Anguiſh, and often dies in a ſhort time, 5, By Reaſon that the Fever, which almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly accompanies a great Cold, concurs to wear the Body down.</p>
               <p>§ 128. Wherefore, ſince a Cold is a Diſeaſe of the ſame Kind with Quinſeys, Peripneumonies and Inflammations of the Breaſt, it ought to be treated in the ſame Manner. If it is a violent one, Blood ſhould be taken from the Arm, which may conſiderably ſhorten its Duration: and this becomes more eſſentially neceſſary, whenever the Patient is of a ſanguineous ruddy Complexion, a bounds with Blood, and has a ſtrong Cough, and great Head-ach.</p>
               <p>The Drinks No. 1, 2, 3, 4, ſhould be very plentifully uſed. It is advantageous to bathe the Feet in warm Water every Night at going to Bed. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">It frequently happens, that the Bathings alone remove the Head-ach, and the Cough too, by relaxing the lower Parts, and the entire Surface of the Body. If the Patient is coſtive, he ſhould receive Glyſters of warm Water, in which ſome Bran has been boiled, with the Addition of a little common Soap or Butter. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                  </note> In a Word, if the Patient is put into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen, the Cure is very ſpeedily effected.</p>
               <p>§ 129. The Diſorder, indeed, however, is often ſo very ſlight, that it may be thought to require very little, if any medical Treatment, and may be eaſily cured without Phyſick, by abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Fleſh, Eggs, Broth and Wine; from all Food that is ſharp, fat and heavy; and by dieting upon Bread, Puls, Fruit and Water; particularly by eating little or no Supper; and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if thirſty, a ſimple Ptiſan of Barley, or an Infuſion of Elder flowers, with the Addition of a third or fourth Part of Milk. Bathing the Feet, and the Powder No. 20 contribute to diſpoſe the Patient to ſleep. Five Tea-Cups of an Infuſion of the red, or wild Poppy Leaves may alſo be ventured on ſafely.</p>
               <p>§ 130. When the Fever, Heat and Inflammation wholly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; when the Patient has kept to his Regimen for ſome Days, and his Blood is well diluted, if the Cough and Want of Sleep ſtill continue, he may take in the Evening a Doſe of Storax <note n="†" place="bottom">Under theſe Circumſtances of a tickling Cough from a Cold, without a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and with very little Inflammation, I have known great and very frequent Succeſs from a Doſe of <hi>Elixir paregoricum,</hi> taken at Bed-time, after a very light thin Supper. If the Patient be ſanguine, ſtrong and coſtive, Bleeding in a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Quantity, and a gently opening Potion, or purging Glyſter, may be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently premiſed to it. Grown Perſons may take from thirty to eighty, or even one hundred Drops of it, in Barley Water, or any other pectoral Drink; and Children in the Chincough from five to twenty Drops; half an Ounce of it by Meaſure containing about one Grain of Opium, which is the Quantity contained in leſs than quite ſix Grains of the Storax Pill; this laſt being a very available pectoral Opiate too in Coughs from Defluction, in more adult Bodies, who may alſo prefer a Medicine in that ſmall Size and Form. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Pill,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012243_0092_0F8A6B778BC5CB40"/>
or of Venice Treacle with Elder-flower Tea, after bathing his Feet. Theſe Remedies by ſtilling the Cough, and reſtoring Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, frequently cure the Cold in the Space of one Night. I confeſs at the ſame time, I have ſeen bad Conſequences from ſuch Opiates, when given too early in the Complaint. It is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, when they are given, that the Patient ſhould have ſupt but very moderately, and that his Supper ſhould be digeſted.</p>
               <p>§ 131. An immenſe Number of Remedies are cried up for the Cure of Colds, ſuch as Ptiſans of Apples or Pippins, of Liquorice, of dry Raiſins, of Figs, of Borage, of Ground-Ivy, of <hi>Veronica,</hi> or Speedwell, of Hyſop, of Nettles, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> I have no Deſign to depreciate them; as all of them may poſſibly be uſeful: But unfortunately, thoſe who have ſeen any particular one of them ſucceed in one Caſe, readily conclude it to be the moſt excellent of them all; which is a dangerous Error, becauſe no one Caſe is a ſufficient Foundation to decide upon: neither indeed are any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to decide, who have not ſeen a great Number of ſuch Caſes; and who do not ſo attentively obſerve the Effects of different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as to determine on thoſe which moſt frequently agree with the Diſorder; and which, in my Judgment, are thoſe I have juſt enumerated. I have known a Tea or Infuſion of Cherry Stalks, which is not a diſagreeable Drink, to cure a very invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cold.</p>
               <p>§ 132. In Colds of the Head or Brain, the Steam of warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, or that in which Elder-flowers, or ſome other mild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatic Herbs, have been boiled, commonly affords a pretty ſpeedy Relief. Theſe are alſo ſerviceable in Colds fallen on the Breaſt. See § 55.</p>
               <p>It has been a Practice, though of no very long ſtanding, to give the Fat of a Whale in theſe Caſes; but this is a very crude indigeſtible Kind of Fat, and greaſy oily Medicines ſeldom agree with Colds. Beſides, this Whale's Fat is very diſagreeable and rancid, that is rank; ſo that it were better to forbear uſing it: I have ſometimes ſeen ill Effects from it, and rarely any good ones <note n="‖" place="bottom">This ſeems but too applicable to the very popular Uſe of <hi>Spermaecti,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuch Caſes, which can only greaſe the Paſſage to the Stomach; muſt impair its digeſtive Faculty, and cannot operate againſt the Cauſe of a Cold; tho' that Cure of it, which is effected by the Oeconomy of Nature in due time, is often aſcribed to ſuch Medicines, as may rather have retarded it. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>§ 133. Such Perſons as abate nothing of the uſual Quantity of their Food, when ſeized with a Cold, and who ſwallow down large Quantities of hot Water, ruin their Health. Their Digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſes; the Cough begins to affect the Stomach, without ceaſing to afflict the Breaſt; and they incur a Chance of ſinking into the Condition deſcribed § 127, No. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:012243_0093_0F8A6B784CB43A50"/>Burnt Brandy and ſpiced Wine are very pernicious in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Colds, and the Omiſſion of them muſt be a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Omiſſion. If any good Effects have ever been known to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Uſe of them, it has been towards the going off of the Cold; when the Diſorder maintained its Ground, ſolely from the Weakneſs of the Patient. Whenever this is the Caſe, there is not the leaſt Room for farther Relaxation; but the Powders No. 14, ſhould be taken every Day in a little Wine; and ſhould the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſeem likely to be thrown upon the Lungs, Bliſters ought to be applied to the fleſhy Part of the Legs.</p>
               <p>§ 134. Drams, or <hi>Liqueurs,</hi> as they are called in <hi>French,</hi> agree ſo very little in this laſt State, that frequently a very ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them revives a Cold that was juſt expiring. There really are ſome Perſons who never drink them without taking Cold, which is not to be wondered at, as they occaſion a light Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Breaſt, which is equivalent to a Cold or Defluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Perſons labouring under this Diſorder ſhould not, however, expoſe themſelves to violent cold Weather, if there is a Poſſibility of avoiding it: though they ſhould equally guard too againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heat. Thoſe, who incloſe themſelves in very hot Rooms, never get quite cured; and how is it poſſible they ſhould be cured in ſuch a Situation? Such Rooms; abſtracted from the Danger of coming out of them, produce Colds in the ſame Manner that Drams do, by producing a light Inflammation in the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>§ 135. Perſons ſubject to frequent Colds, which Habits are ſometimes termed <hi>fluxionary,</hi> or liable to Defluxions, imagine they ought to keep themſelves very hot. This is an Error which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly deſtroys their Health. Such a Diſpoſition to take Cold ariſes from two Cauſes; either becauſe their Perſpiration is eaſily impaired; or ſometimes from the Weakneſs of the Stomach or the Lungs, which require particular Remedies. When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint ariſes from the Perſpiration's being eaſily diſturbed and leſſened, the hotter they keep themſelves, the more they ſweat, and increaſe their Complaint the more. This inceſſantly warm Air lets down and weakens the whole Machine, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Lungs; where the Humours finding leſs Reſiſtance, are continually derived, and are accumulated there. The Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly bathed in a ſmall Sweat, becomes relaxed, ſoft, and incapable of compleating its Functions: from which Failure the ſlighteſt Cauſe produces a total Obſtruction of Perſpiration; and a Multitude of languid Diſorders enſue.</p>
               <p>Theſe Patients, thus circumſtanced, redouble their Precautions againſt the Cold, or even the Coolneſs of the Air, while their utmoſt Cautions are but ſo many effectual Means to lower their Health; and this the more certainly, as their Dread of the free Air neceſſarily ſubjects them to a fedentary Life, which increaſes all their Symptoms; while the hot Drinks they indulge in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their Severity. There is but one Method to cure People
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012243_0094_0F8A6B792D8D6468"/>
thus ſituated; that is, by accuſtoming them gradually to the Air; to keep them out of hot Chambers; to leſſen their Cloathing by Degrees; to make them ſleep cool; and let them eat or drink nothing but what is cold, Ice itſelf being wholeſome in their Drink: to make them uſe much Exerciſe; and finally, if the Diſorder be inveterate, to give them for a conſiderable time the Powder No. 14, and make them uſe the cold Bath. This Method ſucceeds equally too with thoſe, in whom the Diſeaſe originally depended on a Weakneſs of the Stomach, or of the Lungs: and in fact, at the End of a certain Period, theſe three Cauſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways combined. Some Perſons who have been ſubject, for many Years, to catch Colds throughout the Winter; and who, during that Seaſon, never went out, and drank every thing warm, have been evidently the better, during the Winters of 1761 and 1762, for the Directions I have given here. They now walk out every Day; drink their Liquids cold; and by this Means entirely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape Colds, and enjoy perfect Health.</p>
               <p>§ 236. It is more cuſtomary indeed in Town, than in the Country, to have different Sorts of Troches, and Compoſitions in the Mouth. I am not for excluding this Habit; though I think nothing is ſo efficacious as Juice of Liquorice; and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſufficient Doſe be given, it affords certain Relief. I have taken an Ounce and a half in one Day, and have felt the good Conſequences of it very remarkably.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII. Of the Diſeaſes of the Teeth.</head>
               <p>SECT. 137. THE Diſeaſes of the Teeth, which are ſometimes ſo tedious and ſo violent, as to cauſe obſtinate Wakefulneſs, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Degree of Fever, Raving, Inflammations, Abſceſſes, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the Bones, Convulſions, and Faintings, depend on three principal Cauſes. 1, On a <hi>Caries</hi> or Rottenneſs of the Teeth. 2, On an Inflammation of the Nerves of the Teeth, or of the Membrane which inveſts and covers them; and which affects the Membrane of the Gums. 3, On a cold Humour or Defluction that is determined to the Teeth, and to their Nerves and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</p>
               <p>§ 138. In the firſt of theſe Caſes, the <hi>Caries</hi> having eat down to, and expoſed the naked Nerve, the Air, Food, and Drink ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, or, as it were, ſting it; and this Irritation is attended with Pain more or leſs violent. Every thing that increaſes the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012243_0095_0F8A6B79FA10B348"/>
Motion or Action of the affected Part, as Exerciſe, Heat, or Food, will be attended with the ſame Conſequence.</p>
               <p>When the Tooth is greatly decayed, there is no other Cure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that by extracting it, without which the Pain continues; the Breath becomes very offenſive; the Gum is eat down; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teeth, and ſometimes even the Jaw-bone, are infected with the Rottenneſs: beſides, that it alſo prevents the Uſe of the other Teeth, which are infeſted with a Kind of tartarous Matter, and Decay.</p>
               <p>But when the Diſorder is leſs conſiderable, the Progreſs of it may ſometimes be reſtrained, by burning the Tooth with a hot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, or by filling it with Lead, if it is fitted to receive and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Different corroding Liquids are ſometimes uſed on theſe Occaſions, <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> itſelf, and Spirit of Vitriol: but ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are highly dangerous, and ought to be excluded. When the Patients, from Dread, reject the Operations juſt mentioned, a little Oil of Cloves may be applied, by introducing a ſmall Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Cotton, dipt in it, to the rotten hollow Tooth; which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten affords conſiderable Eaſe and Reſpite. Some make uſe of a Tincture of Opium, or Laudanum, after the ſame Manner; and indeed theſe two Medicines may be uſed together in equal Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I have often ſucceeded with <hi>Hoffman</hi>'s mineral Anodyne Liquor; which ſeemed indeed for a few Moments, to increaſe the Pain; but Eaſe generally enſues after ſpitting a little time. A Gargariſm made of the Herb <hi>Argentina,</hi> that is Silver-weed, or wild Tanſey, in Water, frequently appeaſes the Pain that reſults from a <hi>Caries</hi> of the Teeth: and in ſuch Caſes many People have found themſelves at Eaſe, under a conſtant Uſe of it. It certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an Application that cannot hurt, and is even beneficial to the Gums. Others have been relieved by rubbing their Faces over with Honey.</p>
               <p>§ 139. The ſecond Cauſe is the Inflammation of the Nerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Subſtance, or of the Membrane on the Outſide of the Tooth. This is diſcovered by the Patient's Temperament Age and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living. They who are young, ſanguine, who heat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much, whether by Labour, by their Food, their Drink, by ſitting up late, or by any other Exceſs; they who have been accuſtomed to any Diſcharges or Eruptions of Blood, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or artificial, and who ceaſe to have them as uſual, are much expoſed to the Tooth-ach, from this Cauſe.</p>
               <p>This Pain, or rather Torment, if in an acute Degree, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens very ſuddenly, and often after ſome heating Cauſe. The Pulſe is ſtrong and full; the Countenance conſiderably red; the Mouth extremely hot: there is often a pretty high Fever, and a violent Head-ach. The Gums, or ſome Part of them, become inflamed, ſwelled, and ſometimes an Abſceſs appears. At other times the Humours throw themſelves upon the more external Parts; the Cheek ſwells, and the Pain abates. When the Cheek
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012243_0096_0F8A6ADEE2AA8AD0"/>
ſwells, but without any Diminution of the Pain, it then becomes an Augmentation, but no eſſential Change, of the Diſorder.</p>
               <p>§ 140. In this Species of the Diſeaſe, we muſt have Recourſe to the general Method of treating inflammatory Diſorders, and direct Bleeding, which often produces immediate Eaſe, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed early. After Bleeding, the Patient ſhould gargle with Barley Water, or Milk and Water; and apply an emollient Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm to the Cheek. If an Abſceſs or little Impoſthume appears, the Suppuration or ripening of it is to be promoted, by holding continually in the Mouth ſome hot Milk, or Figs boiled in ſome Milk: and as ſoon as ever it ſeems ripe, it ſhould be opened, which may be done eaſily, and without any Pain. The Diſorder, when depending on this Cauſe, is ſometimes not ſo violent, but of a longer Duration and returns whenever the Patient heats him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; when he goes to Bed; or as ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Caſe he ſhould be bled, without which his other Medicines will have little Effect; and he ſhould bath his Feet in warm Water for ſome Evenings ſucceſſively, taking one Doſe of the Powder No. 20. Entire Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from Wine and Meat; eſpecially at Night, has cured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of inveterate and obſtinate Maladies of the Teeth.</p>
               <p>In this Species of Tooth-ach, all hot Remedies are pernicious; and it often happens that Opium, Venice Treacle, and Storax Pills, are ſo far from producing the Relief expected from them, that they have aggravated the Pain.</p>
               <p>§ 141. When the Diſeaſe ariſes from a cold Diſtillation, or Humour, tending to theſe Parts, it is commonly (though equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painful) attended with leſs violent Symptoms. The Pulſe is neither ſtrong, full nor quick; the Mouth is leſs heated and leſs ſwelled. In ſuch Caſes the afflicted ſhould be purged with the Powder No. 21, which has ſometimes perfectly cured very obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Complaints of this Sort. After purging they ſhould make uſe of the Diet Drink of the Woods No. 22. This has cured Tooth achs, which have baffled other Attempts for many Years; but it muſt be added, this Drink would be hurtful in the Diſeaſe from a different Cauſe. Bliſters to the Nape of the Neck, or <note n="*" place="bottom">A ſmall Bliſter behind the Ear of the affected Side, or both Ears, has very often removed the Pain, when from a Defluction.

As this laſt Cauſe is often the Conſequence of a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Stomach, it daily happens that we ſee ſome People, whoſe Diſorder from this Cauſe is augmented, in Proportion as they indulge in a cooling, refreſhing Way of living. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Diſorder diſpoſes them to increaſe the Doſe of what they miſtake for its Remedy, in Proportion to which their Pain only increaſes. There is a Neceſſity that ſuch Perſons ſhould alter this Method; and make uſe of thoſe Medicines which are proper to ſtrengthen the Stomach, and to reſtore Perſpiration. The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der No. 14 has often produced the beſt Conſequences, when I have ordered it in theſe Caſes; and it never fails to diſſipate that Tooth-ach very ſpeedily, which returns periodically at ſtated Days and Hours. I have alſo cured ſome Perſons who never drank Wine, by adviſing them to the Uſe of it.</p>
               <p>§ 143. But beſides the Diſeaſes of the Teeth, that are owing to theſe three principal Cauſes. which are the moſt common ones; there are ſome very tedious and moſt tormenting Diſorders of them, that are occaſioned by a general Acrimony, or great Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Maſs of Blood, and which are never cured by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicines but ſuch, as are proper to correct that Acrimony. When it is of a ſcorbutic Nature, the wild Horſe-radiſh (Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort) Water Creſſes, Brooklime, Sorrel, and Wood-ſorrel cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and cure it. If it is of a different Nature, it requires different Remedies. But very particular Details do not come within the Plan of this Work. As the Malady is of the chronical or tedious Kind, it allows time to conſider and conſult more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>The Gout and the Rheumatiſm are ſometimes transferred to the Teeth, and give Riſe to the moſt excruciating Pains; which muſt be treated like the Diſeaſes from which they ariſe.</p>
               <p>§ 144. From what has been ſaid on this Diſorder, the Reader will diſcern, in what that imaginary Oddneſs may conſiſt, which has been aſcribed to it, from the ſame Application's relieving one Perſon in it, and not affording the leaſt Relief to another. Now the plain Reaſon of this is, that theſe Applications are always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012243_0098_0F8A6AE01A104590"/>
without an exact Knowledge of the particular Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, in different Subjects and Circumſtances; whence the Pain from a rotten Tooth is treated like that from an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that from an Inflammation, like the Pain from a cold Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Fluxion; and this laſt like a Pain cauſed by a ſcorbutic Acrimony: ſo that the Diſappointment is not in the leaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing. Perhaps Phyſicians themſelves do not always attend diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly enough to the Nature of each particular Diſorder: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they do, they content themſelves with directing ſome of the leſs potent Medicines, which may be inadequate to accompliſh the neceſſary Effect. If the Diſtemper truly be of an inflammatory Diſpoſition, Bleeding is indiſpenſible to the Cure.</p>
               <p>It happens in fact, with Regard to the Diſeaſes of the Teeth, as well as to all other Diſeaſes, that they ariſe from different Cauſes; and if theſe Cauſes are not oppoſed by Medicines ſuited to them, the Diſeaſe, far from being cured, is aggravated.</p>
               <p>I have cured violent Tooth-achs, of the lower Jaw, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Plaiſter of Meal, the White of an Egg, Brandy, and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tich, at the Corner of that Jaw, over the Spot where the Pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Artery may be perceived: and I have alſo mitigated the moſt excruciating Pains of the Head, by applying the ſame Plaiſter upon the temporal Artery.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX. Of the Apoplexy.</head>
               <p>SECT. 145. EVERY Perſon has ſome Idea of the Diſeaſe termed an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, which is a ſudden Privation or Loſs of all Senſe, and of all voluntary Motion; the Pulſe at the ſame time being kept up, but Reſpiration or Breathing being oppreſſed. I ſhall treat of this Diſeaſe only in a brief Manner, as it is not common in our Country Villages; and as I have expatiated on it in a different Manner in a Letter to Dr. HALLER, publiſhed in 1761.</p>
               <p>§ 146. This Diſeaſe is generally diſtinguiſhed into two Kinds, the ſanguineous and ſerous Apoplexy. Each of them reſults from an Overfulneſs of the Blood Veſſels of the Brain, which preſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prevents or impairs the Functions of the Nerves. The whole Difference between theſe two Species conſiſts in this, that the ſanguineous Apoplexy prevails among ſtrong robuſt Perſons, who have a rich, heavy, thick, and inflammable Blood, and that in a large Quantity; in which Circumſtance it becomes a genuine inflammatory Diſtemper. The ſerous, or humoral Apoplexy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades Perſons of a leſs robuſt Conſtitution; whoſe Blood is more
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:012243_0099_0F8A6AE0CFEDE950"/>
dilute or watery; and rather viſcid, or lightly gelatinous, than heavy or rich; whoſe Veſſels are in a more relaxed State; and who abound more in other Humours than in red Blood.</p>
               <p>§ 147. When the firſt Kind of this Diſeaſe exiſts in its moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Degree, it is then ſometimes termed, an apoplectic Stroke, or thundering Apoplexy, which kills in a Moment or inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and admits of no Remedies. When the Aſſault is leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, and we find the Patient with a ſtrong, full and raiſed Pulſe, his Viſage red and bloated, and his Neck ſwelled up; with an oppreſſed and loud hoarſe Reſpiration; being ſenſible of nothing, and capable of no other Motions, except ſome Efforts to vomit, the Caſe is not always equally deſperate. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately,</p>
               <p>1, Entirely uncover the Patient's Head, covering the reſt of his Body but very lightly; procure him inſtantly very freſh free Air, and leave his Neck quite unbound and open.</p>
               <p>2, His Head ſhould be placed as high as may be, with his Feet hanging down.</p>
               <p>3, He muſt loſe from twelve to ſixteen Ounces of Blood, from a free open Orifice in the Arm; the Strength or Violence with which the Blood ſallies out, ſhould determine the Surgeon to take a few Ounces more or leſs. It ſhould be repeated to the third or fourth time, within the Space of three or four Hours, if the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſeem to require it, either in the Arm, or in the Foot.</p>
               <p>4, A Glyſter ſhould be given of a Decoction of the firſt emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient opening Herbs that can be got, with four Spoonfuls of Oil, and one Spoonful of Salt; which ſhould be repeated every three Hours.</p>
               <p>5, If it is poſſible, he ſhould be made to ſwallow Water plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in each Pot, or three Pounds and a Quarter, of which three Drachms of Nitre are to be diſſolved.</p>
               <p>6, As ſoon as the Height and Violence of the Pulſe abates, when the Patient's Breathing becomes leſs oppreſſed and difficult, and his Countenance leſs inflamed, he ſhould take the Decoction No. 23; or, if it cannot be got ready in time, he ſhould take three Quarters of an Ounce of Cream of Tartar, and drink Whey plentifully after it. This Medicine ſucceeded extremely well with me in a Caſe where I could not readily procure any other.</p>
               <p>7, He ſhould avoid all ſtrong Liquor, Wine, diſtilled Spirit, whether inwardly or by outward Application, and ſhould even be prevented from <note n="*" place="bottom">I have been very authentically aſſured of the Death of a hale Man, which happened in the very act of pouring out a large Quantity of diſtilled Spirits, by Gallons or Bucket-fuls, from one Veſſel into another. <hi>K.</hi>

               <p>8, The Patient ſhould be ſtirred, moved, or even touched, as little as it is poſſible: in a word, every thing muſt be avoided that can give him the leaſt Agitation. This Advice, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012243_0100_0F8A6AE19384A4A0"/>
is directly contrary to the common Practice; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which it is founded in Reaſon, approved by Experience, and abſolutely neceſſary. In fact, the whole Evil reſults from the Blood being driven up with too much Force, and in too great a Quantity, to the Brain; which being thence in a State of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, prevents every Movement and every Influence of the Nerves. In order, therefore, to re-eſtabliſh theſe Movements, the Brain muſt be unloaded, by diminiſhing the Force of the Blood. But ſtrong Liquors, Wines, Spirits, volatile Salts, all Agitations and Frictions augment it, and by that very Means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Load, the Embarraſſment of the Brain, and thus heighten the Diſeaſe itſelf. On the contrary, every thing that calms the Circulation, contributes to recall Senſation and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motion the ſooner.</p>
               <p>9. Strong Ligatures ſhould be made about the Thighs under the Ham: By this Means the Blood is prevented in its Aſcent from the Legs, and leſs is carried up to the Head.</p>
               <p>If the Patient ſeems gradually, and in Proportion as he takes proper Medicines, to advance into a leſs violent State, there may be ſome Hopes. But if he rather grows worſe after his earlieſt Evacuations, the Caſe is deſperate.</p>
               <p>§ 148. When Nature and Art effect his Recovery, his Senſes return: though there frequently remains a little <hi>Delirium</hi> or Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering for ſome time; and almoſt always a paralytic Defect, more or leſs of the Tongue, the Arm, the Leg, and the Muſcles of the ſame Side of the Face. This Palſy ſometimes goes off gradually, by the Help of cooling Purges from time to time, and a Diet that is but very moderately and lightly nouriſhing. All hot Medicines are extremely hurtful in this Caſe, and may pave the Way to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Attack. A Vomit might be even fatal, and has been more than once ſo <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vomits, which are ſo pernicious in the ſanguineous Apoplexy, where the Patient's Countenance and Eyes are inflamed; and which are alſo dangerous or uſeleſs, when a Perſon has been very moderate in his Meals, or is weakened by Age or other Circumſtances, and whoſe Stomach is far from being overloaded with Aliment, are nevertheleſs very proper for groſs Feeders, who are accuſtomed to exceed at Table, who have Indigeſtions, and have a Maſs of viſcid glairy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in their Stomachs; more eſpecially, if ſuch a one has a little while before indulged himſelf exceſſively, whence he has vomited without any other evident Cauſe, or at leaſt had very ſtrong <hi>Nauſeas,</hi> or Loathings.

or Maſs in the Stomach; but on the Oppreſſion and Embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Brain: and the more conſiderable ſuch Efforts are, the more ſuch Oppreſſion is increaſed; by reaſon that as long as they continue, the Blood cannot return from the Head, by which Means the Brain remains overcharged.</p>
               <p>§ 149. The other Species of Apoplexy is attended with the like Symptoms, excepting the Pulſe not being ſo high nor ſtrong; the Countenance being alſo leſs red, ſometimes even pale; the Breathing ſeems leſs oppreſſed; and ſometimes the Sick have a greater Facility to vomit, and diſcharge more upwards.</p>
               <p>As this Kind of the Diſeaſe attacks Perſons who abound leſs in Blood; who are leſs ſtrong, and leſs heated or inflamed, Bleeding is not often at all neceſſary; at leaſt the Repetition of it is ſcarcely ever ſo: and ſhould the Pulſe have but a ſmall Fullneſs, and not the leaſt unnatural Hardneſs, Bleeding might even be pernicious.</p>
               <p>1. The Patient however ſhould be placed as was directed in the former Mode of this Diſeaſe; though it ſeems not equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary here.</p>
               <p>2. He ſhould receive a Glyſter, but without Oil, with double the Quantity of Salt, and a Bit of Soap of the Size of a ſmall Egg; or with four or five Sprigs of Hedge Hyſſop. It may be repeated twice a Day.</p>
               <p>3. He ſhould be purged with the Powder No. 21.</p>
               <p>4. His common Drink may be a ſtrong Infuſion of Leaves of Bawm.</p>
               <p>5. The Purge ſhould be repeated the third Day.</p>
               <p>6. Bliſters ſhould immediately be applied to the fleſhy Part of the Legs, or between the Shoulder Blades. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Theſe Bliſters may be preceded by Cupping with Scarification on the Nape of the Neck. This Remedy, often uſed by the ancient Phyſicians, hut too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> is one of the moſt ſpeedy, and not the leaſt efficacious, Applications in both ſanguine and ſerous Apoplexies. <hi>E.

               </p>
               <p>7. Should Nature ſeem diſpoſed to relieve herſelf by Sweating, it ſhould be encouraged; and I have often known an Infuſion of the <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> or bleſſed Thiſtle, produce this Effect very ſucceſsfully. If this Method be entered upon, the Sweat ought to be kept up (without ſtirring if poſſible) for many Days. It has then ſometimes happened, that at the End of nine Days, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has been totally freed from the Palſy, which commonly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this Species of the Apoplexy, juſt as it does the other.</p>
               <p>§ 150. Perſons who have been attacked with either Kinds of this Diſeaſe, are liable to ſubſequent ones; each of which is more dangerous than that preceding: whence an Endeavour to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or prevent ſuch Relapſes becomes of the utmoſt Importance. This is to be effected in each Sort by a very exact, and rather ſevere Diet, even to diminiſhing the uſual Quantity of the Patient's Food; the moſt eſſential Precaution, to be obſerved by any who have been once aſſaulted with it, being entirely to leave off Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012243_0102_0F8A6AE421FB5358"/>
Indeed thoſe, who have been once attacked with the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>ſanguineous Apoplexies,</hi> ſhould be ſtill more exact, more upon their Guard, than the others. They ſhould deny themſelves whatever is rich and juicy, hot or aromatic, ſharp, Wine, diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Liquors and Coffee. They ſhould chiefly confine themſelves to Garden-Stuff, Fruits and Acids; ſuch ſhould eat but little Fleſh, and only thoſe called white; taking every Week two or three Doſes of the Powder No. 24, in a Morning faſting, in a Glaſs of Water. They ſhould be purged twice or thrice a Year with the Draught No. 23; uſe daily Exerciſe; avoid very hot Rooms, and the violent Heat of the Sun. They ſhould go to Bed betimes, riſe early, never lie in Bed above eight Hours; and if it is obſerved that their Blood increaſes conſiderably, and has a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards the Head, they ſhould be bled without Heſitation; and for ſome Days reſtrain themſelves entirely to a thin and low Regimen, without taking any ſolid Food. In theſe Circumſtances warm Bathings are hurtful. In the other, the ſerous Apoplexy, inſtead of purging with No. 23, the Patient ſhould take the Purge No. 21.</p>
               <p>§ 151. The ſame Means, that are proper to prevent a Relapſe, might alſo obviate or keep off a primary or firſt Aſſault, if em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in time; for notwithſtanding it may happen very ſuddenly, yet this Diſeaſe foreſhews itſelf many Weeks, ſometimes many Months, nay even Years beforehand, by Vertigos, Heavineſs of the Head; ſmall Defects of the Tongue or Speech; ſhort and momentary Palſies, ſometimes of one, ſometimes of another Part; ſometimes by Loathings and Reachings to vomit; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuppoſing any Obſtruction or Load in the firſt: Paſſages, or any other Cauſe in the Stomach, or the adjoining Parts. There happens alſo ſome particular Change in the Looks and Viſage not eaſy to be deſcribed; ſharp and ſhort Pains about the Region of the Heart; an Abatement of the Strength, without any diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cauſe of ſuch Abatement. Beſides there are ſtill ſome other Signs, which ſignify the Aſcent of the Humours too much to the Head, and ſhew, that the Functions of the Brain are embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons are liable to certain Symptoms and Appearances, which ariſe from the ſame Cauſe as an Apoplexy; and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be conſidered as very light mild Apoplexies, of which they ſuſtain many Attacks, and yet without any conſiderable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of their Health. The Blood, all at once as it were, fluſhes up to their Heads; they appear heedleſs or blundering; and have ſometimes Diſguſts and <hi>Nauſeas,</hi> and yet without any Abatement of their Underſtanding, their Senſes, or Motion of any Sort. Tranquillity of Mind and Body, one Bleeding, and a few Glyſters uſually carry it off ſoon after its Invaſion. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of it may be prevented by the Regimen directed § 150; and eſpecially by a frequent Uſe of the Powder No. 24. At the long Run however, one of theſe Attacks commonly degenerates
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012243_0103_0F8A6AE5865F9F50"/>
into a mortal Apoplexy: though this may be retarded for a very long time by an exact Regimen, and by avoiding all ſtrong Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Mind, but eſpecially that of Anger or violent Rage.</p>

The Blood-Veſſels grow dry, the Blood itſelf becomes condenſed or thickened, and a real Inflammation is formed, which has proved mortal in a very little time.

People may be afflicted with the Diſeaſe from this Cauſe, at two different Seaſons of the Year; that is, either in the Spring, or during the very raging Heats; but their Events are very different. Country People and Labourers are but little liable to the former. It chiefly affects the Inhabitants of Cities,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012243_0104_0F8A6AE61D488948"/>
and delicate Perſons, who have uſed very little Exerciſe in the Winter, and abound with ſuperfluous Humours. If, thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, they expoſe themſelves to the Sun, as even in the Spring he attains a conſiderable Force; and, by the Courſe of Life they have led, their Humours are already much diſpoſed to mount to the Head; while the Coolneſs of the Soil, eſpecially when it has rained, prevents their Feet from being ſo eaſily warmed; the Power of the Sun acts upon the Head like a Bliſter, attracting a great Quantity of Humours to it. This produces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating Pains of the Head, frequently accompanied with quick and violent Shootings, and with Pain in the Eyes; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Degree of the Malady is ſeldom dangerous. Country People, and even ſuch Inhabitants of Cities and Towns, as have not forborn to exerciſe themſelves in Winter, have no Sort of Dread of theſe Strokes of the Sun, in the Spring of the Year. Its Summer Strokes are much more troubleſome and vehement, and aſſault Labourers and Travellers, who are for a long time expoſed to the Fervour of it. Then it is that the Diſeaſe is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated to its higheſt Pitch, thoſe who are thus ſtruck often dying upon the Spot. In the hot Climates this Cauſe deſtroys many in the very Streets, and makes dreadful Havock among Armies on the March, and at Sieges. Some tragical Effects of it, on ſuch Occaſions, are ſeen even in the temperate Countries. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marched a whole Day in the Sun, a Man ſhall fall into a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, and die within ſome Hours, with the Symptoms of raving Madneſs. I have ſeen a Tyler, in a very hot Day, complaining to his Comrade of a violent Pain in his Head, which increaſed almoſt every Moment; and at the very Inſtant when he purpoſed to retire out of the Sun, he ſunk down dead, and fell from the Houſe which he was ſlating. This ſame Cauſe produces very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Country ſome moſt dangerous Phrenzies, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there hot or burning Fevers. Every Year furniſhes but too many of them.</p>
               <p>§ 154. The Vehemence of the Sun is ſtill more dangerous to thoſe, who venture to ſleep expoſed to it. Two Mowers who fell aſleep on a Haycock, being wakened by ſome others, immediately on waking, ſtaggered, and pronouncing a few incoherent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Words, died. When the Violence of Wine and that of the Sun are combined, they kill very ſuddenly: nor is there a ſingle Year in which Peaſants are not found dead on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads; who, being drunk, endeavoured to lie down in ſome Corner, where they periſhed by an Apoplexy, from the Heat of the Sun and of ſtrong Drink. Thoſe of them who eſcape ſo ſpeedy and premature a Death, are ſubject, for the Remainder of their Lives, to chronical, or tedious Head-achs; and to ſuffer ſome little Diſorder and Confuſion in their Ideas. I have ſeen ſome Caſes, when after violent Head-achs of ſome Days Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, the Diſeaſe has been transferred to the Eyelids, which continued a long Time red and diſtended, ſo that they could not
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012243_0105_0F8A6AE9095505D8"/>
be kept aſunder or open. It has alſo been known, that ſome Perſons have been ſtruck by the Sun into a <hi>Delirium</hi> or Raving, without a Fever, and without complaining of a Head-ach. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> has been its Conſequence; and it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſee People, whoſe long Continuance under the ſtrong Light and Influence of the Sun, has made ſuch an Impreſſion upon the Eyes, as preſents them with different Bodies flying about in the Air, which diſtract and confuſe their Sight.</p>
               <p>A Man of forty-two Years of Age, having been expoſed for ſeveral Hours to the violent Heat of the Sun, with a very ſmall Cap or Bonnet; and having paſt the following Night in the open Air, was attacked the next Day with a moſt ſevere Head-ach, a burning Fever, Reachings to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omit, great Anguiſh, and red and ſparkling Eyes. Notwithſtanding the beſt Aſſiſtance of ſeveral Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, he became phrenitic on the fifth Day, and died on the ninth. Suppurated Matter was diſcharged from his Mouth, one of his Noſtrils, and his right Ear, a few Hours before his Death; upon Diſſection a ſmall Abſceſs, was found within the Skull; and the whole Brain, as well as all the Membranes incloſing it, were entirely corrupted.</p>
               <p>§ 155. In very young Children, who are not, or never ſhould be, expoſed for any long Time to ſuch exceſſive Heat (and whom a ſlight Cauſe will often affect) this Malady diſcovers itſelf by a heavy deep Drowſineſs, which laſts for ſeveral Days; alſo by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant Ravings mingled with Rage and Terror, much the ſame as when they are affected with violent Fear; and ſometimes by convulſive Twitchings; by Head-achs which return at certain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and continual Vomitings. I have ſeen Children, who, after a Stroke of the Sun, have been harraſſed a long time with a little Cough.</p>
               <p>§ 156. Old Men who often expoſe themſelves imprudently to the Sun, are little apprized of all the Danger they incur by it. A certain Perſon, who purpoſely ſunned himſelf for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, in the clear Day of an intermitting tertian Fever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the Aſſault of an Apoplexy, which carried him off the following Day. And even when the Diſeaſe may not be ſo ſpeedy and violent, yet this Cuſtom (of ſunning in hot Weather) certainly diſpoſes to an Apoplexy, and to Diſorders of the Head. One of the ſlighteſt Effects of much ſolar Heat upon the Head is, to cauſe a Defluxion from the Brain, a Swelling of the Glands of the Neck, and a Dryneſs of the Eyes, which ſometimes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for a conſiderable Term after it.</p>
               <p>§ 157. The Effect of too much culinary, or common Fire, is of the ſame Quality with that of the Sun. A Man who fell aſleep with his Head directly oppoſite, and probably, very near to the Fire, went off in an Apoplexy, during his Nap.</p>
               <p>§ 158. The Action of too violent a Sun is not only pernicious, when it falls upon the Head; but it is alſo hurtful to other Parts; and thoſe who continue long expoſed to it, though their Heads
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012243_0106_0F8A6AE93908A5A0"/>
ſhould not be affected, experience violent Pains, a diſagreeable Senſation of Heat, and a conſiderable Stiffneſs in the Parts that have been, in ſome Manner, parched by it; as in the Legs, the Knees, the Thighs, Reins, and Arms; and ſometimes they prove feveriſh.</p>
               <p>§ 159. In contemplating the Caſe of a Patient, <hi>Sun-ſtruck,</hi> as we may term it, we muſt endeavour to diſtinguiſh, whether there may not be alſo ſome other joint Cauſes concurring to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. A Traveller, a labouring Man, is often as much affected by the Fatigue of his Journey, or of his Labour, as he is by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſolar Heat.</p>
               <p>§ 160. It is neceſſary to ſet about the Cure of this Diſeaſe, as as ſoon as ever we are ſatisfied of its Exiſtence: for ſuch as might have been eaſily preſerved by an early Application, are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly endangered by a Neglect of it. The Method of treating this is very much the ſame, with that of the inflammatory Diſeaſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned; that is, by Bleeding, and cooling Medicines of various Kinds in their Drinks, by Bathings, and by Glyſters. And 1. If the Diſeaſe be very high and urgent, a large Quantity of Blood ſhould be taken away, and occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. LEWIS the XIV. was bled nine times to prevent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of a Stroke of the Sun, which he received in Hunting in 1658.</p>
               <p>2. After Bleeding, the Patient's Legs ſhould be plunged into warm Water. This is one of the Applications that affords the moſt ſpeedy Relief; and I have ſeen the Head-ach go off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, in Proportion to the Repetition, and the Duration of theſe Bathings of the Legs. When the Diſorder is highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, it will be neceſſary to treat the Patient with <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                        <desc>•••••</desc>
                     </gap>pia,</hi> or warm Baths, in which he may ſit up to his Hips; and in the moſt dangerous Degrees of it, even to bathe the whole Body: but the Water in this Caſe, as well as in Bathings of the Feet, ſhould be only ſenſibly warm: the Uſe of hot would be highly pernicious.</p>
               <p>3. Glyſters made from a Decoction of any of the emollient Herbs are alſo very effectual.</p>
               <p>4. The Patient ſhould drink plentifully of Almond Emulſion No. 4; of Limonade, which is a Mixture of the Juice of Lemons and Water, (and is the beſt Drink in this Diſeaſe) of Water and Vinegar, which is a very good Subſtitute for Limonade; and of, what is ſtill more efficacious, very clear Whey, with the Addition of a little Vinegar. Theſe various Drinks may all be taken cold; Linen Cloths dipt in cold Water and Vinegar of Roſes may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Forehead, the Temples, or all over the Head, which is equivalent to every other Application uſed upon ſuch Occaſions. Thoſe which are the moſt cried up, are the Juice of Purſlain, of Lettuce, of Houſeleek, and of Vervain. The Drink No. 32 is alſo ſerviceable, taken every Morning faſting.</p>
               <p>§ 161. Cold Baths have ſometimes recovered Perſons out of ſuch violent Symptoms, from this Cauſe, as have been almoſt quite deſpaired of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:012243_0107_0F8A6AEA3A50D158"/>A Man twenty Years of Age, having been a very long time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſcorching Sun, became violently delirious, without a Fever, and proved really mad. After repeated Bleedings, he was thrown into a cold Bath, which was alſo frequently repeated; pouring cold Water, at the ſame time, upon his Head. With ſuch Aſſiſtance he recovered, though very gradually.</p>
               <p>An Officer who had rode Poſt for ſeveral Days ſucceſſively, in very hot Weather, ſwooned away, immediately on diſmounting; from which he could not be recovered by the ordinary Aſſiſtance in ſuch Caſes. He was ſaved however, in Conſequence of being plunged into a Bath of freezing Water. It ſhould be obſerved however, that in theſe Caſes the cold Bath ſhould never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to, without previous Bleeding.</p>
               <p>§ 162. It is paſt Doubt, that if a Perſon ſtands ſtill in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Heat of the Sun, he is more liable to be ſtruck with it, than if he walks about; and the Uſe of white Hats, or of ſome Folds of clean white Paper under a black one, may ſenſibly contribute to prevent any Injury from the conſiderable Heat of the Sun; though it is a very incompetent Defence againſt a violent Degree of it.</p>
               <p>The natural Conſtitution, or even that Conſtitution, which has been formed from long Cuſtom and Habit, makes a very great Difference between the Effects of ſolar Heat on different Perſons, People inſenſibly accuſtom themſelves to the Impreſſions of it, as they do to thoſe of all the other Bodies and Elements, which are continually acting upon us; and by Degrees we arrive at a Power of ſuſtaining his violent Heat with Impunity; juſt as others arrive at the Hardineſs of bearing the moſt rigid Colds, with very little Complaint or Inconvenience. The human Body is capable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting many more Violences and Extremes, than it commonly does. Its natural Force is ſcarcely ever aſcertained among civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Nations; becauſe their Education generally tends to impair and leſſen it, and always ſucceeds in this Reſpect. If we were inclined to conſider a purely natural, a ſimply phyſical Man, we muſt look for him among ſavage Nations; where only we can diſcover what we are able to be, and to bear. We certainly could not fail of being Gainers, by adopting their corporal Education; neither does it ſeem as yet to have been infallibly demonſtrated, that we ſhould be great Loſers in commuting our moral Education for theirs.<note n="*" place="bottom">As ſome may think an Apology neceſſary for a Tranſlation of this Chapter on a Diſeaſe, which never, or very ſeldom, exiſts in this or the adjacent Iſland, I ſhall obſerve here, that, abſtracted from the Immorality of a narrow and local Solicitude only for ourſelves, we are politically intereſted as a Nation always in Trade, and often at War, (and whoſe Subjects are extended into very diſtant and and different Climates,) to provide againſt a ſudden and acute Diſtemper, to which our Armies, our Sailors and Colonies are certainly often expoſed. A Fatality from this Cauſe is not reſtrained to our Iſlands within the Tropic, where ſeveral Inſtances of it have occurred during the late War; but it has alſo been known to prevail as far northward as <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> in their Summers, and even in their Harveſts, I once received a ſenſible Scald on the Back of my Thumb, from the Sun ſuddenly darting out through a clear Hole, as it were, in a Cloud, after a ſhort and impetuous Shower in Summer; which Scald manifeſtly bliſtered within ſome Minutes after. Had this concentered Ray been darted on my bare Head, the Conſequence might have been more dangerous; or perhaps as fatal as ſome of the Caſes recorded by Dr. TISSOT, in this Chapter.</note>

               <head>CHAPTER XI. Of the Rheumatiſm.</head>
               <p>SECT. 163. THE Rheumatiſm may exiſt either with or without a Fever. The firſt of theſe may be claſſed among the Diſeaſes, of which I have already treated; being an Inflammation which is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a violent Fever, preceded by Shivering, a ſubſequent Heat, hard Pulſe, and a Head-ach. Sometimes indeed an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Coldneſs, with general Uneaſineſs and Inquietude, exiſts ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days before the Fever is perceived. On the ſecond or third Day, and ſometimes even on the firſt, the Patient is ſeized with a violent Pain in ſome Part of his Body, but eſpecially about the Joints, which entirely prevents their Motion, and which is often accompanied with Heat, Redneſs, and a Swelling of the Part. The Knee is often the firſt Part attacked, and ſometimes both the Knees at once. When the Pain is fixed, an Abatement of the Fever frequently happens; though in ſome Perſons it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for ſeveral Days, and increaſes every Evening. The Pain diminiſhes in one Part after a Duration of ſome Days, and then invades ſome other. From the Knee it deſcends to the Foot, or mounts to the Hip, to the Loins, the Shoulder-blades, Elbow, Wriſt, the Nape of the Neck, and frequently is felt in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Parts. Sometimes one Part is quite free from Pain, when another is attacked; at other times many Parts are ſeized nearly at the ſame Inſtant; and I have ſometimes ſeen every Joint afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once. In this Caſe the Patient is in a very terrible Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being incapable of any Motion, and even dreading the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Attendants, as he can ſcarcely admit of touching, without a ſenſible Aggravation of his Pains. He is unable to bear even the Weight of the Bed-cloths, which muſt be, as it were, arched over his Limbs by a proper Contrivance, to prevent their Preſſure: and the very walking acroſs the Chamber increaſes his Torments. The Parts in which they are the moſt excruciating,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012243_0109_0F8A6AEB5908BCB8"/>
and obſtinate, are the Region of the Loins, the Hips, and the Nape or hinder Part of the Neck.</p>
               <p>§ 164. This Diſeaſe is alſo often extended over the Scalp and the Surface of the Head; and there the Pains are exceſſive. I have ſeen them affect the Eyelids and the Teeth with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Torment. As long as the Diſtemper is ſituated in the more external Parts, the Patient, however painful his Situation may prove, is in no great Danger, if he be properly treated: but if by ſome Accident, ſome Error, or by any latent Cauſe, the Diſeaſe be repelled upon an internal Part or Organ, his Caſe is extremely dangerous. If the Brain is attacked, a frantic raging <hi>Delirium</hi> is the Conſequence; if it falls upon the Lungs, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſuffocated: and if it attacks the Stomach or the Bowels, it is attended with the moſt aſtoniſhing Pains, which are cauſed by the Inflammation of thoſe Parts, and which Inflammation, if violent, is <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note * to Page 29.</note> ſpeedily fatal. About two Years ſince I was called to a robuſt Man, whoſe Guts were already in a gangrenous State, which was the Conſequence of a Rheumatiſm, that firſt attacked one Arm and one Knee; the Cure of which had been attempted by ſweating the Patient with ſome hot Remedies. Theſe indeed brought on a plentiful Sweat; but the inflammatory Humour ſeized the Inteſtines, whoſe Inflammation degenerated into a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, after a Duration of the moſt acute Pain for thirty-ſix Hours; his Torments terminating in Death two Hours after I ſaw him.</p>
               <p>§ 165. This Malady however is often in a leſs violent Degree; the Fever is but moderate, and ceaſes entirely when the Pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; which is alſo confined to one; or not more than two Parts.</p>
               <p>§ 166. If the Diſeaſe continues fixed, for a conſiderable time, in one Joint, the Motion of it is impaired for Life. I have ſeen a Perſon who has now a wry Neck, of twenty Years ſtanding, in Conſequence of a Rheumatiſm in the Nape of the Neck; and I alſo ſaw a poor young Man from <hi>Jurat,</hi> who was Bed-ridden, and who had loſt the Motion of one Hip and both Knees. He could neither ſtand nor ſit, and there were but a few Poſtures in which he could even lie in Bed.</p>
               <p>§ 167. An obſtructed Perſpiration, and inflammatory Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood, conſtitute the moſt general Cauſe of the Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm. This laſt concurring Cauſe is that we muſt immediately encounter; ſince, as long as that ſubſiſts, Perſpiration cannot be perfectly re-eſtabliſhed, which follows of Courſe, when the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is cured. For which Reaſon this Diſtemper muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted like the other inflammatory ones, of which I have already treated.</p>
               <p>§ 168. As ſoon as it is ſufficiently manifeſt, the Glyſter No. 5 ſhould be injected; and twelve Ounces of Blood be taken from
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012243_0110_0F8A6AEC20F84EC0"/>
the Arm an Hour after. The Patient is to enter upon a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and drink plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 2, and of Almond Milk or Emulſion No. 4. As this laſt Medicine may be too coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Country Places for the poor Peaſantry; they may drink, in lieu of it, very clear Whey, ſweetened with a little Honey. I have known a very ſevere Rheumatiſm cured, after twice bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any other Food or Medicine, for the Space of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days. The Whey alſo may be happily uſed by Way of Glyſter.</p>
               <p>§ 169. If the Diſtemper is not conſiderably aſſwaged by the firſt Bleeding, it ſhould be repeated ſome Hours after. I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it four times within the firſt two Days; and ſome Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have even directed a fifth Bleeding. But in general the Hardneſs of the Pulſe becomes leſs after the ſecond: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Pains may continue as ſevere as before, yet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſenſible of leſs Inquietude. The Glyſter muſt be repeated every Day, and even twice a Day, if each of them is attended only with a ſmall Diſcharge; and particularly if there be a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Head-ach. In ſuch Caſes as are exceſſively painful, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can ſcarcely diſpoſe himſelf into a proper Attitude or Poſture to receive Glyſters; and in ſuch Circumſtances his Drinks ſhould be made as opening as poſſible; and a Doſe of the Cream of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar No. 24 ſhould be given Night and Morning. This very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, with the Aſſiſtance of Whey, cured two Perſons I adviſed it to, of rheumatic Pains, with frequent Returns of which they had been infeſted for many Years, and which were attended with a ſmall Fever.</p>
               <p>Apples coddled, Prunes ſtewed, and well ripened Summer Fruits are the propereſt Nouriſhment in this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>We may ſave the Sick a good deal of Pain, by putting one ſtrong Towel always under their Back, and another under their Thighs, in order to move them the more eaſily. When their Hands are without Pain, a third Towel hung upon a Cord, which is faſtened acroſs the Bed, muſt conſiderably aſſiſt them in mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves.</p>
               <p>§ 170. When the Fever entirely diſappears, and the Hardneſs of the Pulſe is removed, I have ordered the Purge No. 23, with a very good Effect; and if it is attended with five or ſix Motions, the Patient is very ſenſibly relieved. The Day but one after, it may be repeated ſucceſsfully, and a third time, after an Interval of a greater Number of Days.</p>
               <p>§ 171. When the Pains are extremely violent, they admit of no Application: Vapour-Baths however may be employed, and provided they are often uſed, and for a conſiderable time, they prove very efficacious. The Purpoſe of theſe Baths is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly to convey the Steam of boiling Water to the Parts affected; which may always eaſily be effected; by a Variety of ſimple and eaſy Contrivances; the Choice of which muſt depend on the different Circumſtances and Situation of the Sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:012243_0111_0F8A6AECDBD5CB20"/>Whenever it is poſſible, ſome of the emollient Applications, No. 9, ſhould be continually employed. A half Bath, or an entire Bath of warm Water, in which the Patient ſhould remain an Hour, after ſufficient Bleedings and many Glyſters, affords the greateſt Relief. I have ſeen a Patient, under the moſt acute Pains of the Loins, of the Hips, and of one Knee, put into one. He continued ſtill under extreme Torment in the Bath, and on being taken out of it: but an Hour after he had been put to Bed, he ſweated, to an incredible Quantity, for thirty-ſix Hours, and was cured. The Bath ſhould never be made uſe of, until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repeated Bleedingſ, or at leaſt other equivalent Evacuations: for otherwiſe timed, it would aggravate the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>§ 172. The Pains are generally moſt ſevere in the Night; whence it has been uſual to give compoſing ſoporific Medicines. This however has been very erroneous, as Opiates really augment the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; they deſtroy the Efficacy of the proper Remedies: and, even not ſeldom, far from aſſwaging the Pains, they increaſe them. Indeed they agree ſo little in this Diſeaſe, that even the Patient's natural Sleep at the Invaſion of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, is rather to his Detriment. They feel, the very Moment they are dropping aſleep, ſuch violent Jirks as awaken them with great Pain: or if they do ſleep a few Minutes, the Pains are ſtronger when they awake.</p>
               <p>§ 173. The Rheumatiſm goes off either by Stool, by turbid thick Urine which drops a great Proportion of a yellowiſh Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by Sweats; and it generally happens that this laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge prevails towards the Concluſion of the Diſeaſe. It may be kept up by drinking an Infuſion of Elder-flowers. At the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning however Sweating is pernicious.</p>
               <p>§ 174. It happens alſo, though but very ſeldom, that Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms determine by depoſiting a ſharp Humour upon the Legs; where it forms Veſications, or a kind of Bliſterings, which burſt open and form Ulcers, that ought not to be healed and dried up too haſtily; as this would occaſion a ſpeedy Return of the rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Pains. They are diſpoſed to heal naturally of themſelves, by the Aſſiſtance of a temperate regular Diet, and a few gentle Purges.</p>
               <p>§ 175. Sometimes again, an Abſceſs is formed either in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part, or in ſome neighbouring one. I have ſeen a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard Dreſſer, who after violent Pains of the Loins, had an Abſceſs in the upper Part of the Thigh, which he neglected for a long time. When I ſaw him it was of a monſtrous Size.

               <p>Another Criſis of the Rheumatiſm has happened by a kind of Itch, which breaks out upon all the Parts adjacent to the Seat of this Diſeaſe. Immediately after this Eruption the Pains vaniſh: but the Puſtules ſometimes continue for ſeveral Weeks.</p>
               <p>§ 176. I have never obſerved the Pains to laſt, with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Violence, above fourteen Days, in this Species of the Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm; though there remains a Weakneſs, Numbneſs, and ſome Inflation, or Puffing, of the adjoining Parts: and it will alſo be many Weeks, and ſometimes even Months; eſpecially if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper attacked them in the Fall,) before the Sick recover their uſual Strength. I have known ſome Perſons, who, after a very painful Rheumatiſm, have been troubled with a very diſagreeable Senſation of Laſſitude; which did not go off till after a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, all over the Body, of little Veſications or Bliſterings, full of a watery Humour; many of them burſt open, and others withered and dried up without burſting.</p>
               <p>§ 177. The Return of Strength into the Parts affected may be promoted by Frictions Night and Morning, with Flanel or any other woollen Stuff; by uſing Exerciſe; and by conforming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the Directions given in the Chapter on Convaleſcence, or Recovery from acute Diſeaſes. The Rheumatiſm may alſo be prevented by the Means I have pointed out, in treating of Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Quinceys.</p>
               <p>§ 178. Sometimes the Rheumatiſm with a Fever, invades Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are not ſo ſanguine, or abounding in Blood; or whoſe Blood is not ſo much diſpoſed to Inflammation; thoſe whoſe Fleſh and Fibres are ſofter; and in whoſe Humours there is more Thinneſs and Sharpneſs, than Viſcidity and Thickneſs. Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proves leſs neceſſary for Perſons ſo conſtituted, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fever ſhould be very ſtrong. Some Conſtitutions require more Diſcharges by Stool; and after they are properly evacuated, ſome Bliſters ſhould be applied, which often afford them a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relief as ſoon as ever they begin to operate. Nevertheleſs they ſhould never be uſed where the Pulſe is hard. The Powder No. 25 anſwers very well in theſe Caſes.</p>
               <p>§ 179. There is another Kind of Rheumatiſm called chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or laſting. It is known by the following Characters or Marks. 1. It is commonly unattended with a Fever. 2. It continues a very long time. 3. It ſeldom attacks ſo many Parts at once as the former. 4. Frequently no viſible Alteration appears in the affected Part, which is neither more hot, red, or ſwelled, than in its healthy State; though ſometimes one or other of theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is evident. 5. The former, the inflammatory Rheumatiſm, aſſaults ſtrong, vigorous, robuſt Perſons: but this rather invades People arrived at a certain Period of Life, or ſuch as are weak and languiſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:012243_0113_0F8A6AEE4F221D70"/>§ 180. The Pain of the chronical Rheumatiſm, when left to itſelf, or injudiciouſly treated, laſts ſometimes many Months, and even Years. It is particularly and extremely obſtinate, when it is exerted on the Head, the Loins, or on the Hip, and along the Thighs, when it is called the <hi>Sciatica.</hi> There is no Part indeed which this Pain may not invade; ſometimes it fixes itſelf in a ſmall Spot, as in one Corner of the Head; the Angle of the Jaw; the Extremity of a Finger; in one Knee; on one Rib, or on the Breaſt, where it often excites Pains, which make the Patient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of a Cancer. It penetrates alſo to the internal Parts. When it affects the Lungs, a moſt obſtinate Cough is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; which degenerates at length into very dangerous Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Breaſt. In the Stomach and Bowels it excites moſt violent Pains like a Cholic; and in the Bladder, Symptoms ſo greatly reſembling thoſe of the Stone, that Perſons who are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deficient in Knowledge nor Experience, have been more than once deceived by them.</p>
               <p>§ 181. The Treatment of this chronical Rheumatiſm does not vary conſiderably from that of the former. Nevertheleſs, in the firſt Place, if the Pain is very acute, and the Patient robuſt, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Bleeding at the Onſet is very proper and efficacious. 2. The Humours ought to be diluted, and their Acrimony or Sharpneſs ſhould be diminiſhed, by a very plentiful Uſe of a Ptiſan of <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Half a Pint of a pretty ſtrong Infuſion of the Leaves of Buckbean, which grows wild here, taken once a Day rather before Noon, has alſo been found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable in that Species of a chronical Rheumatiſm, which conſiderably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from a ſcorbutic State of the Conſtitution. <hi>K.</hi>

Four or five Days after drinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly of this, the Purging <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Another very good Purge, in this Kind of Rheumatiſm, may alſo be compounded of the beſt Gum Guiacum in Powder from twenty-five to forty Grains; diſſolved in a little Yolk of a freſh Egg; adding from five to ten Grains of Jallap powdered, and from three to five Grains of powdered Ginger, with as much plain or Surfeit Water, as will make a purging Draught for a ſtronger or weaker grown Patient. Should the Pains frequently infeſt the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, while the Patient continues coſtive, and there is no other Fever than ſuch a ſmall ſymptomatic one, as may ariſe ſolely from Pain, he may ſafely take, if grown up and ſtrong, from thirty to forty, and, if weaker, from twenty to thirty Drops of the volatile Tincture of Gum Guiacum, in any diluting Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that may not coagulate or ſeparate the Gum. It generally diſpoſes at firſt to a gentle <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> or Sweat, and ſeveral Hours after to one, and ſometimes to a ſecond Stool, with little or no Griping. It may be taken at going to Bed. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Powder No. 21, may be taken with Succeſs. In this Species of the Rheumatiſm a certain Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is ſometimes found ſerviceable. This has acquired ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, (particularly in the Place from whence they bring it, <hi>Geneva,</hi>) under the Title of the Opiate for the Rheumatiſm, tho' I cannot ſay for what Reaſon; as it is indeed neither more nor leſs than the Electuary <hi>Caryocoſtinum,</hi> which may be procured at our Apothecaries. I ſhall obſerve, however, that this Medicine has done Miſchief in the inflammatory Rheumatiſm, and even in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012243_0114_0F8A6AEF18917978"/>
this, as often as the Perſons afflicted with it are feeble, thin and of a hot Temperament; and either when they have not previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken diluting Drinks, or when it has been uſed too long. For, in ſuch a Circumſtance, it is apt to throw the Patient into an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable Weakneſs. The Compoſition conſiſts of the hotteſt Spices, and of very ſharp Purgatives.</p>
               <p>§ 182. When general Remedies have been uſed, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſtill continues, Recourſe ſhould be had to ſuch Medicines, as are available to reſtore Perſpiration; and theſe ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in for a conſiderable Time. The Pills No. 18, with a ſtrong Infuſion of Elder-flowers, have often ſucceeded in this Reſpect: and then after a long Continuance of diluting Drinks, if the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is entirely ſubdued; if the Stomach exerts its Functions well; if the Patient is no ways coſtive; if he is not of a dry Habit of Body; and if the Part affected remains without Inflammation, the Patient may ſafely take the Powder <note n="*" place="bottom">This was erroneouſly printed in the ſecond Edition, No. 29.</note> No. 25, at Night going to Bed, with a Cup or two of an Infuſion of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> or the bleſſed Thiſtle, and a Morſel of Venice Treacle of the Size of a Hazel Nut, or a Filberd. This Remedy brings on a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Sweating, which often expels the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gum Guiacum, given from ſix to ten Grains Morning and Night, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very ſucceſsful in theſe Caſes. It may be made into Pills or Boluſles with the Rob of Elder, or with the Extract of Juniper. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                  </note> Diſeaſe. Theſe Sweats may be rendered ſtill more effectual, by wrapping up the affected Part in a Flanel dipt in the Decoction No. 27.</p>
               <p>§ 183. But of all theſe Pains, the Sciatica is one of the moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and obſtinate. Nevertheleſs I have ſeen the greateſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, from the Application of ſeven or eight Cupping-Glaſſes to the tormented Part; by which, without the Aſſiſtance of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy, I have cured, in a few Hours, Sciaticas of many Years ſtanding, which had baffled other Remedies. Bliſters, or any ſuch ſtimulating Plaiſters, as bring on a Suppuration and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the afflicted Part, contribute alſo frequently to the Cure: tho' leſs effectually than Cupping, which ſhould be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral times. Green Cere-cloth, commonly called Oil-cloth, (whether the Ingredients be ſpread on Taffity or on Linen) being applied to the diſeaſed Part, diſpoſes it to ſweat abundantly, and thus to diſcharge the ſharp Humour which occaſions the Pain. Sometimes both theſe Applications, but eſpecially that ſpread on Silk (which may be applied more exactly and cloſely to the Part, and which is alſo ſpread with a different Compoſition) raiſe a little Veſication on the Part as Bliſters do. A Plaiſter of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Honey blended together has cured inveterate Sciaticas. Oil of Eggs has ſometimes ſucceeded in ſuch Caſes. A Seton has alſo been ſucceſsfully made in the lower Part of the Thigh. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſome Pains which have not yielded to any of theſe Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have been cured by actual burning, inflicted on the very
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012243_0115_0F8A6AEFF8DB6798"/>
Spot, where the moſt violent Pain has been felt; except ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſon, drawn from an anatomical Knowledge of the Part, ſhould determine the Surgeon not to apply it there. The Scull or Head ſhould never be cauterized with a burning Iron.</p>
               <p>§ 184. The hot Baths of <hi>Bourbon, Plombiers, Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> and many others are often very efficacious in theſe chronical Pains; notwithſtanding I really think, there is no rheumatic Pain that may not be cured without them. The common People ſubſtitute to theſe a Bath made of the Huſk of Grapes, after their Juice is expreſſed, which cure ſome by making them ſweat abundantly. Cold Baths however are the beſt to keep off this Diſeaſe; but then they cannot always be ſafely ventured on. Many Circumſtances render the Uſe of them impracticable to particular Perſons. Such as are ſubject to this chronical Rheumatiſm, would do very well to rub their whole Bodies every Morning, if they could, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the afflicted Parts, with Flanel. This Habit keeps up Perſpiration beyond any other Aſſiſtance; and indeed ſometimes even increaſes it too much. It would be ſerviceable alſo, if ſuch Subjects of this cruel Diſeaſe wore Flanel all over their Skin, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winter. After a violent Rheumatiſm, People ſhould long be careful to avoid that cold and moiſt Air, which diſpoſes them to relapſe.</p>
               <p>§ 185. Rheumatic People have too frequent a Recourſe to very improper and hurtful Medicines in this Diſtemper, which daily produce very bad Conſequences. Such are ſpirituous Medicines, Brandy, and Arquebuſade Water. They either render the Pain more obſtinate and fixed, by hardening the Skin; or they repell the Humour to ſome inward Part. And Inſtances are not wanting of Perſons who have died ſuddenly, from the Application of Spirit of Wine upon the Parts that were violently afflicted with the Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm. It alſo happens ſometimes that the Humour, having no Outlet through the Skin, is thrown internally on the Bone and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it. A very ſingular Fact occurred in this Reſpect, an Account of which may be ſerviceable to ſome Perſons afflicted with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. A Woman at Night was chaffing the Arm of her Huſband, who had the Rheumatiſm there, with Spirit of Wine; when a very lucky Accident prevented the Miſchief ſhe might have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by it. The Spirit of Wine took Fire from the Flame of the Candle ſhe made uſe of, and burned the diſeaſed Part. It was dreſt of courſe, and the Suppuration that attended it, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured the Rheumatiſm.</p>
               <p>Sharp and greaſy Unctions or Ointments produce very bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and are equally dangerous. A <hi>Caries,</hi> a Rottenneſs of the Bones, has enſued upon the Uſe of a Medicine called, the Balſam of Sulphur with Turpentine. I was conſulted in 1750, three Days before her Deceaſe, about a Woman who had long endured acute rheumatic Pains. She had taken various Medicines, and, among the reſt, a conſiderable Quantity of a Ptiſan, in which Antimony was blended with ſome purging Medicines, and a greaſy
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012243_0116_0F8A6AF0B4CBDE80"/>
ſpirituous Balſam had been rubbed into the Part. The Fever, the Pains, and the Dryneſs of the Skin ſoon increaſed: the Bones of the Thighs and Arms became carious: and in moving the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient no more than was neceſſary for her Relief and Convenience, without taking her out of her Bed, both Thighs and one Arm broke. So dreadful an Example ſhould make People cautious of giving or applying Medicines inconſiderately, even in ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as appear but trifling in themſelves. I muſt alſo inform my Readers, there are ſome rheumatic Pains, which admit of no Application; and that almoſt every Medicine aggravates them, In ſuch Caſes the afflicted muſt content themſelves with keeping the Parts affected from the Impreſſions of the Air, by a Flanel, or the Skin of ſome Animal with the Fur on.</p>
               <p>It is alſo more adviſeable ſometimes to leave a ſufferable and inveterate Pain to itſelf, eſpecially in old or weakly People, than to employ too many Medicines, or ſuch violent ones, as ſhould affect them more importantly than the Pains did.</p>
               <p>§ 186. If the Duration of the Pains fixed in the ſame Place, ſhould cauſe ſome Degree of Stiffneſs in the Joint affected, it ſhould be expoſed twice a Day to the Vapour of warm Water, and dried well afterwards with hot Linen: then it ſhould be well chaffed, and laſtly touched over with Ointment of Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Pumping, if ſuperadded to this Vapour, conſiderably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes its Efficacy. I directed, for a Caſe of this Sort, a very ſimple Machine of white Tin, or Lattin, which combined the Application of the Steam and the Pump.</p>
               <p>§ 187. Very young Children are ſometimes ſubject to ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Pains, and ſo general too, that they cannot bear touching in any Part without exceſſive Crying. We muſt be careful to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void miſtaking theſe Caſes, and not to treat them like Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms. They ſometimes are owing to Worms, and go off when theſe have been diſcharged.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII. Of the Bite of a mad Dog.</head>
               <p>SECT. 188. MEN may contract the particular and raging Symptom, which is very generally peculiar to, and has thence been ſuppoſed characteriſtical of, this Diſeaſe from this moſt common Cauſe, and that even without any Bite; but this happens very rarely indeed. It is properly a Diſtemper belonging to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine <hi>Genus,</hi> conſiſting of the three Species of Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes, to whom only it ſeems inherent and natural; ſcarcely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012243_0117_0F8A6AF1675E4328"/>
ariſing in other Animals, without its being inflicted by them. Whenever there occurs one of them who breeds it, he bites o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thus the Poiſon, the Cauſe of this terrible Diſeaſe, is diffuſed. Other Animals beſides the canine Species, and Men themſelves being expoſed to this Accident, do ſometimes contract the Diſeaſe in all its Rage and Horror: though it is not to be ſuppoſed, that this is always an unfailing conſequence.</p>
               <p>§ 189. If a Dog who uſed to be lively and active, becomes all at once moapiſh and moroſe; if he has an Averſion to eat; a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and unuſual Look about his Eyes; a Reſtleſſneſs, which appears from his continually running to and fro, we may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive he is likely to prove mad; at which very Inſtant he ought to be tied up ſecurely, that it may be in our Power to deſtroy him as ſoon as the Diſtemper is evident. Perhaps it might be even ſtill ſafer to kill him at once.</p>
               <p>Whenever the Malady is certain, the Symptoms heighten pretty ſoon. His Averſion to Food, but eſpecially to Drink, grows ſtronger. He no longer ſeems to know his Maſter; the Sound of his Voice changes; he ſuffers no Perſon to handle or approach him; and bites thoſe who attempt it. He quits his ordinary Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, marching on with his Head and his Tail hanging down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; his Tongue lolling half out, and covered with Foam or Slaver, which indeed not ſeldom happens indifferently to all Dogs, Other Dogs ſcent him, not ſeldom at a conſiderable Diſtance, and fly him with an Air of Horror, which is a certain Indication of his Diſeaſe. Sometimes he contents himſelf with biting only thoſe who happen to be near him: while at other times becoming more enraged, he ſprings to the right and left on all Men and Animals about him. He hurries away with manifeſt Dread from whatever Waters occur to him: at length he falls down as ſpent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; ſometimes he riſes up again, and drags himſelf on for a little time, commonly dying the third, or, at the lateſt, on the fourth Day after the manifeſt Appearance of the Diſeaſe, and ſometimes even ſooner.</p>
               <p>§ 190. When a Perſon is bit by ſuch a Dog, the Wound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly heals up as readily as if it was not in the leaſt poiſonous: but after the Expiration of a longer or ſhorter Term, from three Weeks to three Months, but moſt commonly in about ſix Weeks, the Perſon bitten begins to perceive, in the Spot that was bit, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dull obtuſe Pain. The Scar of it ſwells, inflames, burſts open, and weeps out a ſharp, foetid, and ſanious, or ſomewhat bloody Humour. At the ſame time the Patient becomes ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly: he feels a kind of Indifference, Inſenſibility, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Numbneſs; an almoſt inceſſant Coldneſs; a Difficulty of breathing; a continual Anguiſh, and Pains in his Bowels. His Pulſe is weak and irregular, his Sleep reſtleſs, turbid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with Ravings, with ſtarting up in Surprize, and with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frights. His Diſcharges by Stool are often much altered and irregular, and ſmall cold Sweats appear at very ſhort Intervals,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012243_0118_0F8A6AF319471990"/>
Sometimes there is alſo a ſlight Pain or Uneaſineſs in the Throat. Such is the firſt Degree of this Diſeaſe, and it is called by ſome Phyſicians the dumb Rage, or Madneſs.</p>
               <p>§ 191. Its ſecond Degree, the confirmed or downright Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is attended with the following Symptoms. The Patient is afflicted with a violent Thirſt, and a Pain in drinking. Soon after this he avoids all Drink, but particularly Water, and within ſome Hours after, he even abhors it. This Horror becomes ſo violent, that the bringing Water near his Lips, or into his Sight, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name of it, or of any other Drink; the Sight of Objects, which, from their Tranſparence, have any Reſemblance of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a Looking-Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> afflicts him with extreme Anguiſh, and ſometimes even with Convulſions. They continue however ſtill to ſwallow (though not without violent Difficulty) a little Meat or Bread, and ſometimes a little Soup. Some even get down the liquid Medicines that are preſcribed them, provided there be no Appearance of Water in them; or that Water is not mentioned to them, at the ſame time. Their Urine becomes thick and high-coloured, and ſometimes there is a Suppreſſion or Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of it. The Voice either grows hoarſe, or is almoſt entirely aboliſhed: but the Reports of the bitten barking like Dogs, are ridiculous and ſuperſtitious Fictions, void of any Foundation; as well as many other Fables that have been blended with the Hiſtory of this Diſtemper. The Barking of Dogs, however, is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to them. They are troubled with ſhort <hi>Deliriums</hi> or Ravings, which are ſometimes mixed with Fury. It is at ſuch Times that they ſpit all around them; that they attempt alſo to bite, and ſometimes unhappily effect it. Their Looks are fixed, as it were, and ſomewhat furious, and their Viſage frequently red. It is pretty common for theſe miſerable Patients to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Approach of their raging Fit, and to conjure the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders to be upon their Guard. Many of them never have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to bite. The increaſing Anguiſh and Pain they feel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inexpreſſible: they earneſtly wiſh for Death, and ſome of them have even deſtroyed themſelves, when they had the Means of effecting it.</p>
               <p>§ 192. It is with the Spittle, and the Spittle only, that this dreadful Poiſon unites itſelf. And here it may be obſerved, 1, That if the Wounds have been made through any of the Patient's Cloaths, they are leſs dangerous than thoſe inflicted immediately on the naked Skin. 2, That Animals who abound in Wool, or have very thick Hair, are often preſerved from the mortal Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Poiſon; becauſe in theſe various Circumſtances, the Cloaths, the Hair, or the Wool have wiped, or even dried up, the Slaver of their Teeth. 3, The Bites inflicted by an infected Animal, very ſoon after he has bitten many others, are leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the former Bites, becauſe their Slaver is leſſened or exhauſted. 4, If the Bite happens in the Face, or in the Neck, the Danger is greater, and the Operation of the Venom is quicker
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012243_0119_0F8A6AF5F7203690"/>
too; by Reaſon the Spittle of the Perſon ſo bit is ſooner infected. 5, The higher the Degree of the Diſeaſe is advanced, the Bites become proportionally more dangerous. From what I have juſt mentioned here it may be diſcerned, why, of many who have been bitten by the ſame Sufferer, ſome have been infected with this dreadful Diſeaſe, and others not.</p>
               <p>§ 193. A great Number of Remedies have been highly cried up, as famous for the Cure of this Diſeaſe; and, in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> particularly, the Root of the Eglantine or wild Roſe, gathered at ſome particular times, under the favourable Aſpects of the Moon, and dried with ſome extraordinary Precautions. There is alſo the <note n="*" place="bottom">This conſiſted of equal Parts of Rue, Vervain, Plantain, Polypody, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wormwood, Mugwort, Baſtard Bawm, Betony, St. <hi>John</hi>'s Wort, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Centaury Tops, to which <hi>Deſault</hi> adds <hi>Coralline.</hi>

When Medicines had been given before the great Symptom appeared, in ſome of thoſe who took them, it afterwards appeared, in others not. The ſame different Events occurred alſo to others who were bitten, and who took not the leaſt Medicine; ſo that, upon the whole, before that Date, no Medicine ſeemed to be of any Conſequence. Since that time, we have had the Happineſs to be informed of a certain Remedy, which is Mercury, joined to a few others.</p>

Though even this is far from being unpainful, yet the Pain coming on more gradually, is leſs terrifying and horrid. And when it had been applied quickly after, and upon the Bite, and kept on for three or four Hours, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, after cutting the <hi>Eſchar,</hi> would ſooner enſue, and in more Abundance, than that from the actual Cautery; the only Preference of which ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in its being capable perhaps of abſorbing, or otherwiſe conſuming, all the poiſonous <hi>Saliva</hi> at once.

It requires more Reſolution, however, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Patient is endued with. The Wound ſhould be waſhed and cleanſed a conſiderable Time with warm Water, with a little Sea Salt diſſolved in it. After this, into the Lips and Edges of the Wound, and into the Surface of the Part all about it, ſhould be rubbed a Quarter of an Ounce of the Ointment No. 28; and the Wound ſhould be dreſſed twice daily, with the ſoft lenient Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment No. 29, to promote Suppuration; but that of No. 28 is to be uſed only once a Day.</p>

                     <p>The great Uſefulneſs of mercurial Frictions, we may even ſay, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Security which they procure for the Patients, in theſe Caſes, provided they are applied very ſoon after the Bite, have been demonſtrated by their Succeſs in <hi>Provence,</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> at <hi>Pondicherry,</hi> and in many other Places.

               <p>9, There is very little Occaſion to ſay any thing relating to the Patient's Food, in ſuch a Situation. Should he aſk for any, he may be allowed Panada, light Soup, Bread, Soups made of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaceous or mealy Vegetables, or a little Milk.</p>

               <p>§ 198. It is certain that a Boy, in whom the raging Symptom of this Diſeaſe had juſt appeared, was perfectly cured, by bathing all about the wounded Part with Sallad-oil, in which ſome Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire and Opium were diſſolved; with the Addition of repeated Frictions of the Ointment No. 28, and making him take ſome <hi>Eau de Luce</hi> with a little Wine. This Medicine, a Coffee-cup of which may be given every four Hours, allayed the great Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Agitation of the Patient; and brought on a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sweat, on which all the Symptoms vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>§ 199. Dogs may be cured by rubbing in a triple Quantity of the ſame Ointment directed for Men, and by giving them the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus No. 33. But both theſe Means ſhould be uſed as ſoon as ever they are bit. When the great Symptom is manifeſt, there would be too much Danger in attempting to apply one, or to give the other; and they ſhould be immediately killed. It might be well, however, to try if they would ſwallow down the Bolus, on its being thrown to them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever Dogs are bit, they ſhould be ſafely tied up, and not let looſe again, before the Expiration of three or four Months.</p>
               <p>§ 200. A falſe and dangerous Prejudice has prevailed with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Bites from Dogs, and it is this—That if a Dog who had bit any Perſon, without being mad at the time of his biting, ſhould become mad afterwards, the Perſon ſo formerly bitten, would prove mad too at the ſame time. Such a Notion is full as abſurd, as it would be to affirm, that if two Perſons had ſlept in the ſame Bed, and that one of them ſhould take the Itch, the Small-Pocks, or any other contagious Diſeaſe, ten or twelve Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the other ſhould alſo be infected with that he took, and at the ſame time too.</p>
               <p>Of two Circumſtances, whenever a Perſon is bit, one muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, either the Dog which gives the Bite, is about to be mad himſelf, in which Caſe this would be evident in a few Days, and then it muſt be ſaid the Perſon was bitten by a mad Dog: Or elſe, that the Dog was abſolutely found, having neither conceived, or bred in himſelf, nor received from without the Cauſe, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Madneſs: in which laſt Caſe I aſk any Man in his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012243_0123_0F8A6AFAA36EADC0"/>
if he could communicate it. No Perſon, no Thing imparts what it has not. This falſe and crude Notion excites thoſe who are poſſeſſed with it to a dangerous Action: they exerciſe that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the Laws unhappily allow them of killing the Dog; by which Means they are left uncertain of his State, and of their own Chance. This is a dreadful Uncertainty, and may be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with embarraſſing and troubleſome Conſequences, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the Poiſon itſelf. The reaſonable Conduct would be to fecure and obſerve the Dog very cloſely, in order to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whether he is, or is not, mad.</p>
               <p>§ 201. It is no longer neceſſary to repreſent the Horror, the Barbarity and Guilt of that cruel Practice, which prevailed, not very long ſince, of ſuffocating Perſons in the Height of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, with the Bed-cloaths. or between Matraſſes. It is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in moſt Countries; and doubtleſs will be puniſhed, or at leaſt ought to be, even in thoſe where as yet it is not.</p>
               <p>Another Cruelty, of which we hope to ſee no repeated Inſtance, is that of abandoning thoſe miſerable Patients to themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Reſource or Aſſiſtance: a moſt deteſtable Cuſtom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thoſe Times, when there was not the leaſt Hope of ſaving them; and ſtill more criminal in our Days, when they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered effectually. I do again affirm, that it is not very often, theſe afflicted Patients are diſpoſed to bite; and that even when they are, they are afraid of doing it; and requeſt the Byſtanders to keep out of their Reach: So that no Danger is incurred; op where there is any, it may eaſily be avoided by a few Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

It muſt be acknowledged, at the ſame Time, to be one of the moſt deſtructive Diſeaſes; for if in ſome Years or Seaſons, it proves to be of a very mild and gentle Sort, in others it is almoſt as fatal as the Plague: It being demonſtrated, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the Conſequences of it's moſt raging, and its gentleſt Prevalence; that it kills one ſeventh of the Number it attacks.</p>

It commonly ceaſes at the End of ſome Weeks, or of ſome Months, and rarely ever appears again in the ſame Place, until four, five, or ſix Years after.</p>
               <p>§ 204. This Malady often gives ſome Intimation of its Approach three or four Days before the Appearance of the Fever, by a little Dejection; by leſs Vivacity and Gaiety than uſual; a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to ſweat; leſs Appetite; a ſlight Alteration of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a kind of pale livid Colour about the Eyes: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, in Children of a lax and phlegmatic Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I have known a moderate Agitation of their Blood, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Shivering approached,) give them a <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame Appearances very often occur in ſuch Subjects by Inoculation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual Sickening, as I have obſerved and inſtanced, <hi>Analyſis</hi> Ed. 1ſt.

               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:012243_0125_0F8A6AFBE85E7CE8"/>This State continues for ſome Hours, at the Expiration of which the Fever abates a little in a Sweat, which is ſometimes a very large one: the Patient then finds himſelf better, but is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding caſt down, torpid or heavy, very ſqueamiſh, with a Head-ach and Pain in the Back, and a Diſpoſition to be drowſy. The laſt Symptom indeed is not very common, except in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſs than ſeven or eight Years of Age.</p>
               <p>The Abatement of the Fever is of ſmall Duration; and ſome Hours after, commonly towards the Evening, it returns with all its Attendants, and terminates again by Sweats, as before.</p>
               <p>This State of the Diſeaſe laſts three or four Days; at the End of which Term, and ſeldom later, the firſt Eruptions appear among the Sweat, which terminates the Paroxyſm or Return of the Fever. I have generally obſerved the earlieſt Eruption to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Face, next to that on the Hands, on the fore Part of the Arms, on the Neck, and on the upper Part of the Breaſt. As ſoon as the Eruption appears, if the Diſtemper is of a gentle Kind and Diſpoſition, the Fever almoſt entirely vaniſhes: the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continues to ſweat a little, or tranſpire; the Number of Eruptions increaſes, others coming out on the Back, the Sides, the Belly, the Thighs, the Legs, and the Feet. Sometimes they are puſhed out very numerouſly even to the Soles of the Feet; where, as they increaſe in Size, they often excite very ſharp Pain, by Reaſon of the great Thickneſs and Hardneſs of the Skin in theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>Frequently on the firſt and ſecond Day of Eruption (ſpeaking hitherto always of the mild Kind and Degree of the Diſeaſe) there returns again a very gentle Revival of the Fever towards the Evening, which, about the Termination of it, is attended with a conſiderable and final Eruption: though as often as the Fever ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates perfectly after the earlieſt Eruption, a very diſtinct and very ſmall one is a pretty certain Conſequence. For though the Eruption is already, or ſhould prove only moderate, the Fever, as I have before ſaid, does not totally diſappear; a ſmall Degree of it ſtill remaining, and heightening a little every Evening.</p>
               <p>Theſe Puſtules, or Effloreſcences, on their firſt Appearances, are only ſo many very little red Spots, conſiderably reſembling a Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite; but diſtinguiſhable by a ſmall white Point in the Middle, a little raiſed above the reſt, which gradually increaſes in Size, with the Redneſs extended about it. They become whiter, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they grow larger; and generally upon the ſixth Day, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that of their firſt Eruption, they attain their utmoſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and are full of <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter. Some of them grow to the Size of a Pea, and ſome ſtill a little larger; but this never happens to the greateſt Number of them. From this time they begin to look yellowiſh, they gradually become dry, and fall off in brown Scales, in ten or eleven Days from their firſt Appearance. As their Eruption occurred on different Days, they alſo wither and fall off ſucceſſively. The Face is ſometimes clear of them,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012243_0126_0F8A6AFC9B40BEE0"/>
while Puſtules ſtill are ſeen upon the Legs, not fully ripe, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated: and thoſe in the Soles of the Feet often remain much longer.</p>
               <p>§ 205. The Skin is of courſe extended or ſtretched out by the Puſtules; and after the Appearance of a certain Quantity, all the Interſtices, or Parts between the Puſtules, are red and bright, as it were, with a proportionable Inflation or Swelling of the Skin. The Face is the firſt Part that appears bloated, from the Puſtules there firſt attaining their utmoſt Size: and this Inflation is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo conſiderable, as to look monſtrous; the like happens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Neck, and the Eyes are entirely cloſed up by it. The Swelling of the Face abates in Proportion to the ſcabbing and drying up of the Puſtules; and then the Hands are puffed up prodigiouſly. This happens ſucceſſively to the Legs, the Tumour or Swelling being the Conſequence of the Puſtules attaining their utmoſt Size, which happens by Succeſſion, in theſe different Parts.</p>
               <p>§ 206. Whenever there is a very conſiderable Eruption, the Fever is heightened at the time of Suppuration, which is not to be wondered at; one ſingle Boil excites a Fever: How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then that ſome hundreds, nay ſome thouſands, of theſe little Abſceſſes ſhould not excite one? This Fever is the moſt dangerous Period, or Time of the Diſeaſe, and occurs between the ninth and the thirteenth Days; as many Circumſtances vary the Term of Suppuration, two or three Days. At this painful and perilous Seaſon then, the Patient becomes very hot, and thirſty: he is harraſſed with Pain; and finds it very difficult to diſcover a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable eaſy Poſture. If the Malady runs very high, he has no Sleep; he raves, becomes greatly oppreſſed, is ſeized with a heavy Drowſineſs; and when he dies, he dies either ſuffocated or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargic, and ſometimes in a State compounded of both theſe Symptoms</p>
               <p>The Pulſe, during this Fever of Suppuration, is ſometimes of an aſtoniſhing Quickneſs, while the Swelling of the Wriſts makes it ſeem, in ſome Subjects, to be very ſmall. The moſt critical and dangerous Time is, when the Swellings of the Face, Head and Neck are in their higheſt Degree. Whenever the Swelling begins to fall, the Scabs on the Face to dry [<hi>ſuppoſing neither of theſe to be too ſudden and premature, for the viſible Quantity of the Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules</hi>] and the Skin to ſhrivel, as it were, the Quickneſs of the Pulſe abates a little, and the Danger diminiſhes. When the Puſtules are very few, this ſecond Fever is ſo moderate, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome Attention to diſcern it, ſo that the Danger is next to none.</p>
               <p>§ 207. Beſides theſe Symptoms, there are ſome others, which require conſiderable Attention and Vigilance. One of theſe is the Soreneſs of the Throat, with which many Perſons in the Small-Pocks are afflicted, as ſoon as the Fever grows pretty ſtrong. It continues for two or three Days; feels very ſtrait and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012243_0127_0F8A6AFD5BF59BA8"/>
in the Action of Swallowing; and whenever the Diſeaſe is extremely acute, it entirely prevents Swallowing. It is commonly aſcribed to the Eruption of Puſtules in the Throat; but this is a Miſtake, ſuch Puſtules being almoſt conſtantly <note n="*" place="bottom">As Puſtules are, and not very ſeldom, viſible on the Tongue, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Roof, even to its Proceſs called the Palate, which I have plainly ſeen; it ſeems not very eaſy to aſſign any inſuperable Obſtacle to the Exiſtence of a few within the Throat; tho' this ſcarcely ever occurs, in the diſtinct Small-Pocks. Doubtleſs however, a conſiderable Inflammation of that Part will be as likely to produce the great Difficulty of Swallowing, as the Exiſtence of Puſtules there; which our learned Author does not <hi>abſolutely</hi> reject, and conſequently will forgive this Suppoſition of them; eſpecially if he credits the ocular Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Violante,</hi> cited in the Analyſis, Ed. 2. p. 71. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> imaginary. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, moſt frequently, before the Eruption appears; if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is in a light Degree, it terminates upon the Eruption; and whenever it revives again in the Courſe of the Diſeaſe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Proportion to the Degree of the Fever. Hence we may infer it does not ariſe from the Puſtules, but is owing to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; and as often as it is of any conſiderable Duration, it is almoſt ever attended with another Symptom, the Salivation, or a Diſcharge of a great Quantity of Spittle, This Salivation rarely exiſts, where the Diſeaſe is very gentle, or the Patient very young; and is full as rarely abſent, where it is ſevere, and the Patient is paſt ſeven or eight Years old; but when the Eruption is very confluent, and the Patient adult, or grown up, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is ſurprizing. Under theſe Circumſtances it flows out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, allowing the afflicted Patient no Reſt nor Reſpite, often incommoding him more than any other Symptom of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and ſo much the more, as after its Continuance for ſome Days, the Lips, the Inſide of the Cheeks, the Tongue, and the Roof of the Mouth are entirely peeled or flead, as it were. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, however painful and embarraſſing this Diſcharge may prove, it is very important and ſalutary. Meer Infants are leſs ſubject to it, ſome of them having a Looſeneſs, in lieu of it: and yet I have obſerved even this laſt Diſcharge to be conſiderably leſs frequent in them, than a Salivation is in grown People.</p>
               <p>§ 208. Children, to the Age of five or ſix Years, are liable to Convulſions before Eruption: theſe however are not dangerous, if they are not accompanied with other grievous and violent Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. But ſuch Convulſions as ſupervene either when Eruption, having already occured, ſuddenly retreats, or <hi>ſtrikes in,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common Phraſe; or during the Courſe of the Fever of Suppuration, are greatly more terrifying.</p>
               <p>Involuntary Diſcharges of Blood from the Noſe often occur, in the firſt Stages of this Diſtemper, which are extremely ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and commonly leſſen, or carry off, the Head-ach. Meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are leſs ſubject to this Diſcharge; though they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little of it: and I have known a conſiderable <hi>Stupor</hi> or Drowſineſs, vaniſh immediately after this Bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:012243_0128_0F8A6AFE2E07E3C8"/>§ 209. The Small-Pocks is commonly diſtinguiſhed into two Kinds, the confluent and the diſtinct, ſuch a Diſtinction really exiſting in Nature: but as the Treatment of each of them is the ſame; and as the Quantity or Doſe of the Medicines is only to be varied, in Proportion to the Danger of the Patient (not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here into very tedious Details, and ſuch as might exceed the Comprehenſion of many of our Readers; as well as whatever might relate particularly to the malignant Small-Pocks) I ſhall limit myſelf within the Deſcription I have premiſed, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Symptoms common to both theſe Kinds of the Small-Pocks. I content myſelf with adding here, that we may expect a very confluent and dangerous Pock, if, at the very time of Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, the Patient is immediately attacked with many violent Symptoms; more eſpecially if his Eyes are extremely quick, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and even gliſtening, as it were; if he vomits almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; if the Pain of his Loins be violent; and if he ſuffers at the ſame time great Anguiſh and Inquietude: if in Infants there is great <hi>Stupor</hi> or Heavineſs; if Eruption appears on the third Day, and ſometimes even on the ſecond; as the haſtier Eruptions in this Diſeaſe ſignify the moſt dangerous Kind and Degree of it; and on the contrary, the flower Eruption is, it is the ſafer too; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Slowneſs of the Eruption not to have been the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of great Weakneſs, or of ſome violent inward Pain.</p>
               <p>§ 210. The Diſorder is ſometimes ſo very mild and ſlight, that Eruption appears with ſcarcely any Suſpicion of the Child's having the leaſt Ailment, and the Event is as favourable as the Invaſion. The Puſtules appear, grow large, ſuppurate, and attain their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, without confining the Patient to his Bed, or leſſening either his Sleep, or Appetite.</p>
               <p>It is very common to ſee Children in the Country (and they are ſeldom more than Children who have it ſo very gently) run about in the open Air, through the whole Courſe of this Diſeaſe, and feeding juſt as they do in Health. Even thoſe who take it in a ſomewhat higher Degree, commonly go out when Eruption is finiſhed, and give themſelves up, without Reſerve, to the Vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Hunger. Notwithſtanding all this Neglect, many get perfectly cured; though ſuch a Conduct ſhould never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Imitation, ſince Numbers have experienced its pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences; and ſeveral of theſe Children have been brought to me, eſpecially from <hi>Jurat,</hi> who, after ſuch Neglect, in the Courſe of the mild and kindly Sort of this Diſtemper, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Complaints and Infirmities of different Kinds which have been found very difficult to ſubdue.</p>
               <p>§ 211. This ſtill continues to be one of thoſe Diſtempers, whoſe Danger has long been increaſed by its improper Treatment, and eſpecially by forcing the Patients into Sweats: and it ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be increaſed, particularly among Country People. They have ſeen Eruption appear, while the Patient ſweats, and obſerved he found himſelf better after its Appearance: and hence they
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012243_0129_0F8A6AFECC4E19C8"/>
conclude that, by quickening and forcing out this Eruption, they contributed to his Relief: and ſuppoſe, that by increaſing the Quantity of his Sweats, and the Number of his Eruptions, the Blood is the better cleared and purified from the Poiſon. Theſe are mortal Errors, which daily Experience has demonſtrated, by their tragical Conſequences.</p>
               <p>When the Contagion or Poiſon, which generates this Diſeaſe, has been admitted into the Blood, it requires a certain Term to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its uſual Effects: at which time the Blood being tainted by the Venom it has received, and by that which ſuch Venom has formed or aſſimilated from it, Nature makes an Effort to free her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it, and to expel it by the Skin, preciſely at the time when every thing is prediſpoſed for that Purpoſe. This Effort pretty generally ſucceeds being very often rather too rapid and violent, and very ſeldom too weak. Hence it is evident, that whenever this Effort is deficient, it ought not to be heightened by hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines or Means, which make it too violent and dangerous: for when it already exceeds in this Reſpect, a further Increaſe of ſuch Violence muſt render it mortal. There are but few Caſes in which the Efforts of Nature, on this Occaſion, are too languid and feeble, eſpecially in the Country; and whenever ſuch rare Caſes do occur, it is very difficult to form a juſt and proper Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them: for which Reaſon we ſhould be very reſerved and cautious in the Uſe of heating Medicines, which are ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally pernicious in this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Wine, Venice Treacle, cordial Confections, hot Air, and Loads of Bed-cloths, annually ſweep off thouſands of Children, who might have recovered, if they had taken nothing but warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and every Perſon who is intereſted in the Recovery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients from this Diſtemper, ought carefully to prevent the ſmalleſt Uſe of ſuch Drugs; which, if they ſhould not immediately ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it to a fatal Degree, yet will certainly increaſe the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Torment of it, and annex the moſt unhappy and tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſequences to it.</p>
               <p>The Prejudice in this Point is ſo ſtrongly rooted, that a total Eradication of it muſt be very difficult: but I only deſire Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be convinced by their own Eyes, of the different Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the hot Regimen, and of that I ſhall propoſe. And here indeed I muſt confeſs, I found more Attention and Docility, on this Point, among the Inhabitants of the City, and eſpecially in the laſt epidemical ſpreading of the Small-Pocks, than I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to hope for. Not only as many as conſulted me on the Invaſion of it, complied exactly with the cooling Regimen I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them; but their Neighbours alſo had Recourſe to it, when their Children ſickened: and being often called in when it had been many Days advanced, I obſerved with great Pleaſure, that in many Houſes, not one heating Medicine had been given; and great Care had been taken to keep the Air of the Patient's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber refreſhingly cool and temperate. This encourages me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012243_0130_0F8A6AFFF14E1DB8"/>
that this Method hereafter will become general here. What certainly ought moſt eſſentially to conduce to this is, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Diffuſion or ſpreading of this Diſeaſe was as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and extenſive as any of the former, the Mortality, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it, was evidently leſs.</p>
               <p>§ 212. At the very Beginning of the Small-Pocks (which may be reaſonably ſuſpected, from the Preſence of the Symptoms I have already deſcribed; ſuppoſing the Perſon complaining never to have had it, and the Diſeaſe to prevail near his Reſidence) the Patient is immediately to be put on a ſtrict Regimen, and to have his Legs bathed Night and Morning in warm Water. This is the moſt proper and promiſing Method to leſſen the Quantity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Face and Head, and to facilitate it every where elſe on the Surface. Glyſters alſo greatly contribute to abate the Head-ach, and to diminiſh the Reachings to vomit, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vomitings, which greatly diſtreſs the Patient; but which however it is highly abſurd and pernicious to ſtop by any ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chic cordial Confection, or by Venice Treacle; and ſtill more dangerous to attempt removing the Cauſe of them, by a Vomit or Purge, which are hurtful in the beginning of the Small-Pocks<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Tiſſot</hi> juſtly propoſes Glyſters in the inflammatory Apparatus of the Small-Pocks, and as judiciouſly rejects the Practice of ſtopping the Reachings to vomit, by any cordial Confection or Opiate. But it is probable the Caution he gives againſt attempting to abate them by a Vomit or Purge, ſhould, in ſome Caſes at leaſt, be reſtrained only to ſuch of thoſe Evacuants, as have any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their Operation. Indiſputably this is an improper Stage for ſtimulating, or adding to the Agitation of the Blood; but where there was a rational Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of abating this Stimulation, and of guarding, or relieving the Head, either by gently indulging the Puking, if manifeſtly bilious, with Draughts of warm Water, or of very light green Tea, we think this may be ſafely and diſcretely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. In Caſes too where a conſiderable Coſtiveneſs had preceded the Attack of this Diſeaſe, and the Eyes and Countenance were highly inflamed, a little Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na with Magneſia Alba, or Cream of Tartar, or perhaps a Drachm or two of Glauber Salt, according to the Patient's Age, &amp;c. might be prudently ventured on: And if this, or the like Laxative, was not attended with any Diſcharge in three or four Hours, one might be promoted by inviting it downward, with a moderately opening Glyſter. Theſe Means promiſe rationally to abate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Efferveſcence, to reſtrain the Fever, &amp;c. as it is very common for Patients un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der frequent bilious Pukings before Eruption, to confeſs themſelves immediately eaſier upon each Diſcharge. After Eruption I have given a very ſenſible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Relief to an inoculated Patient of twenty four Years, by allowing him to drink a Pint, or better of ſmall, and pretty warm, green Tea, which brought on a conſiderable and very bitter Diſcharge from his Stomach, and entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Oppreſſion and Nauſea. <hi>K.</hi>

               <p>If the Fever be moderate, the Bathings of the Legs on the firſt Day of ſickening, and one Glyſter may ſuffice then. The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be reſtrained to his Regimen; and inſtead of the Ptiſan No. 1, 2, 4, a very young Child ſhould drink nothing but Milk, diluted with two thirds of Elder-flower or Lime-tree Tea, or with Bawm Tea, if there be no perceivable Fever; and in ſhort, if they have an Averſion to the Taſt of them all, with only the ſame Quantity

But it is certain the Child recovered as ſpeedily as others, whoſe Eruption was more diſtinct, and who drank Barley-Water, very thin Rice or Indian Corn Gruel, Bawm Tea or the like. In fact, throughout the Courſe of this Viſitation from the Small-Pocks in <hi>Carolina</hi> in 1738, we had but too many Demonſtrations of the fatal Co-operation of violent Heat with their Contagion; and not a very few ſurprizing Inſtances of the ſalutary Effects of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily and involuntarily expoſed to ſome very cooling Accidents after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and in ſome Caſes after Eruption too: which I then more particularly mentioned in a ſmall controverſial Tract printed there. <hi>K.</hi>

An Apple coddled or baked may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it; and if they complain of Hunger a little Bread may be allowed; but they muſt be denied any Meat, or Meat Broth, Eggs and ſtrong Drink; ſince it has appeared from Obſervations fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, that Children who had been indulged with ſuch Diet, proved the worſe for it, and recovered more ſlowly than others. In this early Stage too, clear Whey alone may ſerve them inſtead of every other Drink, the good Effects of which I have frequently been a Witneſs to; or ſome Buttermilk may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. When the Diſtemper is of a mild Species, a perfect Cure enſues, without any other Aſſiſtance or Medicine: but we ſhould not neglect to purge the Patient as ſoon as the Puſtules are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſcabbed on the greater Part of his Face, with the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 11, which muſt be repeated ſix Days after. He ſhould not be allowed Fleſh 'till after this ſecond Purge; though after the firſt he may be allowed ſome well-boiled Puls, or Garden-ſtuff and Bread, and in ſuch a Quantity, as not to be pinched with Hunger, while he recovers from the Diſeaſe.</p>

But if the Fever ſhould be ſtrong, the Pulſe hard, and the Pain of the Head and Loins ſhould be violent, he muſt, 1. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately loſe Blood from the Arm; receive a Glyſter two Hours after; and, if the Fever continues, the Bleeding muſt be repeated, I have directed a Repetition of it even to the fourth Time, within the two firſt Days, to young People under the Age of eighteen; and it is more eſpecially neceſſary in ſuch Perſons as, with a hard and full Pulſe, are alſo affected with a heavy Drowſineſs and a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Raving.</p>
               <p>2. As long as the Fever continues violently, two, three, and even four Glyſters ſhould be given in the twenty-four Hours; and the Legs ſhould be bathed twice.</p>
               <p>3. The Patient is to be taken out of Bed, and ſupported in a Chair, as long as he can tolerably bear it.</p>
               <p>4. The Air of his Chamber ſhould frequently be renewed, and if it be too hot, which it often is in Summer, in order to refreſh it and the Patient, the Means muſt be employed which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected § 36.</p>

He is to be reſtrained to the Ptiſans No. 2 or 4; and if that does not ſufficiently moderate the Fever, he ſhould take every Hour, or every two Hours, according to the Urgency of the Caſe, a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 10: mixed with a Cup of Ptiſan. After the Eruption, the Fever being then abated, there is leſs Occaſion for Medicine; and ſhould it even entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Patient may be regulated, as directed, § 212.</p>
               <p>§ 214. When, after a Calm, a Remiſſion or Intermiſſion of ſome Days, the Proceſs of Suppuration revives the Fever, we ought firſt, and eſpecially, to keep the <note n="*" place="bottom">We muſt remember that Dr. TISSOT is treating <hi>here</hi> of the higher and confluent Degrees of this Diſeaſe; for in the diſtinct Small-Pocks, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to find Perſons for ſeveral Days without a Stool, and without the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Diſorder for want of one, (their whole Nouriſhment being very light and liquid,) in which Caſes, while Matters proceed well in all other Reſpects, there ſeems little Occaſion for a great Solicitude about Stools: But if one ſhould be judged neceſſary after four or five Days Coſtiveneſs, accompanied with a Tightneſs or Hardneſs of the Belly, doubtleſs the Glyſter ſhould be of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Kind, (as thoſe directed by our Author are,) and not calculated to produce more than a ſecond Stool at the very moſt. Indeed, where there is Reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a ſtrong ſecondary Fever, from the Quantity of Eruption, and a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly high Inflammation, it is more prudent to provide for a Mitigation of it, by a moderately open Belly, than to ſuffer a long Coſtiveneſs; yet ſo as to incur very little Hazard of abating the Salivation, or of retarding the Growth or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration of the Puſtules, by a Superpurgation, which it may be too eaſy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in ſome Habits. If the Diſcharge by ſpitting, and the Brightneſs and Quantity of Suppuration, have been in Proportion to the Number of Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; though the Conflict from the ſecondary Fever, where theſe have been numerous, is often acute and high; and the Patient, who is in great Anguiſh, is far from being out of Danger; yet Nature pretty generally proves ſtronger than the Diſeaſe, in ſuch Circumſtances. As the <hi>Elect. Catholicon</hi> is little uſed, or made here, the lenitive Electuary of our Diſpenſatory may be ſubſtituted for it, or that of the <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Diſpenſatory, which was calculated particularly for Glyſters. <hi>K.</hi>

For this Purpoſe, α an Ounce of <hi>Catholicon</hi> ſhould be added to the Glyſter; or they might be ſimply made of Whey, with Honey, Oil and Salt. β Give the Patient three times every Morning, at the Interval of two Hours between each, three Glaſſes of the Ptiſan No. 32. γ Purge him <hi>after</hi> two Days, with the Potion No. 23, but on that Day, he muſt not take the Ptiſan No. 32.</p>
               <p>2. He muſt, if the Diſtemper be very violent, take a double Doſe of the Mixture No. 10.</p>
               <p>3. The Patient ſhould be taken out of Bed, and kept up in a Room well aired Day and Night, until the Fever has abated. Many Perſons will probably be ſurprized at this Advice; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is that which I have often experienced to be the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, and without which the others are ineffectual. They will ſay, how ſhall the Patient ſleep at this rate? To which it may be anſwered, Sleep is not neceſſary, nay, it is hurtful in this State and Stage of the Diſeaſe. Beſides, he is really unable to ſleep; the continual Salivation prevents it, and it is very neceſſary to keep up the Salivation; which is facilitated by often injecting
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012243_0133_0F8A6B01CB551B98"/>
warm Water and Honey into his Throat. It is alſo of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service to throw ſome up his Noſtrils, and often thus to cleanſe the Scabs which form within them. A due Regard to theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances not only contributes to leſſen the Patient's Uneaſineſs, but very effectually alſo to his Cure.</p>
               <p>4. If the Face and Neck are greatly ſwelled, emolient Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms ought to be applied to the Soles of the Feet; and if theſe ſhould have very little Effect, Sinapiſms ſhould be applied. Theſe are a kind of Plaiſter or Application compoſed of Yeaſt, Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, and ſome Vinegar. They ſometimes occaſion ſharp and almoſt burning Pain; but in Proportion to the Sharpneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of theſe Pains, the Head and Neck are remarkably relieved.</p>
               <p>§ 215. The Eyelids are puffed up and ſwelled when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe runs high, ſo as to conceal the Eyes, which are cloſed up faſt for ſeveral Days. Nothing further ſhould be attempted, with Reſpect to this Circumſtance, but the frequent moiſtening of them with a little warm Milk and Water. The Precautions which ſome take to ſtroke them with Saffron, a Gold Ducat, or Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, are equally childiſh and inſignificant. What chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to prevent the Redneſs or Inflammation of the Eyes after the Diſeaſe, and in general all its other bad Conſequences, is to be content for a conſiderable time, with a very moderate Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Food, and particularly to abſtain from Fleſh and Wine. In the very bad Small-Pocks, and in little Children, the Eyes are cloſed up from the Beginning of the Eruption.</p>
               <p>§ 216. One extremely ſerviceable Aſſiſtance, and which has not been made uſe of for a long time paſt, except as a Means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Smoothneſs and Beauty of the Face; but yet which has the greateſt Tendency to preſerve Life itſelf, is the Opening of the Puſtules, not only upon the Face, but all over the Body. In the firſt Place, by opening them, the Lodgment or Retention of <hi>Pus</hi> is prevented, which may be ſuppoſed to prevent any Eroſion, or eating down, from it; whence Scars, deep Pits, and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities are obviated. Secondly, in giving a Vent to the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Retreat of it into the Blood is cut off, which removes a principal Cauſe of the Danger of the Small-Pocks. Thirdly, the Skin is relaxed; the Tumour of the Face and Neck diminiſh in Proportion to that Relaxation; and thence the Return of the Blood from the Brain is facilitated, which muſt prove a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Puſtules ſhould be opened every where, ſucceſſively as they ripen. The preciſe time of doing it is when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely white; when they juſt begin to turn but a very little yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; and when the red Circle ſurrounding them is quite pale. They ſhould be opened with very fine ſharp-pointed Sciſſars; this does not give the Patient the leaſt Pain; and when a certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them are opened, a Spunge dipt in a little warm Water is to be repeatedly applied to ſuck up and remove that <hi>Pus,</hi> which would ſoon be dried up into Scabs. But as the Puſtules, when emptied thus, ſoon fill again, a Diſcharge of this freſh Matter
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:012243_0134_0F8A6B06BA2CE9F0"/>
muſt be obtained in the ſame Manner ſome Hours after; and this muſt ſometimes be repeated five or even ſix times ſucceſſively. Such extraordinary Attention in this Point may probably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as minute, and even trivial, by ſome; and is very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become a <note n="*" place="bottom">This Practice which I had heard of, and even ſuggeſted to myſelf, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen actually enterprized, ſeems ſo very rational as highly to deſerve a fair Trial in the confluent Degrees of the Small-Pocks [for in the very diſtinct it can ſcarcely be neceſſary] wherein every probable Aſſiſtance ſhould be employed, and in which the moſt potent Medicines are frequently unſucceſsful. We have but too many Opportunities of trying it ſufficiently; and it certainly has a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing Aſpect than a Practice ſo highly recommended many Years ago, of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Puſtules (which is ſometimes the whole Surface of the Patient) in Melilot, or ſuppoſe any other ſuppurating, Plaiſter; which muſt effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Perſpiration, and greatly increaſe the Soreneſs, Pain, and Embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patient, at the Height of the Diſeaſe. I can conceive but one bad Conſequence that might poſſibly ſometimes reſult from the former; but this (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Means that may be uſed to avert it) is rather remote, and ſo uncertain, until the Trial is repeatedly made, that I think it ought not to be named, in Competition with the Benefits that may poſſibly ariſe from it in ſuch Caſes, as ſeem, otherwiſe, too generally irrecoverable. I own indeed, that Dr. GATTI gives his Suffrage ſtrongly againſt this Practice, in his late Tract concerning Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; RHAZES however uſed and recommended it, which I recollect the more readily, from having lately read the learned Mr. CHANNING's clear and elegant <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation of him, from the original <hi>Arabic,</hi> which is printed in the oppoſite Pages. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> general Practice: but I do again affirm it to be of much more Importance than many may imagine; and that as often as the Fever attending Suppuration is violent and menacing, a very general, exact and repeated opening, emptying and abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ripened Puſtules, is a Remedy of the utmoſt Importance and Efficacy; as it removes two very conſiderable Cauſes of the Danger of this Diſeaſe, which are the Matter itſelf, and the great Tenſion and Stiffneſs of the Skin.</p>
               <p>§ 217. In the Treatment of this Diſeaſe, I have ſaid nothing with Reſpect to Anodynes, or ſuch Medicines as procure Sleep, which I am ſenſible are pretty generally employed in it; but which I ſcarcely ever direct in this violent Degree of the Diſeaſe, and the Danger of which Medicine in it I have demonſtrated in the Letter to Baron HALLER, which I have already mentioned. For which Reaſon, wherever the Patient is not under the Care and Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Phyſician, they ſhould very carefully abſtain from the Uſe of Venice Treacle, Laudanum, <hi>Diacodium,</hi> that is, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of white Poppies, or even of the wild red Poppy; Syrup of Amber, Pills of Storax, of <hi>Cynogloſſum</hi> or Hounds-tongue, and, in one Word, of every Medicine which produces Sleep. But ſtill more eſpecially ſhould their Uſe be entirely baniſhed, throughout the Duration of the ſecondary Fever, when even natural Sleep it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is dangerous. One Circumſtance in which their Uſe may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be permitted, is in the Caſe of weakly Children, or ſuch as are liable to Convulſions, where Eruption is effected not without Difficulty. But I muſt again inculcate the greateſt Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012243_0135_0F8A6B08790D0E88"/>
in the Uſe of ſuch Medicines, whoſe Effects are fatal <note n="†" place="bottom">The Uſe of Opiates in this Diſeaſe undoubtedly requires no ſmall Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the great SYDENHAM himſelf not ſeeming always ſufficiently guarded in the Exhibition of them; as far as Experience ſince his Day has enabled Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to judge of this Matter. In general our Author's Limitations of them ſeem very juſt; though we have ſeen a few clear Inſtances, in which a light Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which evidently aroſe from Want of Sleep (joined to ſome Dread of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the Diſeaſe by Inoculation) was happily removed, with every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Complaint, by a moderate Opiate. In ſore and fretful Children too, under a large or middling Eruption, as the time gained to Reſt is taken from Pain, and from waſting their Spirits in Crying and Clamour, I have ſeen Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration very benignly promoted by <hi>Diacodium.</hi> But in the <hi>Criſis</hi> of the ſecondary Fever in the confluent or coherent Pock, when there is a morbid Fulneſs, and Nature is ſtruggling to unload herſelf by ſome other Outlets than thoſe of the Skin, which now are totally obſtructed (and which ſeems the only Evacuation, that is not reſtrained by Opiates) the giving and repeating them then, as has too often been practiſed, ſeems importantly erroneous: for I think Dr. SWAN has taken a judicious Liberty of diſſenting from the great Author he very juſtly tranſlates, in forbidding an Opiate, if the Spitting abates, or grows ſo tough and ropy, as to endanger Suffocation. As the Difference of our Oeconomy in the Adminiſtration of Phyſic from that in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> and Dr. TISSOT's juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, may diſpoſe many Country Practitioners to peruſe this Treatiſe, I take the Liberty of referring ſuch Readers for a Recollection of ſome of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Opiates, (long before the Appearance of this Work in <hi>French</hi>) to the ſecond Edition of the Analyſis from P. 94 to 97, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> And here I adopt with Pleaſure, the following judicious Remark of a learned and experienced Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has done me the Favour of attentively peruſing my ſecond Edition, in order to this third and more correct one.—
<q>Opiates ſhould never be given to procure Sleep, but Eaſe, in this Diſtemper; and their Doſes muſt be ſmall, juſt enough to take off the Senſe of Soreneſs, and no more. <hi>Diacodium</hi> is the beſt of all, and never hinders the Expectoration.</q>
—It may be added indeed, that Sleep will very often naturally attend the Eaſe procured by the Opiate (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if long Wakefulneſs has preceded) but there will rarely, if ever, be any ill Conſequence, from that moderate Portion of Sleep, which this gentle tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Opiate, in a prudent Doſe, diſpoſes to. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> when the Blood-veſſels are turgid or full; whenever there is Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fever, a great Diſtention of the Skin; whenever the Patient raves, or complains of Heavineſs and Oppreſſion; and when it is neceſſary that the Belly ſhould be open; the Urine plentifully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and the Salivation be freely promoted.</p>
               <p>§ 218. If Eruption ſhould ſuddenly retreat, or ſtrike in, heating, ſoporific, ſpirituous, and volatile Remedies ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be avoided: but the Patient may drink plentifully of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion No. 12 pretty hot, and ſhould be bliſtered on the fleſhy Part of the Legs. This is a very embarraſſing and difficult Caſe, and the different Circumſtances attending it may require different Means and Applications, the Detail and Diſcuſſion of which are beyond my Plan here. Sometimes a ſingle Bleeding has effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recalled Eruption at once.</p>
               <p>§ 219. The only certain Method of ſurmounting all the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this Malady, is to inoculate. But this moſt ſalutary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which ought to be regarded as a particular and gracious Diſpenſation of Providence, can ſcarcely be attainable by, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to, the Bulk of the People; except in theſe Countries,

               <p>§ 220. This Preparation conſiſts, upon the whole, in removing all Want of, and all Obſtructions to, the Health of the Perſon ſubject to this Diſeaſe, if he have any ſuch; and in bringing him into a mild and healthy, but not into a very robuſt and vigorous State; as this Diſtemper is often exceedingly violent in the laſt.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that ſince the Defects of Health are very different in different Bodies, the Preparations of them muſt as often vary; and that a Child ſubject to ſome habitual Diſorder, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the ſame Method with another who has a very oppoſite one. The Detail and Diſtinctions which are neceſſary on this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Head, would be improper here, whether it might be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their unavoidable Length; or to the Impoſſibility of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons, who are not Phyſicians, ſufficient Knowledge and Information, to qualify them for determining on, and preferring, the moſt proper Preparation in various Caſes. Nevertheleſs I will point out ſome ſuch as may be very likely to agree, pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, with Reſpect to ſtrong and healthy Children <note n="*" place="bottom">The Subject of this Section flows from the Combination of an excellent Underſtanding with great Experience, mature Reflection, and real Probity; and fundamentally expoſes both the Abſurdity of ſuch as univerſally decry any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of any Subject previous to Inoculation, (which is ſaid to be the Practice of a preſent very popular Inoculator in <hi>Paris,</hi>) and the oppoſite Abſurdity of giving one and the very ſame Preparation to all Subjects, without Diſtinction; tho' this was avowed to have been ſucceſsfully practiſed in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſome Years ſince; which the Reader may ſee Analyſ.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The firſt Step then is an Abatement of their uſual Quantity of Food. Children commonly eat too much. Their Limitation ſhould be in Proportion to their Size and Growth, wherever we can exactly aſcertain them: but with Regard to all, or to much the greater Number of them, we may be allowed to make their Supper very light and very ſmall.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Advantage will conſiſt in the Choice of their Food. This Circumſtance is leſs within the Attainment of, and indeed leſs neceſſary for, the common People, who are of courſe limited to a very few, than to the Rich, who have Room to make great Retrenchments on this Account. The Diet of Country People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſimpleſt Kind, and almoſt ſolely conſiſting of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and of Milk-meats, is the moſt proper Diet towards prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this Diſeaſe. For this Reaſon, ſuch Perſons have little more to attend to in this Reſpect, but that ſuch Aliments be ſound
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012243_0137_0F8A6B0949B46FA0"/>
and good in their Kind; that their Bread be well baked; their Puls dreſſed without Bacon, or rancid ſtrong Fat of any Sort; that their Fruits ſhould be well ripened; that their Children ſhould have no Cakes or Tarts, [But ſee Note * P. 20.] and but little Cheeſe. Theſe ſimple Regulations may be ſufficient, with Regard to this Article of their Preparation.</p>
               <p>Some Judgment may be formed of the good Conſequences of their Care in theſe two Points, concerning the Quantity and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Children's Diet, by the moderate Shrinking of their Bellies; as they will be rendered more lively and active by this Alteration in their living; and yet, notwithſtanding a little leſs Ruddineſs in their Complexion, and ſome Abatement of their common Plight of Body, their Countenances, upon the whole, will ſeem improved.</p>
               <p>The third Article I would recommend, is to bathe their Legs now and then in warm Water, before they go to Bed. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Perſpiration, cools, dilutes the Blood, and allays the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, as often as it is properly timed.</p>
               <p>The fourth Precaution is the frequent uſe of very clear Whey. This agreeable Remedy, which conſiſts of the Juices of Herbs filtred through and concocted, or as it were, ſweetened by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of a healthy Animal, anſwers every viſible Indication: (I am ſtill ſpeaking here of ſound and hearty Children.) It imparts a Flexibility or Soupleneſs to the Veſſels; it abates the Denſity, the heavy Conſiſtence and Thickneſs of the Blood; which being augmented by the Action of the poiſonous Cauſe of the Small-Pocks, would degenerate into a moſt dangerous inflammatory <note n="‖" place="bottom">There may certainly be an inflammatory Acrimony or Thinneſs, as well as Thickneſs, of the Blood; and many medical Readers may think a morbid Fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the red Globules to be a more frequent Effect of this Contagion, than an increaſed Viſcidity, or Denſity, of them. See Analyſ. Ed. 2d. P. 75 to 83. But this Tranſlation, conforming to the Spirit of its Original, admits very little Theory, and ſtill leſs Controverſy, into its Plan. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Viſcidity or Thickneſs. It removes all Obſtructions in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or Bowels of the lower Cavity, the Belly. It opens the Paſſages which ſtrain off the Bile; ſheaths, or blunts, its Sharpneſs, gives it a proper Fluidity, prevents its Putridity, and ſweetens whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceſſive Acrimony may reſide throughout the Maſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. It likewiſe promotes Stools, Urine, and Perſpiration; and, in a Word, it communicates the moſt favorable Diſpoſition to the Body, not to be too violently impreſſed and agitated by the Operation of an inflammatory Poiſon: And with Regard to ſuch Children as I have mentioned, for thoſe who are either ſanguine or bilious, it is beyond all Contradiction, the moſt effectual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Drink, and the moſt proper to make them amends for the Want of Inoculation.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerved, that it may alſo be uſed to great Advantage, during the Courſe of the Diſeaſe: but I muſt further
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012243_0138_0F8A6B0A5BCE6498"/>
obſerve, that however ſalutary it is, in the Caſes for which I have directed it, there are many others in which it would be hurtful. It would be extremely pernicious to order it to weak, languiſhing, ſchirrous, pale Children, ſubject to Vomitings, Purgings, Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to all Diſeaſes which prove their Bowels to be weak, their Humours to be ſharp: ſo that People muſt be very cautious not to regard it as an univerſal and infallible Remedy, towards preparing for the Small-Pocks. Thoſe to whom it is adviſed, may take a few Glaſſes every Morning, and even drink it daily, for their common Drink; they may alſo ſup it with Bread for Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, for Supper, and indeed at any time.</p>
               <p>If Country People will purſue theſe Directions, which are very eaſy to obſerve and to comprehend, whenever the Small-Pocks rages, I am perſuaded it muſt leſſen the Mortality attending it. Some will certainly experience the Benefit of them; ſuch I mean as are very ſenſible, and diſcreet, and ſtrongly influenced by the trueſt Love of their Children. Others there are, alas! who are too ſtupid to diſcern the Advantage of them, and too unnatural to take any juſt Care of their Families.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV. Of the Meaſles.</head>
               <p>SECT. 221. THE Meaſles, to which the human Species are as generally liable, as to the Small-Pocks, is a Diſtemper conſiderably related to it; though, generally ſpeaking, it is leſs fatal; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, it is not a little deſtructive in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. In <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> we loſe much fewer in the Diſeaſe, than from the Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>It happens now and then that the Small-Pocks and the Meaſles rage at the ſame time, and in the ſame Place; though I have more frequently obſerved, that each of them was epidemical in different Years. Sometimes it alſo happens that both theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are combined at once in the ſame Perſon; and that one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenes before the other has finiſhed its Courſe, which makes the Caſe very perilous.</p>
               <p>§ 222. In ſome Conſtitutions the Meaſles gives Notice of its Approach, many Days before its evident Invaſion, by a ſmall, frequent; and dry Cough, without any other ſenſible Complaint; though more frequently by a general Uneaſineſs; by Succeſſions of Shivering and of Heat; by a ſevere Head-ach in grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012243_0139_0F8A6B0C5697C488"/>
a Heavineſs in Children; a conſiderable Complaint of the Throat; and, by what particularly characterizes this Diſtemper, an Inflammation and a conſiderable Heat in the Eyes, attended with a Swelling of the Eye-lids, with a Defluxion of ſharp Tears, and ſo acute a Senſation, or Feeling of the Eyes, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the Light; by very frequent Sneezings and a Dripping from the Noſe of the ſame Humour with that, which trickles from the Eyes.</p>
               <p>The Heat and the Fever increaſe with Rapidity; the Patient is afflicted with a Cough, a Stuffing, with Anguiſh, and continual Reachings to vomit; with violent Pains in the Loins; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a Looſeneſs, under which Circumſtance he is leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with Vomiting. At other times, and in other Subjects, Sweating chiefly prevails, though in leſs Abundance than in the Small-Pocks. The Tongue is foul and white; the Thirſt is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very high; and the Symptoms are generally more violent than in the mild Small-Pocks.</p>
               <p>At length, on the fourth or fifth Day, and ſometimes about the End of the third, a ſudden Eruption appears, and in a very great Quantity, eſpecially about the Face; which in a few Hours is covered with Spots, each of which reſembles a Flea-bite; many of them ſoon joining form red Streaks or Suffuſions larger or ſmaller, which inflame the Skin, and produce a very perceivable Swelling of the Face; whence the very Eyes are ſometimes cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Each ſmall Spot or Suffuſion is raiſed a little above the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, eſpecially in the Face, where they are manifeſt both to the Sight and the Touch. In the other Parts of the Body, this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation or Riſing is ſcarcely perceivable by any Circumſtance, but the Roughneſs of the Skin.</p>
               <p>The Eruption, having firſt appeared in the Face, is afterwards extended to the Breaſt, the Back, the Arms, the Thighs and Legs. It generally ſpreads very plentifully over the Breaſt and the Back, and ſometimes red Suffuſions are found upon the Breaſt, before any Eruption has appeared in the Face.</p>
               <p>The Patient is often relieved, as in the Small-Pocks, by plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſcharges of Blood from the Noſe, which carry off the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Head, of the Eyes, and of the Throat.</p>
               <p>Whenever this Diſtemper appears in its mildeſt Character, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Symptom abates after Eruption, as it happens in the Small-Pocks; though, in general, the Change for the better is not as thoroughly perceivable, as it is in the Small-Pocks. It is certain the Reachings and Vomitings ceaſe almoſt entirely; but the Fever, the Cough, the Head-ach continue; and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved that a bilious Vomiting, a Day or two after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, proved a more conſiderable Relief to the Patient than the Eruption had proved. On the third or fourth Day of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the Redneſs diminiſhes; the Spots, or very ſmall Puſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, dry up and fall off in very little branny Scales; the Cuticle, or ſuperficial Skin alſo ſhrivels off, and is replaced by one ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath it. On the 9th Day, when the Progreſs of the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012243_0140_0F8A6B0D63F1FB08"/>
has been ſpeedy, and on the eleventh, when it has been very ſlow, no Trace of the Redneſs is to be found; and the Surface immediately reſumes its uſual Appearance.</p>
               <p>§ 223. Notwithſtanding all which the Patient is not ſafe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, during the Courſe of the Diſtemper, or immediately after it, he has had ſome conſiderable Evacuation; ſuch as the Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have juſt mentioned; or a bilious Looſeneſs; or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſcharges by Urine; or very plentiful Sweating. For when any of theſe Evacuations ſupervenes, the Fever vaniſhes; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reſumes his Strength, and perfectly recovers. It happens ſometimes too, and even without any of theſe perceivable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, that inſenſible Perſpiration expels the Relics of the poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, and the Patient recovers his Health. Yet it occurs too often, that this Venom not having been entirely expelled (or its internal Effects not having been thoroughly effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) it is repelled upon the Lungs, where it produces a ſlight In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. In Conſequence of this the Oppreſſion, the Cough, the Anguiſh and Fever return, and the Patient's Situation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very dangerous. This Outrage is frequently leſs vehement, but it proves tedious and chronical, leaving a very obſtinate Cough behind it, with many Reſemblances of the Whooping-Cough. In 1758 there was a very epidemic ſtate of the Meaſles at <hi>Lauſanne,</hi> which affected great Numbers: Almoſt all who had it, and who were not very carefully and judiciouſly attended, were ſeized in Conſequence of it with that Cough, which proved very violent and obſtinate.</p>
               <p>§ 224. However, notwithſtanding this be the frequent Progreſs and Conſequence of this Diſeaſe, when left entirely to itſelf, or erroneouſly treated, and more particularly when treated with a hot Regimen; yet when proper Care was taken to moderate the Fever at the Beginning, to dilute, and to keep up the Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch unhappy Conſequences have been very rare.</p>
               <p>§ 225. The proper Method of conducting this Diſtemper is much the ſame with that of the Small-Pocks.</p>
               <p>1, If the Fever be high, the Pulſe hard, the Load and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion heavy, and all the Symptoms violent, the Patient muſt be bled once or twice.</p>
               <p>2, His Legs muſt be bathed, and he muſt take ſome Glyſters: the Vehemence of the Symptoms muſt regulate the Number of each.</p>
               <p>3, The Ptiſans No. 3 or 4 muſt be taken, or a Tea of Elder and Lime-tree flowers, to which a fifth Part Milk may be added.</p>
               <p>4, The Vapour, the Steam of warm Water ſhould alſo be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as very conducive to aſſwage the Cough, the Soreneſs of the Throat, and the Oppreſſion the Patient labours under.</p>
               <p>5, As ſoon as the Effloreſcence, the Redneſs, becomes pale, the Patient is to be purged with the Draught No. 23.</p>
               <p>6, He is ſtill to be kept ſtrictly to his Regimen, for two Days
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012243_0141_0F8A6B0E1F8F4CC8"/>
after this Purge; after which he is to be put upon the Diet of thoſe who are in a State of Recovery.</p>
               <p>7, If during the Eruption ſuch Symptoms ſupervene as occur [at the ſame Term] in the Small-Pocks, they are to be treated in the Manner already directed there.</p>
               <p>§ 226. Whenever this Method has not been obſerved, and the Accidents deſcribed § 223 ſupervene, the Diſtemper muſt be treated like an Inflammation in its firſt State, and all muſt be done as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected § 225. If the Diſeaſe is not vehement, <note n="†" place="bottom">Our Author very prudently limits this Diſcharge, and the Repetition of it, in this Diſeaſe (§ 225) as an erroneous Exceſs of it has ſometimes prevailed. I have ſeen a very epidemical Seaſon of the Meaſles, where Bleeding was not indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in one third of the infected. And yet I have known ſuch an Abuſe of Bleeding in it, that being repeated more than once in a Caſe before Eruption (the Meaſles probably not being ſuſpected) the Eruption was retarded ſeveral Days; and the Patient, a young Lady of Condition, remained exceeding low, faint, and ſickiſh; 'till after recruiting a very little, the Meaſles appeared, and ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. In a Youth of a lax Fibre, where the Meaſles had appeared, a ſeventh or eighth Bleeding was ordered on a Stitch in the Side, ſupervening from their too early Diſappearance, and the Caſe ſeemed very doubtful. But Nature conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued very obſtinately favourable in this Youth, who at length, though very ſlowly, recovered. His Circulation remained ſo languid, his Strength, with his Juices, ſo exhauſted, that he was many Weeks before he could ſit upright in a Chair; being obliged to make Uſe of a Cord depending from the Ceiling, to raiſe himſelf erectly in his Seat. Theſe certain Inſtances of the Abuſe of Bleeding in this Diſeaſe, are nevertheleſs by no Means intended to prohibit the Uſe of it, when clearly indicated, as it often is. The medical Reader may ſee Dr. MEAD's rational Sentiments on this Head, in his Book <hi>De variol. et morbil.</hi> from P. 94 to 95.</note> Bleeding may be omitted. If it is of ſome ſtanding in groſs Children, loaded with Humours, inactive, and pale, we muſt add to the Medicines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preſcribed the Potion No. 8, and Bliſters to the Legs.</p>
               <p>§ 227. It often happens from the Diſtance of proper Advice, that the Relics, the Dregs as it were, of the Diſeaſe have been too little regarded, eſpecially the Cough; in which Circumſtance it forms a real Suppuration in the Lungs, attended with a ſlow Fever. I have ſeen many Children in Country Villages deſtroyed by this Neglect. Their Caſe is then of the ſame Nature with that deſcribed § 68 and 82, and terminates in the ſame Manner in a Looſeneſs, (attended with very little Pain) and ſometimes a very foetid one, which carries off the Patient. In ſuch Caſes we muſt recur to the Remedies preſcribed § 74, Article 3, 4, 5; to the Powder No. 14; and to Milk and Exerciſe. But it is ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to make Children take the Powder, that it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary to truſt to the Milk without it, which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen in ſuch Situations accompliſh a very difficult Cure. I muſt adviſe the Reader at the ſame time, that it has not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat an Effect, as when it is taken ſolely, unjoined by any other Aliment; and that it is of the laſt Importance not to join it with any, which has the leaſt Acidity or Sharpneſs.

               <p>§ 228. Sometimes there remains, after the Courſe of the Meaſles, a ſtrong dry Cough, with great Heat in the Breaſt, and throughout the whole Body, with Thirſt, an exceſſive Dryneſs of the Tongue, and of the whole Surface of the Body. I have cured Perſons thus indiſpoſed after this Diſtemper, by making them breathe in the Vapour of warm Water; by the repeated Uſe of warm Baths; and by allowing them to take nothing for ſeveral Days but Water and Milk.</p>
               <p>Before I take leave of this Subject, I aſſure the Reader again, that the contagious Cauſe of the Meaſles is of an extremely ſharp and acrid Nature. It appears to have ſome Reſemblance to the bilious Humour, which produces the <hi>Eriſipelas,</hi> or St. Anthony's Fire; and thence it demands our particular Attention and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; without which very troubleſome and dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may be apprehended. I have ſeen, not long ſince, a young Girl, who was in a very languid State after the Meaſles, which ſhe had undergone three Years before: It was at length attended with an Ulceration in her Neck, which was cured, and her Health finally reſtored by <hi>Sarſaparilla</hi> with Milk and Water.</p>
               <p>§ 229. The Meaſles have been communicated by <note n="†" place="bottom">The only Account I have read of this Practice, is in the learned Dr. HOME's <hi>Medical Facts and Experiments,</hi> publiſhed in 1759, which admits, that but nine out of fifteen of the Subjects of this Practice took. Cotton dipt in the Blood of a Patient in the Meaſles was inſerted into the Arms of twelve; and three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Cotton into their Noſtrils, after the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Manner of infuſing the Small-Pocks; but of theſe laſt not one took, and one of thoſe who had taken, had the Meaſles again two Months after. I think the ſharp hot Lymph diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the inflamed Eyes of Perſons in this Diſeaſe, a likelier Vehicle to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it than the Blood, eſpecially the dry Blood, which was ſometimes tried; ſince the human <hi>Serum</hi> ſeems the Fluid more particularly affected by it; and this muſt have been evaporated, when the Blood grew dry. A few practical Stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on this Work, and particularly on this Practice deſcribed in it, appeared in the Monthly Review, Vol. XXI. P. 68 to 75. One Dr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> who treats the Public ſometimes, with a few medical Crumbs in the News-Papers, has aſſumed (without the leaſt Reference or Acknowledgement) this Notion of inoculating the Meaſles from the watery Diſcharge by the Eyes in it. Of this however, of whatever Conſequence it may prove, I was certainly the firſt Propoſer, though I have never made any Experiment of its Event; but only mentioned it to my Lord HOME, who aſſured me he would communicate it to Dr. HOME. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> Inoculation in ſome Countries, where it is of a very malignant Diſpoſition; and that Method might alſo be very advantageous in this Diſeaſe. But what we have already obſerved, with Reſpect to the Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Small-Pocks, <hi>viz.</hi> That it cannot be extended to the general Benefit of the People, without the Foundation of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals for that very Purpoſe, is equally applicable to the Inoculation of the Meaſles.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV. Of the ardent or burning Fever.</head>
               <p>SECT. 230. THE much greater Number of the Diſeaſes I have hitherto conſidered, reſult from an Inflammation of the Blood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the particular Inflammation of ſome Part; or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſome Contagion or Poiſon, which muſt be evacuated. But when the Blood is ſolely and ſtrongly inflamed, without an Attack on any particular Part, this Fever, which we term hot or burning, is the Conſequence.</p>
               <p>§ 231. The Signs which make it evident are, a Hardneſs and Fulneſs of the Pulſe in a higher Degree than happens in any other Malady; an exceſſive Heat; great Thirſt; with an extraordinary Dryneſs of the Eyes, Noſtrils, Lips, of the Tongue, and of the Throat; a violent Head-ach; and ſometimes a Raving at the Height of the Paroxyſm, or Increaſe of the Fever, which riſes conſiderably every Evening. The Reſpiration is alſo ſomewhat oppreſſed, but eſpecially at the Return of this Paroxyſm, with a Cough now and then: though without any Pain in the Breaſt, and without any Expectoration, or coughing up. The Body is coſtive; the Urine very high coloured, hot, and in a ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, The Sick are alſo liable to ſtart ſometimes, but eſpecially when they ſeem to ſleep; for they have little ſound refreſhing Sleep, but rather a kind of Drowſineſs, that makes them very little attentive to, or ſenſible of, whatever happens about them, or even of their own Condition. They have ſometimes a little Sweat or Moiſture; though commonly a very dry Skin; they are manifeſtly weak, and have either little or no Smell or Taſt.</p>
               <p>§ 232. This Diſeaſe, like all other inflammatory ones, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Cauſes which thicken the Blood, and increaſe its Motion; ſuch as exceſſive Labour, violent Heat, Want of Sleep, the Abuſe of Wine or other ſtrong Liquors; the long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a dry Conſtitution of the Air, Exceſs of every Kind, and heating inflaming Food.</p>
               <p>§ 233. The Patient, under theſe Circumſtances, ought, 1, immediately to be put upon a Regimen; to have the Food al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him given only every eight Hours, and, in ſome Caſes only twice a Day: and indeed, when the Attack is extremely violent, Nouriſhment may be wholly omitted.</p>
               <p>2, Bleeding ſhould be performed and repeated, 'till the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pulſe is ſenſibly abated. The firſt Diſcharge ſhould be conſiderable, the ſecond ſhould be made four Hours after. If
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012243_0144_0F8A6B10100A4320"/>
the Pulſe is ſoftened by the firſt, the ſecond may be ſuſpended, and not repeated before it becomes ſufficiently hard again to make us apprehenſive of Danger; but ſhould it continue ſtrong and hard, the Bleeding may be repeated on the ſame Day to a third Time, which often happens to be the utmoſt Repetition that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>3, The Glyſter No. 5, ſhould be given twice, or even thrice, daily.</p>
               <p>4, His Legs are to be bathed twice a Day in warm Water: his Hands may be bathed in the ſame Water. Linen or Flanel Cloths dipt in warm Water may be applied over the Breaſt, and upon the Belly; and he ſhould regularly drink the Almond Milk No. 4 and the Ptiſan No. 7. The pooreſt Patients may content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the laſt, but ſhould drink very plentifully of it; and after the Bleeding properly repeated, freſh Air and the plentiful Continuance of ſmall diluting Liquors generally eſtabliſh the Health of the Patient.</p>
               <p>5, If, notwithſtanding the repeated Bleedings, the Fever ſtill rages highly, it may be leſſened by giving a Spoonful of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 10 every Hour 'till it abates; and afterwards every three Hours, untill it becomes very moderate.</p>
               <p>§ 234. Haemorrhages, or Bleedings from the Noſe frequently occur in this Fever, greatly to the Relief and Security of the Patient.</p>
               <p>The firſt Appearances of Amendment are a ſoftening of the Pulſe, (which however does not wholly loſe all its Hardneſs, before the Diſeaſe entirely terminates) a ſenſible Abatement of the Head-ach; a greater Quantity of Urine, and that leſs high coloured; and a manifeſtly approaching Moiſture of the Tongue. Theſe favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Signs keep increaſing in their Degree, and there frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, between the ninth and the fourteenth Day, and often after a Flurry of ſome Hours Continuance, very large Evacuations by Stool; a great Quantity of Urine, which lets fall a palely reddiſh Sediment, the Urine above it being very clear, and of a natural Colour; and theſe accompanied with Sweats in a leſs or greater Quantity. At the ſame Time the Noſtrils and the Mouth grow moiſt: the brown and dry Cruſt which covered the Tongue, and which was hitherto inſeparable from it, peels off of itſelf; the Thirſt is diminiſhed; the Clearneſs of the Faculties riſes; the Drowſineſs goes off, it is ſucceeded by comfortable Sleep, and the natural Strength is reſtored. When Things are evidently in this Way, the Patient ſhould take the Potion No. 23, and be put upon the Regimen of thoſe who are in a State of Recovery. It ſhould be repeated at the End of eight or ten Days. Some Patients have perfectly recovered from this Fever, without the leaſt Sediment jn their Urine.</p>
               <p>§ 235. The augmenting Danger of this Fever may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the continued Hardneſs of the Pulſe, though with an Abatement of its Strength; if the Brain becomes more confuſed;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012243_0145_0F8A6B10EAC1EC40"/>
the Breathing more difficult; if the Eyes, Noſe, Lips, and Tongue become ſtill more dry, and the Voice more altered. If to theſe Symptoms there be alſo added a Swelling of the Belly; a Diminution of the Quantity of Urine; a conſtant Raving; great Anxiety, and a certain Wildneſs of the Eyes, the Caſe is in a manner deſperate; and the Patient cannot ſurvive many Hours. The Hands and Fingers at this Period are inceſſantly in Motion, as if feeling for ſomething upon the Bed-cloths, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly termed, their hunting for Flies.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI. Of putrid Fevers.</head>
               <p>SECT. 236. HAVING treated of ſuch feveriſh Diſtempers as ariſe from an Inflammation of the Blood, I ſhall here treat of thoſe produced by corrupt Humours, which ſtagnate in the Stomach, the Guts, or other Bowels of the lower Cavity, the Belly; or which have already paſſed from them into the Blood. Theſe are called putrid Fevers, or ſometimes bilious Fevers, when a certain Degeneracy or Corruption of the Bile ſeems chiefly to prevail in the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>§ 237. This Diſtemper frequently gives Notice of its Approach, ſeveral Days before its manifeſt Attack; by a great Dejection, a Heavineſs of the Head; Pains of the Loins and Knees; a Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Mouth in the Morning; little Appetite; broken Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and ſometimes by an exceſſive Head-ach for many Days, without any other Symptom. After this, or theſe Diſorders, a Shivering comes on, followed by a ſharp and dry Heat: the Pulſe, which was ſmall and quick during the Shivering, is raiſed during the Heat, and is often very ſtrong, though it is not attended with the ſame Hardneſs, as in the preceding Fever; except the putrid Fever be combined with an inflammatory one, which it ſometimes is. During this Time, that is the Duration of the Heat, the Head-ach is commonly extremely violent; the Patient is almoſt conſtantly affected with Loathings, and ſometimes even with Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting; with Thirſt, diſagreeable Riſings, a Bitterneſs in the Mouth; and very little Urine. This Heat continues for many Hours, frequently the whole Night; it abates a little in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Pulſe, though always feveriſh, is then ſomething leſs ſo, while the Patient ſuffers leſs, though ſtill greatly dejected.</p>
               <p>The Tongue is white and furred, the Teeth are foul, and the Breath ſmells very diſagreeably. The Colour, Quantity and Conſiſtence of the Urine, are very various and changeable. Some
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012243_0146_0F8DFBD126583D08"/>
Patients are coſtive, others frequently have ſmall Stools, without the leaſt Relief accruing from them. The Skin is ſometimes dry, and at other times there is ſome ſenſible Perſpiration, but without any Benefit attending it. The Fever augments every Day, and frequently at unexpected irregular Periods. Beſides that <hi>great</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm or Increaſe, which is perceivable in all the Subjects of this Fever, ſome have alſo other <hi>leſs</hi> intervening ones.</p>
               <p>§ 238. When the Diſeaſe is left to itſelf, or injudiciouſly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or when it proves more powerful than the Remedies againſt it, which is by no Means ſeldom the Caſe, the Aggravations of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come longer, more frequent and irregular. There is ſcarcely an Interval of Eaſe. The Patient's Belly is ſwelled out like a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball: a <hi>Delirium</hi> or Raving comes on; he proves inſenſible of his own Evacuations, which come away involuntarily; he rejects Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and keeps muttering continually, with a quick, ſmall, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Pulſe. Sometimes little Spots of a brown, or of a livid Colour appear on the Surface, but particularly about the Neck, Back and Breaſt. All the Diſcharges from his Body have a moſt foetid Smell: convulſive Motions alſo ſupervene, eſpecially in the Face; he lies down only on his Back, ſinks down inſenſibly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Feet of the Bed, and picks about, as if catching Flies; his Pulſe becomes ſo quick and ſo ſmall, that it cannot be perceived without Difficulty, and cannot be counted. His Anguiſh ſeems inexpreſſible: His Sweats ſtream down from Agony: his Breaſt ſwells out as if diſtended by Fullneſs, and he dies miſerably.</p>
               <p>§ 239. When this Diſtemper is leſs violent, or more judiciouſly treated, and the Medicines ſucceed well, it continues for ſome Days in the State deſcribed § 237, without growing worſe, though without abating, None of theſe Symptoms however appear, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed § 238; but, on the contrary, all the Symptoms become milder, the Paroxyſms, or Aggravations, are ſhorter and leſs violent, the Head-ach more ſupportable; the Diſcharges by Stool are leſs frequent, but more at once, and attended with Relief to the Patient. The Quantity of Urine is very conſiderable, though it varies at different Times in Colour and Conſiſtence, as before. The Patient ſoon begins to get a little Sleep, and grows more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and eaſy. The Tongue diſengages itſelf from its Filth and Furrineſs, and Health gradually, yet daily, advances.</p>
               <p>§ 240. This Fever ſeems to have no critical Time, either for its Termination in Recovery, or in Death. When it is very violent, or very badly conducted, it proves ſometimes fatal on the ninth Day. Perſons often die of it from the eighteenth to the twentieth; ſometimes only about the fortieth; after having been alternately better and worſe.</p>
               <p>When it happens but in a light Degree, it is ſometimes cured within a few Days, after the earlieſt Evacuations. When it is of a very different Character, ſome Patients are not out of Danger before the End of ſix Weeks, and even ſtill later. Nevertheleſs it is certain that theſe Fevers, extended to this Length of Duration,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012243_0147_0F8DFBD5B1DBBF88"/>
often depend in a great Meaſure on the Manner of treating them; and that in general their Courſe muſt be determined, ſome time from the fourteenth to the thirtieth Day.</p>
               <p>§ 241. The Treatment of this Species of Fevers is comprized in the following Method and Medicines.</p>
               <p>1, The Patient muſt be put into a Regimen; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is far from coſtive, and ſometimes has even a ſmall Purging, he ſhould receive one Glyſter daily. His common Drink ſhould be Lemonade, (which is made of the Juice of Lemons. Sugar and Water) or the Ptiſan No. 3. Inſtead of Juice of Lemons, Vinegar may be occaſionally ſubſtituted, which, with Sugar and Water, makes an agreeable and very wholeſome Drink in theſe Fevers.</p>
               <p>2, If there be an Inflammation alſo, which may be diſcovered by the Strength and the Hardneſs of the Pulſe, and by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and Complexion of the Patient; if he is naturally ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, and has heated himſelf by any of the Cauſes deſcribed, § 232, he ſhould be bled once, and even a ſecond time, if neceſſary, ſome Hours after. I muſt obſerve, however, that very frequently there is no ſuch Inflammation, and that in ſuch a Caſe Bleeding would be hurtful.</p>
               <p>3, When the Patient has drank very plentifully for two Days of theſe Liquids, if his Mouth ſtill continues in a very foul State, and he has violent Reachings to vomit, he muſt take the Powder No. 34, diſſolved in half a <note n="†" place="bottom">That is about two Ounces more than a Pint and half of our Meaſure.</note> Pot of warm Water; a <note n="*" place="bottom">About three Ounces.</note> Glaſs of it being to be drank every half Quarter of an Hour. But as this Medicine vomits, it muſt not be taken, except we are certain the Patient is not under any Circumſtance which forbids the Uſe of a Vomit: all which Circumſtances ſhall be particularly mentioned in the Chapter, reſpecting the Uſe of ſuch Medicines, as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of Precaution, or Prevention. If the firſt Glaſſes excite a plentiful Vomiting, we muſt forbear giving another, and be content with obliging the Patient to drink a conſiderable Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of warm Water. But if the former Glaſſes do not occaſion Vomiting, they muſt be repeated, as already directed until they do. Thoſe who are afraid of taking this Medicine, which is uſually called the Emetic, may take that of No. 35, alſo drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warm Water plentifully during its Operation; but the former is preferable, as more prevalent, in dangerous Caſes. We muſt caution our Readers at the ſame time, that wherever there is an Inflammation of any Part, neither of theſe Medicines muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which might prove a real Poiſon in ſuch a Circumſtance; and even if the Fever is extremely violent, though there ſhould be no particular Inflammation, they ſhould not be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:012243_0148_0F8DFBD694896E58"/>The Time of giving them is ſoon after the End of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm, when the Fever is at the loweſt. The Medicine No. 34 generally purges, after it ceaſes to make the Patient vomit: But No. 35 is ſeldom attended with the ſame Effect.</p>
               <p>When the Operation of the Vomit is entirely over, the Sick ſhould return to the Uſe of the Ptiſan; and great Care muſt be taken to prohibit them from the Uſe of Fleſh Broth, under the Pretext of working off a Purging with it. The ſame Method is to be continued on the following Days as on the firſt; but as it is of Importance to keep the Body open, he ſhould take every Morning ſome of the Ptiſan No. 32. Such, as this would be too expenſive for, may ſubſtitute, in the room of it, a fourth Part of the Powder No. 34, that is, one Grain and a half of Tartar emetic, in five or ſix Glaſſes of Water, of which they are to take a Cup every two Hours, beginning early in the Morning. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if the Fever be very high, No. 32 ſhould be preferred to it.</p>
               <p>4, After the Operation of the Vomit if the Fever ſtill continue, if the Stools are remarkably foetid; and if the Belly is tenſe and diſtended as it were, and the Quantity of Urine is ſmall, a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Potion No. 10 ſhould be given every two Hours which checks the Putridity, and abates the Fever. Should the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per become violent, and very preſſing, it ought to be taken every Hour.</p>
               <p>5, Whenever, notwithſtanding the giving all theſe Medicines as directed, the Fever continues obſtinate; the Brain is manifeſtly diſordered; there is a violent Head-ach, or very great Reſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, two bliſtering Plaiſters No. 36 muſt be applied to the inſide and fleſhy Part of the Legs, and their Suppuration and Diſcharge ſhould be continued as long as poſſible.</p>
               <p>6, If the Fever is extremely violent indeed, there is a Neceſſity abſolutely to prohibit the Patient from receiving the leaſt Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>7, When it is thought improper, or unſafe, to give the Vomit, the Patient ſhould take in the Morning, for two ſucceſſive Days, three Doſes of the Powder No. 24, at the Interval of one Hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each: This Medicine produces ſome bilious Stools, which greatly abate the Fever, and conſiderably leſſen the Violence of all the other Symptoms of the Diſeaſe. This may be done with Succeſs, when the exceſſive Height of the Fever prevents us from giving the Vomit: and we ſhould limit ourſelves to this Medicine, as often as we are uncertain, whether the Circumſtances of the Diſeaſe and the Patient will admit of the Vomiting; which may alſo be diſpenſed with, in many Caſes.</p>
               <p>8, When the Diſtemper has manifeſtly and conſiderably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, the Paroxyſms are more ſlight; and the Patient continues without any Fever for ſeveral Hours, the daily Uſe of the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opening Drinks ſhould be diſcontinued. The common Ptiſans however ſhould be ſtill made uſe of; and it will be proper to give
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012243_0149_0F8DFBD745FA51B8"/>
every other Day two Doſes of the Powder No. 24, which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obviates every ill Conſequence from this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>9, If the Fever has been clearly off for a long Part of the Day; if the Tongue appears in a good healthy State; if the Patient has been well purged; and yet one moderate Paroxyſm of the Fever returns every Day, he ſhould take four Doſes <note n="†" place="bottom">As theſe contain but half a Drachm of the Bark, the Quantity of each Doſe might be doubled in large adult Perſons: thoſe who were younger and ſmall, might take two Scruples for each Doſe in the Intervals; and half a Drachm might ſuffice for all from nine or ten Years to fourteen or fifteen. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if the Paroxyſms have been gentle and regular, there is no Doubt but the Doſe directed by Dr. TISSOT might have a very good Effect; the Severity of the Fits and Symptoms requiring the largeſt Quantities of the Bark, to be given during the Intermiſſion. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> of the Powder No. 14, between the End of one Return and the Beginning of the next, and continue this Repetition ſome Days. People who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily procure this Medicine, may ſubſtitute, inſtead of it, the bitter Decoction, No. 37, four Glaſſes of which may be taken at equal Intervals, between the two Paroxyſms or Returns of the Fever.</p>
               <p>10. As the Organs of Digeſtion have been conſiderably wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened through the Courſe of this Fever, there is a Neceſſity for the Patient's conducting himſelf very prudently and regularly long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, with Regard both to the Quantity and Quality of his Food. He ſhould alſo uſe due Exerciſe, as ſoon as his Strength will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; without which he may be liable to fall into ſome chronical and languiſhing Diſorder, productive of conſiderable Langour and Weakneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">As our Jail, Hoſpital, Camp, and often Ship Fevers may generally be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this Claſs, as of the moſt putrid Kind, and not ſeldom occaſioned by bad Food, bad Air, unclean unwholeſome Lodging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a judicious Uſe may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be made of a ſmall Quantity of genuine, and not ungenerous Wine in ſuch of them, as are not blended with an inflammatory Cauſe, or inflammable Conſtitution, or which do not greatly reſult from a bilious Cauſe; though in theſe laſt, where there is manifeſt Lowneſs and Dejection, perhaps a little Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh might be properly interpoſed between the Lemonade and other Drinks di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected § 241. Doubtleſs Dr. TISSOT was perfectly apprized of this ſalutary Uſe of it in ſome low Fevers; but the Neceſſity of its being regulated by the Preſence of a Phyſician has probably diſpoſed him rather to omit mentioning it, than to leave the Allowance of it to the Diſcretion of a ſimple Country Patient, or his ignorant Aſſiſtants. Wine, we know, was not the ſmalleſt Article in the Practice of Hippocrates, even in ſome feveriſh Diſorders; and, indeed, when greatly diluted, it becomes manifeſtly acetous (acid) and may be ſo managed, as to prove attemperating, if not even cooling. But what makes ſtill more for the prudent Exhibition of Wine, in this kind of Fevers, is the Experience of Dr. de Monchy, in his Account of Diſeaſes occurring in Voyages to the Weſt Indies; who aſſures us, that in the Treatment of a putrid Fever, on a Voyage to South America, he found a well regulated Uſe, even of undiluted Wine, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients greatly coveted, very conducive to their Cure. All who have peruſed the ingenious Dr. Pringle's Account of Camp Fevers, muſt be abundantly convinced of the frequent Utility of Wine in them. <hi>K.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII. Of malignant Fevers.</head>
               <p>SECT. 242. THOSE Fevers are termed malignant, in which the Danger is more than the Symptoms would make us apprehenſive of: they have frequently a fatal Event, without appearing ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perilous; on which Account it has been well ſaid of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that it is a Dog which bites without barking.</p>
               <p>§ 243, The diſtinguiſhing <hi>Criterion</hi> or Mark of malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is a total Loſs of the Patient's Strength, immediately on their firſt Attack. They ariſe from a Corruption of the Humours, which is noxious to the very Source and Principle of Strength, the Impairing or Deſtruction of which is the Cauſe of the Feebleneſs of the Symptoms; by Reaſon none of the Organs are ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to exert an Oppoſition ſufficiently vigorous, to ſubdue the Cauſe of the Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>If, for Inſtance or Illuſtration, we were to ſuppoſe, that when two Armies were on the Point of engaging, one of them ſhould be nearly deprived of all their Weapons, the Conteſt would not appear very violent, nor attended with great Noiſe or Tumult, though with a horrible Maſſacre. The Spectator (who, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the Diſarmament of one Army,) would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to calculate the Carnage of the Battle, but in Proportion to its Noiſe and Tumult, muſt be extremely deceived in his Conception of it. The Number of the Slain would be aſtoniſhing, which might have been much leſs (though the Noiſe and Clangor of it had been greater) if each Army had been equally provided for the Combat.</p>
               <p>§ 244. The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are a long Uſe of animal Food or Fleſh alone, without Puls, Fruits or Acids; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Uſe of other bad Proviſions, ſuch as Bread made of damaged Corn or Grain, or very ſtale Meat. Eight Perſons who dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on corrupt Fiſh, were all ſeized with a malignant Fever, which killed five of them, notwithſtanding the Endeavours of the moſt able Phyſicians. Theſe Fevers are alſo frequently the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a great Dearth or Famine; of too hot and moiſt an Air, or an Air, which highly partakes of theſe two Qualities; ſo that they happen to ſpread moſt in hot Years, in Places abounding with Marſhes and ſtanding Waters. They are alſo the Effects of a very cloſe and ſtagnant Air, eſpecially if many Perſons are crouded together in it, this being a Cauſe that particularly tends to corrupt the Air. Tedious Grief and Vexation alſo contribute to generate theſe Fevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:012243_0151_0F8DFBD8B3B021C8"/>§ 245. The Symptoms of malignant Fevers are, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, a total and ſudden Loſs of Strength, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evident preceding Cauſe, ſufficient to procure ſuch a Loſs of it. At the ſame time there is alſo an utter Dejection of the Mind, which becomes almoſt inſenſible and inattentive to every thing, and even to the Diſeaſe itſelf; a ſudden Alteration in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, eſpecially in the Eyes; ſome ſmall Shiverings, which are varied throughout the Space of twenty-four Hours, with little Paroxyſms or Viciſſitudes of Heat; ſometimes there is a great Head-ach and a Pain in the Loins; at other Times there is no perceivable Pain in any Part; a kind of Sinkings or Faintings, immediately from the Invaſion of the Diſeaſe, which is always very unpromiſing; not the leaſt refreſhing Sleep; frequently a kind of half Sleep, or Drowſineſs; a light and ſilent or inward Raving, which diſcovers itſelf in the unuſual and aſtoniſhed Look of the Patient, who ſeems profoundly employed in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on ſomething, but really thinks of nothing, or not at all: Some Patients have, however, violent Ravings; moſt have a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Weight or Oppreſſion, and at other times of a Binding or Tightneſs about, or around, the Pit of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The ſick Perſon ſeems to labour under great Anguiſh: he has ſometimes ſlight convulſive Motions and Twitchings in his Face and his Hands, as well as in his Arms and Legs. His Senſes ſeem torpid, or as it were benumbed. I have ſeen many who had loſt, to all Appearance, the whole five, and yet ſome of them have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. It is not uncommon to meet with ſome, who neither ſee, underſtand, nor ſpeak. Their Voices change, become weak, and are ſometimes quite loſt. Some of them have a fixed Pain in ſome Part of the Belly: this ariſes from a Stuffing or Obſtruction, and often ends in a Gangrene, whence this Symptom is highly dangerous and perplexing.</p>
               <p>The Tongue is ſometimes very little altered from its Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Health; at other times it is covered over with a yellowiſh brown Humour; but it is more rarely dry in this Fever than in the others; and yet it ſometimes does reſemble a Tongue that has been long ſmoaked.</p>
               <p>The Belly is ſometimes very ſoft, and at other Times tenſe and hard. The Pulſe is weak, ſometimes pretty regular, but always more quick than in a natural State, and at ſometimes even very quick; and ſuch I have always found it, when the Belly has been diſtended.</p>
               <p>The Skin is often neither hot, dry, nor moiſt: it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overſpread with petechial or eruptive Spots (which are little Spots of a reddiſh livid Colour) eſpecially on the Neck, about the Shoulders, and upon the Back. At other times the Spots are larger and brown, like the Colour of Wheals from the Strokes of a Stick.</p>
               <p>The Urine of the Sick is almoſt conſtantly crude, that is of a lighter Colour than ordinary. I have ſeen ſome, which could
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012243_0152_0F8DFBD9695FDBA0"/>
not be diſtinguiſhed, merely by the Eye, from Milk. A black and ſtinking Purging ſometimes attends this Fever, which is mortal, except the Sick be evidently relieved by the Diſcharge.</p>
               <p>Some of the Patients are infeſted with livid Ulcers on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Mouth, and on the Palate. At other times Abſceſſes are formed in the Glands of the Groin, of the Arm-pit, in thoſe between the Ears and the Jaw; or a Gangrene may appear in ſome Part, as on the Feet, the Hands, or the Back. The Strength proves entirely ſpent, the Brain is wholly confuſed: the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patient, ſtretched out on his Back, frequently expires under Convulſions, an enormous Sweat, and an oppreſſed Breaſt and Reſpiration. Haemorrhages alſo happen ſometimes and are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, being almoſt unexceptionably ſuch in this Fever. There is alſo in this, as in all other Fevers, an Aggravation of the Fever in the Evening.</p>
               <p>§ 246. The Duration and <hi>Criſis</hi> of theſe malignant, as well as thoſe of putrid Fevers, are very irregular. Sometimes the Sick die on the ſeventh or eighth Day, more commonly between the twelfth and the fifteenth, and not infrequently at the End of five or ſix Weeks. Theſe different Durations reſult from the different Degree and Strength of the Diſeaſe. Some of theſe Fevers at their firſt Invaſion are very ſlow; and during a few of the firſt Days, the Patient, though very weak, and with a plainly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Look and Manner, ſcarcely thinks himſelf ſick.</p>
               <p>The Term or Period of the Cure or the Recovery, is as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as that of Death, in this Diſtemper. Some are out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the End of fifteen Days, and even ſooner; others not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Expiration of ſeveral Weeks.</p>
               <p>The Signs which portend a Recovery are, a little more Strength in the Pulſe; a more concocted Urine; leſs Dejection and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; a leſs confuſed Brain; an equal kindly Heat; a pretty warm or hot Sweat in a moderate Quantity, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude or Anguiſh; the Revival of the different Senſes that were extinguiſhed, or greatly ſuſpended, in the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe; though the Deafneſs is not a very threatening Symptom, if the others amend while it continues.</p>
               <p>This Malady commonly leaves the Patient in a very weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and a long Interval will enſue between the End of it, and their recovering their full Strength.</p>
               <p>§ 247. It is, in the firſt place, of greater Importance in this Diſtemper than in any other, both for the Benefit of the Patients, and thoſe who attend them, that the Air ſhould be renewed and purified. Vinegar ſhould often be evaporated from a hot Tile or Iron in the Chamber, and one Window kept almoſt conſtantly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>2, The Diet ſhould be light; and the Juice of Sorrel may be mixed with their Water; the Juice of Lemons may be added to Soups prepared from different Grains and Puls; the Patient may
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012243_0153_0F8DFBDA38F7E0A8"/>
eat ſharp acid Fruits, ſuch as tart juicy <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>French</hi> Word is <hi>Griottes,</hi> which <hi>Boyer</hi> engliſhes, <hi>the Agriot the red or ſour Cherry</hi>; and <hi>Chambaud. the ſweeter large black Cherry or Mazzard</hi>—But as Dr. TISSOT was recommending the Uſe of Acids, it is more probably the firſt of theſe: ſo that our Morellas, which make a pleaſant Preſerve, may be a good Subſtitute to them, ſuppoſing them not to be the ſame. Our Berbery Jam, and Jelly of Red Currants, may be alſo employed to anſwer the ſame Indication. The <hi>French</hi> Word <hi>Griotte</hi> is probably derived from the <hi>Latin</hi> Word <hi>agreſtis,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>wild,</hi> which theſe Cherries may be in ſome Part of <hi>France</hi>; all vegetable Productions being ſo in ſome Place or other. Thus Peaches are ſaid to be wild, or native, in <hi>Perſia,</hi> Shallots are found wild in <hi>Carolina,</hi> and Parſley in <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das. K.</hi>
                  </note> Cherries, Gooſeberries, ſmall black Cherries; and thoſe who can afford them, may be allowed Lemons, Oranges, and Pomegranates.</p>
               <p>3, The Patient's Linen ſhould be changed every two Days.</p>
               <p>4, Bleeding is very rarely neceſſary, or even proper, in this Fever; the Exceptions to which are very few, and cannot be thoroughly aſcertained, as fit and proper Exceptions to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Bleeding, without a Phyſician, or ſome other very ſkilful Perſon's ſeeing the Patient.</p>
               <p>5, There is often very little Occaſion for Glyſters, which are ſometimes even dangerous in this Fever.</p>
               <p>6, The Patient's common Drink ſhould be Barley Water, made acid with the Spirit No. 10, at the Rate of one Quarter of an Ounce to at leaſt full three Pints of the Water, or acidulated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to his Taſt. He may alſo drink Lemonade.</p>
               <p>7, It is neceſſary to open and evacuate the Bowels, where a great Quantity of corrupt Humours is generally lodged. The Powder No. 35 may be given for this Purpoſe, after the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the Patient generally finds himſelf better, at leaſt for ſome Hours, It is of Importance not to omit this at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe; though if it has been omitted at firſt, it were beſt to give it even later, provided no particular Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſupervened, and the Patient has ſtill ſome Strength. I have given it, and with remarkable Succeſs, on the twentieth Day.</p>
               <p>8, Having by this Medicine expelled a conſiderable Portion of the bad Humours, which contribute to feed and keep up the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Patient ſhould take every other Day, during the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Diſeaſe, and ſometimes even every Day, one Doſe of the Cream of Tartar and Rhubarb No. 38. This Remedy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuates the corrupt Humours, prevents the Corruption of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; expells the Worms that are very common in theſe Fevers, which the Patient ſometimes diſcharges upwards and downwards; and which frequently conduce to many of the odd and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Symptoms, that are obſerved in malignant Fevers. In ſhort, it ſtrengthens the Bowels, and, without checking the neceſſary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, it moderates the Looſeneſs, when it is hurtful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:012243_0154_0F8DFBDAE8C5A328"/>9, If the Skin be dry, with a Looſeneſs, and that by check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we deſign to increaſe Perſpiration, inſtead of the Rhubarb, the Cream of Tartar may be blended with the Ipecacuana, No. 39, which, being given in ſmall and frequent Doſes, reſtrains the Purging, and promotes Perſpiration. This Medicine, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is to be taken in the Morning; two Hours after, the Sick muſt begin with the Potion, No. 40, and repeat it regularly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very three Hours; until it be interrupted by giving one of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines No. 38 or 39: After which the Potion is to be repeated again, as already directed, till the Patient grows conſiderably better.</p>
               <p>10, If the Strength of the Sick be very conſiderably depreſſed, and he is in great Dejection and Anguiſh, he ſhould take, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Draught of the Potion, the Bolus, or Morſel No. 41, If the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> the Purging is violent, there ſhould be added, once or twice a Day to the Bolus, the Weight of twenty Grains, or the Size of a very ſmall Bean, of <hi>Diaſcordium</hi>; or, if that is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to be got, as much Venice Treacle.</p>
               <p>11, Whenever, notwithſtanding all this Aſſiſtance, the Patient continues in a State of Weakneſs and Inſenſibility, two large Bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be applied to the fleſhy Inſides of the Legs, or a large one to the Nape of the Neck: and ſometimes, if there be a great Drowſineſs, with a manifeſt Embarraſſment of the Brain, they may be applied with great Succeſs over the whole Head. Their Suppuration and Diſcharge is to be promoted abundantly; and, if they dry up within a few Days, others are to be applied, and their Evacuation is to be kept up for a conſiderable Time.</p>
               <p>12, As ſoon as the Diſtemper is ſufficiently abated, for the Patient to remain ſome Hours with very little or no Fever, we muſt avail ourſelves of this Interval, to give him ſix, or at leaſt five <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note † to § 241. Art. 9.</note> Doſes of the Medicine No. 14, and repeat the ſame the next Day, which may prevent the Return of the Fever: <note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervation and Experience have demonſtrated the Advantage of the Bark, to obviate a Gangrene, and prevent the Putrefaction of animal Subſtances. We therefore conclude it may be uſefully employed in malignant Fevers, as ſoon as the previous and neceſſary Evacuations ſhall have taken Place. <hi>E. L.</hi>—Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there be very clear and regular <hi>Remiſſions</hi> at leaſt. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> after which it may be ſufficient to give daily only two Doſes for a few Days.</p>
               <p>13, When the Sick continue entirely clear of a Fever, or any Return, they are to be put into the Regimen of Perſons in a State of Recovery, But if his Strength returns very ſlowly, or not at all; in order to the ſpeedier Eſtabliſhment and Confirmation of it, he may take three Doſes a Day of the <hi>Theriaca Pauperum,</hi> or poor Man's Treacle No. 42, the firſt of them faſting, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twelve Hours after. It were to be wiſhed indeed, this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine was introduced into all the Apothecaries Shops, as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Stomachic, in which Reſpect it is much preferable to Venice Treacle, which is an abſurd Compoſition, dear, and often dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. It is true, it does not diſpoſe the Patients to Sleep; but when we would procure them Sleep, there are better Medicines than the Treacle to anſwer that Purpoſe. Such as may not think the Expence of the Medicine No. 14, too much, may take three Doſes of it daily for ſome Weeks, inſtead of the Medicine No. 42, already directed.</p>
               <p>§ 248. It is neceſſary to eradicate a Prejudice that prevails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Country People, with Regard to the Treatment of theſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; not only becauſe it is falſe and ridiculous, but even dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous too. They imagine that the Application of Animals can draw out the Poiſon of the Diſeaſe; in Conſequence of which they apply Poultry, or Pigeons, Cats, or ſucking Pigs to the Feet, or upon the Head of the Patient, having firſt ſplit the living Animals open. Some Hours after they remove their ſtrange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, corrupted, and ſtinking very offenſively; and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch Corruption and horrid Stink to the Poiſon they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Application to be charged with; and which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be the Cauſe of this Fever. But in this ſuppoſed Extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poiſon, they are groſly miſtaken, ſince the Fleſh does not ſtink in Conſequence of any ſuch Extraction, but from its being corrupted through Moiſture and Heat: and they contract no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Smell but what they would have got, if they had been put in any other Place, as well as on the Patient's Body, that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hot and moiſt. Very far from drawing out the Poiſon, they augment the Corruption of the Diſeaſe; and it would be ſufficient to communicate it to a ſound Perſon, if he was to ſuffer many of theſe animal Bodies, thus abſurdly and uſeleſsly butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be applied to various Parts of his Body in Bed; and to lie ſtill a long time with their putrified Carcaſes faſtened about him, and corrupting whatever Air he breathed there.</p>
               <p>With the ſame Intention they faſten a living Sheep to the Bed's-ſoot for ſeveral Hours: which, though not equally dangerous, is in ſome Meaſure hurtful; ſince the more Animals there are in a Chamber, the Air of it is proportionably corrupted, or alter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d at leaſt from its natural Simplicity, by their Reſpiration and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations; but admitting this to be leſs pernicious, it is equally abſurd. It is certain indeed the Animals, who are kept very near the ſick Perſon, breathe in the poiſonous, or noxious Vapours which exhale from his Body, and may be incommoded with them, as well as his Attendants: but it is ridiculous to ſuppoſe their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept near the Sick cauſes ſuch Poiſon to come out of their Bodies. On the very contrary, in contributing ſtill further to the Corruption of the Air, they increaſe the Diſeaſe. They draw a falſe Conſequence, and no Wonder, from a falſe Principle; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the Sheep dies the Sick will recover. Now, moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sheep does not die; notwithſtanding which the Sick ſometimes recover; and ſometimes they both die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:012243_0156_0F8DFBDD340565E8"/>§ 249. The Cauſe of malignant Fevers is, not infrequently, combined with other Diſeaſes, whoſe Danger it extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes. It is blended, for Inſtance, with the Poiſon of the Small-Pocks, or of the Meaſles. This may be known by the Union of thoſe Symptoms, which carry the Marks of Malignity, with the Symptoms of the other Diſeaſes. Such combined Caſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous; they demand the utmoſt Attention of the Phyſician; nor is it poſſible to preſcribe their exact Treatment here, ſince it conſiſts in general of a Mixture of the Treatment of each Diſeaſe; though the Malignity commonly demands the greateſt Attention.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII. Of intermitting Fevers.</head>
               <p>SECT. 250. INTERMITTING Fevers, commonly called here, Fevers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, are thoſe, which, after an Invaſion and Continuance for ſome Hours, abate very perceivably, as well as all the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms attending them, and then entirely ceaſe: nevertheleſs, not without ſome periodical or ſtated Return of them.</p>
               <p>They were very frequent with us ſome Years ſince; and indeed might even be called epidemical: but for the five or ſix laſt Years, they have been much leſs frequent throughout the greater Part of <hi>Swiſſerland</hi>: notwithſtanding they ſtill continue in no ſmall Number, wherever the Inhabitants breathe the Air that prevails in all the marſhy Borders of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and in ſome other Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are expoſed to much the ſame humid Air and Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>§ 251. There are ſeveral Kinds of intermitting Fevers, which take their different Names from the Interval, or different Space of time, in which the Fits return.</p>
               <p>If the Paroxyſm or Fit returns every Day, it is either a true Quotidian, or a double Tertian Fever: The firſt of theſe may be diſtinguiſhed from the laſt by this Circumſtance, that in the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, or one Day Fever, the Fits are long; and correſpond pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty regularly to each other in Degree and Duration. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is leſs frequent in <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi> In the double Tertian, the Fits are ſhorter, one being alternately light, and the other more ſevere.</p>
               <p>In the ſimple Tertian, or third Day's Fever, the Fits return e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Day; ſo that three Days include one Paroxyſm, and the Return of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:012243_0157_0F8DFBDDE63B2F88"/>In a Quartan, the Fit returns every fourth Day, including the Day of the firſt and that of the ſecond Attack: ſo that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient enjoys two clear Days between the two ſick ones.</p>
               <p>The other kinds of Intermittents are much rarer. I have ſeen however one true Quintan, or fifth Day Ague, the Patient hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three clear Days between two Fits; and one regularly weekly Ague, as it may be called, the Viſitation of every Return happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Sunday.</p>
               <p>§ 252. The firſt Attack of an intermittent Fever often happens, when the Patient thought himſelf in perfect Health. Sometimes however it is preceded by a Senſation of Cold, and a kind of Numbneſs, which continue ſome Days before the manifeſt Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It begins with frequent Yawnings, a Laſſitude, or Senſation of Wearineſs, with a general Weakneſs, with Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Shivering and Shaking: There is alſo a Paleneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Parts of the Body, attended with Loathings, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an actual Vomiting. The Pulſe is quick, weak, and ſmall, and there is a conſiderable Degree of Thirſt.</p>
               <p>At the End of an Hour or two, and but ſeldom ſo long as three or four Hours, a Heat ſucceeds, which increaſes inſenſibly, and becomes violent at its Height. At this Period the whole Body grows red, the Anxiety of the Patient abates; the Pulſe is very ſtrong and large, and his Thirſt proves exceſſive. He complains of a violent Head-ach, and of a Pain in all his Limbs; but of a different. Sort of Pain from that he was ſenſible of, while his Coldneſs continued. Finally, having endured this hot State, four, five, or ſix Hours, he falls into a general Sweat for a few more: upon which all the Symptoms already mentioned abate, and ſometimes Sleep ſupervenes.</p>
               <p>At the Concluſion of this Nap the Patient often wakes without any ſenſible Fever; Complaining only of Laſſitude and Weakneſs. Sometimes his Pulſe returns entirely to its natural State between the two Fits; though it often continues a little quicker than in perfect Health; and does not recover its firſt Diſtinctneſs and Slowneſs, till ſome Days after the laſt Fit.</p>
               <p>One Symptom, which moſt particularly characteriſes theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Species of intermitting Fevers, is the Quality of the Urines which the Sick paſs after the Fit. They are of a reddiſh Colour, and let fall a Sediment, or Settling, which exactly reſembles Brick-duſt. They are ſometimes frothy too, and a Pellicle, or very thin filmy Skin, appears on the Top, and adheres to the Sides of the Glaſs that contains them.</p>
               <p>§ 253. The Duration of each Fit is of no fixed Time or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, being various according to the particular ſort of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and through many other Circumſtances. Sometimes they return preciſely at the very ſame Hour; at other times they come one, two or three Hours ſooner; and in other Inſtances as much later than the former. It has been imagined that thoſe Fevers,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012243_0158_0F8DFBE22E9DA7A0"/>
whoſe Paroxyſms returned ſooner than uſual, were ſooner finally terminated: but there ſeems to be no general Rule in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>§ 254. Intermitting Fevers are diſtinguiſhed into thoſe of Spring and Autumn. The former generally prevail from Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to June: the latter are thoſe which reign from July to Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. Their eſſential Nature and Characters are the very ſame, as they are not different Diſtempers; though the various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending them deſerve our Conſideration. Theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances depend on the Seaſon itſelf, and the Conſtitution of the Patients, during ſuch Seaſon. The Spring Intermittents are ſometimes blended with an inflammatory Diſpoſition, that being the uſual Diſpoſition of Bodies in that Seaſon; but as the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then advances daily into an improving State, the Spring Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are commonly of a ſhorter Duration. The autumnal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are frequently combined and aggravated with a Principle of Putrefaction; and as the Air of that Seaſon rather degenerates, they are more tedious and obſtinate.</p>
               <p>§ 255. The autumnal Fevers ſeldom begin quite ſo early as July, but much oftner in Auguſt: and the Duration to which they are frequently extended, has increaſed the Terror which the People entertain of Fevers that begin in that Month. But that Prejudice which aſcribes their Danger to the Influence of Auguſt, is a very abſurd Error; ſince it is better they ſhould ſet in then, than in the following Months; becauſe they are obſtinate in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Tardineſs, the Slowneſs, of their Approach. They ſometimes appear at firſt conſiderably in the Form of putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. not aſſuming that of Intermittents till ſome Days after their Appearance: but very happily there is little or no Danger in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them for putrid Fevers, or in treating them like ſuch. The Brick-coloured Sediment, and particularly the Pellicle or Film on the Surface of the Urine, are very common in autumnal Intermittents, and are often wanting in the Urine of putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. In theſe latter, it is generally leſs high coloured, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to a yellow, a kind of Cloudineſs is ſuſpended in the Middle of it. Theſe alſo depoſite a white Sediment, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no bad Prognoſtic.</p>
               <p>§ 256. Generally ſpeaking, intermitting Fevers are not mortal; often terminating in Health of their own Accord (without the Uſe of any Medicines) after ſome Fits. In this laſt Reſpect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents in the Spring differ conſiderably from thoſe in the Fall, which continue a long time, and ſometimes even until Spring, if they are not removed by Art, or if they have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly treated.</p>
               <p>Quartan Fevers are always more obſtinate and inveterate than Tertians; the former ſometimes perſevering in certain Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for whole Years. When theſe Sorts of Fevers occur in bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy marſhy Countries, they are not only very chronical or tedious, but Perſons infeſted with them are liable to frequent Relapſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="unknown:012243_0159_0F8DFBE39DDDC850"/>§ 257. A few Fits of an Intermittent are not very injurious, and it happens ſometimes, that they are attended with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alteration of the Habit in Point of Health; by their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating the Cauſe or Principle of ſome languid and tedious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; though it is erroneous to conſider them as ſalutary. If they prove tedious and obſtinate, and the Fits are long and violent, they weaken the whole Body, impairing all its Functions, and particularly the Digeſtions: They make the Humours ſharp and unbalmy, and introduce ſeveral other Maladies, ſuch as the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Dropſy, Aſthma, and ſlow waſting Fevers. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times old Perſons, and thoſe who are very weak, expire in the Fit; though ſuch an Event never happens but in the cold Fit.</p>
               <p>§ 258. Very happily Nature has afforded us a Medicine, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly cures theſe Fevers; this is the <hi>Kinkina,</hi> or Jeſuits Bark; and as we are poſſeſſed of this certain Remedy, the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Difficulty is to diſcover, if there be not ſome other Diſeaſe combined with theſe Fevers, which Diſeaſe might be aggravated by the Bark. Should any ſuch exiſt, it muſt be removed by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines adapted to it, before the Bark is given. <note n="*" place="bottom">This admirable Medicine was unknown in <hi>Europe,</hi> 'till about one hundred and twenty years paſt; we are obliged to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for it, who found it in the Province of <hi>Quito</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi>; the Counteſs of <hi>Chinchon</hi> being the firſt <hi>European</hi> who uſed it in <hi>America,</hi> whence it was brought to <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Name of the Counteſs's Powder. The Jeſuits having ſoon diſpenſed and diſtributed it abroad, it became ſtill more publick by the Name of the Jeſuits Powder: and ſince it has been known by that of <hi>Kinkina</hi> or the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark. It met with great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at firſt; ſome deeming it a Poiſon, while others conſidered it as a divine Remedy: ſo that the Prejudices of many being heightened by their Animoſity, it was nearly a full Century, before its true Virtue and its Uſe were agreed to: and about twenty Years ſince the moſt unfavourable Prejudices againſt it pretty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſubſided. The Inſufficience of other Medicines in ſeveral Caſes; its great Efficaciouſneſs; and the many and ſurprizing Cures which it did, and daily does effect; the Number of Diſtempers; the different Kinds of Fevers, in which it proves the ſovereign Remedy; its Effects in the moſt difficult chirurgical Caſes; the Comfort, the Strength and Spirits it gives thoſe who need and take it, have at length opened every Perſon's Eyes; ſo that it has almoſt unanimouſly obtained the firſt Reputation, among the moſt efficacious Medicines. The World is no longer amuſed with Apprehenſions of its injuring the Stomach; of its fixing or <hi>ſhutting up</hi> the Fever (as the Phraſe has been) without curing it; that it ſhuts up the Wolf in the Sheepfold; that it throws thoſe who take it into the Scurvy, the Aſthma, the Dropſy, the Jaundice. On the contrary, they are perſuaded it prevents theſe very Diſeaſes; and, that if it is ever hurtful, it is only when it is either adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, as moſt great Remedies have been; or has been wrongly preſcribed, or improperly taken; or laſtly, when it meets with ſome latent, ſome unknown Particularities in a Conſtitution, which Phyſicians term an <hi>Idioſyncraſy,</hi> and which prevent or pervert its very general Effects.

               <p>§ 259. In the Vernal, or Spring-Fevers, if the Fits are not very ſevere; if the Patient is evidently well in their Intervals; if his Appetite, his Strength, and his Sleep continue as in Health, no Medicine ſhould be given, nor any other Method be taken, but that of putting the Perſon, under ſuch a gentle Intermittent, upon the Regimen directed for Perſons in a State of Recovery.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012243_0160_0F8DFBE46F47A728"/>
This is ſuch a Regimen as pretty generally agrees with all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of theſe Fevers: for if they ſhould be reduced to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men proper in acute Diſeaſes, they would be weakened to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and perhaps be the worſe for it. But at the ſame time if we were not to retrench from the Quantity, nor ſomewhat to vary the Quality, of their uſual Food in a State of Health; as there is not the leaſt Digeſtion made in the Stomach, during the whole Term of the Fit; and as the Stomach is always weakened a little by the Diſeaſe, crude and indigeſted Humours would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which might afford a Fuel to that Diſeaſe. Not the leaſt ſolid Food ſhould be allowed, for at leaſt two Hours before the uſual Approach of the Fit.</p>
               <p>§ 260. If the Fever extends beyond the ſixth, or the ſeventh Fit, and the Patient ſeems to have no Occaſion for a Purge; which may be learned by attending to the Chapter, that treats of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to be taken by Way of Precaution; <note n="*" place="bottom">It happens very ſeldom that intermitting Fevers require <note n="†" place="bottom">Yet I have known many in whom no Purge was neceſſary, and have ſeen ſome rendered more obſtinate and chronical by erroneous Purging. But a Vomit (given about an Hour before the ſtated Return of the Fit) is very generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before the Bark is given. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </note> no Purge towards their Cure, eſpecially in Places, which are diſpoſed to generate Putridity. There is always ſome material Cauſe eſſential to theſe Fevers, of which Nature diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſes herſelf more eaſily by Stools, than by any other Diſcharge: And as there is not the leaſt Danger to be apprehended from a gentle Purge, ſuch as thoſe of No. 11 or 23, we think it would be prudent always to premiſe a Doſe or two of either to the Bark. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                  </note> he may take the Bark, that is the Powder No. 14. If it is a Quotidian, a daily Fever, or a double Tertian, ſix Doſes, containing three Quarters of an Ounce, ſhould be taken between the two Fits; and as theſe Intermiſſions commonly conſiſt of but ten or twelve, or at the moſt of fourteen or fifteen Hours, there ſhould be an Interval of only one Hour and a half between the Doſe. During this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the Sick may take two of his uſual Refreſhments or Suppings.</p>
               <p>When the Fever is a Tertian, an Ounce ſhould be given between the two Fits: which makes eight Doſes, one of which is to be taken every three Hours.</p>
               <p>In a Quartan I direct one Ounce and a half, to be taken in the ſame Manner. It is meer trifling to attempt preventing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with ſmaller Doſes. The frequent Failures of the Bark are owing to over ſmall Doſes. On ſuch Occaſions the Medicine is cried down, and cenſured as uſeleſs, when the Diſappointment is ſolely the Fault of thoſe who do not employ it properly. The laſt Doſe is to be given two Hours before the uſual Return of the Fit.</p>
               <p>The Doſes, juſt mentioned, frequently prevent the Repetition of the Fit; but whether it returns or not, after the time of its uſual Duration is paſt, repeat the ſame Quantity, in the ſame
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012243_0161_0F8DFBE4B720C718"/>
Number of Doſes, and Intervals, which certainly keeps off ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For ſix Days following, half the ſame Quantity muſt be continued in the Intervals, that would have occurred between the Fits, if they had returned: and during all this time the Patient ſhould inure himſelf to as much Exerciſe as he can well bear.</p>
               <p>§ 261. Should the Fits be very ſtrong, the Pain of the Head violent, the Viſage red, the Pulſe full and hard; if there is any Cough; if even after the Fit is over, the Pulſe ſtill is perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hard; if the Urine is inflamed, hot and high-coloured, and the Tongue very dry, the Patient muſt be bled<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This does not ſeem directed, with Reſpect to the Cure of the Intermittent, but from a judicious Caution to prevent its degenerating into a continual Fever; into which, in ſuch full and ſanguine Habits, as are moſt liable to theſe acute Symptoms, it certainly ſometimes has degenerated. Bleeding therefore, under theſe Circumſtances, has a very probable Tendency to fix it, as an Intermittent, which is by much the leſs dangerous Diſeaſe. But bleeding Patients of low lax Habits in, or ſoon after, the Cure of Intermittents, whether with or without the Bark, as well as ſevere or unſeaſonable Purging, has certainly been found to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Relapſes, and to render the Diſeaſe more chronical. Rhubarb in Powder ſeems the beſt Purge, where Purging may be neceſſary, after an Intermittent; and it would be ſtill the better, if a third Part of the Bark were given with it. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dr. TISSOT's own Sentiments on theſe Evacuations in this Diſeaſe, eſpecially in Quartans, follow § 262 and 3.</p>
                  </note>, and drink plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of Barley Water No. 3. Theſe two Remedies generally bring the Patient into the State deſcribed § 259: in which State he may take on a Day, when the Fever is entirely off, three or four Doſes of the Powder No. 24, and then leave the Fever to purſue its own Courſe for the Space of a few Fits. But ſhould it not then terminate of itſelf, the Bark muſt be recurred to.</p>
               <p>If the Patient, even in the Interval of the Returns, has a foetid, furred Mouth, a Loathing, Pains in the Loins, or in the Knees, much Anxiety, and bad Nights, he ſhould be purged with the Powder No. 21 or the Potion No. 23, before he takes the Bark.</p>
               <p>§ 262. If Fevers in Autumn appear to be of the continual Kind, and very like putrid Fevers, the Patients ſhould drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of Barley Water; and if at the Expiration of two or three Days, there ſtill appears to be a Load or Oppreſſion at the Stomach, the Powder No. 34 or that of 35 is to be given (but ſee § 241): and if, after the Operation of this, the Signs of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridity continue, the Body is to be opened with repeated Doſes of the Powder No. 24; or where the Patients are very robuſt, with No. 21; and when the Fever becomes quite regular, with diſtinct <hi>Remiſſions</hi> at leaſt, the Bark is to be given as directed § 260.</p>
               <p>But as autumnal Fevers are more obſtinate; after having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued the Bark for eight Days; and notwithſtanding there has been no Return of the Fever, it is proper to reſume the Bark, and to give three Doſes of it daily for the ſucceeding eight Days, more eſpecially if it was a Quartan; in which Species I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it to be repeated, every other eight Days, for ſix times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:012243_0162_0F8DFBE56A266BA8"/>Many People may find it difficult to comply with this Method of Cure, which is unavoidably expenſive, through the Price of the Bark. I thought however this ought not to prevent me from averring it to be the only certain one; ſince nothing can be an equivalent <hi>Succedaneum</hi> or Subſtitute to this Remedy, which is the only ſure and ſafe one in all theſe Caſes. The World had long been prepoſſeſſed with Prejudices to the contrary: it was ſuppoſed to be hurtful to the Stomach; to prevent which it has been uſual to make the Sick eat ſomething an Hour after it. Nevertheleſs, very far from injuring the Stomach, it is the beſt Medicine in the Univerſe to ſtrengthen it; and it is a pernicious Cuſtom, when a Patient is obliged to take it often, to eat an Hour after it. It had alſo been imagined to cauſe Obſtructions, and that it ſubjected Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients to a Dropſy: but at preſent we are convinced, it is the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and inveterate Duration of the Intermittent, that cauſes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and paves the Way to a Dropſy. The Bark, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of its ſpeedily curing the Fever, does not only prevent the former Diſeaſe; but when it continues, through an injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Omiſſion of the Bark, a proper Uſe of it is ſerviceable in the Dropſy. In a Word, if there is any other Malady combined with the Fever, ſometimes <hi>that</hi> indeed prevents the Succeſs of the Bark, yet without rendering it hurtful. But whenever the intermitting Fever is ſimple and uncombined, it ever has, and will render the Patient all poſſible Service. In another Place I ſhall mention ſuch Means and Methods as may in ſome Degree, though but inadequately, be ſubſtituted inſtead of it.</p>
               <p>After the Patient has begun with the Bark, he muſt take no purging Medicine, as that Evacuation would, with the greateſt Probability, occaſion a Return of the Fever.</p>
               <p>§ 263. Bleeding is never, or extremely ſeldom indeed, neceſſary in a Quartan Ague, which occurs in the Fall oftner than in the Spring; and with the Symptoms of Putridity, rather than of Inflammation. See Note * § 261.</p>
               <p>§ 264. The Patient ought, two Hours before the Invaſion of the Fit, to drink a ſmall Glaſs of warm Elder-flower Tea, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Honey, every Quarter of an Hour, and to walk about moderately: this diſpoſes him to a very gentle Sweat, and thence renders the enſuing Coldneſs and the whole Fit milder. He is to continue the ſame Drink throughout the Duration of the cold Fit; and when the hot one approaches, he may either continue the ſame, or ſubſtitute that of No. 2, which is more cooling. It is not neceſſary however, in this State, to drink it warm, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be not over cold. When the Sweat, at the Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the hot Fit, is concluded, the Patient ſhould be well wiped and dried, and may get up. If the Fit was very long, he may be allowed a little Gruel, or ſome other ſuch Nouriſhment during the Sweat.</p>
               <p>§ 265. Sometimes the firſt, and a few ſucceſſive Doſes of the Bark purge the Patient. This is no otherwiſe an ill Conſequence,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012243_0163_0F8DFBE646ED21E0"/>
than by its retarding the Cure; ſince, when it purges, it does not commonly [<hi>though ſometimes</hi>] prevent the Return of the Fever; ſo that theſe Doſes may be conſidered as to no Purpoſe, and others ſhould be repeated, which, ceaſing to purge, do prevent it. Should the Looſeneſs notwithſtanding continue, the Bark muſt be diſcontinued for one entire Day, in order to give the Patient half a Quarter of an Ounce of Rhubarb: after which the Bark is to be reſumed again; and if the Looſeneſs ſtill perſeveres, fifteen Grains of Venice Treacle ſhould be added to each Doſe, but not otherwiſe. All other Medicines which are ſuperadded, very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſerve only to increaſe the Bulk of the Doſe, while they leſſen its Virtue.</p>
               <p>§ 266. Before our thorough Experience of the Bark, other bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Medicines were uſed for the ſame Purpoſe: theſe indeed were not deſtitute of Virtue in ſuch Caſes, though they were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leſs available than the Bark. Under No. 43, ſome valuable Preſcriptions of that kind may be ſeen, whoſe Efficacy I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten experienced: though at other times I have been obliged to leave them off, and recur to the Bark more ſucceſsfully. Filings of Iron, which enter into the third Preſcription, are an excellent Febrifuge in particular Caſes and Circumſtances. In the Middle of the Winter 1753, I cured a Patient of a Quartan Ague with it, who would not be prevailed on to take the Bark. It muſt be confeſſed he was perfectly regular in obſerving the Regimen direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him; and that, during the moſt rigid Severity of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he got every Day on Horſeback, and took ſuch a Degree of other Exerciſe in the open Air, as diſpoſed him to perſpire abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
               <p>§ 267. Another very practicable eaſy Method, of which I have often availed my Patients, under Tertian Fevers (but which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with me only twice in Quartans) was to procure the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer a very plentiful Sweat, at the very time when the Fit was to return, in its uſual Courſe. To effect this he is to drink, three or four Hours before it is expected, an Infuſion of Elder-flowers ſweetened with Honey, which I have already recommended § 264; and one Hour before the uſual Invaſion of the Shivering, he is to go into Bed, and take, as hot as he can drink it, the Preſcription No. 44.</p>
               <p>I have alſo cured ſome Tertians and even Quartans, in 1751 and 1752, by giving them, every four Hours between the Fits, the Powder No. 45. But I muſt acknowledge that, beſides its having often failed me, and its never ſucceeding ſo ſpeedily as the Bark, I have found it weaken ſome Patients; it diſorders, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with, their Stomachs: and in two Caſes, where it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Fever, I was obliged to call in the Bark, for a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Eſtabliſhment of the Patient's Health. Nevertheleſs as theſe Medicines are very cheap and attainable, and often do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I thought I could not properly omit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:012243_0164_0F8DFBE6E6CE18E8"/>§ 268. A Multitude of other Remedies are cried up for the Cure of Fevers: though none of them are equally efficacious with thoſe I have directed; and as many of them are even dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, it is prudent to abſtain from them. Some Years ſince certain Powders were ſold here, under the Name of the <hi>Berlin</hi> Powders; theſe are nothing but the Bark maſqued or diſguiſed (which has ſometimes been publickly diſcovered) and have always been ſold very dear: though the Bark well choſen, and freſhly powdered when wanted, is greatly preferable.</p>
               <p>§ 269. I have often known Peaſants, who had laboured for ſeveral Months under intermitting Fevers; having made Uſe of many bad Medicines and Mixtures for them, and obſerved no Manner of Regimen. Such I have happily treated by giving them the Remedies No. 34, or 35; and afterwards, for ſome Days, that of No. 38; at the End of which time, I have ordered them the Bark, (See § 260,) or other Febrifuges, as at § 266, 267: and then finally directed them for ſome Days, to take Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the poor Man's Treacle (See § 247, <hi>Art.</hi> 13,) to ſtrengthen and confirm their Digeſtions, which I have found very weak and irregular.</p>
               <p>§ 270. Some Intermittents are diſtinguiſhed as pernicious or malignant, from every Fit's being attended with the moſt violent Symptoms. The Pulſe is ſmall and irregular, the Patient exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dejected, and frequently ſwooning; afflicted with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anguiſh, Convulſions, a deep Drowſineſs, and continual Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to go to Stool, or make Urine, but ineffectually. This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is highly preſſing and dangerous; the Patient may die in the third Fit, and rarely ſurvives the ſixth, if he is not very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly treated. Not a Moment ſhould be loſt, and there is no other Step to be taken, but that of giving the Bark continually, as directed § 260, to prevent the ſucceeding Fits. Theſe worſt Kinds of Intermittents are often combined with a great Load of putrid Humours in the firſt Paſſages: and as often as ſuch an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Combination is very evident, we ſhould immediately after the End of one Fit, give a Doſe of Ipecacuana No. 35, and when its Operation is finiſhed, give the Bark. But I chuſe to enter into very few Details on this Species of Intermittents, both as they occur but ſeldom, and as the Treatment of them is too difficult and important, to be ſubmitted to the Conduct of any one but a Phyſician. My Intention has only been to repreſent them ſufficiently, that they may be ſo diſtinguiſhed when they do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, as to apprize the People of their great Danger.</p>
               <p>§ 271. The ſame Cauſe which produces theſe intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, frequently alſo occaſions Diſorders, that return periodically at the ſame Hour, without Shivering, without Heat, and often without any Quickneſs of the Pulſe. Such Diſorders generally obſerve the Intermiſſions of quotidian or tertian Fevers, but much ſeldomer thoſe of Quartans. I have ſeen violent Vomitings, and Reachings to vomit, with inexpreſſible Anxiety; the ſevereſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012243_0165_0F8DFBE8688AE030"/>
the moſt racking Cholics; dreadful Palpitations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Tooth-achs; Pains in the Head, and very often an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Pain over one Eye, the Eyelid, Eyebrow and Temple, on the ſame Side of the Face; with a Redneſs of that Eye, and a continual, involuntary trickling of Tears. I have alſo ſeen ſuch a prodigious Swelling of the affected Part, that the Eye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, or ſtood out, above an Inch from the Head, covered by the Eyelid, which was alſo extremely inflated, or puffed up. All theſe Maladies begin preciſely at a certain Hour, laſt about the uſual time of a Fit; and terminating without any ſenſible Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, return exactly at the ſame Hour, the next Day, or the next but one.</p>
               <p>There is but one known Medicine that can effectually oppoſe this Sort, which is the Bark, given as directed § 260. Nothing affords Relief in the Fit, and no other Medicine ever ſuſpends or puts it off. But I have cured ſome of theſe Diſorders with the Bark, and eſpecially thoſe affecting the Eyes, which happen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than the other Symptoms, after their Duration for many Weeks, and after the ineffectual Uſe of Bleeding, Purging, Baths, Waters, Bliſters, and a great Number of other Medicines. If a ſufficient Doſe of it be given, the next fit is very mild; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is prevented; and I never ſaw a Relapſe in theſe Caſes, which ſometimes happens after the Fits of common Intermittents ſeemed cured.</p>
               <p>§ 272. In Situations where the Conſtitution of the Air renders theſe Fevers very common, the Inhabitants ſhould frequently burn in their Rooms, at leaſt in their lodging Rooms, ſome aromatic Wood or Herbs. They ſhould daily chew ſome Juniper Berries, and drink a fermented Infuſion of them. Theſe two Remedies are very effectual to fortify the weakeſt Stomachs, to prevent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and to promote Perſpiration. And as theſe are the Cauſes which prolong theſe Fevers the moſt obſtinately; nothing is a more certain Preſervation from them than theſe cheap and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Aſſiſtances. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I have ſeen ſeveral Caſes in very marſhy maratime Countries, with little good drinking Water, and far South of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> where intermitting Fevers, with Agues at different Intervals, are annually endemic, very popular, and often ſo obſtinate as to return repeatedly, whenever the weekly precautionary Doſes of the Bark have been omitted, (through the Patient's nauſeating the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Swallowing of it,) ſo that the Diſeaſe has ſometimes been extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Term of a full Year, and even far into a ſecond, including the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Removals of it by the Bark. Nevertheleſs, in ſome ſuch obſtinate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents, and particularly Quartans there, wherein the Bark alone has had but a ſhort and imperfect Effect, I have known the following Compoſition, after a good Vomit, (taken about an Hour before the uſual Return of the Fit, at which Juncture it operates briſkly,) attended with ſpeedy and final Succeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of freſh Saſſafras Bark, of <hi>Virginia</hi> Snake-root, of Roch-Allom, of Nutmeg, of diaphoretic Antimony, of Salt of Wormwood, of each one Drachm. To theſe well rubbed together into fine Powder, add the Weight of the whole, of the beſt and freſheſt Bark; then drop in three or four Drops of the chemical Oil of Mint, and with Syrup of Cloves, or Saffion, make it into the Conſiſtence of an Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary or Bolus, for twelve Doſes for a grown Perſon, to be taken at the Diſtance of three or four Hours from each other, while the Patient is awake, according to the longer or ſhorter Intermiſſion of the Fever.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo known, particularly in obſtinate autumnal Agues there, an Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two Ounces of the beſt Bark in fine Powder, or two Ounces and a Half in groſs Powder, in a Quart of the beſt Brandy, for three or four Days (a ſmall Wine Glaſs to be taken by grown Perſons at the Diſtance of from four to ſix Hours) effectually and ſpeedily terminate ſuch inveterate Agues, as had given but little Way to the Bark in Subſtance. This was certainly moſt ſuitable for thoſe who were not of a light delicate Habit and Temperament, and who had not been remarkable for their Abſtinence from ſtrong Liquors: the inebriating Force of the Brandy being remarkably leſſened by the Addition, and long Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the Bark. Theſe Facts which I ſaw, are the leſs to be wondered at, as in ſuch inveterate, but perfectly clear and diſtinct Intermittents, both the State of the Fluids and Solids ſeem very oppoſite to their State in an acutely inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Diſeaſe. <hi>K.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX. Of the Eriſipelas, and the Bites of Animals.</head>
               <p>SECT. 273. THE Eriſipelas, commonly called in Engliſh, St. Anthony's Fire, and in Swiſſerland <hi>the Violet,</hi> is ſometimes but a very ſlight Indiſpoſition which appears on the Skin, without the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's being ſenſible of any other Diſorder; and it moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaks out either in the Face, or on the Legs. The Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tenſe, or ſtiff, rough and red; but this Redneſs diſappears on preſſing the Spot with a Finger, and returns on removing it. The Patient feels in the Part affected a burning Heat which makes him uneaſy, and ſometimes hinders him from ſleeping. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order increaſes for the Space of two or three Days; continues at its Height one or two, and then abates. Soon after this, that Part of the Skin which was affected, falls off in pretty large Scales, and the Diſorder entirely terminates.</p>
               <p>§ 274. But ſometimes this Malady is conſiderably more ſevere, beginning with a violent Shivering, which is ſucceeded by a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat, a vehement Head-ach, a Sickneſs at Heart, as it is commonly termed, or Reachings to vomit, which continue till the <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> appears, which ſometimes does not happen before the ſecond, or even the third Day. The Fever then abates, and the Sickneſs goes off, though frequently a leſs Degree of Fever, and of Sickneſs or Loathing remain, during the whole Time, in which the Diſeaſe is in its increaſing State. When the Eruption and Inflammation happen in the Face, the Head-ach continues
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012243_0167_0F8DFBEC4981EDF0"/>
until the Decline, or going off, of the Diſeaſe, The Eyelid ſwells, the Eye is cloſed, and the Patient has not the leaſt Eaſe or Tranquillity. It often paſſes from one Cheek to the other, and extends ſucceſſively over the Forehead, the Neck, and the Nape of the Neck; under which Circumſtance the Diſeaſe is of a more than ordinary Duration. Sometimes alſo when it exiſts in a very high Degree, the Fever continues, the Brain is obſtructed and oppreſſed; the Patient raves; his Caſe becomes extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; whence ſometimes, if he is not very judiciouſly aſſiſted, he dies, eſpecially if of an advanced Age. A violent <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> on the Neck brings on a Quinſey, which may prove very grievous or even fatal.</p>
               <p>When it attacks the Leg, the whole Leg ſwells up; and the Heat and Irritation from it is extended up to the Thigh.</p>
               <p>Whenever this Tumour is conſiderable, the Part it ſeizes is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſmall Puſtules filled with a clear watery Humour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe which appear after a Burn, and drying afterwards and ſcaling off. I have ſometimes obſerved, eſpecially when this Diſtemper affected the Face, that the Humour, which iſſued from theſe little Puſtules, was extremely thick or glewy, and formed a thick Scurf, or Scabs nearly reſembling thoſe of ſucking Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: they have continued faſt on the Face many Days before they fell off.</p>
               <p>When the Diſeaſe may be termed violent, it ſometimes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues eight, ten, twelve Days at the ſame Height; and is at laſt terminated by a very plentiful Sweat, that may ſometimes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by a Reſtleſſneſs attended with Shiverings, and a little Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety of ſome Hours Duration. Throughout the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, the whole Skin is very dry, and even the Inſide of the Mouth.</p>
               <p>§ 275. An <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> rarely comes to Suppuration, and when it does, the Suppuration is always unkindly, and much diſpoſed to degenerate into an Ulcer. Sometimes a malignant kind of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſipelas</hi> is epidemical, ſeizing a great Number of Perſons, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently terminating in Gangrenes.</p>
               <p>§ 276. This Diſtemper often ſhifts its Situation; it ſometimes retires ſuddenly; but the Patient is uneaſy and diſordered; he has a Propenſity to vomit, with a ſenſible Anxiety and Heat: the <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> appears again in a different Part, and he feels himſelf quite relieved from the preceding Symptoms. But if inſtead of re-appearing on ſome other Part of the Surface, the Humour is thrown upon the Brain, or the Breaſt, he dies within a few Hours; and theſe fatal Changes and Tranſlations ſometimes occur, without the leaſt Reaſon or Colour for aſcribing them either to any Error of the Patient, or of his Phyſician.</p>
               <p>If the Humour has been transferred to the Brain, the Patient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately becomes delirious, with a highly fluſhed Viſage, and very quick ſparkling Eyes: very ſoon after he proves downright frantic, and goes off in a Lethargy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:012243_0168_0F8DFBED97E5CC40"/>If the Lungs are attacked, the Oppreſſion, Anxiety and Heat are inexpreſſible.</p>
               <p>§ 277. There are ſome Conſtitutions ſubject to a very frequent, and, as it were, to an habitual <hi>Eriſipelas.</hi> If it often affects the Face, it is generally repeated on the ſame Side of it; and that Eye is, at length, conſiderably weakened by it.</p>
               <p>§ 278. This Diſtemper reſults from two Cauſes; the one an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crid ſharp Humour, which is commonly bilious, diffuſed through the Maſs of Blood; the other conſiſts in that Humour's not being ſufficiently diſcharged by Perſpiration.</p>
               <p>§ 279. When this Diſeaſe is of a gentle Nature, ſuch as it is deſcribed § 273, it will be ſufficient to keep up a very free Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but without heating the Patient; and the beſt Method to anſwer this Purpoſe is putting him upon the Regimen ſo often already referred to, with a plentiful Uſe of Nitre in Elder-flower Tea. Fleſh, Eggs and Wine are prohibited of courſe, allowing the Patient a little Puls and ripe Fruits. He ſhould drink El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-flower Tea abundantly, and take half a Drachm of Nitre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very three Hours; or, which amounts to the ſame thing, let three Drachms of Nitre be diſſolved in as much Infuſion of Elder-flowers, as he can drink in twenty-four Hours. Nitre may be given too in a Bolus with Conſerve of Elder-berries. Theſe Medicines keep the Body open, and increaſe Urine and Perſpiration.</p>
               <p>§ 280. When the Diſtemper prevails in a ſeverer Degree, if the Fever is very high, and the Pulſe, at the ſame time, ſtrong or hard, it may be neceſſary to bleed once: but this ſhould never be permitted in a large Quantity at a time in this Diſeaſe; it being more adviſeable, if a ſufficient Quantity has not been taken at once, to bleed a ſecond time, and even a third, if the Fever ſhould prove very high, as it often does, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſo violent a Degree, as to render it extremely danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and in a few ſuch Caſes Nature has ſometimes ſaved the Patients by effecting a large Haemorrhage, or Bleeding, to the Quantity of four or five Pounds. This Conduct a very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and prudent Phyſician may preſume to imitate; but I dare not adviſe the ſame Conduct to that Claſs of Phyſicians, for which only I write: it being ſafer for them to uſe repeated Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſuch Caſes, than one in an exceſſive Quantity. Theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſipelatous Fevers are often excited by a Perſon's being too long over-heated.</p>
               <p>After Bleeding the Patient is to be reſtrained to his Regimen; Glyſters are to be given until there is a ſenſible Abatement of the Fever: and he ſhould drink the Barley Water freely, No. 3.</p>
               <p>When the Fever is ſomewhat diminiſhed, either the Purge No. 23 ſhould be given, or a few Doſes of Cream of Tartar No. 24, every Morning. Purging is abſolutely neceſſary to carry off the ſtagnant Bile, which is generally the firſt Cauſe of the violent Degrees of this Diſtemper. It may ſometimes be really neceſſary too, if the Diſeaſe is very tedious; if the Loathing and Sickneſs
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012243_0169_0F8DFBEE792F34B8"/>
at Stomach is obſtinate; the Mouth ill-ſavoured, and the Tongue foul, (provided there be only a ſlight Fever, and no Fear of an Inflammation) to give the Medicines No. 34 or 35, which, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Agitation, the Shaking they occaſion, remove theſe Impediments ſtill better than Purges.</p>
               <p>It commonly happens that this Diſeaſe is more favourable after theſe Evacuations; nevertheleſs it is ſometimes neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them the next Day, or the next but one; eſpecially if the Malady affects the Head. Purging is the true Evacuation for curing it, whenever it attacks this Part. By carrying off the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, they diminiſh it, and prevent its worſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
               <p>Whenever, even after theſe Evacuations, the Fever ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be very ſevere, the Patient ſhould take every two Hours, or, occaſionally, oftner, two Spoonfuls of the Preſcription No. 10, added to a Glaſs of Ptiſan.</p>
               <p>It will be very uſeful, when this Diſeaſe is ſeated in the Head or Face, to bath the Legs frequently in warm Water; and, where it is violent there, alſo to apply Sinapiſms to the Soles of the Feet. I have ſeen this Application, in about four Hours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or draw down an <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> to the Legs, which had ſpread over the Noſe, and both the Eyes. When the Diſtemper once begins to go off by Sweating, this ſhould be promoted by Elder-flower Tea and Nitre (See § 279) and the Sweating may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to Advantage for ſome Hours.</p>
               <p>§ 281. The beſt Applications that can be made to the affected Part are 1ſt, The Herb Robert, a Species of <hi>Geranium,</hi> or Crane's Bill; or Chervil, or Parſley, or Elder Flowers: and if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint be of a very mild Diſpoſition, it may be ſufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a very ſoft ſmooth Linen over it, which ſome People duſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a little dry Meal.</p>
               <p>2, If there is a very conſiderable Inflammation, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſo circumſtanced as to be very tractable and is regularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, Flanels wrung out of a ſtrong Decoction of Elder-flowers and applied warm, afford him the ſpeedieſt Eaſe and Relief. By this ſimple Application I have appeaſed the moſt violent Pains of a St. Anthony's Fire, which is the moſt cruel Species of an <hi>Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas,</hi> and has ſome peculiar Marks or Symptoms extraordinary.</p>
               <p>3, The Plaiſter of Smalt, and Smalt itſelf No. 46, are alſo very ſucceſsfully employed in this Diſorder. This Powder, the farina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that is the mealy ones, or others recommended for it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree beſt when a thin watery Humour diſtils or weeps from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Veſications attending it, which it is convenient to abſorb by ſuch Applications; without which Precaution this Humour might gall, or even ulcerate, the Part.</p>
               <p>All other Plaiſters, which are partly compounded of greaſy, or of reſinous Subſtances, are very dangerous: they often repel, or ſtrike in the <hi>Eriſipelas,</hi> occaſioning it to ulcerate, or even to gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene. If People who are naturally ſubject to this Diſeaſe ſhould
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012243_0170_0F8DFBEF292128D8"/>
apply any ſuch Plaiſter to their Skin, even in its ſoundeſt State, an <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> is the ſpeedy Conſequence.</p>
               <p>§ 282. Whenever the Humour occaſioning the Diſtemper is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and thrown upon the Brain, the Throat, the Lungs, or any internal Part, the Patient ſhould be bled; Bliſters muſt be applied to the Legs; and Elder Tea, with Nitre diſſolved in it, ſhould be plentifully drank.</p>
               <p>§ 283. People who are liable to frequent Returns of an <hi>Eriſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> ſhould very carefully avoid uſing <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſhould think it would not always be neceſſary to extend this Reſtriction to freſh clarified Whey; eſpecially if a ſmall Quantity of the Leaves of Wood-Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or of <hi>French</hi> Sorrel, had been infuſed ſometime in it; or if the Milk had been turned with the Juice of a good ripe Lemon. See alſo, on this Point, Dr. TISSOT's Concluſion of this §. Some have allowed Water and Milk in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſipelas. <hi>K.</hi>

A careful Conformity to theſe Regulations is of real Importance, as, beſides the Danger of the frequent Viſitations of this Diſeaſe, they denote ſome ſlight Indiſpoſitions of the Liver and the Gall-bladder; which, if too little attended to, might in time prove very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pernicious.</p>
               <p>Such mineral Waters as are gently opening are very proper for theſe Conſtitutions, as well as the Juice of Succory, and clarified Whey, of which they ſhould take about three Pints every Morning, during the five or ſix Summer Months. This becomes ſtill more efficacious, if a little Cream of Tartar and Honey be added to it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX. Of ſpurious, or falſe Inflammations of the Breaſt, and of ſpurious, bilious Pleuriſies.</head>
               <p>SECT. 285. THE Inflammation of the Breaſt and that Pleuriſy, which is called <hi>bilious,</hi> are the ſame Diſeaſe. It is properly a putrid Fever, attended with an Infarction or Stuffing of the Lungs, though without Pain; in which Circumſtance it is called a putrid or bilious Peripneumony: but when attended with a Pain of the Side, a Stitch, it is called a ſpurious or baſtard Pleuriſy.</p>
               <p>§ 286. The Signs which diſtinguiſh theſe Diſeaſes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ones of the ſame Name, deſcribed Chap. IV and V, are a leſs hard and leſs ſtrong, but a quicker Pulſe, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompanied with the ſame Symptoms which conſtitute the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ones, (See § 47 and 90.) The Mouth is foul, and has a Senſation of Bitterneſs; the Patient is infeſted with a ſharp and dry Heat; he has a Feeling of Heavineſs and Anxiety all about
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012243_0172_0F8DFBF0ADA17CF0"/>
his Stomach, with Loathings: he is leſs fluſhed and red in theſe, than in the inflammatory Diſeaſes, but rather a little yellow. He has a dejected wan Look; his Urine reſembles that in putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and not that of inflammatory ones; and he has very often a ſmall bilious Looſeneſs, which is extremely offenſive. The Skin is commonly very dry in this Diſeaſe; the Humour ſpit up is leſs thick, leſs reddiſh, and rather more yellow, than in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Diſeaſes of the ſame Names.</p>
               <p>§ 287. Theſe Diſeaſes muſt be treated like putrid Fevers, as in § 241. Suppoſing ſome little Degree of Inflammation to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the Diſeaſe, it may be removed by a ſingle Bleeding. After this the Patient is to drink Barley Water No. 3, to make Uſe of Glyſters; and as ſoon as all Symptoms of any Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wholly diſappear, he is to take the vomiting and purging Draught No. 34. But the utmoſt Caution muſt be taken not to give it, before every Appearance of any Inflammation is totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; as giving it ſooner would be certain Death to the ſick: and it is dreadful but to think of agitating, by a Vomit, Lungs that are inflamed, and overloaded with Blood, whoſe Veſſels burſt and diſcharge themſelves, only from the Force of Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. After an Interval of ſome Days, he may be purged again with the Medicine No. 23. The Preſcription No. 25 ſucceeds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very well as a Vomit. If the Fever is violent, he muſt drink plentifully of the Potion No. 10.</p>
               <p>Bliſters to the Legs are very ſerviceable, when the Load and Oppreſſion are not conſiderably abated after general Evacuations.</p>
               <p>§ 288. The falſe Inflammation of the Breaſt is an Over-fulneſs or Obſtruction in the Lungs, accompanied with a Fever; it is cauſed by extremely thick and tenacious Humours: and not by a really inflammatory Blood, or by any putrid or bilious Humour.</p>
               <p>§ 289. This Diſtemper happens more frequently in the Spring, than in any other Seaſon. Old Men, puny, ill-conſtitutioned Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, languid Women, feeble young Men, and particularly ſuch as have worn their Conſtitutions out by drinking, are the Subjects moſt frequently attacked by it; eſpecially if they have uſed but little Exerciſe throughout the Winter; if they have fed on viſcid, mealy and fat Aliments, as Paſtry, Cheſnuts, thick Milk or Pap, and Cheeſe. All their Humours have contracted a thick glutinous Quality; they are circulated with Difficulty, and when Heat or Exerciſe in the Spring increaſes their Motion at once, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours already ſtuffing up the Lungs, ſtill more augment that Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, whence theſe vital Organs are fatally extended, and the Patient dies.</p>
               <p>§ 290. This Diſtemper is known to exiſt,</p>
               <p>1, By the previous Exiſtence of the Cauſes already mentioned.</p>
               <p>2, By the Symptoms which precede and uſher it in: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Patient many Days before-hand has a ſlight Cough; a ſmall Oppreſſion when he moves about; a little Reſtleſſneſs, and is ſometimes a little choleric or fretful. His Countenance is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012243_0173_0F8DFBF16D4E30B8"/>
coloured than in Health; he has a Propenſity to ſleep, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Confuſion and without Refreſhment, and has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an extraordinary Appetite.</p>
               <p>3, When this State has continued for ſome Days, there comes on a cold Shivering, though more conſiderable for its Duration than its Violence; it is ſucceeded by a moderate Degree of Heat; but that attended with much Inquietude and Oppreſſion. The ſick Perſon cannot confine himſelf to the Bed; but walks to and fro in his Chamber, and is greatly dejected. The Pulſe is weak and pretty quick; the Urine is ſometimes but little changed from that in Health; at other times it is diſcharged but in a ſmall Quantity, and is higher coloured: he coughs but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and does not expectorate, or cough up, but with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Viſage becomes very red, and even almoſt livid; he can neither keep awake, nor ſleep well; he raves for ſome Moments, and then his Head grows clear again. Sometimes it happens, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to Perſons of advanced Age, that this State ſuddenly terminates in a mortal Swoon or Fainting: at other times and in other Caſes, the Oppreſſion and Anguiſh increaſe; the Patient cannot breathe but when ſitting up, and that with great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Agony: the Brain is utterly diſturbed and embarraſſed; this State laſts for ſome Hours, and then terminates of a ſudden.</p>
               <p>§ 291. This is a very dangerous Diſtemper; becauſe, in the firſt place, it chiefly attacks thoſe Perſons whoſe Temperament and Conſtitution are deprived of the ordinary Reſources for Health and Recovery: in the ſecond place, becauſe it is of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate Nature, the Patient ſometimes dying on the third Day, and but ſeldom ſurviving the ſeventh; while the Cauſe of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more conſiderable Term for its Removal, or Mitigation. Beſides which, if ſome Indications preſent, for the Employment of a Remedy, there are frequently others which forbid it; and all that ſeems to be done is, as follows;</p>
               <p>1, If the Patient has ſtill a pretty good Share of Health; if he is not of too advanced an Age; if the Pulſe has a perceivable Hardneſs, and yet at the ſame time ſome Strength; if the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dry, and the Wind blows from the North, he ſhould be bled once, to a moderate Quantity. But if the greater Part of theſe Circumſtances are wanting, Bleeding would be very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial. Were we obliged to eſtabliſh ſome general and poſitive Rule in this Caſe, it were better to exclude Bleeding, than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
               <p>2, The Stomach and the Bowels ſhould be unloaded from their viſcid glutinous Contents; and the Medicines which ſucceed the beſt in this Reſpect are No. 35, when the Symptoms ſhew there is a great Neceſſity for vomiting, and there is no Inflammation; or the Preſcription No. 25, which after vomiting, purges by Stool, promotes Urine, breaks down and divides the viſcid Humours, that occaſion the Diſeaſe, and increaſes Perſpiration. When we are afraid of hazarding the Agitations of a Vomit and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012243_0174_0F8DFBF22D237738"/>
the Potion, No. 11 may be given; but we muſt be very cautious, in Regard to old Men, even with this; as ſuch may expire during the Operation of it.</p>
               <p>3, They ſhould, from the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, drink plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 26, which is the beſt Drink in this Diſeaſe; or that of No. 12, adding half a Dram of Nitre to every Pint of it.</p>
               <p>4, A Cup of the Mature No. 8 muſt be taken every two Hours.</p>
               <p>5, Bliſters are to be applied to the Inſides of the Legs.</p>
               <p>When the Caſe is very doubtful and perplexing, it were beſt to confine ourſelves to the three laſt-mentioned Remedies, which have often been ſucceſsful in ſevere Degrees of this Diſeaſe; and which can occaſion no ill Conſequence.</p>
               <p>§ 292. When this Malady invades old People, though they partly recover, they never recover perfectly, entirely, from it: and if due Precaution is not taken, they are very liable to fall into a Dropſy of the Breaſt after it.</p>
               <p>§ 293. The ſpurious or falſe Pleuriſy is a Diſtemper that does not affect the Lungs, but only the Teguments, the Skin, and the Muſcles which cover the Ribs. It is the Effect of a Rheumatic Humour thrown upon theſe Parts, in which, as it produces very ſharp Pains reſembling that which is called a <hi>Stitch,</hi> it has, from this Circumſtance, been termed a Pleuriſy.</p>
               <p>It is generally ſuppoſed by the meer Multitude, and even by ſome of a different Rank, that a falſe Pleuriſy is more dangerous than a genuine, a true one; but this is a Miſtake. It is often uſhered in by a Shivering, and almoſt ever attended with a little Fever, a ſmall Cough, and a ſlight Difficulty of breathing; which, as well as the Cough, is occaſioned from the Circumſtance of a Patient's (who feels Pain in Reſpiration, or Breathing) checking Breathing as much as he can; this accumulates a little too much Blood in the Lungs; but yet he has no Anguiſh, not the other Symptoms of acute true Pleuriſies. In ſome Patients this Pain is extended, almoſt over the whole Breaſt, and to the Nape of the Neck. The ſick Perſon cannot repoſe himſelf on the Side affected.</p>
               <p>This Diſorder is not more dangerous than a Rheumatiſm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in two Caſes, 1, When the Pain is ſo very ſevere, that the Patient ſtrongly endeavours not to breathe at all, which brings on a great Infarction or Stoppage in the Lungs. 2, When this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, like any other rheumatic one, is transferred to ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part.</p>
               <p>§ 294. It muſt be treated exactly like a Rheumatiſm. See § 168 and 169.</p>
               <p>After bleeding once or more, a Bliſter applied to the affected Part is often attended with a very good Effect: this being indeed the Kind of <note n="*" place="bottom">The Seneka Rattle-ſnake-root, already recommended in true Pleuriſies, will, with the greateſt Probability, be found not leſs effectual in theſe falſe ones, in which the Inflammation of the Blood is leſs. The Method of giving it may be ſeen P. 58, N. (a.) By Dr. TISSOT's having never mentioned this valuable Simple throughout his Work, it may be preſumed, that when he wrote it, this Remedy had not been admitted into the Apothecaries Shops in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> K.</note> Pleuriſy, in which it particularly agrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:012243_0175_0F8DFBF31769BE70"/>§ 295. This Malady ſometimes gives way to the firſt Bleeding; often terminating on the third, fourth or fifth Day, by a very plentiful Sweat, and rarely laſting beyond the ſeventh. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it attacks a Perſon very ſuddenly, after a Stoppage of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; and then, if at once, before the Fever commences, and has had time to inflame the Blood, the Patient takes ſome <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trank,</hi> it effects a ſpeedy Cure by reſtoring Perſpiration. They are ſuch Caſes as theſe, or that mentioned § 96, which have given this Compoſition the Reputation it has obtained in this Diſeaſe; a Reputation nevertheleſs, which has every Year proved tragical in its Conſequences to many Peaſants, who being deceived by ſome miſleading Reſemblances in this Diſtemper, have raſhly and ignorantly made Uſe of it in true inflammatory Pleuriſies.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI. Of the Cholic and its different Kinds.</head>
               <p>SECT. 296. THE Appellation of a Cholic is commonly given to all Pains of the Belly indiſcriminately; but I apply it in this Place only to ſuch as attack the Stomach, or the Inteſtines, the Guts.</p>
               <p>Cholics may and do reſult from very many Cauſes; and the greater Number of Cholics are chronical or tedious Complaints, being more common among the inactive Inhabitants of Cities, and Workmen in ſedentary Trades, than among Country People. Hence I ſhall treat here only of the ſmall Variety of Cholics, which happen the moſt uſually in Villages. I have already proved that the fatal Events of ſome Diſtempers were occaſioned by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to force the Patients into Sweats; and the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Conſequences have attended Cholics, from accuſtoming the Subjects of this Diſeaſe to Drams, and hot inflaming ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquors, with an Intention to expel the Wind.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the inflammatory Cholic.</head>
                  <p>§ 297. The moſt violent and dangerous Kind of Cholic is that, which ariſes from an Inflammation of the Stomach, or of
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012243_0176_0F8DFBF3B9873FC8"/>
the Inteſtines. It begins moſt commonly without any Shivering, by a vehement Pain in the Belly, which gradually becomes ſtill more ſo. The Pulſe grows quick and hard; a burning Pain is felt through the whole Region of the Belly; ſometimes there is a watery <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> or Purging; at other Times the Belly is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſtive, which is attended with Vomiting, a very embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and dangerous Symptom: the Countenance becomes highly fluſhed; the Belly tenſe and hard; neither can it be touched ſcarcely without a cruel Augmentation of the Patient's Pain, who is alſo afflicted with extreme Reſtleſſneſs; his Thirſt is very great, being unquenchable by Drink; the Pain often extends to the Loins, where it proves very ſharp, and ſevere; little Urine is made, and that very red, and with a Kind of burning Heat. The tormented Patient has not a Moment's Reſt, and now and then raves a little. If the Diſeaſe is not removed or moderated, before the Pains riſe to their utmoſt Height and Violence, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient begins at length to complain leſs; the Pulſe becomes leſs ſtrong and leſs hard than before, but quicker; his Face firſt abates of its Fluſh and Redneſs, and ſoon after looks pale; the Parts under the Eyes become livid; the Patient ſinks into a low ſtupid Kind of <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Raving; his Strength entirely deſerts him; the Face, Hands, Feet, and the whole Body, the Belly only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, become cold: the Surface of the Belly appears bluiſh; extreme Weakneſs follows, and the Patient dies. There fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurs, juſt a Moment before he expires, an abundant Diſcharge of exceſſively foetid Matter by Stool; and during this Evacuation he dies, with his Inteſtines quite gangrened, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſtemper aſſaults the Stomach, the Symptoms are the very ſame, but the Pain is felt higher up, at the Pit of the Stomach. Almoſt every Thing that is ſwallowed is caſt up again; the Anguiſh of the tortured Patient is terrible, and the Raving comes on very ſpeedily. This Diſeaſe, proves mortal in a few Hours.</p>
                  <p>§ 298. The only Method of ſucceeding in the Cure of it is as follows:</p>
                  <p>1, Take a very large Quantity of Blood from the Arm; this almoſt immediately diminiſhes the Violence of the Pains, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays the Vomiting; beſides its contributing to the greater Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the other Remedies. It is often neceſſary to repeat this Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Space of two Hours.</p>
                  <p>2, Whether the Patient has a Looſeneſs, or has not, a Glyſter of a Decoction of Mallows, or of Barley Water and Oil, ſhould be given every two Hours.</p>
                  <p>3, The Patient ſhould drink very plentifully of Almond Milk No. 4; or a Ptiſan of Mallow Flowers, or of Barley, all which ſhould be warm.</p>
                  <p>4, Flanels dipt in hot, or very warm Water, ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012243_0177_0F8DFBF71B35FCF8"/>
applied over the Belly, ſhifting them every Hour, or rather oftner; for in this Caſe they very quickly grow dry.</p>
                  <p>5, If the Diſeaſe, notwithſtanding all this, continues very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and violent, the Patient ſhould be put into a warm Water Bath, the extraordinary Succeſs of which I have obſerved.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſtemper is over, that is to ſay, when the Pains have terminated, and the Fever has ceaſed, ſo that the Patient recovers a little Strength, and gets a little Sleep, it will be proper to give him a Purge, but a very gentle one. Two Ounces of Manna, and a Quarter of an Ounce of Sedlitz <note n="*" place="bottom">Glauber or Epſom Salt may be ſubſtituted, where the other is not readily to be procured. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </note> Salt diſſolved in a Glaſs of clear Whey are generally ſufficient, at this Period, to purge the moſt robuſt and hardy Bodies. Manna alone may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for more delicate Conſtitutions: as all acri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſharp Purges would be highly dangerous, with Regard to the great Senſibility and tender Condition of the Stomach and of the Inteſtines, after this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>§ 299. It is ſometimes the Effect of a general Inflammation of the Blood; and is produced, like other inflammatory Diſeaſes, by extraordinary Labour, very great Heat, heating Meats or Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is often the Conſequence of other Cholics which have been injudiciouſly treated, and which otherwiſe would not have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into inflammatory ones; as I have many times ſeen theſe Cholics introduced after the uſe of heating Medicines; one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which may be ſeen § 164.</p>
                  <p>§ 300. Ten Days after I had recovered a Woman out of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cholic, the Pains returned violently in the Night. She, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to ariſe only from Wind, hoped to appeaſe them by drinking a deal of diſtilled Walnut water; which, far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any ſuch Effect, rendered them more outrageous. They were ſoon heightened to a ſurpriſing Degree, which might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected. Being ſent for very early in the Morning. I found her Pulſe hard, quick, ſhort; her Belly was tenſe and hard; ſhe complained greatly of her Loins; her Urine was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely ſtopt. She paſt but a few Drops, which felt as it were ſcalding hot, and theſe with exceſſive Pain. She went very frequently to the Cloſe-ſtool, with ſcarcely any Effect; her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, Heat, Thirſt, and the Dryneſs of her Tongue were even terrifying; and her wretched State, the Effect of the ſtrong hot Liquor ſhe had taken, made me very apprehenſive for her. One Bleeding, to the Quantity of fourteen Ounces, ſomewhat abated all the Pains; ſhe took ſeveral Glyſters, and drank off a few Pots of <hi>Orgeat</hi> in a few Hours. By theſe Means the Diſeaſe was a little mitigated; by continuing the ſame Drink and the Glyſters the Looſeneſs abated; the Pain of the Loins went off, and ſhe paſſed a conſiderable Quantity of Urine, which proved turbid, and then
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012243_0178_0F8DFBF8863BB7E8"/>
letting fall a Sediment, the Patient recovered, Nevertheleſs I verily believe, if the Bleeding had been delayed two Hours longer, this ſpirituous Walnut Water would have been the Death of her. During the Progreſs of this violent Diſeaſe, no Food is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; and we ſhould never be too inattentive to ſuch Degrees of Pain, as ſometimes remain after their Severity is over; leſt a <hi>Schirrus,</hi> an inward hard Tumour, ſhould be generated, which may occaſion the moſt inveterate and tedious Maladies.</p>
                  <p>§ 301. An Inflammation of the Inteſtines, and one of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, may alſo terminate in an Abſceſs, like an Inflammation of any other Part; and it may be apprehended that one is forming, when, though the Violence of the Pain abates, there ſtill remains a ſlow, obtuſe, heavy Pain, with general Inquietude, little Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, frequent Shiverings; the Patient at the ſame time not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering any Strength. In ſuch Caſes the Patient ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no other Drinks, but what are already directed in this Chapter, and ſome Soops made of Puls, or other farinaceous Food.</p>
                  <p>The Breaking of the Abſceſs may ſometimes be diſcovered by a ſlight Swoon or fainting Fit; attended with a perceivable Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Weight or Heavineſs in the Part, where it was lately felt: and when the <hi>Pus,</hi> or ripe Matter, is effuſed into the Gut, the Patient ſometimes has Reachings to vomit, a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Head, and the Matter appears in the next Stools. In this Caſe there remains an Ulcer within the Gut, which, if either neglected, or improperly treated, may pave the Way to a ſlow waſting Fever, and even to Death. Yet this I have cured by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Patient live ſolely upon ſkimmed Milk, diluted with one third Part Water, and by giving every other Day a Glyſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of equal Parts of Milk and Water, with the Addition of a little Honey.</p>
                  <p>When the Abſceſs breaks on the Outſide of the Gut, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges its Contents into the Cavity of the Belly, it becomes a very miſerable Caſe, and demands ſuch further Aſſiſtance as cannot be particularized here.</p>

                  <head>Of the bilious Cholic.</head>
                  <p>§ 302. The bilious Cholic diſcovers itſelf by very acute Pains, but is ſeldom accompanied with a Fever; at leaſt not until it has laſted a Day or two. And even if there ſhould be ſome Degree of a Fever, yet the Pulſe, though quick, is neither ſtrong nor hard: the Belly is neither tenſe or ſtretched as it were, nor burning hot, as in the former Cholic; the Urine comes away with more Eaſe, and is leſs high-coloured. Nevertheleſs the inward Heat and Thirſt are conſiderable; the Mouth is bitter; the Vomiting or Purging, when either of them attend it, diſcharges a yellowiſh Humour or Excrement; and the Patient's Head is often vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or dizzy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="unknown:012243_0179_0F8DFBF95CACCE18"/>§ 303. The Method of curing this is,</p>
                  <p>1, By injecting Glyſters of Whey and Honey; or, if Whey is not readily procurable, by repeating the Glyſter No. 5.</p>
                  <p>2, By making the Sick drink conſiderably of the ſame Whey, or of a Ptiſan made of the Root of Dog's-Graſs (the common Graſs) and a little Juice of Lemon; for want of which a little Vinegar and Honey may be ſubſtituted inſtead of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pullet, or rather chicken Water, but very weak, may often do inſtead of Ptiſan, or ſerve for a little Variety of Drink to ſome Patients. <hi>E. L.</hi>—K.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3, By giving every Hour one Cup of the Medicine No. 32; or, where this is not to be had, half a Drachm of Cream of Tartar at the ſame ſhort Intervals.</p>
                  <p>4, Fomentations of warm Water and Half-baths are alſo very proper.</p>
                  <p>5, If the Pains are ſharp and violent, in a robuſt ſtrong Perſon, and the Pulſe is ſtrong and tenſe, Bleeding ſhould be uſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>6, No other Nouriſhment ſhould be given, except ſome maigre Soops, made from Vegetables, and particularly from Sorrel.</p>
                  <p>7, After plentiful Dilution with the proper Drink, if no Fever ſupervenes; if the Pains ſtill continue, and the Patient diſcharges but little by Stool, he ſhould take a moderate Purge. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected No. 47 is a very proper one.</p>
                  <p>§ 304. This bilious Cholic is habitual to many Perſons; and may be prevented or greatly mitigated by an habitual Uſe of the Powder No. 24; by ſubmitting to a moderate Retrenchment in the Article of Fleſh-meat; and by avoiding heating and greaſy Food, and the Uſe of Milk.</p>

                  <p>§ 305. Under this Appellation I comprehend all thoſe Cholics, which are either owing to any overloading Quantity of Food ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at once; or to a Maſs or Accumulation of Aliments formed by Degrees in ſuch Stomachs, as digeſt but very imperfectly; or which reſult from noxious Mixtures of Aliment in the Stomach, ſuch as that of Milk and Acids; or from Food either not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in its ſelf, or degenerated into an unwholeſome Condition.</p>
                  <p>This Kind of Cholic may be known from any of theſe Cauſes having preceded it; by its Pains, which are accompanied with great Reſtleſſneſs, and come on by Degrees, being leſs fixed than in the Cholics before treated of. Theſe Cholics are alſo without any Fever, Heat, or Thirſt, but accompanied with a Giddineſs of the Head, and Efforts to vomit, and rather with a pale, than a high-coloured Viſage.</p>
                  <p>§ 306. Theſe Diſorders, from theſe laſt Cauſes, are ſcarcely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dangerous in themſelves; but may be made ſuch by injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Management, and doing more than is neceſſary or proper: as the only thing to be done is, to promote the Diſcharges by warm Drinks. There are a conſiderable Variety of them, which ſeem equally good, ſuch as warm Water, or even cold Water with a Toaſt, with the Addition either of a little Sugar, or a little Salt: a light Infuſion of Camomile, or of Elder-flowers, common Tea, or Baum, it imports little which, provided the Patient drink plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of them: in Conſequence of which the offending Matter is diſcharged, either by vomiting, or a conſiderable purging; and the ſpeedier and more in Quantity theſe Diſcharges are, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Patient is relieved.</p>
                  <p>If the Belly is remarkably full and coſtive, Glyſters of warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Salt ſhould be injected.</p>
                  <p>The Expulſion of the obſtructing Matter is alſo facilitated, by rubbing the Belly heartily with hot Cloths.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Humours, or other retained Contents of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are more pernicious from their Quality, than their Quantity; and then the Malady may be diſſipated without the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, by the irritating ſharp Humour being diluted, or even drowned, as it were, in the Abundance of ſmall watery Drinks. When the Pains invade firſt in the Stomach, they become leſs ſharp, and the Patient feels leſs Inquietude, as ſoon as the Cauſe of the Pain has deſcended out of the Stomach into the Inteſtines, whoſe Senſations are ſomething leſs acute than, or ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from, thoſe of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>It is often found that after theſe plentiful Diſcharges, and when the Pains are over, there remains a very diſagreeable Taſt in the Mouth, reſembling the Savour of rotten Eggs. This may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by giving ſome Doſes of the Powder No. 24, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely of good Water:</p>
                  <p>It is an eſſential Point in theſe Caſes to take no Food, before a perfect Recovery.</p>
                  <p>§ 307. Some have been abſurd enough in them, to fly at once to ſome heating Cordial Confection, to Venice Treacle, Aniſeed Water, Geneva, or red Wine to ſtop theſe Evacuations; but there cannot be a more fatal Practice: ſince theſe Evacuations are the only thing which can cure the Complaint, and to ſtop them is to deprive the Perſon, who was in Danger of drowning, of the Plank which might ſave him. Nay, ſhould this Endeavour of ſtopping them unhappily ſucceed, the Patient is either throws into a putrid Fever, or ſome chronical tedious Malady; unleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much wiſer than ſuch a miſerable Aſſiſtant, ſhould prevail over the Obſtacles oppoſed to her Recovery, and reſtore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Evacuations by her own Oeconomy, in the Space of a few Days.</p>
                  <p>§ 308. Sometimes an Indigeſtion happens with very little Pain or Cholic, but with violent Reachings to vomit, inexpreſſible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, Faintings, and cold Sweats: and not ſeldom alſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady begins, only with a very ſudden and unexpected Fainting:
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012243_0181_0F8DFBFA6D88C4D0"/>
the Patient immediately loſes all his Senſes, his Face is pale and wan: he has ſome Hiccups rather than Reachings to vomit, which joined to the Smallneſs of his Pulſe, to the Eaſineſs of his reſpiring or breathing, and to the Circumſtance of his being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked immediately, or very ſoon, after a Meal, makes this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order diſtinguiſhable from a real Apoplexy. Nevertheleſs, when it riſes to this Height, with theſe terrible Symptoms, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kills in a few Hours. The firſt thing to be done is to throw up a ſharp Glyſter, in which Salt and Soap are to be diſſolved; next to get down as much Salt and Water as he can ſwallow; and if that is ineffectual, the Powder No. 34 is to be diſſolved in three Cups of Water; one half of which is to be given directly; and, if it does not operate in a Quarter of an Hour, the other half. Generally ſpeaking the Patient's Senſe begins to return, as ſoon as he begins to vomit.</p>

                  <head>Of the flatulent or windy Cholic.</head>
                  <p>§ 309. Every Particular which conſtitutes our Food, whether ſolid or liquid, contains much Air, but ſome of them more than others. If they do not digeſt ſoon enough, or but badly, which occaſions a ſenſible Eſcape of ſuch Air; if they are ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an extraordinary Quantity of Air; or if the Guts being ſtraitened or compreſſed any where in the Courſe of their Extent, prevent that Air from being equally diffuſed (which muſt occaſion a greater Proportion of it in ſome Places) then the Stomach and the Guts are diſtended by this Wind; and this Diſtention occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons theſe Pains, which are called flatulent, or windy.</p>
                  <p>This Sort of Cholic rarely appears alone and ſimple; but is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complicated with, or added, as it were, to the other Sorts, of which it is a Conſequence; and is more eſpecially joined with the Cholic from Indigeſtions, whoſe Symptoms it multiplies and heightens. It may be known, like that, by the Cauſes which have preceded it, by its not being accompanied either with Fever, Heat, or Thirſt; the Belly's being large and full, though without Hardneſs, being unequal in its Largeneſs, which prevails more in one Part of it, than in another, forming ſomething like Pockets of Wind, ſometimes in one Part, ſometimes in another; and by the Patient's feeling ſome Eaſe, merely from the rubbing of his Belly, as it moves the Wind about; which eſcaping either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or downwards affords him ſtill a greater Relief.</p>
                  <p>§ 310. When it is combined with any different Species of the Cholic, it requires no diſtinct Treatment from that Species; and it is removed or diſſipated by the Medicines which cure the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes however it does happen to exiſt alone, and then it depends on the Windineſs of the ſolid and liquid Food of the Perſon affected with it, ſuch as the <hi>Muſt</hi> or new Wine, Beer, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially very new Beer, certain Fruits and Garden-ſtuff. It may
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012243_0182_0F8DFBFB36EA0390"/>
be cured by a Glyſter; by chaffing the Body with hot Cloths; by the Uſe of Drink moderately ſpiced; and eſpecially by Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile Tea, to which a little cordial Confection, or even Venice Treacle, may be added. When the Pains are almoſt entirely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and there is no Fever, nor any unhealthful Degree of Heat; and if the Patient is ſenſible of a Weakneſs at Stomach, he may take a little aromatic, or ſpiced Wine, or even a ſmall cordial ſtomachic Dram. It ſhould be obſerved, that theſe are not to be allowed in any other Kind of Cholic.</p>
                  <p>§ 311. When any Perſon is frequently ſubject to cholic-like Pains, it is a Proof that the digeſtive Faculty is impaired, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of which ſhould be carefully attended to; ſince, without this, the Health of the Patient muſt ſuffer conſiderably, and he muſt be very likely to contract many tedious and troubleſome Diſorders.</p>

                  <head>Of Cholics from Cold.</head>
                  <p>§ 312. When any Perſon has been very cold, and eſpecially in his Feet, it is not uncommon for him to be attacked, within a few Hours after it, with violent Cholic Pains, in which heating and ſpirituous Medicines are very pernicious: but which are eaſily cured by rubbing the Legs well with hot Cloths, and keeping them afterwards for a conſiderable time in warm Water; adviſing the Patient at the ſame time to drink freely of a light Infuſion of Camomile or Elder-flowers.</p>
                  <p>The Cure will be effected the ſooner, if the Patient is put to Bed and ſweats a little, eſpecially in the Legs and Feet.</p>
                  <p>A Woman who had put her Legs into a pretty cool Spring, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter travelling in the Height of Summer, was very quickly after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with a moſt violent Cholic.

                        </p>
                        <p>The Propriety or Impropriety of Bleeding in a Cholic, from this Cauſe, ſhould be determined, I think, from the State of the Perſon it happens to: So that bleeding a ſtrong Perſon with a firm Fibre, and a hard Pulſe, may be very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and precautionary: But if it be a weakly lax Subject with a ſoft and low Pulſe, there may be Room either for omitting, or for ſuſpending, it. <hi>K.</hi>

It appears throughout the Courſe of this Chapter, that it is neceſſary to be extremely on our Guard, againſt permitting the Uſe of heating and ſpirituous Medicines in Cholics, as they may not only aggravate, but even render them mortal. In ſhort they ſhould never be given, and when it is difficult to diſcover the real Cauſe of the Cholic, I adviſe Country People to confine themſelves to the three following Remedies, which cannot be hurtful in any Sort of Cholic, and may remove as many as are not of a violent Nature. Firſt then, let Glyſters be frequently repeated. 2, Let the Patient drink warm Water plentifully, or Elder-flower Tea. 3, Let the Belly be often fomented in pretty warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the moſt preferable Fomentation of any.</p>
                  <p>§ 314. I have ſaid Nothing here of the Uſe of any Oils in this Diſeaſe, as they agree but in very few Species of Cholics, and not at all in thoſe of which I lave been treating. For this Reaſon I adviſe a total Diſuſe of them, ſince they may be of bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in many Reſpects.</p>
                  <p>§ 315. Chronical Diſeaſes not coming within the Plan of this Work, I purpoſely forbear treating of any Kind of thoſe tedious Cholics, which afflict ſome People for many Years: but I think it my Duty to admoniſh ſuch, that their Torments being very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally occaſioned by Obſtructions in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or different Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the Belly, or by ſome other Fault, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe Organs, which are intended to prepare the Bile, they ſhould, 1, avoid with the greateſt Care, the Uſe of ſharp, hot, violent Medicines, Vomits, ſtrong Purges, Elixirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2, They ſhould be thoroughly on their Guard againſt all thoſe, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them a very ſpeedy Cure, by the Aſſiſtance of ſome ſpecific Remedy; and ought to look upon them as Mountebanks, into whoſe Hands it is highly dangerous to truſt themſelves. 3, They ſhould be perſuaded, or rather convinced, that they can entertain no reaſonable Hope of being cured, without an exact Conformity to a proper and judicious Regimen; and a long Perſeverance in a Courſe of mild and ſafe Remedies. 4, They ſhould continually reflect with themſelves, that there is little Difficulty in doing them great Miſchief; and that their Complaints are of that Sort, which require the greateſt Knowledge and Prudence in thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom the Treatment and Cure of them are confided.</p>

               <p>SECT. 316. THESE violent Diſeaſes are fatal to many Country People, while their Neighbours are frequently ſo ignorant of the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012243_0184_0F8DFBFCA960F4E0"/>
Cauſe of their Death, that Superſtition has aſcribed it to Poiſon, or to Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>§ 317. The firſt of theſe, the <hi>Miſerere,</hi> or Iliac Paſſion, is one of the moſt excruciating Diſtempers. If any Part of the Inteſtines, the Cavity of the Guts is cloſed up, whatever may have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, the Courſe or Deſcent of the Food they contain is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtopped; in which Caſe it frequently happens, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Motion obſerved in the Guts of a living Animal diſſected, and which was intended to detrude, or force their Contents downwards, is propagated in a directly contrary Manner, from the Guts towards the Mouth.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe ſometimes begins after a Conſtipation, or Coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of ſome Days; at other times without that Coſtiveneſs, having been preceded by Pains in any Part of the Belly, eſpecially around the Navel; but which Pains, gradually increaſing after their Commencement, at length become extremely violent, and throw the Patient into exceſſive Anguiſh. In ſome of theſe Caſes a hard Tumour may be felt, which ſurrounds the Belly like a Cord. The Flatulences within become very audible, ſome of them are diſcharged upwards; in a little time after, Vomitings come on, which increaſe till the Patient has thrown up all he had taken in, with a ſtill further Augmentation of the exceſſive Pain. With the firſt of his Vomitings he only brings up the laſt Food he had taken, with his Drink and ſome yellowiſh Humour: but what comes up afterwards proves ſtinking; and when the Diſeaſe is greatly heightened, they have what is called the Smell of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Dung; but which rather reſembles that of a putrid dead Body. It happens too ſometimes, that if the Sick have taken Glyſters compoſed of Materials of a ſtrong Smell; the ſame Smell is perceivable in the Matter they vomit up. I confeſs, however, I never ſaw either real Excrements, or the Subſtance of their Glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, brought up, much leſs the Suppoſitories that were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Fundament: and were it credible that Inſtances of this Kind had occurred, they muſt be allowed very difficult to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for.

               <p>§ 318 As this Diſeaſe is highly dangerous, the Moment it is ſtrongly apprehended, it is neceſſary to oppoſe it by proper Means and Remedies: the ſmalleſt Error may be of fatal Conſequence, and hot inflaming Liquids have been known to kill the Patient in a few Hours. I was called in the ſecond Day of the Diſeaſe to a young Perſon, who had taken a good deal of Venice Treacle: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012243_0185_0F8DFBFDCD3D30D0"/>
could afford her any Relief, and ſhe died early on the third Day.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe ſhould be treated preciſely in the ſame Manner as an inflammatory Cholic; the principal Difference being, that in the former there are no Stools, but continual Vomitings.</p>
               <p>1, Firſt of all then the Patient ſhould be plentifully bled, if the Phyſician has been called in early enough, and before the Sick has loſt his Strength.</p>
               <p>2, He ſhould receive opening Glyſters made of a Decoction of Barley Water, with five or ſix Ounces of Oil in each.</p>
               <p>3, We ſhould endeavour to allay the violent Efforts to vomit, by giving every two Hours a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 48.</p>
               <p>4, The Sick ſhould drink plentifully, in very ſmall Quantities, very often repeated, of an appeaſing, diluting, refreſhing Drink, which tends at the ſame time to promote both Stools and Urine. Nothing is preferable to the Whey No. 49, if it can be had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: if not, give ſimple clear Whey ſweetened with Honey, and the Drinks preſcribed § 298, Art. 3.</p>
               <p>5, The Patient is to be put into a warm Bath, and kept there as long as he can bear it; repeating it as often daily too, as his Strength will permit.</p>
               <p>6, After Bleeding, warm Bathing, repeated Glyſters and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, if each and all of theſe have availed nothing; the Fume or Smoak of Tobacco may be introduced in the Manner of a Glyſter, of which I ſhall ſpeak further, in the Chapter on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons drowned.</p>
               <p>I cured a Perſon of this Diſeaſe, by conveying him into a Bath, immediately after bleeding him, and giving him a Purge on his going into the Bath.</p>
               <p>§ 319. If the Pain abates before the Patient has quite loſt his Strength; if the Pulſe improves at the ſame time; if the Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are leſs in Number, and in the Quantity of the Matter brought up; if that Matter ſeems in a leſs putrid offenſive State; if he feels ſome Commotion and Rumbling in his Bowels; if he has ſome little Diſcharge by Stool; and if at the ſame time he feels himſelf a little ſtronger than before, his Cure may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be expected; but if he is otherwiſe circumſtanced he will ſoon depart. It frequently happens, a ſingle Hour before Death, that the Pain ſeems to vaniſh, and a ſurprizing Quantity of extremely foetid Matter is diſcharged by Stool: the Patient is ſuddenly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great Weakneſs and Sinking, falls into a cold Sweat, and immediately expires.</p>
               <p>§ 320. This is the Diſeaſe which the common People attribute to, and term, the <hi>Twiſting of the Guts</hi>; and in which they make the Patient ſwallow Bullets, or large Quantities of Quick-ſilver. This twiſting, tangling, or knotting of the Guts is an utter, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Chimera; for how can they admit of ſuch a Circumſtance, as one of their Extremities, their Ends, is connected to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the other irremovably faſtened to the Skin of the Fork
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012243_0186_0F8DFBFE2E3EEDA0"/>
or Cleft of the Buttocks? In fact this Diſeaſe reſults from a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Cauſes, which have been diſcovered on a Diſſection of thoſe who have died of it. It were to be wiſhed indeed this prudent Cuſtom, ſo extremely conducive to enrich, and to perfect, the Art of Phyſic, were to prevail more generally; and which we ought rather to conſider as a Duty to comply with, than a Difficulty to ſubmit to; as it is our Duty to contribute to the Perfection of a Science, on which the Happineſs of Mankind ſo conſiderably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. I ſhall not enter into a Detail of theſe Cauſes; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, the Practice of ſwallowing Bullets in the Diſeaſe is always pernicious, and the like Uſe of Mercury muſt be often ſo<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding this, a Practitioner of great Probity and Experience aſſures me, he has ſeen a Cure affected in this Caſe, by giving two Ounces of Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, every third Hour, when every other Remedy had been ineffectual. <hi>K.</hi>

                  <head>Of the Cholera-morbus.</head>
                  <p>§ 321. This Diſeaſe is a ſudden, abundant, and painful Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, by vomiting and by Stool.</p>
                  <p>It begins with much Flatulence, or Wind, with ſwelling and ſlight Pains in the Belly, accompanied with great Dejection; and followed with large Evacuations either by Stool or by Vomit at firſt, but whenever either of them has begun, the other quickly follows. The Matter evacuated is either yellowiſh, green, brown, whitiſh, or black; the Pains in the Belly are violent; the Pulſe, (almoſt conſtantly feveriſh,) is ſometimes ſtrong at firſt, but ſoon ſinks into Weakneſs, in Conſequence of the prodigious Diſcharge. Some Patients purge a hundred times in the Compaſs of a few Hours; they may even be ſeen to fall away; and if the Diſeaſe exiſts in a violent Degree, they are ſcarcely to be known within three or four Hours from the Commencement of theſe Diſcharges. After a great Number of them they are afflicted with Spaſms or Cramps, in their Legs, Thighs, and Arms, which torment them as much as the Pains in the Belly. When the Diſeaſe rages too highly to be aſſwaged, Hiccups, Convulſions, and a Coldneſs of the Extremities approach; there is a ſcarcely intermitting Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fainting, or ſwooning Fits, the Patient dying either in one of them, or in Convulſions.</p>
                  <p>§ 322. This Diſeaſe, which conſtantly depends on Bile raiſed to the higheſt Acrimony, commonly prevails towards the End of July and in Auguſt: eſpecially if the Heats have been very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and there have been little or no Summer Fruits, which greatly conduce to attemper and allay the putreſcent Acrimony of the Bile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="unknown:012243_0187_0F8DFBFF77F1F1F8"/>§ 323. Nevertheleſs, however violent this Diſtemper may be, it is leſs dangerous, and alſo leſs tormenting than the former, many Perſons recovering from it.</p>
                  <p>1, Our firſt Endeavour ſhould be to dilute, or even to drown this acrid Bile, by Draughts, by Deluges, of the moſt mitigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drinks; the Irritation being ſo very great, that every thing having the leaſt Sharpneſs is injurious. Wherefore the Patient ſhould continually take in, by Drink, and by Way of Glyſter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Barley Water, Almond-Milk, or pure Water; with one eighth Part Milk, which has ſucceeded very well in my Practice. Or he may uſe a very light Decoction, or Ptiſan, as it were, of Bread, which is made by gently boiling a Pound of toaſted Bread in three or four Pots of Water for half an Hour. In <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> we prefer Oat-bread. We alſo ſucceſsfully uſe pounded Rye, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a light Ptiſan of it.</p>
                  <p>A very light thin Soup made of a Pullet, a Chicken, or of one Pound of lean Veal, in three Pots of Water, is very proper too in this Diſeaſe. Whey is alſo employed to good Purpoſe; and in thoſe Places where it can eaſily be had, Butter-milk is the beſt Drink of any. But, whichever of theſe Drinks ſhall be thought preferable, it is a neceſſary Point to drink very plentifully of it; and the Glyſters ſhould be given every two Hours.</p>
                  <p>2, If the Patient is of a robuſt Conſtitution, and ſanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, with a ſtrong Pulſe at the Time of the Attack, and the Pains are very ſevere, a firſt, and in ſome Caſes a ſecond Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, very early on the Invaſion, aſſwages the Violence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, and allows more Leiſure for the Aſſiſtance of other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. I have ſeen the Vomiting ceaſe almoſt entirely, after the firſt Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>The Rage of this Diſeaſe abates a little after a Duration of five or ſix Hours: We muſt not however, during this Remiſſion, or Abatement, forbear to throw in proper Remedies; ſince it returns ſoon after with great Force, which Return however indicates no Alteration of the Method already entered upon.</p>
                  <p>3, In general, the warm Bath refreſhes the Patient while he continues in it: but the Pains frequently return ſoon after he is taken out; which, however, is no Reaſon for omitting it, ſince it has frequently been found to give a more durable Relief. The Patient ſhould continue in it a conſiderable Time, and, during that Time, he ſhould take ſix or ſeven Glaſſes of the Potion No. 32, which has been very efficacious in this Diſeaſe. By theſe Means the Vomiting has been ſtopt; and the Patient, upon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Bath, has had ſeveral large Stools, which very conſiderably diminiſhed the Violence of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>4, If the Patient's Attendants are terrified by theſe great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, and determine to check them (however prematurely) by Venice Treacle, Mint Water, Syrup of white Poppies, called Diacodium, by Opium or Mithridate, it either happens, that the Diſeaſe and all its Symptoms are heightened, to which I have
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012243_0188_0F8DFBFFA5F77F68"/>
been a Witneſs; or, if the Evacuations ſhould actually be ſtopt, the Patient, in Conſequence of it, is thrown into a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Condition. I have been obliged to give a Purge, in order to renew the Diſcharges, to a Man, who had been thrown into a violent Fever, attended with a raging <hi>Delirium,</hi> by a Medicine compoſed of Venice Treacle, Mithridate and Oil. Such Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ought not to be employed, until the Smallneſs of the Pulſe, great Weakneſs, violent and almoſt continual Cramps, and even the Inſufficience of the Patient's Efforts to vomit, make us appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of his ſinking irrecoverably. In ſuch Circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he ſhould take every Quarter or half Quarter of an Hour, a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 50, ſtill continuing the diluting Drinks. After the firſt Hour, they ſhould only be given every Hour, and that only to the Extent of eight Doſes. But I deſire to inſiſt upon it here, that this Medicine ſhould not be given too early in this Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>§ 324. If the Patient is likely to recover, the Pains and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations gradually abate; the Thirſt is leſs; the Pulſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues very quick, but it becomes regular. There have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Propenſity to a heavy Kind of Drowſineſs at this time; for perfect refreſhing Sleep advances but ſlowly after this Diſeaſe. It will ſtill be proper to perſevere in the Medicines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready directed, though ſomewhat leſs frequently. And now we may begin to allow the Patient a few Soups from farinaceous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subſtances; and as ſoon as the Evacuations accompanying this Diſeaſe are evidently ceaſed, and the Pains are vaniſhed, though an acute Senſibility and great Weakneſs continue, beſide ſuch Soups, he may be allowed ſome new-laid Eggs, very lightly boiled, or even raw, for ſome Days. After this he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Regimen ſo frequently recommended to Perſons in a State of Recovery: when the concurring Uſe of the Powder No. 24, taken twice a Day, will greatly aſſiſt to haſten and eſtabliſh his Health.</p>

               <p>SECT. 325. EVERY one knows what is meant by a Looſeneſs or Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Populace frequently call a Flux, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Cholic.</p>
               <p>There are certain very chronical, or tedious and obſtinate ones, which ariſe from ſome eſſential Fault in the Conſtitution. Of ſuch, as foreign to my Plan, I ſhall ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:012243_0189_0F8DFC02B71E6D88"/>Thoſe which come on ſuddenly, without any preceding Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, except ſometimes a ſlight Qualm or ſhort Loathing, and a Pain in the Loins and Knees; which are not attended with ſmart Pains nor a Fever (and frequently without any Pain, or any other Complaint) are oftner of Service than prejudicial. They carry off a Heap of Matter that may have been long amaſſed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the Body; which, if not diſcharged, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome Diſtemper; and, far from weakening the Body, ſuch Purgings as theſe render it more ſtrong, light and active.</p>
               <p>§ 326. Such therefore ought by no Means to be ſtopped, nor even ſpeedily checked: they generally ceaſe of themſelves, as ſoon as all the noxious Matter is diſcharged; and as they require no Medicine, it is only neceſſary to retrench conſiderably from the ordinary Quantity of Nouriſhment; to abſtain from Fleſh, Eggs and Wine or other ſtrong Drink; to live only on ſome Soaps, on Puls, or on a little Fruit, whether raw or baked, and to drink ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs than uſual. A ſimple Ptiſan with a little Syrup of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaire,</hi> or Maiden hair, is ſufficient in theſe Purgings, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no Venice Treacle, Confection, nor any Drug whatever.</p>
               <p>§ 327. But ſhould it continue more than five or ſix Days, and manifeſtly weaken the Patient: if the Pain attending it grows a little ſevere; and eſpecially if the Irritation, the urging to Stool, proves more frequent, it becomes ſeaſonable to check or to ſtop it. For this Purpoſe the Patient is to be put into a Regimen; and if the Looſeneſs has been accompanied with a great Loathing, with Riſings or Wamblings at Stomach, with a foul furred Tongue, and a bad Taſt in the Mouth, he muſt take the Powder No. 35. But if theſe Symptoms do not appear, give him that of No. 51: and during the three following Hours, let him take, every half Hour, a Cup of weak light Broth, without any Fat on it.</p>
               <p>If the Purging, after being reſtrained by this Medicine, ſhould return within a few Days, it would ſtrongly infer, there was ſtill ſome tough viſcid Matter within, that required Evacuation. To effect this he ſhould take the Medicines No. 21, 25 or 27; and afterwards take faſting, for two ſucceſſive Mornings, half the Powder No. 51.</p>
               <p>On the Evening of that Day when the Patient took No. 35, or No. 51, or any other Purge, he may take a ſmall Doſe of Venice Treacle.</p>
               <p>§ 328. A Purging is often neglected for a long time, without obſerving the leaſt Regimen, from which Neglect they degenerate into tedious, and as it were, habitual, perpetual ones, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely weaken the Patient. In ſuch Caſes the Medicine No. 35 ſhould be given firſt; then, every other Day for four times ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, he ſhould take No. 51: during all which time he ſhould li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV. Of the Dyſentery, or Bloody-flux.</head>
               <p>SECT. 329. THE Dyſentery is a Flux or Looſeneſs of the Belly, attended with great Reſtleſſneſs and Anguiſh, with ſevere Gripings, and frequent Propenſities to go to Stool. There is generally a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Blood in the Stools, though this is not a conſtant Symptom, and is not eſſential to the Exiſtence of a Dyſentery; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it may not be much leſs dangerous, for the Abſence of this Symptom.</p>
               <p>§ 330. The Dyſentery is often epidemical; beginning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the End of July, though oftner in Auguſt, and going off when the Froſts ſet in. The great preceding Heats render the Blood and the Bile acrid and ſharp; and though during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Heat, Perſpiration is kept up (See Introduct. P. 14) yet as ſoon as the Heat abates, eſpecially in the Mornings and Evenings, that Diſcharge is diminiſhed; and by how much the more Viſcidity or Thickneſs the Humours have acquired, in Conſequence of the violent Heats, (the Diſcharge of the ſharp Humour by Perſpiration being now checked,) it is thrown upon the Bowels, which it irritates, producing Pains in, and Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them.</p>
               <p>This Kind of Dyſentery may happen at all times, and in all Countries; but if other Cauſes, capable of producing a Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Humours, be complicated with it; ſuch as the croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a great Number of People into very little Room, and very cloſe Quarters, as in Hoſpitals, Camps, or Priſons, this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a malignant Principle into the Humours, which, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the ſimple Cauſe of the Dyſentery, renders it the more difficult and dangerous.</p>
               <p>§ 331. This Diſeaſe begins with a general Coldneſs rather than a Shivering, which laſts ſome Hours; the Patient's Strength ſoon abates, and he feels ſharp Pains in his Belly, which ſometimes continue for ſeveral Hours, before the Flux begins. He is affected with <hi>Vertigos,</hi> or Swimmings in the Head, with Reachings to vomit, and grows pale; his Pulſe at the ſame time being very little, if at all, feveriſh, but commonly ſmall, and at length the Purging begins. The firſt Stools are often thin, and yellowiſh; but in a little time they are mixt with a viſcid ropy Matter, which
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:012243_0191_0F8DFC04ED1590A0"/>
is often tinged with Blood. Their Colour and Conſiſtence are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious too, being either brown, greeniſh, or black, thinner or thicker, and foetid. The Pains increaſe before each of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, which grow very frequent, to the Number of eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen in an Hour: then the Fundament becomes conſiderably irritated, and the <hi>Teneſmus</hi> (which is a great Urgency to go to Stool, though without any Effect) is joined to the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery or Flux, and often brings on a Protruſion or falling down of the Fundament, the Patient being now moſt ſeverely afflicted. Worms are ſometimes voided, and glairy hairy Humours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Pieces of Peelings of Guts, and ſometimes Clots of Blood.</p>
               <p>If the Diſtemper riſes to a violent Height, the Guts become inflamed, which terminates either in Suppuration or in Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the miſerable Patient diſcharges <hi>Pus,</hi> or black and foetid watery Stools: The Hiccup ſupervenes; he grows delirious; his Pulſe ſinks; and he falls into cold Sweats and Faintings which terminate in Death.</p>
               <p>A kind of Phrenzy, or raging <hi>Delirium,</hi> ſometimes comes on before the Minute of Expiration. I have ſeen a very unuſual Symptom accompany this Diſeaſe in two Perſons, which was an Impoſſibility of ſwallowing, for three Days before Death.</p>
               <p>But in general this Diſtemper is not ſo extremely violent; the Diſcharges are leſs frequent, being from twenty-five to forty within a Day and Night. Their Contents are leſs various and uncommon, and mixed with very little Blood; the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more Strength; the Number of Stools gradually decreaſes; the Blood diſappears; the Conſiſtence of the Diſcharges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; Sleep and Appetite return, and the Sick recover.</p>
               <p>Many of the Sick have not the leaſt Degree or Fever, nor of Thirſt, which perhaps is leſs common in this Diſeaſe, than in a ſimple Purging or Looſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Their Urine ſometimes is but in a ſmall Quantity; and many Patients have ineffectual Endeavours to paſs it, to their no ſmall Affliction and Reſtleſſneſs.</p>
               <p>§ 332. The moſt efficacious Remedy for this Diſeaſe is a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. That of No. 34. (when there is no preſent Circumſtance that forbids the giving a Vomit) if taken immediately on the firſt Invaſion of it, often removes it at once; and always ſhortens its Duration. That of No. 35 is not leſs effectual; it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered for a long time, even as a certain Specific, which it is not, though a very uſeful Medicine. If the Stools prove leſs frequent after the Operation of either of them, it is a good Sign; if they are no ways diminiſhed, we may apprehend the Diſeaſe is like to be tedious and obſtinate.</p>
               <p>The Patient is to be ordered to a Regimen, abſtaining from all Fleſh-meat with the ſtricteſt Attention, until the perfect Cure of the Diſeaſe. The Ptiſan No. 3 is the beſt Drink for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="unknown:012243_0192_0F8DFC05C4FA6230"/>The Day after the Vomit, he muſt take the Powder No. 51 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Doſes: the next Day he ſhould take no other Medicine but his Ptiſan; on the fourth the Rhubarb muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, after which the Violence of the Diſeaſe commonly abates. His Diet during the Diſeaſe is nevertheleſs to be continued exactly for ſome Days; after which he may be allowed to enter upon that of Perſons in a State of Recovery.</p>
               <p>§ 333. The Dyſentery ſometimes commences with an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Fever; a feveriſh, hard, full Pulſe, with a violent Pain in the Head, and Loins, and a ſtiff diſtended Belly. In ſuch a Caſe the Patient muſt be bled once; and daily receive three or even four of the Glyſters No. 6, drinking plentifully of the Drink No. 3.</p>
               <p>When all Dread of an Inflammation is entirely over, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to be treated in the Manner juſt related; though often there is no Neceſſity for the Vomit: and if the inflammatory Symptoms have run high, his firſt Purge ſhould be that of No. 11, and the Uſe of the Rhubarb may be poſtponed, till about the manifeſt Concluſion of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I have cured many Dyſenteries, by ordering the Sick no other Remedy, but a Cup of warm Water every Quarter of an Hour; and it were better to rely only on this ſimple Remedy, which muſt be of ſome Utility, than to employ thoſe, of whoſe Effects Country People are ignorant, and which are often productive of very dangerous ones.</p>
               <p>§ 334. It ſometimes happens that the Dyſentery is combined with a putrid Fever, which makes it neceſſary, after the Vomit, to give the Purges No. 23 or 47, and ſeveral Doſes of No. 24, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rhubarb is given. No. 32 is excellent in this combined Caſe.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> in the Autumn of 1755, after a very numerous Prevalence of epidemical putrid Fevers had ceaſed, a Multitude of Dyſenteries, which had no ſmall Affinity with, or Relation to, ſuch Fevers. I treated them firſt, with the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 34, giving afterwards No. 32; and I directed the Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb only to very few, and that towards the Concluſion of the Diſeaſe. By much the greater Number of them were cured at the End of four or five Days. A ſmall Proportion of them, to whom I could not give the Vomit, or whoſe Caſes were more compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, remained languid a conſiderable time, though without Fatality or Danger</p>
               <p>§ 335. When the Dyſentery is blended with Symptoms of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity (See § 245.) after premiſing the Preſcription No. 35, thoſe of No. 38 and 39 may be called in ſucceſsfully.</p>
               <p>§ 336. When the Diſeaſe has already been of many Days ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the Patient's having taken any Medicines, or only ſuch as were injurious to him, he muſt be treated as if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper had but juſt commenced; unleſs ſome Symptoms, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the Nature of the Dyſentery, have ſupervened upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="unknown:012243_0193_0F8DFC066EA24738"/>§ 337. Relapſes ſometimes occur in Dyſenteries, ſome few Days after the Patients appeared well; much the greater Number of which are occaſioned either by ſome Error in Diet, by cold Air, or by being conſiderably over-heated. They are to be prevented by avoiding theſe Cauſes of them; and may be removed by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Patient on his Regimen, and giving him one Doſe of the Preſcription No. 51. Should it return even without any ſuch diſcoverable Cauſes, and if it manifeſts itſelf to be the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper renewed, it muſt be treated as ſuch.</p>
               <p>§ 338. This Diſeaſe is ſometimes combined too with an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever; in which Caſe the Dyſentery muſt be removed firſt, and the Intermittent afterwards. Nevertheleſs, if at each Acceſs, the Fits of the Fever have been very ſtrong, Bark muſt be given as directed, § 259.</p>
               <p>§ 339. One pernicious Prejudice, which ſtill generally prevails is, that Fruits are noxious in a Dyſentery, that they even give it, and aggravate it; and this perhaps is an extremely ill-grounded one. In truth bad Fruits, and ſuch as have not ripened well, in unſeaſonable Years, may really occaſion Cholics, a Looſeneſs (though oftner a Coſtiveneſs) and Diſorders of the Nerves, and of the Skin; but never can occaſion an epidemical Dyſentery or Flux. Ripe Fruits, of whatever Species, and eſpecially Summer Fruits, are the real Preſervatives from this Diſeaſe. The greateſt Miſchief they can effect, muſt reſult from their thinning and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Humours, eſpecially the mick glutinous Bile, if they are in ſuch a State; good ripe Fruits being the true Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of ſuch; in Conſequence of which indeed they may bring on a Purging, but ſuch a one, as is rather a Guard againſt a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery.</p>
               <p>We had a great, an extraordinary Abundance of Fruit in 1759 and 1760, but ſcarcely any Dyſenteries. It has even been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be more rare, and leſs dangerous than formerly; and if the Fact is certain, it cannot be attributed to any thing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, than to the very numerous Plantations of Trees, which have rendered Fruit very plenty, cheap and common. Whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have obſerved Dyſenteries to prevail. I made it a Rule to eat leſs Fleſh, and Plenty of Fruit; I have never had the ſlighteſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of one; and ſeveral Phyſicians uſe the ſame Caution with the ſame Succeſs.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen eleven Patients in a Dyſentery in one Houſe, of whom nine were very tractable: they eat Fruit and recovered. The Grandmother and one Child, whom ſhe loved more than the reſt, were carried off. She managed the Child after her own F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhion, with burnt Wine, Oil, and ſome Spices, but no Fruit. She conducted herſelf in the very ſame Manner, and both died.</p>
               <p>In a Country Seat near <hi>Berne,</hi> in the Year 1751, when theſe Fluxes made great Havock, and People were ſeverely warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Uſe of Fruits, out of eleven Perſons in the Family, ten eat plentifully of Plums, and not one of them was ſeized with it;
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012243_0194_0F8DFC0726DB20D8"/>
The poor Coachman alone rigidly obſerved that Abſtinence from Fruit injoined by this Prejudice, and took a terrible Dyſentery.</p>
               <p>This ſame Diſtemper had nearly deſtroyed a Swiſs Regiment in Garriſon in the South of <hi>France</hi>; the Captains purchaſed the whole Crop of ſeveral Acres of Vineyard; there they carried the ſick Soldiers, and gathered the Grapes for ſuch as could not bear being carried into the Vineyard; thoſe who were well eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; after this not one more died, nor were any more even attacked with the Dyſentery.</p>
               <p>A Clergyman was ſeized with a Dyſentery, which was not in the leaſt mitigated by any Medicines he had taken. By meer Chance he ſaw ſome red Currans; he longed for them, and eat three Pounds of them between ſeven and nine o'Clock in the Morning; that very Day he became better, and was entirely well on the next.</p>
               <p>I could greatly enlarge the Number of ſuch Inſtances; but theſe may ſuffice to convince the moſt incredulous, whom I thought it might be of ſome Importance to convince. Far from forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good Fruit, when Diſenteries rage, the Patients ſhould be encouraged to eat them freely; and the Directors of the Police, inſtead of prohibiting them, ought to ſee the Markets well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with them. It is a Fact of which Perſons, who have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully informed themſelves, do not in the leaſt doubt. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence demonſtrates it, and it is founded in Reaſon, as good Fruit counter-operates all the Cauſes of Dyſenteries<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Experience of all Countries and Times ſo ſtrongly confirms theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths, that they cannot be too often repeated, too generally publiſhed, whenever and wherever this Diſeaſe rages. The Succeſſion of cold Showers to violent Heats; too moiſt a Conſtitution of the Air; an Exceſs of animal Food; Uncleanlineſs and Contagion, are the frequent Cauſes of epidemical Fluxes. <hi>E.

               <p>§ 340. It is important and even neceſſary, that each Subject of this Diſeaſe ſhould have a Cloſe-ſtool or Convenience apart to himſelf, as the Matter diſcharged is extremely infectious: and if they make uſe of Bed-pans, they ſhould be carried immediately out of the Chamber, the Air of which ſhould be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, burning Vinegar frequently in it.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very neceſſary to change the Patient's Linen frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; without all which Precautions the Diſtemper becomes more violent, and attacks others who live in the ſame Houſe. Hence it

               <p>It was BOERHAAVE's Opinion, that all the Water which was drank, while Dyſenteries were epidemical, ſhould be <hi>ſtummed,</hi> as we term it, or ſulphurized <note n="*" place="bottom">Our learned Author, or his medical Editor at <hi>Lyons,</hi> obſerves here, `that in the Edition of this Treatiſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> there was an eſſential Miſtake, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Boerhaave</hi> recommend the Addition of Brandy, <hi>Eau de vie,</hi> inſtead of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or ſulphurizing it, for which this Note, and the Text too uſe the Verb <hi>branter,</hi> which Word we do not find in any Dictionary.

               <p>§ 341. It has happened, by ſome unaccountable Fatality, that there is no Diſeaſe, for which a greater Number of Remedies are adviſed, than for the Dyſentery. There is ſcarcely any Perſon who boaſts not of his own Preſcription, in Preference to all the reſt, and who does not boldly engage to cure, and that within a few Hours, a tedious ſevere Diſeaſe (of which he has formed no juſt Notion) with ſome Medicine or Compoſition, of whoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he is totally ignorant: while the poor Sufferer, reſtleſs and impatient, ſwallows every Body's Recommendation, and gets poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned either through Fear, downright Diſguſt or Wearineſs, or through entire Complaiſance. Of theſe many boaſted Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome are only indifferent, but others pernicious. I ſhall not pretend to detail all I know myſelf, but after repeatedly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the only true Method of Cure is that I have adviſed here, the Purpoſe of which is evacuating the offending Matter; I alſo affirm that all thoſe Methods, which have a different Scope or Drift, are pernicious; but ſhall particularly obſerve, that the Method moſt generally followed, which is that of ſtopping the Stools by Aſtringents, or by Opiates, is the worſt of all, and even ſo mortal a one, as to deſtroy a Multitude of People annually, and which throws others into incurable Diſeaſes. By preventing the Diſcharge of theſe Stools, and incloſing the Wolf in the Fold, it either follows, 1, that this <note n="†" place="bottom">A firſt or ſecond Doſe of Glauber Salt has been known to ſucceed in the epidemical Summer Fluxes of the hotter Climates, when repeated Doſes of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and Opiates had failed. Such Inſtances ſeem a collateral Confirmation of Dr. TISSOT's rational and ſucceſsful Uſe of cooling opening Fruits in them. The vitriolic Salt, juſt recommended, probably reſtrains the Efferveſcence of the Blood; and imparts, by its ſtyptic Quality, more Tone and Firmneſs to the Bowels, than any warm Evacuant could, during the intemperate Heats, which tend to produce colliquative Fluxes. <hi>K.</hi>

               <p>I have been conſulted on Account of a terrible Rheumatiſm, which enſued immediately after taking a Mixture of Venice Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Plantain, on the ſecond Day of a Dyſentery.</p>

Neither are Purges without their Abuſe and Danger; they determine the Courſe of all the Humours more violently to the tender afflicted Parts; the Body becomes exhauſted; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions fail; the Bowels are weakened, and ſometimes even lightly ulcerated, whence incurable <hi>Diarrhoeas</hi> or Purgings enſue, and prove fatal after many Years Affliction.</p>

At firſt one or two little Pimples or Puſtules appear, filled with a Kind of clear Water, and excite a very diſagreeable Itching. If theſe Puſtules are broke by ſcratching them, the Water oozing from them infects the neighbouring Parts. At the Beginning of this Infection it can ſcarcely be diſtinguiſhed, if a Perſon is not well apprized of its Nature; but in the Progreſs of it, the little Puſtules increaſe both in Number and Size; and when they are opened by ſcratching, a loathſome Kind of Scab is
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012243_0197_0F8A6D31803C0348"/>
formed, and the Malady extends over the whole Surface. Where they continue long, they produce ſmall Ulcers, and are at that time highly contagious.</p>
               <p>§ 345. Bad Diet, particularly the Uſe of ſalted Meat, bad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Fruit, and Uncleanlineſs occaſion this Diſeaſe: though it is oftneſt taken by Contagion. Some very good Phyſicians ſuppoſe it is never contracted otherwiſe; but I muſt take Leave to diſſent, as I have certainly ſeen it exiſt without Contagion.</p>
               <p>When it happens to a Perſon, who cannot ſuſpect he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by Contact, his Cure ſhould commence with a total Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from all ſalt, ſour, fat, and ſpicy Food. He ſhould drink a Ptiſan of wild and bitter Succory, or that of No. 26, five or ſix Glaſſes of which may be daily taken; at the End of four or five Days, he may be purged with No. 21, or with an Ounce of <hi>Sedlitz</hi> [or <hi>Glauber</hi>] Salt. His Abſtinence, his Regimen is to be continued; the Purge to be repeated after ſix or ſeven Days; and then all the Parts affected, and thoſe very near them, are to be rubbed in the Morning faſting, with a fourth Part of the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment No. 52. The three following Days the ſame Friction is to be repeated, after which the ſame Quantity of Ointment is to be procured, and uſed in the ſame Proportion; but only every other Day. It happens but ſeldom that this Method fails to remove this diſagreeable Malady; ſometimes however it will return, in which Caſe the Patient muſt be purged again, and then recur to the Ointment, whoſe good Effects I have experienced, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do.</p>
               <p>If the Diſeaſe has been very lately contracted, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by Contact, the Ointment may be fearleſsly employed, as ſoon as it is diſcovered, without taking any Purge before it. But if, on the contrary, the Diſeaſe has been long neglected, and has roſe to a high Degree, it will be neceſſary to reſtrain the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a long time to the Regimen I have directed; he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly purged, and then drink plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 26, before the Ointment is rubbed in. When the Malady is thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, I have always begun with the Ointment No. 28, half a Quarter of which is to be uſed every Morning. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo frequently omitted the Uſe of that No. 52, having always found the former as certain, but a little flower in its Effects.</p>
               <p>§ 346. While theſe Medicines are employed, the Patient muſt avoid all Cold and Wet, eſpecially if he makes Uſe of No. 28, <note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen a pretty ſingular Conſequence from the Abuſe of mercurial Unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Itch; whether it happened from the Strength or Quantity of the Ointment, or from taking Cold after applying it, as this Subject, a healthy Youth of about ſixteen, probably did, by riding three or four Miles through the Rain. But without any other previous Complaint, he awoke quite blind one Morning, wondering, as he ſaid, when it would be Day. His Eyes were very clear, and free from Inflammation, but the Pupil was wholly immovable, as in a <hi>Gutta Serena.</hi> I effected the Cure by ſome moderate Purges repeated a few Times; by diſpoſing him to ſweat, from lying pretty much in Bed (it being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Winter) and by promoting his Perſpiration chiefly with Sulphur: After which the ſhaved Scalp was embrocated with a warm nervous Mixture, in which Balſam of <hi>Peru</hi>: was a conſiderable Ingredient. In ſomething leſs than three Weeks he could diſcern a glowing Fire, or the bright Flame of a Candle. As his Sight increaſed, he diſcerned other Objects, which appeared for ſome Days inverted to him, with their Colours confuſed; but Red was moſt diſtinguiſhable. He diſcovered the Aces ſooner than other Cards; and in about ſix or ſeven Weeks recovered his full Sight in all its natural Strength, which he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. <hi>K.</hi>

in which there is Quick-ſilver; which, if ſuch Precautions were neglected, might bring on a Swelling of the Throat and Gums, and even riſe to a Salivation. Yet this Ointment has one Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in its having no Smell, and being ſuſceptible of an agreeable one; while it is very difficult to diſguiſe the diſagreeable Odour of the other.</p>
               <p>The Linen of a Perſon in this Diſeaſe ought to be often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but his upper Cloaths muſt not be changed: becauſe theſe having been infected, might, when worn again, communicate the Itch to the Wearer again, after he had been cured.</p>
               <p>Shirts, Breeches, and Stockings may be fumigated with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, before they are put on; and this Fumigation ſhould be made in the open Air.</p>
               <p>§ 347. If this Diſorder becomes very inveterate and tedious, it exhauſts the Patient in Conſequence of its not ſuffering him to ſleep at Nights, as well as by his reſtleſs Irritation; and ſometimes even brings on a Fever, ſo that he falls away in Fleſh, and his Strength abates.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Caſe he muſt take, 1, a gentle Purge.</p>
               <p>2, Make Uſe frequently of warm Baths.</p>

               <p>This Malady is often very obſtinate, and then the Medicines muſt be varied according to the Circumſtances, the Detail of which I avoid here.</p>
               <p>§ 348. After giving repeated Purges in ſuch obſtinate Caſes, mineral Waters abounding with Sulphur, ſuch as <note n="*" place="bottom">Sea Water, and thoſe of <hi>Dulwich, Harrigate, Shadwell,</hi> &amp;c. will be full as effectual. <hi>K.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI. The Treatment of Diſeaſes peculiar to Women.</head>
               <p>SECT. 350. BESIDES all the preceding Diſeaſes to which Women are liable in common with Men, their Sex alſo expoſes them to others peculiar to it, and which depend upon four principal Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which are their monthly Diſcharges, their Pregnancy, their Labours in Child-birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Conſequences of their Labours. It is not my preſent Deſign to treat profeſſedly on each of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ariſing from theſe Cauſes, which would require a larger Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume than I have propoſed; but I ſhall confine myſelf to certain general Directions on theſe four Heads.</p>
               <p>§ 351. Nature, who intended Women for the Increaſe, and the Nouriſhment of the human Race at the Breaſt, has ſubjected them to a periodical Efflux, or Diſcharge, of Blood: which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance conſtitutes the Source, from whence the Infant is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to receive his Nutrition and Growth.</p>
               <p>This Diſcharge generally commences, with us, between the Age of ſixteen and eighteen. Young Maidens, before the Appearance of this Diſcharge, are frequently, and many for a long time, in a State of Weakneſs, attended with various Complaints, which is termed the <hi>Chloroſis,</hi> or Green Sickneſs, and Obſtructions: and when their Appearance is extremely ſlow and backward, it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions very grievous, and ſometimes even mortal Diſeaſes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is too uſual, though very improper, to aſcribe all the Evils, to which they are ſubject at this Term of Life, ſolely to this Cauſe, while they really often reſult from a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cauſe, of which the Obſtructions themſelves are ſometimes only the Effect; and this is the natural, and, in ſome Degree, even neceſſary Feebleneſs of the Sex. The Fibres of Women which are intended to be relaxed, and to give Way, when they are unavoidably extended by the Growth of the Child, and its incloſing Membranes (which frequently ariſe to a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Size) ſhould neceſſarily be leſs ſtiff and rigid, leſs ſtrong, and more lax and yielding than the Fibres of Men. Hence the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012243_0200_0F8A6D33C9AA0790"/>
of their Blood is more ſlow and languid than in Males; their Blood is leſs compact and denſe, and more watery; their Fluids are more liable to ſtagnate in their different Bowels, and to form Infarctions and Obſtructions.</p>
               <p>§ 352. The Diſorders to which ſuch a Conſtitution ſubjects them might, in ſome Meaſure be prevented, by aſſiſting that Langour or Feebleneſs of their natural Movements, with ſuch an Increaſe of their Force as Exerciſe might contribute to: But this Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which in ſome Manner is more neceſſary for Females than Males, they are partly deprived of, by the general Education and Habitude of the Sex; as they are uſually employed in managing Houſhold Buſineſs, and ſuch light ſedentary Work, as affords them leſs Exerciſe and Motion, than the more active Occupations of Men. They ſtir about but little, whence their natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Weakneſs increaſes from Habit, and thence becomes morbid and ſickly. Their Blood circulates imperfectly; its Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities become impaired; the Humours tend to a pretty general Stagnation; and none of the vital Functions are compleatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>From ſuch Cauſes and Circumſtances, they begin to ſink into a State of Weakneſs, ſometimes while they are very young, and many Years before this periodical Diſcharge could be expected. This State of Langour diſpoſes them to be inactive; a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſoon fatigues them, whence they take none at all. It might prove a Remedy, and even effect a Cure, at the Beginning of their Complaint; but as it is a Remedy, that is painful and diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, they reject it, and thus increaſe their Diſorders.</p>
               <p>Their Appetite declines with the other vital Functions, and gradually becomes ſtill leſs; the uſual ſalutary Kinds of Food never exciting it; inſtead of which they indulge themſelves in whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cravings, and often of the oddeſt and moſt improper Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Nutrition, which entirely impair the Stomach with its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive Functions, and conſequently Health itſelf.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes after the Duration of this State for a few Years, the ordinary time of their monthly Evacuations approaches, which however make not the leaſt Appearance, for two Reaſons. The firſt is, that their Health is too much impaired to accompliſh this new Function at a time when all the others are ſo languid: and the ſecond is, that under ſuch Circumſtances, the Evacuations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are unneceſſary; ſince their final Purpoſe is to diſcharge (when the Sex are not pregnant) that ſuperfluous Blood, which they were intended to produce, and whoſe Retention would be unhealthy, when not applied to the Growth of the Foetus, or Nouriſhment of the Child: and this Superfluity of Blood does not exiſt in Women who have been long in a very low and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing State.</p>
               <p>§ 353. Their Diſorder, however, continues to increaſe, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one daily muſt, which does not terminate. This Increaſe of it is attributed to the Suppreſſion or Non-appearance of their
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:012243_0201_0F8A6D3453C0DE98"/>
monthly Efflux, which is often erroneous; ſince the Diſorder is not always owing to that Suppreſſion, which is often the Effect of that Diſtemperature. This is ſo true, that even when the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux happens, if their Weakneſs ſtill continues, the Patients are far from being the better for it, but the reverſe. Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual to ſee young Lads, who have received from Nature, and from their Parents, a Sort of feminine Conſtitution, Education, and Habitude, infeſted with much the ſame Symptoms, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed young Women.</p>
               <p>Country Girls, who are generally more accuſtomed to ſuch har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Work and Exerciſe as Country Men, are leſs ſubject to theſe Complaints, than Women who live in Cities.</p>
               <p>§ 354. Let People then be careful not to deceive themſelves on this important Account; ſince all the Complaints of young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens are not owing to the want of their Cuſtoms. Nevertheleſs it is certain there are ſome of them, who are really afflicted from this Cauſe. For Inſtance, when a ſtrong young Virgin in full Health, who is nearly arrived to her full Growth, and who manifeſtly abounds with Blood, does not obtain this Diſcharge at the uſual time of Life, then indeed this ſuperfluous Blood is the Fountain of very many Diſorders, and greatly more violent ones than thoſe, which reſult from the contrary Cauſes already mentioned.</p>
               <p>If the lazy inactive City Girls are more ſubject to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which either ariſe from the Weakneſs and Langour I have formerly taken Notice of, or which accompany it; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Girls are more ſubject to Complaints from this latter Cauſe (too great a Retention of ſuperfluous Blood) than Women who live in Cities: and it is this laſt Cauſe that excites thoſe ſingular Diſorders, which appear ſo ſupernatural to the common People, that they aſcribe them to Sorcery.</p>
               <p>§ 355. And even after theſe periodical Diſcharges have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, it is known that they have often been ſuppreſſed, without the leaſt unhealthy Conſequence reſulting from that Suppreſſion. They are often ſuppreſſed, in the Circumſtances mentioned § 351, by a Continuance of the Diſeaſe, which was firſt an Obſtacle or Retardment to their Appearance; and in other Caſes, they have been ſuppreſſed by other Cauſes, ſuch as Cold, Moiſture, violent Fear, any very ſtrong Paſſion; by too chilly a Courſe of Diet, with Indigeſtion; or too hot and irritating Diet; by Drinks cooled with Ice, by Exerciſe too long continued, and by unuſual Watching. The Symptoms, occaſioned by ſuch Suppreſſions, are ſometimes more violent than thoſe, which preceded the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Diſcharge.</p>
               <p>§ 356. The great Facility with which this Evacuation may be ſuppreſſed, diminiſhed, or diſordered, by the Cauſes already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; the terrible Evils which are the Conſequences of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions and Irregularities of them; ſeem to me very cogent Reaſons to engage the Sex to uſe all poſſible Care, in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012243_0202_0F8A6D351FCE4DB0"/>
to preſerve the Regularity of them; by avoiding, during their Approach and Continuance, every Cauſe that may prevent or leſſen them. Would they be thoroughly perſuaded, not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by my Advice, but by that of their Mothers, their Relations, their Friends, and by their own Experience, of what great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is to be very attentive to themſelves, at thoſe critical times, I think there is not one Woman, who from the firſt, to the very laſt Appearance of them, would not conduct herſelf with the the moſt ſcrupulous Regularity.</p>
               <p>Their Demeanour, in theſe Circumſtances, very fundamentally intereſts their own Health, as well as that of their Children: and conſequently their own Happineſs, as well as that of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Families.</p>
               <p>The younger and more delicate they are, Caution becomes the more neceſſary for them. I am very ſenſible a ſtrong Country Girl is too negligent in regulating herſelf at thoſe critical Seaſons, and ſometimes without any ill Conſequence; but at another time ſhe may ſuffer feverely for it; and I could produce a long Liſt of many, who, by their Imprudence on ſuch Occaſions, have thrown themſelves into the moſt terrible Condition.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Caution with which Females ſhould avoid theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cauſes, juſt mentioned in the preceding Section, every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to remember what has moſt particularly diſagreed with her during that Term, and forever conſtantly to reject it.</p>
               <p>§ 357. There are many Women whoſe Cuſtoms viſit them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſlighteſt Impeachment of their Health: others are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſordered on every Return of them; and to others again they are very tormenting, by the violent Cholics, of a longer or a ſhorter Duration, which precede or accompany them. I have known ſome of theſe violent Attacks laſt but ſome Minutes, and others which continued a few Hours. Nay ſome indeed have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted for many Days, attended with Vomiting, Fainting, with Convulſions from exceſſive Pain, with Vomiting of Blood, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the Noſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, in ſhort, have brought them to the very Jaws of Death. So very dangerous a Situation requires the cloſeſt Attention: though, as it reſults from ſeveral and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very oppoſite Cauſes, it is impoſſible, within the preſent Plan, to direct the Treatment that may be proper for each Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. Some Women have the Unhappineſs to be ſubject to theſe Symptoms every Month, from the firſt Appearance, to the final Termination of theſe Diſcharges; except proper Remedies and Regimen, and ſometimes a happy Child-birth, remove them. Others complain but now and then, every ſecond, third, or fourth Month; and there are ſome again, who have ſuffered very ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durng the firſt Months, or Years, after their firſt Eruptions, ſuffer no more afterwards. A fourth Number, after having had their Cuſtoms for a long Time, without the leaſt Complaint, find themſelves afflicted with cruel Pains, at every Return of them; if by Imprudence, or ſome inevitable Fatality, they have incurred
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:012243_0203_0F8A6D3625287B50"/>
any Cauſe, that has ſuppreſſed, diminiſhed, or delayed them. This Conſideration ought to ſuggeſt a proper Caution even to ſuch, as generally undergo theſe Diſcharges, without Pain or Complaint: ſince all may be aſſured, that though they ſuffer no ſenſible Diſorder at that Time, they are nevertheleſs more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, more impreſſible by extraneous Subſtances; more eaſily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Paſſions of the Mind; and have alſo weaker Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs at theſe particular Periods.</p>
               <p>§ 358. Theſe Diſcharges may alſo be ſometimes too profuſe in Quantity, in which Caſe the Patients become conoxious to very grievous Maladies; into the Diſcuſſion of which however I ſhall not enter here, as they are much leſs frequent than thoſe, ariſing from a Suppreſſion of them. Beſides which, in ſuch Caſes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may be had to the Directions I ſhall give hereafter; when I treat of the Quantity of Blood, which it may be expedient to part with, during the Courſe of Gravidation or Pregnancy. See § 365.</p>
               <p>§ 359. Finally even when they are the moſt regular, after their Continuance for a pretty certain Number of Years (rarely exceeding thirty-five) they go off of their own Accord, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily between the Age of forty-five and fifty; ſometimes even ſooner, but ſeldom continuing longer: and this <hi>Criſis</hi> of their ceaſing is generally a very troubleſome, and often a very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one for the Sex.</p>
               <p>§ 360. The Evils mentioned § 352 may be prevented, by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſes producing them; and, 1, by obliging young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to uſe conſiderable Exerciſe; eſpecially as ſoon as there is the leaſt Reaſon to ſuſpect the Approach of this Diſorder, the <hi>Chloroſis,</hi> or Green Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>2. By watching them carefully, that they eat nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome or improper; as there are ſcarcely any natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, even among ſuch as are moſt improper for them, and the moſt diſtaſteful, which have not ſometimes been the Objects of their ſickly, their unaccountable Cravings. Fat Aliments, Paſtry, farinaceous or mealy, and ſour and watery Foods are pernicious to them. Herb-Teas, which are frequently directed as a Medicine for them, are ſufficient to throw them into the Diſorder, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing that Relaxation of their Fibres, which is a principal Cauſe of it. If they muſt drink any ſuch Infuſions, as medicated Drinks, let them be taken cold: but the beſt Drink for them is Water, in which red hot Iron has been extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>3. They muſt avoid hot ſharp Medicines, and ſuch as are ſolely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to force down their Terms, which are frequently attended with very pernicious Conſequences, and never do any good: and they are ſtill the more hurtful, as the Patient is the younger.</p>
               <p>4, If the Malady increaſes, it will be neceſſary to give them ſome Remedies: but theſe ſhould not be Purges, nor conſiſt of Diluters, and Decoctions of Herbs, of Salts, and a Heap of other uſeleſs and noxious Ingredients; but they ſhould take Filings of
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:012243_0204_0F8A6D36C3AD9AC8"/>
Iron, which is the moſt certain Remedy in ſuch Caſes. Theſe Filings ſhould be of true ſimple Iron, and not from Steel; and Care ſhould be taken that it be not ruſty, in which State it has very little Effect.</p>
               <p>At the Beginning of this Diſtemper, and to young Girls, it is ſufficient to give twenty Grains daily, enjoining due Exerciſe, and a ſuitable Diet. When it prevails in a more ſevere Degree, and the Patient is not ſo young, a Quarter of an Ounce may be ſafely ventured on: certain Bitters or Aromatics may be advantageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined to the Filings, which are numbered in the Appendix, 54, 55, 56, and conſtitute the moſt effectual Remedies in this Diſtemper, to be taken in the Form of Powder, of vinous Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or of Electuary <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>French</hi> Word here, <hi>Opiat,</hi> is ſometimes uſed by them for a compound Medicine of the Conſiſtence of an Electuary: and cannot be ſuppoſed, in this Place, to mean any Preparation, into which <hi>Opium</hi> enters. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note>. When there is a juſt Indication to bring down the Diſcharge, the vinous Infuſion No. 55 muſt be given, and generally ſucceeds: but I muſt again repeat it (as it ſhould carefully be conſidered) that the Stoppage or Obſtruction of this Diſcharge is frequently the Effect, not the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe; and that there ſhould be no Attempt to force it down, which, in ſuch a Caſe, may ſometimes prove more hurtful than beneficial; ſince it would naturally return of its own Accord, on the Recovery, and with the Strength, of the Patient: as their Return ſhould follow that of perfect Health, and neither can precede Health, nor introduce it. There are ſome Caſes particularly, in which it would be highly dangerous to uſe hot and active Medicines, ſuch Caſes for Inſtance, as are attended with ſome Degree of Fever, a frequent Coughing, a Haemorrhage or Bleeding, with great Leanneſs and conſiderable Thirſt: all which Complaints ſhould be removed, before any hot Medicines are given to force this Evacuation, which many very ignorantly imagine cures all other female Diſorders; an Error, that has prematurely occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Loſs of many Women's Lives.</p>
               <p>§ 361. While the Patient is under a Courſe of theſe Medicines, ſhe ſhould not take any of thoſe I have forbidden in the preceding Sections; and the Efficacy of theſe ſhould alſo be furthered with proper Exerciſe. That in a Carriage is very healthy; Dancing is ſo too, provided it be not extended to an Exceſs. In Caſe or a Relapſe in theſe Diſorders, the Patient is to be treated, as if it were an original Attack.</p>
               <p>§ 362. The other Sort of Obſtructions, deſcribed § 354, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a very different Treatment. Bleeding, which is hurtful in the former Sort, and the Uſe, or rather Abuſe, of which has thrown ſeveral young Women into irrecoverable Weakneſſes, has often removed this latter Species, as it were, in a Moment.

               <p>4, The Patient ſhould frequently take, in a Morning faſting, the Powder No. 24, which is very beneficial in ſuch Caſes; as it moderately increaſes the natural Excretions by Stool, Urine, and Perſpiration; and thence leſſens that Quantity of Blood, which would otherwiſe ſuperbound.</p>

The Uſe of aſtringent Medicines at this criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal time might diſpoſe the Patient to a Cancer of the Womb.</p>
               <p>Many Women die about this Age, as it is but too eaſy a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to injure them then; a Circumſtance that ſhould make them very cautious and prudent in the Medicines they recur to.

Nevertheleſs Country Women are ſubject, as well as Citizens, to Pains of the Stomach, to vomiting in a Morning, to Head-ach and Tooth-ach; but theſe Complaints very commonly yield to Bleeding,

But it ſhould have been conſidered, that Dr. TISSOT was profeſſedly writing here to hearty active Country Wives, who are very rarely thus conſtituted; and whom he might be unwilling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe with ſuch multiplied Diſtinctions and Directions, as would very ſeldom be neceſſary, and might ſometimes prevent them from doing what was ſo.

                  <p>§ 365. Sometimes after carrying too heavy Burthens; after too much or too violent Work; after receiving exceſſive Jolts, or having had a Fall, they are ſubject to violent Pains of the Loins, which extend down to their Thighs, and terminate quite at the Bottom of the Belly; and which commonly ſignify, that they are in Danger of an Abortion, or Miſcarrying.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this Conſequence, which is always dangerous, they ſhould, 1, immediately go to Bed; and if they have not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, they ſhould lie upon a Bed ſtuffed with Straw, a Feather-bed being very improper in ſuch Caſes. They ſhould repoſe, or keep themſelves quite ſtill in this Situation for ſeveral Days, not ſtirring, and ſpeaking as little as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>2, They ſhould directly loſe eight or nine Ounces of Blood from the Arm.</p>
                  <p>3, They ſhould not eat Fleſh, Fleſh-broth, nor Eggs; but live ſolely on Soups, made of farinaceous or mealy Subſtances.</p>

                  <p>Some ſanguine robuſt Women are very liable to miſcarry at a certain Time, or Stage, of their Pregnancy.

But this Method would avail very little for delicate Citizens, who miſcarry from a very different Cauſe; and whoſe Abortions are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a very different Treatment.</p>

                  <p>§ 366. It has been obſerved that a greater Proportion of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men die in the Country in, or very ſpeedily after, their Delivery, and that from the Scarcity of good Aſſiſtance, and the great Plenty of what is bad; and that a greater Proportion of thoſe in Cities

die after their Labours are effected, by a Continuance of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bad Health.</p>
                  <p>The Neceſſity there is for better inſtructed, better qualified Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, through a great Part of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> is but too manifeſt an Unhappineſs, which is attended with the moſt fatal Conſequences, and which merits the utmoſt Attention of the Government.</p>
                  <p>The Errors which are incurred, during actual Labour, are numberleſs, and too often indeed are alſo irremediable. It would require a whole Book, expreſsly for that Purpoſe (and in ſome Countries there are ſuch) to give all the Directions that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent ſo many Fatalities: and it would be as neceſſary to form a ſufficient Number of well-qualified Midwives to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and to obſerve them; which exceeds the Plan of the Work I have propoſed. I ſhall only mark out one of the Cauſes, and the moſt injurious one on this Occaſion: This is the Cuſtom of giving hot irritating things, whenever the Labour is very painful, or is ſlow; ſuch as Caſtor, or its Tincture, Saffron, Sage, Rue, Savin, Oil of Amber, Wine, Venice Treacle, Wine burnt with Spices, Coffee, Brandy, Aniſeed-Water, Walnut-Water, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-Water, and other Drams or ſtrong Liquors. All theſe things are ſo many Poiſons in this Reſpect, which very far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Woman's Delivery, render it more difficult by inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Womb (which cannot then ſo well contract itſelf) and the Parts, through which the Birth is to paſs, in Conſequence of which they ſwell, become more ſtraitened, and cannot yield or be dilated. Sometimes theſe ſtimulating hot Medicines alſo bring on Haemorrhages, which prove mortal in a few Hours.</p>
                  <p>§ 367. A conſiderable Number, both of Mothers and Infants, might be preſerved by the directly oppoſite Method. As ſoon as a Woman who was in very good Health, juſt before the Approach of her Labour, being robuſt and well made, finds her Travel come on, and that it is painful and difficult; far from encouraging thoſe premature Efforts which are always deſtructive; and from furthering them by the pernicious Medicines I have juſt enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the Patient ſhould be bled in the Arm, which will prevent the Swelling and Inflammation; aſſwage the Pains; relax the Parts, and diſpoſe every thing to a favourable Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>During actual Labour no other Nouriſhment ſhould be allowed, except a little Panada every three Hours, and as much Toaſt and Water as the Woman chuſes.</p>
                  <p>Every fourth Hour a Glyſter ſhould be given, conſiſting of a Decoction of Mallows, and a little Oil. In the Intervals between theſe Glyſters, ſhe ſhould be ſet over a Kind of Stove, or in a pierced eaſy Chair, containing a Veſſel in which there is ſome hot Water: the Paſſage ſhould be gently rubbed with a little Butter; and Stupes wrung out of a Fomentation of ſimple hot Water, which is the moſt efficacious of any, ſhould be applied over the Belly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:012243_0208_0F8A6D3B019DF0C0"/>The Midwives, by taking this Method, are not only certain of doing no Miſchief, but they alſo allow Nature an Opportunity of doing Good: as a great many Labours, which ſeem difficult at firſt, terminate happily; and this ſafe and unprecipitate Manner of Proceeding, at leaſt affords time to call in further Aſſiſtance. Beſides, the Conſequences of ſuch Deliveries are healthy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; when by purſuing the heating oppreſſing Practice, even though the Delivery be effected, both the Mother and Infant have been ſo cruelly, though undeſignedly, tormented, that both of them frequently periſh.</p>
                  <p>§ 368. I acknowledge theſe Means are inſufficient, when the Child is unhappily ſituated in the Womb; or when there is an embarraſſing Conformation in the Mother: though at leaſt they prevent the Caſe from proving worſe, and leave time for calling in Men-Midwives, or other Female ones, who may be better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</p>
                  <p>I beg Leave again to remind the Midwives, that they ſhould be very cautious of urging their Women to make any forced Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to forward the Birth, which are extremely injurious to them, and which may render a Delivery very dangerous and embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that might otherwiſe have been happily effected: and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the more freely on the Danger attending theſe unſeaſonable Efforts, and on the very great Importance of Patience, as the other very pernicious Practice is become next to univerſal amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>The Weakneſs, in which the labouring Woman appears, makes the By-ſtanders fearful that ſhe will not have Strength enough to be delivered; which they think abundantly juſtifies them in giving her Cordials; but this Way of Reaſoning is very weak and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical. Their Strength, on ſuch Occaſions, is not ſo very ſpeedily diſſipated: the ſmall light Pains ſink them, but in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the Pains become ſtronger, their Strength ariſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never deficient, when there is no extraordinary and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Symptom; and we may reaſonably be aſſured, that in a healthy, well formed Woman, meer Weakneſs never prevents a Delivery.</p>

                  <p>§ 369. The moſt uſual Conſequences of Child-birth in the Country are, 1, An exceſſive Haemorrhage. 2, An Inflammation of the Womb. 3, A ſudden Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> or uſual Diſcharges after Delivery.

                  <p>Exceſſive Bleedings or Floodings, ſhould be treated according to the Manner directed, § 365: and if they are very exceſſive, Folds of Linen, which have been wrung out of a Mixture of equal Parts of Water and Vinegar, ſhould be applied to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Loins, and the Thighs: theſe ſhould be changed for freſh

moiſt ones, as they dry; and ſhould be omitted, as ſoon as the Bleeding abates.</p>
                  <p>§ 370. The Inflammation of the Womb is diſcoverable by Pains in all the lower Parts of the Belly; by a Tenſion or Tight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole; by a ſenſible Increaſe of Pain upon touching it; a Kind of red Stain or Spot, that mounts to the Middle of the Belly, as high as the Navel: which Spot, as the Diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, turns black, and then is always a mortal Symptom; by a very extraordinary Degree of Weakneſs; an aſtoniſhing Change of Countenance; a light <hi>Delirium</hi> or Raving; a continual Fever with a weak and hard Pulſe; ſometimes inceſſant Vomitings; a frequent Hiccup; a moderate Diſcharge of a reddiſh ſtinking, ſharp Water; frequent Urgings to go to Stool; a burning Kind of Heat of Urine; and ſometimes an entire Suppreſſion of it.</p>
                  <p>§ 371. This moſt dangerous and frequently mortal Diſeaſe ſhould be treated like inflammatory ones. After Bleeding, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Glyſters of warm Water muſt by no Means be omitted; ſome ſhould alſo be injected into the Womb, and applied conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually over the Belly. The Patient may alſo drink continually, either of ſimple Barley-Water, with a Quarter of an Ounce of Nitre in every Part of it, or of Almond Milk No. 4.</p>
                  <p>§ 372. The total Suppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> the Diſcharge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Labour, which proves a Cauſe of the moſt violent Diſorders, ſhould be treated exactly in the ſame Manner: but if unhappily hot Medicines have been given, in order to force them down, the Caſe will very generally prove a moſt hopeleſs one.</p>
                  <p>§ 373. If the Milk-fever run very high, the Barley Ptiſan di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected § 371, and Glyſters, with a very light Diet conſiſting only of Panada, or made of ſome other farinaceous Subſtance, and that very thin, very generally remove it.</p>
                  <p>§ 374. Delicate infirm Women, who have not all the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary Attendance they want; and ſuch as from Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence are obliged to work too ſoon, are expoſed to many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which frequently ariſe from a Want of due Perſpiration, and an inſufficient Diſcharge of the <hi>Lochia</hi>; and hence the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Milk in their Breaſts being diſturbed, there are milky Congeſtions, or Knots as it were, which are always very painful and troubleſome, and eſpecially when they are formed more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. They often happen on the Thighs, in which Caſe the Ptiſan No. 58 is to be drank, and the Pultices No. 59 muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Theſe two Remedies gradually diſſipate and remove the Tumour, if that may be effected without Suppuration. But if that proves impoſſible, and <hi>Pus,</hi> or Matter, is actually formed, a Surgeon muſt open the Abſceſs, and treat it like any other.</p>
                  <p>§ 375. Should the Milk coagulate, or curdle as it were, in the Breaſt, it is of the utmoſt Importance immediately to attenuate or diſſolve that Thickneſs, which would otherwiſe degenerate into a Hardneſs and prove a <hi>Scirrhus</hi>; and from a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> in Proceſs of Time a Cancer, that moſt tormenting and cruel Diſtemper.</p>

               <p>SECT. 377. THE Diſeaſes of Children, and every thing relating to their Health, are Objects which generally ſeem to have been too
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012243_0211_0F8A6D3E777E3128"/>
much neglected by Phyſicians; and have been too long confided to the Conduct of the moſt improper Perſons for ſuch a Charge. At the ſame time it muſt be admitted, their Health is of no little Importance; their Preſervation is as neceſſary as the Continuance of the human Race; and the Application of the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to their Diſorders is ſuſceptible of nearer Approaches to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than is generally conceived. It ſeems to have even ſome Advantage over that Practice which regards grown Perſons; and it conſiſts in this, that the Diſeaſes of Children are more ſimple, and leſs frequently complicated, than thoſe of Adults.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid indeed, they cannot make themſelves ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and meer Infants certainly not at all. This is true in fact to a certain Degree, but not rigidly true; for though they do not ſpeak our Language, they have one which we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to underſtand. Nay every Diſtemper may be ſaid, in ſome Senſe, to have a Language of its own, which an attentive Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian will learn. He ſhould therefore uſe his utmoſt Care to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that of Infants, and avail himſelf of it, to increaſe the Means of rendering them healthy and vigorous, and to cure them of the different Diſtempers to which they are liable. I do not propoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to compleat this Taſk myſelf, in all that Extent it may juſtly demand; but I ſhall ſet forth the principal Cauſes of their Diſtempers, and the general Method of treating them. By this Means I ſhall at leaſt preſerve them from ſome of the Miſchiefs which are too frequently done them; and the leſſening ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as Ignorance, or erroneous Practice, occaſions, is one of the moſt important Purpoſes of the preſent Work.</p>
               <p>§ 378. Nearly all the Children who die before they are one Year, and even two Years, old, die <hi>with</hi> Convulſions: People ſay they died <hi>of</hi> them, which is partly true, as it is in Effect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions that have deſtroyed them. But then theſe very Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are the Conſequences, the Effects, of other Diſeaſes, which require the utmoſt Attention of thoſe, who are entruſted with the Care and Health of the little Innocents; as an effectual Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe Diſeaſes, theſe morbid Cauſes, is the only Means of removing the Convulſions. The four principal known Cauſes are, the <hi>Meconium,</hi> the Excrements contained in the Body of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, at the Birth; <hi>Acidities,</hi> or ſharp and ſour Humours; the Cutting of the Teeth, and Worms. I ſhall treat briefly of each.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Meconium.</head>
                  <p>§ 379. The Stomach and Guts of the Infant, at its Entrance into the World, are filled with a black Sort of Matter of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling Conſiſtence, and very viſcid or glutinous, which is called the <hi>Meconium.</hi> It is neceſſary this Matter ſhould be diſcharged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infant ſucks, ſince it would otherwiſe corrupt the Milk, and, becoming extremely ſharp itſelf, there would reſult from
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012243_0212_0F8A6D3EDD8FBFC0"/>
their Mixture a double Source of Evils, to the Deſtruction of the Infant.</p>
                  <p>The Evacuation of this Excrement is procured, 1, By giving them no Milk at all for the firſt twenty-four Hours of their Lives. 2, By making them drink during that time ſome Water, to which a little Sugar or Honey muſt be added, which will dilute this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conium,</hi> and promote the Diſcharge of it by Stool, and ſometimes by vomiting.</p>
                  <p>To be the more certain of expelling all this Matter, they ſhould take one Ounce of Compound Syrup <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>This Method [ſays the Editor and Annotator of <hi>Lyons</hi>] is uſeful, whenever the Mother does not ſuckle her Child. Art is then obliged to prove a Kind of Subſtitute to Nature, though always a very imperfect one. But when a Mother, attentive to her own true Intereſt, as well as her Infant's, and, liſtening to the Voice of Nature and her Duty, ſuckles it herſelf, theſe Remedies [he adds] ſeem hurtful, or at leaſt, uſeleſs. The Mother ſhould give her Child the Breaſt as ſoon as ſhe can. The firſt Milk, the <hi>Coloſtrum,</hi> or <hi>Strippings,</hi> as it is called in Quadrupeds, which is very ſerous or watery, will be ſerviceable as a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; it will forward the Expulſion of the <hi>Meconium,</hi> prove gradually nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is better than Biſcuits, or Panada, which [he thinks] are dangerous in the firſt Days after the Birth. <hi>E. L.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Syrup of Succory being ſcarcely ever prepared with us, though ſufficiently proper for the Uſe aſſigned it here, I have retained the preceding Note, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it directs theſe <hi>Strippings,</hi> for the ſame Purpoſe, with an Air of certain Experience; and as this Effect of them ſeems no ways repugnant to the phyſical Wiſdom and Oeconomy of Nature, on ſuch important Points. Should it in fact be their very general Operatoin, it cannot be unknown to any Male or Female Practitioner in Midwifery, and may ſave poor People a little Expence, which was one Object of our humane Author's Plan. The Oil of <hi>Ricinus,</hi> corruptly called <hi>Caſtor</hi> Oil (being expreſſed from the Berries of the <hi>Palma Chriſti</hi>) is particularly recommended by ſome late medical Writers from <hi>Jamaica, &amp;c.</hi> for this Purpoſe of expelling the <hi>Meconium,</hi> to the Quantity of a ſmall Spoonful. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen alſo conſider it as the moſt proper, and almoſt ſpecific Opener, in the dry Belly-ach of that torrid Climate; which tormenting Diſeaſe has the cloſeſt Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the <hi>Miſerere,</hi> or Iliac Paſſion, of any I have ſeen. The Annotator's Objection to our Author's very <hi>thin light</hi> Panada, ſeems to be of little Weight. <hi>K.</hi>

                     </note> of Succory, which ſhould be diluted with a little Water, drinking up this Quantity within the Space of four or five Hours. The Practice is a very beneficial one, and it is to be wiſhed it were to become general. This Syrup is greatly preferable to all others, given in ſuch Caſes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Oil of Almonds.</p>
                  <p>Should the great Weakneſs of the Child ſeem to call for ſome Nouriſhment, there would be no Inconvenience in allowing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Biſcuit well boiled in Water, which is pretty commonly done, or a little very thin light Panada.</p>

                  <head>Of Acidities, or ſharp Humours.</head>
                  <p>§ 380. Notwithſtanding the Bodies of Children have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly emptied ſpeedily after their Birth, yet the Milk very often turns four in their Stomachs, producing Vomitings, violent Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Convulſions, a Looſeneſs, and even terminating in Death.
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:012243_0213_0F8A6D3F8A1E2238"/>
There are but two Purpoſes to be purſued in ſuch Caſes, which are to carry off the ſour or ſharp Humours, and to prevent the Generation of more. The firſt of theſe Intentions is beſt effected by the Syrup of Succory <note n="*" place="bottom">Or, for Want of it, the ſolutive Syrup of Roſes. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </note>, juſt mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Generation of further Acidities is prevented, by giving three Doſes daily, if the Symptoms are violent, and but two, or even one only, if they are very moderate, of the Powder No. 61, drinking after it Bawm Tea, or a Tea of Lime-tree Flowers.</p>
                  <p>§ 381. It has been a Cuſtom to load Children with Oil of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Magneſia</hi> is an excellent Subſtitute in Children, for theſe Oils Dr. TISSOT ſo juſtly condemns here. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </note> as ſoon as ever they are infeſted with Gripes: but it is a pernicious Cuſtom, and attended with very dangerous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is very true that this Oil ſometimes immediately allays the Gripes, by involving, or ſheathing up, as it were, the acrid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and ſomewhat blunting the Senſibility of the Nerves. But it proves only a palliative Remedy, or aſſwaging for a time, which, far from removing, increaſes the Cauſe, ſince it becomes ſharp and rancid itſelf; whence the Diſorder ſpeedily returns, and the more Oil the Infant takes, it is griped the more. I have cured ſome Children of ſuch Diſorders, without any other Remedy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept abſtaining from Oil, which weakens their Stomachs, whence their Milk is leſs perfectly, and more ſlowly digeſted, and becomes more eaſily ſoured. Beſides this Weakneſs of the Stomach, which thus commences at that very early Age, has ſometimes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy Influence on the Conſtitution of the Child, throughout the Remainder of his Life.</p>
                  <p>A free and open Belly is beneficial to Children; now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Oil very often binds them, in Conſequence of its diminiſhing the Force and Action of the Bowels. There is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Perſon, who cannot obſerve this Inconvenience attending it; notwithſtanding they all continue to adviſe and to give it, to obtain a very different Purpoſe: But ſuch is the Power of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in this Caſe, and in ſo many others; People are ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with a Notion, that ſuch a Medicine muſt produce ſuch an Effect, that its never having produced it, avails nothing with them, their Prejudice ſtill prevails; they aſcribe its Want of Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to the Smallneſs of the Doſes; theſe are doubled then, and notwithſtanding its bad Effects are augmented, their obſtinate Blindneſs continues.</p>
                  <p>This Abuſe of the Oil alſo diſpoſes the Child to knotty hard Tumours, and at length often proves the firſt Cauſe of ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Skin, whoſe Cure is extremely difficult.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident, this Oil ſhould be uſed on ſuch Occaſions but very ſeldom; and that it is always very injudicious to give it in Cholics, which ariſe from ſharp and ſour Humours in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or in the Bowels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="unknown:012243_0214_0F8A6D40539E79E8"/>§ 382. Infants are commonly moſt ſubject to ſuch Cholics dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their earlieſt Months; after which they abate, in Proportion as their Stomachs grow ſtronger. They may be relieved in the Fit by Glyſters of a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, in which a Bit of Soap of the Size of a Hazel Nut is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ed. A Piece of Flanel wrung out of a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, with the Addition of ſome Venice Treacle, and applied hot over the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and on the Belly, is alſo very beneficial, and relieving.</p>
                  <p>Children cannot always take Glyſters, the Continuance of which Inability might be dangerous to them; and every one is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the common Method of ſubſtituting Suppoſitories to them, whether they are formed of the ſmooth and ſupple Stalks of Vines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Soap, or of Honey boiled up to a proper Conſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>But one of the moſt certain Means to prevent theſe Cholics, which are owing to Children's not digeſting their Milk, is to move and exerciſe them as much as poſſible; having a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard however to their tender time of Life.</p>
                  <p>§ 383. Before I proceed to the third Cauſe of the Diſeaſes of Children, which is, the Cutting of their Teeth, I muſt take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the firſt Care their Birth immediately requires, that is, the Waſhing of them the firſt Time, merely to cleanſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſtrengthen them.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>Of waſhing Children.</head>
                  <p>§ 384. The whole Body of an Infant juſt born is covered with a groſs Humour, which is occaſioned by the Fluids, in which it was ſuſpended in the Womb. There is a Neceſſity to cleanſe it directly from this, for which nothing is ſo proper as a Mixture of one third Wine, and two thirds Water; Wine alone would be dangerous. This Waſhing may be repeated ſome Days ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but it is a bad Cuſtom to continue to waſh them thus warm, the Danger of which is augmented by adding ſome Butter to the Wine and Water, which is done too often. If this groſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that covers the Child, ſeems more thick and glutinous than ordinary, a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, with a little Bit of Soap, may be uſed to remove it. The Regularity of Perſpiration is the great Foundation of Health; to procure this Regularity the Teguments, the Skin, muſt be ſtrengthened; but warm Waſhing tends to weaken it. When it is of a proper Strength it always performs its Functions; nor is Perſpiration diſordered ſenſibly by the Alteration of the Weather. For this Reaſon nothing ſhould be omitted, that may fix it in this State; and to attain ſo important an Advantage, Children ſhould be waſhed ſome few Days after their Birth, with cold Water, in the State it is brought from the Spring.</p>
                  <p>For this Purpoſe a Spunge is employed, with which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by waſhing firſt the Face, the Ears, the back Part of the

This Method which has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ſo many Ages, and which is practiſed at preſent by many People, who prove very healthy, will appear ſhocking to ſeveral Mothers; they would be afraid of killing their Children by it; and would particularly fail of Courage enough to endure the Cries, which Children often make, the firſt time they are waſhed. Yet if their Mothers truly love them, they cannot give a more ſubſtantial Mark of their Tenderneſs to them, than by ſubduing their Fears and their Repugnance, on this important Head.</p>
                  <p>Weakly Infants <note n="†" place="bottom">There is however a certain Degree of Weakneſs, which may very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deter us from this Waſhing; as when the Infant manifeſtly wants Heat, and needs ſome Cordial and frequent Frictions, to prevent its expiring from downright Feebleneſs; in which Circumſtances Waſhing muſt be hurtful to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have had the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obſerve, ſince I firſt endeavoured to introduce this Cuſtom among us, that ſeveral of the moſt affectionate and moſt ſenſible Mothers have uſed it with the greateſt Succeſs. The Midwives, who have been Witneſſes of it; the Nurſes and the Servants of the Children, whom they have waſhed, publiſh it abroad; and ſhould the Cuſtom become as general, as every thing ſeems to promiſe it will, I am fully perſuaded, that by preſerving the Lives of a great Number of Children, it will certainly contribute to check the Progreſs of Depopulation.</p>
                  <p>They ſhould be waſhed very regularly every Day, in every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and every Sort of Weather; and in the fine warm Seaſon they ſhould be plunged into a large Pail of Wafer, into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons around Fountains, in a Brook, a River, or a Lake.</p>
                  <p>After a few Days, crying, they grow ſo well accuſtomed to this Exerciſe, that it become, one of their Pleaſures; ſo that they laugh all the Time of their going through it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Benefit of this Practice is, as I have already ſaid, the keeping up their Perſpiration, and rendering them leſs obnoxious to the Impreſſions of the Air and Weather: and it is alſo in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this firſt Benefit, that they are preſerved from a great Number of Maladies, eſpecially from knotty Tumours, often call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kernels; from Obſtructions; from Diſeaſes of the Skin, and from Convulſions; its general Conſequence being to inſure them firm, and even robuſt Health.</p>

                     <pb n="196" facs="unknown:012243_0216_0F8A6D41D037A450"/>§ 385. But Care ſhould be taken not to prevent, or, as it were to undo, the Benefit this Waſhing procures them, by the bad Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of keeping them too hot. There is not a more pernicious one than this, nor one that deſtroys more Children. They ſhould be accuſtomed to light Cloathing by Day, and light Covering by Night, to go with their Heads very thinly covered, and not at all in the Day-time, after their attaining the Age of two Years, They ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d avoid ſleeping in Chambers that are too hot, and ſhould live in the open Air, both in Summer and Winter, as much as poſſible. Children who have been kept too hot in ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are very often liable to Colds; they are weakly, pale, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, bloated and melancholly. They are ſubject to hard, knotty Swellings, a Conſumption, all Sorts of languid Diſorders, and either die in their Infancy, or only grow up into a miſerable valetudinary Life: while thoſe who are waſhed or plunged into cold Water, and habitually expoſed to the open Air, are juſt in the oppoſite Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>§ 386. I muſt further add here, that Infancy is not the only Stage of Life in which cold Bathing is advantageous. I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it with remarkable Succeſs to Perſons of every Age, even to that of ſeventy: and there are two Kinds of Diſeaſes, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent indeed in Cities than in the Country, in which cold Baths ſucceed very greatly; that is, in Debility or Weakneſs of the Nerves; and when Perſpiration is diſordered, when Perſons are fearful of every Breath of Air, liable to Defluctions or Colds, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and languiſhing, the cold Bath re-eſtabliſhes Perſpiration; reſtores Strength to the Nerves; and by that Means diſpels all the Diſorders, which ariſe from theſe two Cauſes, in the animal Oeconomy. It ſhould be uſed before Dinner. But in the ſame Proportion that cold Bathing is beneficial, the habitual Uſe, or rather Abuſe, of warm Baths, is pernicious; they diſpoſe the Perſons addicted to them to the Apoplexy; to the Dropſy; to Vapours, and to the hypochondriacal Diſeaſe: and Cities, in which they are too frequently uſed, become, in ſome Meaſure, deſolate from ſuch Diſtempers.</p>

If it proves very painful, we ſhould, during that Period, 1, Keep their Bellies open by Glyſters conſiſting only of a ſimple Decoction of Mallows: but Glyſters are not neceſſary, if the Child, as it ſometimes happens, has then a Purging.</p>
                  <p>2, Their ordinary Quantity of Food ſhould be leſſened for two Reaſons; firſt, becauſe the Stomach is then weaker than uſual; and next, becauſe a ſmall Fever ſometimes accompanies the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                  <head>Of Worms.</head>
                  <p>§ 388. The <hi>Meconium,</hi> the Acidity of the Milk, and Cutting of the Teeth are the three great Cauſes of the Diſeaſes of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There is alſo a fourth, Worms, which is likewiſe very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pernicious to them; but which, nevertheleſs, is not, at leaſt not near ſo much, a general Cauſe of their Diſorders, as it is generally ſuppoſed, when a Child exceeding two Years of Age proves ſick. There are a great Variety of Symptoms, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe People to think a Child has Worms; though there is but one that demonſtrates it, which is diſcharging them upwards or downwards. There is great Difference among Children too in this Reſpect, ſome remaining healthy, though having ſeveral Worms, and others being really ſick with a few.</p>
                  <p>They prove hurtful, 1, by obſtructing the Guts, and compreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neighbouring Bowels by their Size. 2, By ſucking up the Chyle intended to nouriſh the Patient, and thus depriving him of his very Subſtance as well as Subſiſtence: and, 3, by irritating the Guts and even <note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen a Child about three Years old, whoſe Navel, after ſwelling and inflaming, ſuppurated, and through a ſmall Orifice (which muſt have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with the Cavity of the Gut or the Belly) diſcharged one of thoſe Worms we call <hi>teretes,</hi> about three Inches long. He had voided ſeveral by Stool, after taking ſome vermifuge Medicines. The Fact I perfectly remember; and to the beſt of my Recollection, the Ulcer healed ſome time after, and the Orifice cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but the Child died the following Year of a putrid Fever, which might be unuſed, or was aggravated, by Worms. <hi>K.</hi>

They are afflicted with Palpitations, Swoonings, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, long and profound Drowſineſs; cold Sweats which come on ſuddenly; Fevers which have the Appearances of Malignity; Obſcurities and even Loſs of Sight and of Speech, which continue for a conſiderable Time; Palſies either of their Hands, their Arms, or their Legs, and Numbneſſes. Their Gums are in a bad State, and as though they had been knawed or corroded: they have often the Hiccup, a ſmall and irregular Pulſe, Ravings, and what is one of the leaſt doubtful Symptoms, frequently a ſmall dry Cough; and not ſeldom a Mucoſity or Slimineſs in their Stools: ſometimes very long and violent Cholics, which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in an Abſceſs on the Outſide of the Belly, from whence Worms iſſue.

                     <hi>Grenette</hi> or Worm-ſeed, which is one of the moſt common, is a very good one. The Preſcription No. 62, is alſo a very ſucceſsful one; and the Powder No. 14 is one of the beſt. Flower of Brimſtone, the Juice of <hi>Naſturtium,</hi> or Creſſes, Acids and Honey Water have often been very ſerviceable; but the firſt three I have mentioned, ſucceeded by a Purge, are the beſt. No. 63 is a purging Medicine, that the moſt averſe and difficult Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may eaſily take. But when, notwithſtanding theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, the Worms are not expelled, it is neceſſary to take Advice of ſome Perſon qualified to preſcribe more efficacious ones. This is of conſiderable Importance, becauſe, notwithſtanding a great Proportion of Children may probably have Worms, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them continue in good Health, there are, nevertheless, ſome who are really killed by Worms, after having been cruelly tormented by them for ſeveral Years.</p>
                  <p>A Diſpoſition to breed Worms always ſhews the Digeſtions are weak and imperfect; for which Reaſon Children liable to Worms ſhould not be nouriſhed with Food difficult to digeſt. We ſhould be particularly careful not to ſtuff them with Oils, which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Oils ſhould immediately kill ſome of their Worms, do yet increaſe that Cauſe, which diſpoſes them to generate others. A long continued Uſe of Filings of Iron is the Remedy, that moſt effectually deſtroys this Diſpoſition to generate Worms.</p>

                  <head>Of Convulſions.</head>
                  <p>§ 391. I have already ſaid, § 378, that the Convulſions of Children are almoſt conſtantly the Effect of ſome other Diſeaſe, and eſpecially of ſome of the four I have mentioned. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though leſs frequent Cauſes, ſometimes occaſion them, and theſe may be reduced to the following.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of them is the corrupted Humours, that often abound in their Stomachs and Inteſtines; and which, by their Irritation, produce irregular Motions throughout the whole Syſtem of the Nerves, or at leaſt through ſome Parts of them; whence theſe Convulſions ariſe, which are merely involuntary Motions of the Muſcles. Theſe putrid Humours are the Conſequence of too great a Load of Aliments, of unſound ones, or of ſuch as the Stomachs of Children are incapable of digeſting. Theſe Humours are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſometimes the Effect of a Mixture and Confuſion of different Aliments, and of a bad Diſtribution of their Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>It may be known that the Convulſions of a Child are owing to this Cauſe, by the Circumſtances that have preceded them; by a diſguſted loathing Stomach; by a certain Heavineſs and Load at it; by a foul Tongue; a threat Belly; by its bad Complexion, and by its diſturbed unrefreſhing Sleep.</p>
                  <p>The Child's proper Diet, that is, a certain Diminution of the Quantity of its Food; ſome Glyſters of warm Water, and one Purge of No. 63, generally remove ſuch Convulſions.</p>
                  <p>§ 392. The ſecond Cauſe is the bad Quality of their Milk. Whether it be that the Nurſe has fallen into a violent Paſſion, ſome conſiderable Diſguſt, great Fright or frequent Fear: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe has eat unwholeſome Food, drank too much Wine, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors, or any ſtrong Drink: whether ſhe is ſeized with a Deſcent of her monthly Diſcharges, which may have greatly diſordered her Health; or finally whether ſhe prove really ſick: In all theſe Caſes the Milk is vitiated, and expoſes the Infant to violent Symptoms, which ſometimes ſpeedily deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>The Remedies for Convulſions, from this Cauſe, conſiſt, 1, In letting the Child abſtain from this corrupted Milk, until the Nurſe ſhall have recovered her State of Health and Tranquillity, the ſpeedy Attainment of which may be forwarded by a few Glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; by gentle pacific Medicines; by an entire Abſence of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſed or conduced to her bad Health; and by drawing off all the Milk that had been ſo vitiated.</p>
                  <p>2, In giving the Child itſelf ſome Glyſters: in making it drink plentifully of a light Infuſion of the Flowers of the Lime-tree; in giving it no other Nouriſhment for a Day or two, except Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and other light Spoon-meat, without Milk.</p>
                  <p>3, In purging the Child (ſuppoſing what has been juſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been unavailable) with an Ounce, or an Ounce and a Half, of compound Syrup of Succory, or as much Manna.
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012243_0220_0F8A6D4650E1BB48"/>
Theſe lenient gentle Purges carry off the Remainder of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Milk, and remove the Diſorders occaſioned by it.</p>
                  <p>§ 393. A third Cauſe which alſo produces Convulſions, is the feveriſh Diſtempers which attack Children, eſpecially the Small-Pocks and the Meaſles; but in general ſuch Convulſions require no other Treatment, but that proper for the Diſeaſe, which has introduced them.</p>
                  <p>§ 394. It is evident from what has been ſaid in the Courſe of this Chapter, and it deſerves to be attended to, that Convulſions are commonly a Symptom attending ſome other Diſeaſe, rather than an original Diſeaſe themſelves: that they depend on many different Cauſes; that from this Conſideration there can be no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Remedy for removing or checking them; and that the only Means and Medicines which are ſuitable in each Caſe, are thoſe which are proper to oppoſe the particular Cauſe producing them, and which I have already pointed out in treating of each Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The greater Part of the pretended Specifics, which are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately and ignorantly employed in all Sorts of Convulſions, are often uſeleſs, and ſtill oftner prejudicial. Of this laſt Sort and Character are,</p>
                  <p>1, All ſharp and hot Medicines, ſpirituous Liquors, Oil of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, other hot Oils and Eſſences, volatile Salts, and ſuch other Medicines as, by the Violence of their Action on the irritable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Children, are likelier to produce Convulſions, than to allay them.</p>
                  <p>2, Aſtringent Medicines, which are highly pernicious, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Convulſions are cauſed by any ſharp Humour, that ought to be diſcharged from the Body by Stool; or when ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions are the Conſequences of an <note n="*" place="bottom">This very important Conſideration, on which I have treated pretty largely, in the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> ſeems not to be attended to in Practice, ſo frequently as it ought. <hi>K.</hi>
                     </note> Effort of Nature, in order to effect a <hi>Criſis</hi>: And as they almoſt ever depend on one or the other of theſe Cauſes, it follows that Aſtringents can very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ever, be beneficial. Beſides that there is always ſome Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in giving them to Children, without a mature, a thorough Conſideration of their particular Caſe and Situation, as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſpoſe them to Obſtructions.</p>
                  <p>3, The over early, and too conſiderable Uſe of Opiates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not properly indicated, or continued too long, ſuch as Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Treacle, Mithridate, Syrup of Poppies (and it is very eaſy to run upon ſome of theſe Sholes) are alſo attended with the moſt embarraſſing Events, in Regard to Convulſions; and it may be affirmed they are improper, for nine Tenths of thoſe they are adviſed to. It is true they often produce an apparent Eaſe and Tranquillity for ſome Minutes, and ſometimes for ſome Hours too; but the Diſorder returns even with greater Violence for this Suſpenſion, by Reaſon they have augmented all the Cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012243_0221_0F8A6D4705CFEE28"/>
it; they impair the Stomach; they bind up the Belly; they leſſen the uſual Quantity of Urine; and beſides, by their abating the Senſibility of the Nerves (which ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one of the chief Centinels appointed by Nature, for the Diſcovery of any approaching Danger) they diſpoſe the Patient inſenſibly to ſuch Infarctions and Obſtructions, as tend ſpeedily to produce ſome violent and mortal Event, or which generate a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to languid and tedious Diſeaſes: and I do again repeat it, that notwithſtanding there are ſome Caſes, in which they are abſolutely neceſſary, they ought in general to be employed with great Precaution and Prudence. To mention the principal Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for them in convulſive Caſes, they are proper,</p>
                  <p>1, When the Convulſions ſtill continue, after the original Cauſe of them is removed.</p>
                  <p>2, When they are ſo extremely violent, as to threaten a great and very ſpeedy Danger of Life; and when they prove an Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the taking Remedies calculated to extinguiſh their Cauſe; and,</p>
                  <p>3, When the Cauſe producing them is of ſuch a Nature, as is apt to yield to the Force of Anodynes; as when, for Inſtance, they have been the immediate Conſequence of a Fright.</p>
                  <p>§ 395. There is a very great Difference in different Children, in Reſpect to their being more or leſs liable to Convulſions. There are ſome, in whom very ſtrong and irritating Cauſes cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them; not even excruciating Gripes and Cholics; the moſt painful Cutting of their Teeth; violent Fevers; the Small-Pocks; Meaſles; and though they are, as it were, continually corroded by Worms, they have not the ſlighteſt Tendency to be convulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On the other Hand, ſome are ſo very obnoxious to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, or ſo eaſily <hi>convulſible,</hi> if that Expreſſion may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they are very often ſeized with them from ſuch very ſlight Cauſes, that the moſt attentive Conſideration cannot inveſtigate them. This Sort of Conſtitution, which is extremely danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and expoſes the unhappy Subject of it, either to a very ſpeedy Death, or to a very low and languid State of Health, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome peculiar Conſiderations; the Detail of which would be the more foreign to the Deſign of this Treatiſe, as they are pretty common in Cities, but much leſs ſo in Country Places. In general cold Bathing and the Powder No. 14 are ſerviceable in ſuch Circumſtances.</p>

                  <head>General Directions with Reſpect to Children.</head>
                  <p>§ 396. I ſhall conclude this Chapter by ſuch farther Advice, as may contribute to give Children a more vigorous Conſtitution and Temperament, and to preſerve them from many Diſorders.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, we ſhould be careful not to cram them too much, and to regulate both the Quantity and the ſet Time of their Meals, which is a very practicable Thing, even in the very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:012243_0222_0F8A6D4855C61CA8"/>
Days of their Life; when the Woman who nurſes them will be careful to do it regularly. Perhaps indeed this is the very Age, when ſuch a Regulation may be the moſt eaſily attempted and effected; becauſe it is that Stage, when the conſtant Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their Way of living ſhould incline us to ſuppoſe, that what they have Occaſion for is moſt conſtantly very much the ſame.</p>
                  <p>A Child who has already attained to a few Years, and who is ſurrendered up more to his own Exerciſe and Vivacity, feels other Calls; his Way of Life is become a little more various and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; whence his Appetite muſt prove ſo too. Hence it would be inconvenient to ſubject him over exactly to one certain Rule, in the Quantity of his Nouriſhment, or the Diſtance of his Meals. The Diſſipation or paſſing off of his Nutrition being unequal, the Occaſions he has for repairing it cannot be preciſely ſtated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. But with Reſpect to very little Children in Arms, or on the Lap, a Uniformity in the firſt of theſe Reſpects, the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of their Food, very conſiſtently conduces to a uſeful Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity with Reſpect to the ſecond, the Times of feeding them. Sickneſs is probably the only Circumſtance, that can warrant any Alteration in the Order and Intervals of their Meals; and then this Change ſhould conſiſt in a Diminution of their uſual Quantity, notwithſtanding a general and fatal Conduct ſeems to eſtabliſh the very Reverſe: and this pernicious Faſhion authorizes the Nurſes to cram theſe poor little Creatures the more, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they have real Need of leſs feeding. They conclude of Courſe, that all their Cries are the Effects of Hunger, and the Moment an Infant begins, then they immediately ſtop his Mouth with his Food; without once ſuſpecting, that theſe Wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be occaſioned by the Uneaſineſs, which an over-loaded Stomach may have introduced; or by Pains, whoſe Cauſe is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removed nor mitigated, by making the Children eat; though the meer Action of eating may render them inſenſible to ſlight Pains, for a very few Minutes; in the firſt Place, by calling off their Attention; and ſecondly, by huſhing them to ſleep, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Effect of feeding Children, being in fact a very general and conſtant one, and depending on the ſame Cauſes, which diſpoſe ſo many grown Perſons to ſleep after Meals.</p>
                  <p>A Detail of the many Evils Children are expoſed to, by thus forcing too much Food upon them, at the very Time when their Complaints are owing to Cauſes, very different from Hunger, might appear incredible. They are however ſo numerous and certain, that I ſeriouſly wiſh ſenſible Mothers would open their Eyes to the Conſideration of this Abuſe, and agree to put an End to it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who overload them with Victuals, in Hopes of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening them, are extremely deceived; there being no one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice equally fatal to ſuch a Number of them. Whatever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Aliment a Child receives, weakens, inſtead of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening him. The Stomach, when overdiſtended, ſuffers in its
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:012243_0223_0F8A6D4A70C0CA08"/>
Force and Functions, and becomes leſs able to digeſt thoroughly. The Exceſs of the Food laſt received impairs the Concoction of the Quantity, that was really neceſſary; which, being badly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, is ſo far from yielding any Nouriſhment to the Infant, that it weakens it, proves a Source of Diſeaſes, and concurs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Obſtructions, Rickets, the Evil, ſlow Fevers, a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Death.</p>
                  <p>Another unhappy Cuſtom prevails, with regard to the Diet of Children, when they begin to receive any other Food beſides their Nurſe's Milk, and that is, to give them ſuch as exceeds the digeſtive Power of their Stomachs; and to indulge them in a Mixture of ſuch Things in their Meals, as are hurtful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and more particularly ſo, with regard to their feeble and delicate Organs.</p>
                  <p>To juſtify this pernicious Indulgence, they affirm it is neceſſary to accuſtom their Stomachs to every Kind of Food; but this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is highly abſurd, ſince their Stomachs ſhould firſt be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, in order to make them capable of digeſting every Food; and crouding indigeſtible, or very difficultly digeſtible Materials in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is not the Way to ſtrengthen it. To make a Foal ſufficiently ſtrong for future Labour, he is exempted from any, till he is four Years old; which enables him to ſubmit to conſiderable Work, without being the worſe for it. But if, to inure him to Fatigue, he ſhould be accuſtomed immediately from his Birth to ſubmit to Burthens above his Strength, he could never prove any thing but an utter Jade, incapable of real Service. The Application of this to the Stomach of a Child is plainly obvious.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add another very important Remark, and it is this, that the too early Work to which the Children of Peaſants are forced, become of real Prejudice to the Publick. Hence Families them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are leſs numerous, and the more Children there are removed from their Parents, while they are very young, it follows, that thoſe who are left are obliged to work the more, and very often even at hard Labour, at an Age when they ſhould exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the uſual Diverſions and Sports of Children. Hence they wear out in a Manner, before they attain the ordinary Term of Manhood; they never arrive at their utmoſt Strength, nor reach their full Stature; and it is too common to ſee a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with the Look of twenty Years, joined to a Stature of twelve or thirteen. In fact, they often ſink under the Weight of ſuch hard involuntary Labour, and fall into a mortal Degree of Waſting and Exhauſtion.</p>
                  <p>§ 397. Secondly, which indeed is but a Repetition of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I have already given, and upon which I cannot inſiſt too much, they muſt be frequently waſhed or bathed in cold Water.</p>
                  <p>§ 398. Thirdly, they ſhould be moved about and exerciſed as much as they can bear, after they are ſome Weeks old: the earlier Days of their tender Lives ſeeming conſecrated, by Nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to a nearly total Repoſe, and to ſleeping, which ſeems not
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012243_0224_0F8A6D4B8D1B1658"/>
to determine, until they have Need of Nouriſhment: ſo that, during this very tender Term of Life, too much Agitation or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe might be attended with mortal Conſequences. But as ſoon as their Organs have attained a little more Solidity and Firmneſs, the more they are danced about (provided it is not done about their uſual Time of Repoſe, which ought ſtill to be very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) they are ſo much the better for it; and by increaſing it gradually, they may be accuſtomed to a very quick Movement, and at length very ſafely to ſuch, as may be called hard and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exerciſe. That Sort of Motion they receive in Go-Carts, or other Vehicles, particularly contrived for their Uſe, is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to them, than what they have from their Nurſes Arms, becauſe they are in a better Attitude in the former, and it heats them leſs in Summer, which is a Circumſtance of no ſmall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them; conſiderable Heat and Sweat diſpoſing them to be ricketty.</p>
                  <p>§ 399. Fourthly, they ſhould be accuſtomed to breathe in the free open Air as much as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>If Children have unhappily been leſs attended to than they ought, whence they are evidently feeble, thin, languid, obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and liable to Scirrhoſities (which conſtitute what is termed a ricketty or conſumptive State) theſe four Directions duly obſerved retrieve them from that unhappy State; provided the Execution of them has not been too long delayed.</p>
                  <p>§ 400. Fifthly, If they have any natural Diſcharge of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by the Skin, which is very common with them, or any Eruption, ſuch as Tetters, white Scurf, a Raſhe, or the like, Care muſt be taken not to check or repel them, by any greaſy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent Applications Not a Year paſſes without Numbers of Children having been deſtroyed by Imprudence in this Reſpect; while others have been reduced to a deplorable and weakly Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</p>
                  <p>I have been a Witneſs to the moſt unhappy Conſequences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medicines applied for the Raſhe and white Scurf; which, however frightful they may appear, are never dangerous; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nothing at all is applied to them, without the Advice and Conſideration of a truly ſkilful Perſon.</p>
                  <p>When ſuch external Diſorders prove very obſtinate, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuſpect ſome Fault or Diſagreement in the Milk the Child ſucks; in which Caſe it ſhould immediately be diſcontinued, corrected, or changed. But I cannot enter here into a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Detail of all the Treatment neceſſary in ſuch Caſes.</p>

Directions with reſpect to drowned Perſons<note n="*" place="bottom">The Misfortune of a young Man drowned in bathing himſelf, at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Seaſon, occaſioned the Publication of this Chapter by itſelf in <hi>June</hi> 1761. A few Days after, the like Misfortune happened to a labouring Man; but he was happily taken out of the Water ſooner than the firſt (who had remained about Half an Hour under it) and he was recovered by obſerving Part of the Advice this Chapter contains; of which Chapter ſeveral By-ſtanders had Copies.—This Note ſeems to be from the Author himſelf.</note>.</head>
               <p>SECT. 401. WHENEVER a Perſon who has been drowned, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Quarter of an Hour under Water, there can be no conſiderable Hope of his Recovery; the Space of two or three Minutes in ſuch a Situation being often ſufficient to kill a Man ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably. Nevertheleſs, as ſeveral Circumſtances may happen to have continued Life, in ſuch an unfortunate Situation, beyond the ordinary Term, we ſhould always endeavour to afford them the moſt effectual Relief, and not give them up as irrecoverable too ſoon: ſince it has often been known, that until the Expiration of two, and ſometimes even of three Hours, ſuch Bodies have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited ſome apparent Tokens of Life.</p>
               <p>Water has ſometimes been found in the Stomachs of drowned Perſons; at other times none at all. Beſides the greateſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which has ever been found in it has not exceeded that, which may be drank without any Inconvenience; whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the meer Quantity was not mortal; neither is it very eaſy to conceive how drowning Perſons can ſwallow Water. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kills them is meer Suffocation, or the Interception of Air, of the Action of Breathing; and the Water which deſcends into the Lungs, and which is determined there, by the Efforts they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, though involuntarily make, to draw Breath, after they are under Water: for there abſolutely does not any Water de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, either into the Stomach or the Lungs of Bodies plunged into Water, after they are dead; a Circumſtance which ſerves to eſtabliſh a legal Sentence and Judgment, in ſome criminal Caſes and Trials. This Water, intimately blending itſelf with the Air in the Lungs, forms a viſcid inactive Kind of Froth, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroys the Functions of the Lungs; whence the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sufferer is not only ſuffocated, but the Return of the Blood from the Head being alſo intercepted, the Blood Veſſels of the Brain are overcharged, and an Apoplexy is combined with the
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012243_0226_0F8A6D4C4ED28A58"/>
Suffocation. This ſecond Cauſe, that is, the Deſcent of the Water into the Lungs, is far from being general; it having been evident from the Diſſection of ſeveral drowned Bodies, that it really never had exiſted in them.</p>
               <p>§ 402. The Intention that ſhould be purſued, is that of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading the Lungs, and the Brain, and of reviving the extinguiſhed Circulation. For which Purpoſe we ſhould, 1, immediately ſtrip the Sufferer of all his wet Cloaths; rub him ſtrongly with dry coarſe Linen; put him, as ſoon as poſſible into a well heated Bed, and continue to rub him well a very conſiderable time together.</p>
               <p>2, A ſtrong and healthy Perſon ſhould force his own warm Breath into the Patient's Lungs; and alſo the Smoke of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, if ſome was at Hand, by Means of ſome Pipe, Chanel, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or the like, that may be introduced into the Mouth. This Air or Fume, being forcibly blown in, by ſtopping the Sufferer's Noſtrils cloſe at the ſame Time, penetrates into the Lungs, and there rarifies by its Heat that Air, which blended with the Water, compoſed the viſcid Spume or Froth. Hence that Air becomes diſengaged from the Water, recovers its Spring, dilates the Lungs; and, if there ſtill remains within any Principle of Life, the Circulation is renewed again that Inſtant.</p>
               <p>3, If a moderately expert Surgeon is at Hand, he muſt open the jugular Vein, or any large Vein in the Neck, and let out ten or twelve Ounces of Blood. Such a Bleeding is ſerviceable on many Accounts. Firſt, merely as Bleeding, it renews the Circulation, which is the conſtant Effect of Bleeding in ſuch Swoonings, as ariſe from an intercepted or ſuffocated Circulation. Secondly, it is that particular Bleeding, which moſt ſuddenly removes, in ſuch Caſes, the Infarction or Obſtruction of the Head and Lungs: and, thirdly, it is ſometimes the only Veſſel, whence Blood will iſſue under ſuch Circumſtances. The Veins of the Feet then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford none; and thoſe of the Arms ſeldom; but the Jugulars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly furniſh it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Fume of Tobacco ſhould be thrown up, as ſpeedily and plentifully as poſſible, into the Inteſtines by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament. There are very commodious Contrivances deviſed for this Purpoſe; but as they are not common, it may be effected by many ſpeedy Means. One, by which a Woman's Life was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, conſiſted only in introducing the ſmall Tube of a Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Pipe well lighted up: the Head or Bowl of it was wrapped up in a Paper, in which ſeveral Holes were pricked, and through theſe the Breath was ſtrongly forced. At the fifth Blaſt a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Rumbling was heard in the Woman's Belly; ſhe threw up a little Water, and a Moment afterwards came to her Senſes. Two Pipes may be thus lighted and applied, with their Bowls co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over; the Extremity of one is to be introduced into the Fundament; and the other may be blown through into the Lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:012243_0227_0F8A6D4D07255C68"/>Any other Vapour may alſo be conveyed up, by introducing a <hi>Canula,</hi> or any other Pipe, with a Bladder firmly fixed to it. This Bladder is faſtened at its other End to a large Tin Funnel, under which Tobacco is to be lighted. This Contrivance has ſucceeded with me upon other Occaſions, in which Neceſſity compelled me to invent and apply it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ſtrongeſt Volatiles ſhould be applied to the Patient's Noſtrils. The Powder of ſome ſtrong dry Herb ſhould be blown up his Noſe, ſuch as Sage, Roſemary, Rue, Mint, and eſpecially Marjoram, or very well dried Tobacco; or even the Fume, the Smoke of theſe Herbs. But all theſe Means are moſt properly employed after Bleeding, when they are moſt efficacious and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, as long as the Patient ſhews no Signs of Life, he will be unable to ſwallow, and it is then uſeleſs, and even dangerous, to pour much Liquid of any Kind into his Mouth, which could do nothing but keep up, or increaſe Suffocation. It is ſufficient, in ſuch Circumſtances, to inſtil a few Drops of ſome irritating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which might alſo be cordial and reviving. But as ſoon as ever he diſcovers any Motion, he ſhould take, within the Space of one Hour, five or ſix common Spoonfuls of Oxymel of Squills di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with warm Water: or, if that Medicine was not to be had very ſpeedily, a ſtrong Infuſion of the bleſſed Thiſtle, or <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> of Sage, or of Chamomile Flowers ſweetened with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, might do inſtead of it: and ſuppoſing nothing elſe to be had, ſome warm Water, with the Addition of a little common Salt, ſhould be given. Some Perſons are bold enough to recommend Vomits in ſuch Caſes; but they are not without their Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and it is not as a Vomit that I recommend the Oxymel of Squills in them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, notwithſtanding the Sick diſcover ſome Tokens of Life, we ſhould not ceaſe to continue our Aſſiſtance; ſince they ſometimes irrecoverably expire, after theſe firſt Appearances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, though they ſhould be manifeſtly re-animated, there ſometimes remains an Oppreſſion, a Coughing and Feveriſhneſs, which effectually conſtitute a Diſeaſe: and then it becomes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſometimes to bleed them in the Arms; to give them Barley Water plentifully, or Elder flower Tea.</p>
               <p>§ 403. Having thus pointed out ſuch Means as are neceſſary, and truly effectual, in ſuch unfortunate Accidents, I ſhall very briefly mention ſome others, which it is the general Cuſtom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to and apply in the firſt Hurry.</p>
               <p>1, Theſe unhappy People are ſometimes wrapped up in a Sheep's, or a Calf's, or a Dog's Skin, immediately flead from the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: ſuch Applications have ſometimes indeed revived the Heat of the Drowned; but their Operations are more ſlow, and leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, than the Heat of a well-warmed Bed; with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012243_0228_0F8A6D4DE2B9F038"/>
Vapour of burnt Sugar, and long continued Frictions with hot Flanels.</p>
               <p>2, The Method of rolling them in an empty Hogſhead, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and miſpends a deal of important Time.</p>
               <p>3, That alſo of hanging them up by the Feet is attended with Danger, and ought to be wholly diſcontinued. The Froth or Foam, which is one of the Cauſes of their Death, is too thick and tough to diſcharge itſelf, in Conſequence of its own Weight. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, this is the only Effect that can be expected, from this Cuſtom of ſuſpending them by the Feet; which muſt alſo be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by its tending to increaſe the Overfulneſs of the Head and of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>§ 404. It is ſome Years ſince a Girl of eighteen Years old was recovered [though it is unknown whether ſhe remained under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only a little Time or ſome Hours] who was motionleſs, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen as it were, inſenſible, with her Eyes cloſed, her Mouth wide open, a livid Colour, a ſwoln Viſage, a Tumour or Bloating of the whole Body, which was overladen as it were, or Water-ſoaked. This miſerable Object was extended on a Kind of Bed, of hot of very warm Aſhes, quickly heated in great Kettles; and by laying her quite naked on theſe Aſhes; by covering her with others equally hot; by putting a Bonnet round her Head, with a Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round her Neck ſtuffed with the ſame, and heaping Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings over all this, at the End of Half an Hour her Pulſe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe recovered her Speech, and cried out, <hi>I freeze, I freeze</hi>: A little Cherry-Brandy was given her, and then ſhe remained bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as it were, eight Hours under the Aſhes; being taken out of them afterwards without any other Complaint, except that of great Laſſitude or Wearineſs, which went entirely off the third Day. This Method was undoubtedly ſo effectual, that it well deſerves Imitation; but it ſhould not make us inattentive to the others. Heated Gravel or Sand mixed with Salt, or hot Salt alone, would have been equally efficacious, and they have been found ſo.</p>
               <p>At the very Time of writing this, two young Ducks, that were drowned, have been revived by a dry Bath of hot Aſhes. The Heat of a Dung-heap may alſo be beneficial; and I have juſt been informed, by a very creditable and ſenſible Spectator of it, that it effectually contributed to reſtore Life to a Man, who had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly remained ſix Hours under Water.</p>
               <p>§ 405. I ſhall conclude theſe Directions with an Article printed in a little Work at <hi>Paris,</hi> about twenty Years ſince, by Order of the King, to which there is not the leaſt Doubt, but that any other Sovereign will readily accede.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Notwithſtanding the common People are very generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be compaſſionate, and may wiſh to give all Aſſiſtance to drowned Perſons, it frequently happens they do not, only becauſe they dare not; imagining they expoſe themſelves by it to Proſecutions. It is therefore neceſſary that they ſhould
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012243_0229_0F8A6D4E87857DC8"/>
know, and it cannot be too often repeated, in order to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch a pernicious Prejudice, that the Magiſtrates have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver interpoſed to prevent People from trying every poſſible Means to recover ſuch unfortunate Perſons, as ſhall be drowned and taken out of the Water. It is only in thoſe Caſes, when the Perſons are known to be abſolutely and irrecoverably dead, that Juſtice renders it neceſſary to ſeize their Bodies.</q>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX. Of Subſtances ſtopt between the Mouth and the Stomach.</head>
               <p>SECT. 406. THE Food we take in deſcends from the Mouth through a very ſtrait Paſſage or Channel called the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which going parallel with the Spine or Backbone, joins to, or terminates at, the Stomach.</p>
               <p>It happens ſometimes that different Bodies are ſtopt in this Channel, without being able either to deſcend or to return up again; whether this Difficulty ariſes from their being too large; or whether it be owing to their having ſuch Angles or Points, as by penetrating into, and adhering to the Sides of this membranous Canal, abſolutely prevent the uſual Action and Motion of it.</p>
               <p>§ 407. Very dangerous Symptoms ariſe from this Stoppage, which are frequently attended with a moſt acute Pain in the Part; and at other times, with a very incommodious, rather than pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Senſation; ſometimes an ineffectual Commotion at, or riſing of, the Stomach, attended with great Anguiſh; and if the Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page be ſo circumſtanced, that the <hi>Glottis</hi> is cloſed, or the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe compreſſed, a dreadful Suffocation is the Conſequence: the Patient cannot breathe, the Lungs are quite diſtended; and the Blood being unable to return from the Head, the Countenance becomes firſt red, then livid; the Neck ſwells; the Oppreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and the poor Sufferer ſpeedily dies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>When the Patient's Breathing is not ſtopt, nor greatly oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if the Paſſage is not entirely blocked up, and he can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſomething, he lives very eaſily for a few Days, and then his Caſe becomes a particular Diſorder of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> or Gullet, But if the Paſſage is abſolutely cloſed, and the Obſtruction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed for many Days, a terrible Death is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>§ 408. The Danger of ſuch Caſes does not depend ſo much on the Nature of the obſtructing Subſtance, as on its Size, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that of the Paſſage of the Part where it ſtops, and of the Manner in which it forms the Obſtruction; and frequently the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012243_0230_0F8A6D5224608FA0"/>
very Food may occaſion Death; while Subſtances leſs adapted to be ſwallowed are not attended with any violent Conſequences, though ſwallowed.</p>
               <p>A Child of ſix Days old ſwallowed a Comfit or Sugar Plumb, which ſtuck in the Paſſage, and inſtantly killed it.</p>
               <p>A grown Perſon perceived that a Bit of Mutton had ſtopt in the Paſſage; not to alarm any Body he aroſe from Table; a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterwards, on looking where he might be gone, he was found dead. Another was choaked by a Bit of Cake; a third by a Piece of a Skin of a Ham; and a fourth by an Egg, which he ſwallowed whole in a Bravado.</p>
               <p>A Child was killed by a Cheſnut ſwallowed whole. Another died ſuddenly, choaked (which is always the Circumſtance, when they die inſtantly after ſuch Accidents) by a Pear which he had toſſed up, and catched in his Mouth. A Woman was choaked with another Pear. A Piece of a Sinew continued eight Days in the Paſſage, ſo that it prevented the Patient from getting down any Thing uſe; at the Expiration of that Time it fell into the Stomach, being looſened by its Putridity: the Patient notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding died ſoon after, being killed by the Inflammation, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and Weakneſs it had occaſioned. Unhappily there occur but too many Inſtances of this Sort, of which it is unneceſſary to cite more.</p>
               <p>§ 409. Whenever any Subſtance is thus detained in the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, there are two Ways of removing it; that is either by extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or puſhing it down. The ſafeſt and moſt certain Way is always to extract or draw it out, but this is not always the eaſieſt: and as the Efforts made for this Purpoſe greatly fatigue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and are ſometimes attended with grievous Conſequences; therefore, if the Occaſion is extremely urging, it may be eligible to thruſt it down, if that is eaſier; and if there is no Danger from the Reception of the obſtructing Body into the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Subſtances which may be puſhed down without Danger are all common nouriſhing ones, as Bread, Meat, Cakes, Fruits, Puls, Morſels of Tripe, and even Skin of Bacon. It is only very large Morſels of particular Aliments, that prove very difficult to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; yet even ſuch are rarely attended with any Fatality.</p>
               <p>§ 410 The Subſtances we ſhould endeavour to extract or draw out, though it be mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> painful and leſs eaſy than to puſh them down, are all thoſe, whoſe Conſequences might be highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or even mortal, if ſwallowed. Such are all totally indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible Bodies, as Cork, Linen-Rags, large Fruit Stones, Bones, Wood, Glaſs, Stones, Metals; and more eſpecially if any further Danger may be ſuperadded to that of its Indigeſtibility, from the Shape, whether rough, ſharp, pointed, or angular, of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſwallowed. Wherefore we ſhould chiefly endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Pins, Needles, Fiſh-bones, other pointed Fragments of Bones, Bits of Glaſs, Sciſſars, Rings, or Buckles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:012243_0231_0F8A6D524950B078"/>Nevertheleſs it has happened, that every one of theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have at one Time or another been ſwallowed, and the moſt uſual Conſequences of them are violent Pains of the Stomach, and in the Guts; Inflammations, Suppurations, Abſceſſes, a ſlow Fever, Gangrene, the <hi>Miſerere</hi> or Iliac Paſſion; external Abſceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, through which the Bodies ſwallowed down have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and frequently, after a long Train of Maladies, a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death.</p>
               <p>§ 411. When ſuch Subſtances have not paſſed in too deep, we ſhould endeavour to extract them with our Fingers, which often ſucceeds. If they are lower, we ſhould make uſe of Nippers, or a ſmall Forceps; of which Surgeons are provided with different Sorts. Thoſe which ſome Smoakers carry about them might be very convenient for ſuch Purpoſes; and in Caſe of Neceſſity they might be made very readily out of two Bits of Wood. But this Attempt to extract rarely ſucceeds, if the Subſtance has deſcended far into the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and if it be of a flexible Nature, which exactly applies itſelf to, and fills up the Cavity or Channel of the Gullet.</p>
               <p>§ 412. If the Fingers and the Nippers fail, or cannot be duly applied, Crotchets, a Kind of Hooks, muſt be employed.</p>
               <p>Such may be made at once with a pretty ſtrong Iron Wire, crooked at the End. It muſt be introduced in the flat Way, and for the better conducting of it, there ſhould be another Curve or Hook at the End it is held by, to ſerve as a Kind of Handle to it, which has this further Uſe, that it may be ſecured by a String tied to it; a Circumſtance not to be omitted in any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment employed on the like Occaſions, to avoid ſuch ill Accidents as have ſometimes enſued, from theſe Inſtruments ſlipping out of the Operator's Hold. After the Crotchet has paſſed beyond and below the Subſtance, that obſtructs the Paſſage, it is drawn up again, and hooks up with it and extracts that Impediment to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>This Crotchet is alſo very convenient, whenever a Subſtance ſomewhat flexible, as a Pin or a Fiſhbone ſticks, as it were, acroſs the Gullet: the Crotchet in ſuch Caſes ſeizing them about their middle Part, crooks and thus diſengages them. If they are very brittle Subſtances, it ſerves to break them; and if any Fragments ſtill adhere within, ſome other Means muſt be uſed to extract them.</p>
               <p>§ 413. When the obſtructing Bodies are ſmall, and only ſtop up Part of the Paſſage; and which may either eaſily elude the Hook, or ſtraiten it by their Reſiſtance, a Kind of Rings may be uſed, and made either ſolid or flexible.</p>
               <p>The ſolid ones are made of Iron Wire, or of a String of very fine Braſs Wire. For this Purpoſe the Wire is bent into a Circle about the middle Part of its Length, the Sides of which Circle do not touch each other, but leave a Ring, or hollow Cavity, of about an Inch Diameter. Then the long unbent Sides of the Wire are brought near each other; the circular Part or Ring is
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:012243_0232_0F8A6D530E4B4188"/>
introduced into the Gullet, in order to be conducted about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Body, and ſo to extract it. Very flexible Rings may be made of Wool, Thread, Silk, or ſmall Packthread, which may be waxed, for their greater Strength and Conſiſtence. Then they are to be tied faſt to a Handle of Iron Wire, of Whalebone, or of any alexible Wood; after which the Ring is to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſurround the obſtructing Subſtance, and to draw it out.</p>
               <p>Several of theſe Rings paſſed through one another are often made uſe of, the more certainly to lay hold of the obſtructing Body, which may be involved by one, if another ſhould miſs it. This Sort of Rings has one Advantage, which is, that when the Subſtance to be extracted is once laid hold of, it may then, by turning the Handle, be retained ſo ſtrongly in the Ring thus twiſted, as to be moved every Way; which muſt be a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advantage in many ſuch Caſes.</p>
               <p>§ 414. A fourth Material employed on theſe unhappy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is the Spunge. Its Property of ſwelling conſiderably, on being wet, is the Foundation of its Uſefulneſs here.</p>
               <p>If any Subſtance is ſtopt in the Gullet, but without filling up the whole Paſſage, a Bit of Spunge is introduced into that Part that is unſtopt, and beyond the Subſtance. The Spunge ſoon dilates, and grows larger in this moiſt Situation, and indeed the Enlargement of it may be forwarded, by making the Patient ſwallow a few Drops of Water; and then drawing back the Spunge by the Handle it is faſtened to, as it is now too large to return through the ſmall Cavity, by which it was conveyed in, it draws out the obſtructing Body with it, and thus unplugs, as it were, and opens the Gullet.</p>
               <p>As dry Spunge may ſhrink or be contracted, this Circumſtance has proved the Means of ſqueezing a pretty large Piece of it into a very ſmall Space. It becomes greatly compreſſed by winding a String or Tape very cloſely about it, which Tape may be eaſily unwound and withdrawn, after the Spunge has been introduced. It may alſo be incloſed in a Piece of Whalebone, ſplit into four Sticks at one End, and which, being endued with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spring, contracts upon the Spunge. The Whalebone is ſo ſmoothed and accommodated, as not to wound; and the Spunge is alſo to be ſafely tied to a ſtrong Thread; that after having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged the Whalebone from it, the Surgeon may alſo draw out the Spunge at Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Spunge is alſo applied on theſe Occaſions in another Manner. When there is no Room to convey it into the Gullet, becauſe the obſtructing Subſtance ingroſſes its whole Cavity; and ſuppoſing it not hooked into the Part, but ſolely detained by the Straitneſs of the Paſſage, a pretty large Bit of Spunge is to be introduced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gullet, and cloſe to the obſtructing Subſtance: Thus applied, the Spunge ſwells, and thence dilates that Part of the Paſſage that is above this Subſtance. The Spunge is then with
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:012243_0233_0F8A6D53D3FD5328"/>
drawn a little, and but a very little, and this Subſtance being leſ preſſed upon above than below, it ſometimes happens, that the greater Straitneſs and Contraction of the lower Part of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, than of its upper Part, cauſes that Subſtance to aſcend; and as ſoon as this firſt Looſening or Diſengagement of it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the total Diſengagement of it eaſily follows.</p>
               <p>§ 415. Finally, when all theſe Methods prove unavailable, there remains one more, which is to make the Patient vomit; but this can ſcarcely be of any Service, but when ſuch obſtructing Bodies are ſimply engaged in, and not hooked or ſtruck into the Sides of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi>; ſince under this latter Circumſtance vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting might occaſion further Miſchief.</p>
               <p>If the Patient can ſwallow, a Vomiting may be excited with the Preſcription No. 8 or with No. 34, or 35. By this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Bone was thrown out, which had ſtopt in the Paſſage four and twenty Hours.</p>
               <p>When the Patient cannot ſwallow, an Attempt ſhould be made to excite him to vomit by introducing into, and twirling about the feathery End of a Quill in, the Bottom of the Throat, which the Feather however will not effect, if the obſtructing Body ſtrongly compreſſes the whole Circumference of the Gullet; and then no other Reſource is left, but giving a Glyſter of Tobacco. A certain Perſon ſwallowed a large Morſel of Calf's Lightſ, which ſtopt in the Middle of the Gullet, and exactly filled up the Paſſage. A Surgeon unſucceſsfully attempted various Methods to extract it; but another ſeeing how unavailable all of them were; and the Patient's Viſage becoming black and ſwelled; his Eyes ready to ſtart, as it were, out of his Head; and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to frequent Swoonings, attended with Convulſions too, he cauſed a Glyſter of an Ounce of Tobacco boiled to be thrown up; the Conſequence of which was a violent Vomiting, which threw up the Subſtance that was ſo very near killing him.</p>
               <p>§ 416. A ſixth Method, which I believe has never hitherto been attempted, but which may prove very uſeful in many Caſes, when the Subſtances in the Paſſage are not too hard, and are very large, would be to fix a Worm (uſed for withdrawing the Charge of Guns that have been loaded) faſt to a flexible Handle, with a waxed Thread faſtened to the Handle, in order to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it, if the Handle ſlipt from the Worm; and by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance it might be very practicable, if the obſtructing Subſtance was not too deep in the Paſſage of the Gullet, to extract it.— It has been known that a Thorn faſtened in the Throat, has been thrown out by laughing.</p>
               <p>§ 417. In the Circumſtances mentioned § 409, when it is more eaſy and convenient to puſh the obſtructing Body downwards, it has been uſual to make uſe of Leeks, which may generally be had any where (but which indeed are very ſubject to break) or of a Wax-candle oiled, and but a very little heated, ſo as to make it flexible; or of a Piece of Whalebone; or of Iron-Wire; one
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:012243_0234_0F8A6D5488851F30"/>
Extremity of which may be thickened and blunted in a Minute with a little melted Lead. Small Sticks of ſome flexible Wood may be as convenient for the ſame Uſe, ſuch as the Birch-tree, the Hazel, the Aſh, the Willow, a flexible Plummet, or a leaden Ring. All theſe Subſtances ſhould be very ſmooth, that they may not give the leaſt Irritation; for which Reaſon they are ſometimes covered over with a thin Bit of Sheep's Gut. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Spunge is faſtened to one End of them, which, completely filling up the whole Paſſage, puſhes down whatever Obſtacle it meets with.</p>
               <p>In ſuch Caſes too, the Patient may be prompted to attempt ſwallowing down large Morſels of ſome unhurtful Subſtance, ſuch as a Cruſt of Bread, a ſmall Turnep, a Lettuce Stalk, or a Bullet, in Hopes of their carrying down the obſtructing Cauſe with them. It muſt be acknowledged, however, that theſe afford but a feeble Aſſiſtance; and if they are ſwallowed without being well ſecured to a Thread, it may be apprehended they may even increaſe the Obſtruction, by their own Stoppage.</p>
               <p>It has ſometimes very happily, though rarely, occured, that thoſe Subſtances attempted to be detruded or thruſt downwards, have ſtuck in the Wax-Candle, or the Leek, and ſprung up and out with them: but this can never happen, except in the Caſe of pointed Subſtances.</p>
               <p>§ 418. Should it be impoſſible to extract the Bodies mentioned § 410, and all ſuch as it muſt be dangerous to admit into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, we muſt then prefer the leaſt of two Evils, and rather run the Hazard of puſhing them down, than ſuffer the Patient to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh dreadfully in a few Moments. And we ought to ſcruple this Reſolution the leſs, as a great many Inſtances have demonſtrated, that notwithſtanding ſeveral bad Conſequences, and even a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Death, have often followed the ſwallowing of ſuch hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or indigeſtible Subſtances; yet at other times they have been attended with little or no Diſorder.</p>
               <p>§ 419. One of theſe four Events is always the Caſe, after ſwallowing ſuch Things. They either, 1, go off by Stool; or, 2, they are not diſcharged, and kill the Patient. Or elſe, 3, they are diſcharged by Urine; or, 4, are viſibly extruded to the Skin. I ſhall give ſome Inſtances of each of theſe Events.</p>
               <p>§ 420. When they are voided by Stool, they are either voided ſoon after they have been ſwallowed, and that without having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſcarce any troubleſome Symptoms; or the voiding of them has not happened till a long time after ſwallowing, and is preceded with very conſiderable Pain. It has been ſeen that a Bone of the Leg of a Fowl, a Peach-ſtone, the Cover of a ſmall Box of Venice Treacle, Pins, Needles, and Coins of different Sorts, have been voided within a few Days after they had ſlipt down into the Stomach; and that with little or no Complaint. A ſmall Flute, or Pipe alſo, four Inches long, which occaſioned acute Pains for three Days, has been voided happily afterwards,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:012243_0235_0F8A6D5548075410"/>
beſides Knives, Razors, and one Shoe-buckle. I have ſeen but a few Days ſince, a Child between two and three Years old, who ſwallowed a Nail above an Inch long, the Head of which was more than three Tenths of an Inch broad: it ſtopt a few Moments about the Neck, but deſcended while its Friends were looking for me; and was voided with a Stool that Night, without any bad Conſequence. And ſtill more lately I have known the entire Bone of a Chicken's Wing thus ſwallowed, which only occaſioned a ſlight Pain in the Stomach for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rce or four Days.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſuch Subſtances are retained within for a long Time, not being voided till after ſeveral Months, and even Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ill Effect: and ſome of them have never either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, nor been complained of.</p>
               <p>§ 421. But the Event is not always ſo happy; and ſometimes, though they are diſcharged through the natural Paſſages, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges have been preceded by very acute Pains in the Stomach, and in the Bowels. A Girl ſwallowed down ſome Pins, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted her with violent Pains for the Space of Six Years; at the Expriation of which Term ſhe voided them and recovered. Three Needles being ſwallowed brought on Cholics, Swoonings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions for a Year after: and then being voided by Stool, the Patient recovered. Another Perſon who ſwallowed two, was much happier, in ſuffering but ſix Hours from them; when they were voided by Stool, and he did well.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens that ſuch indigeſtible Subſtances, after having paſt all the Meanders, the whole Courſe of the Inteſtines, have been ſtopt in the Fundament, and brought on very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Symptoms; but ſuch however, as an expert Surgeon may very generally remove. If it is practicable to cut them, as it is when they happen to be thin Bones, the Jaw-bones of Fiſh, or Pins, they are then very eaſily extracted.</p>
               <p>§ 422. The ſecond Event is when theſe fatal Subſtances are never voided, but cauſe very embarraſſing Symptoms which finally kill the Patient; and of theſe Caſes there have been but too many Examples.</p>
               <p>A young Girl having ſwallowed ſome Pins, which ſhe held in her Mouth, ſome of them were voided by Stool; but others of them pricked and pierced into her Guts, and even into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of her Belly, with the ſevereſt Pain; and killed her at the and of three Weeks.</p>
               <p>A Man ſwallowed a Needle, which pierced through his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and into his Liver<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſaw a very ſimilar Inſtance and Event in a Lady's little favourite Bitch, whoſe Body ſhe deſired to be opened, from ſuſpecting her to have been poiſoned. But it appeared that a ſmall Needle with fine Thread, which ſhe had ſwallowed, had paſſed out of the Stomach into the <hi>Duodenum</hi> (one of the Guts) through which the Point had pierced, and pricked and corroded the concave Part of the Liver, which was all rough and putrid. The whole Carcaſe was greatly bloated and extremely offenſive, very ſoon after the poor Animal's Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened two or three Months after the Accident, and was preceded by a great Wheezing, Reſtleſſneſs and Loſs of Appetite. The Needle was ruſty, but the Thread entire, and very little altered. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note>, and ended in a mortal Conſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="unknown:012243_0236_0F8A6D5607C4A1D8"/>A Plummet which ſlipt down, while the Throat of a Patient was ſearching, killed him at the End of two Years.</p>
               <p>It is very common for different Coins, and of different Metals, to be ſwallowed without any fatal or troubleſome Effects. Even a hundred Luidores <note n="*" place="bottom">I knew a Man of the Name of <hi>Poole,</hi> who being taken in the ſame Ship with me, 1717 or 18, by Pirates, had ſwallowed four Guineas, and a Gold Ring, all which he voided ſome Days after without any Injury or Complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaved them. I forgot the exact Number of Days be retained them, but the Pirates ſtaid with us from Saturday Night to Thurſday Noon. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> have been ſwallowed, and all voided. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs theſe fortunate Eſcapes ought not to make People too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and incautious on ſuch Occaſions, ſince ſuch melancholy Conſequences have happened, as may very juſtly alarm them. One ſingle Piece of Money that was ſwallowed, entirely obſtructed the Communication between the Stomach and the Inteſtines, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Patient. Whole Nuts have often been inadvertently ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but there have been ſome Inſtances of Perſons in whom a Heap <note n="†" place="bottom">Many fatal Examples of this Kind may be ſeen in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions</hi>; and they ſhould caution People againſt ſwallowing Cherry-ſtones, and ſtill more againſt thoſe of Prunes, or ſuch as are pointed, though not very acutely. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </note> of them has been formed, which proved the Cauſe of Death, after producing much Pain and Inquietude.</p>
               <p>§ 423. The third Iſſue or Event is, when theſe Subſtances, thus ſwallowed down, have been diſcharged by Urine: but theſe Caſes are very rare.</p>
               <p>A Pin of a middling Size has been diſcharged by Urine, three Days after it ſlipt down: and a little Bone has been expelled the ſame Way, beſides Cherry-ſtones, Plumb-ſtones, and even one Peach-ſtone.</p>
               <p>§ 424. Finally, the fourth Conſequence or Event is, when the indigeſtible Subſtances thus ſwallowed, have pierced through the Stomach or Inteſtines, and even to the Skin itſelf; and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Abſceſs, have made an Outlet for themſelves, or have been taken out of the Abſceſs. A long Time is often required to effect this extraordinary Trajection and Appearance of them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Pains they occaſion are continual; in other Caſes the Patient complains for a Time after which the Pain ceaſes, and then returns again. The Impoſthume, or Gathering, is formed in the Stomach, or in ſome other Part of the Belly: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe very Subſtances, after having pierced through the Guts, make very ſingular Roots, and are diſcharged very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely from the Belly. One Needle that had been ſwallowed found its Way out, at the End of four Years, through the Leg; another at the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="unknown:012243_0237_0F8A6D56F2F69D98"/>§ 425. All theſe Examples, and many others of cruel Deaths, from ſwallowing noxious Subſtances, demonſtrate the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an habitual Caution in this Reſpect; and give their Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt the horrid, I had almoſt ſaid, the criminal Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of People amuſing themſelves with ſuch Tricks as may lead to ſuch terrible Accidents; or even holding any ſuch Subſtance in their Mouths, as, by ſlipping down through Imprudence or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, may prove the Occaſion of their Death. Is it poſſible that any one, without ſhuddering, can hold Pins or Needles in their Mouths, after reflecting on the dreadful Accidents, and cruel Deaths, that have thus been cauſed by them?</p>
               <p>§ 426. It has been ſhewn already, that Subſtances obſtructing the Paſſage of the Gullet ſometimes ſuffocate the Patient; that at other times they can neither be extracted nor thruſt down; but that they ſtop in the Paſſage, without killing the Patient, at leaſt not immediately and at once. This is the Caſe when they are ſo circumſtanced, as not to compreſs the <hi>Trach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> the Wind-pipe, and not totally to prevent the ſwallowing of Food; which laſt Circumſtance can ſcarcely happen, except the Obſtruction has been formed by angular or pointed Bodies. The Stoppage of ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is ſometimes attended, and that without much Violence, with a ſmall Suppuration, which looſens them; and then they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned upwards through the Mouth, or deſcend into the Stomach. But at other times an extraordinary Inflammation is produced, which kills the Patient. Or if the Contents of the Abſceſs attending the Inflammation tend outwardly, a Tumour is formed on the external Part of the Neck which is to be opened, and through whoſe Orifice the obſtructing Body is diſcharged. In other Inſtances again they take a different Courſe, attended with little or no Pain, and are at length diſcharged by a Gathering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Neck, on the Breaſt, the Shoulder, or various other Parts.</p>
               <p>§ 427. Some Perſons, aſtoniſhed at the extraordinary Courſe and Progreſſion of ſuch Subſtances, which, from their Size, and eſpecially from their Shape, ſeem to them incapable of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into, and in ſome Sort, circulating through the human Body, without deſtroying it, are very deſirous of having the Rout and Progreſſion of ſuch intruding Subſtances explained to them. To gratify ſuch Inquirers, I may be indulged in a ſhort Digreſſion, which perhaps is the leſs foreign to my Plan; as in diſſipating what ſeems marvelous, and has been thought ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural in ſuch Caſes, I may eradicate that ſuperſtitious Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which has often aſcribed Effects of this Sort to Witchcraft; but which admit of an eaſy Explanation. This very Reaſon is the Motive that has determined me to give a further Extent to this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Wherever an Inciſion is made through the Skin, a certain Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane appears, which conſiſts of two Coats or <hi>Lamin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> ſeparated from each other by ſmall Cells or Cavities, which all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:012243_0238_0F8A6D58E112DBA0"/>
together; and which are furniſhed, more or leſs, with Fat, There is not any Fat throughout the human Body, which is not incloſed in, or enveloped with, this Coat, which is called the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipoſe, fatty, or cellular Membrane.</p>
               <p>This Membrane is not only found under the Skin, but further plying and inſinuating itſelf in various Manners, it is extended throughout the whole Body. It diſtinguiſhes and ſeparates all the Muſcles; it conſtitutes a Part of the Stomach, of the Guts, of the Bladder, and of all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Bowels. It is this which forms what is termed the Cawl, and which alſo furniſhes a Sheath or Envelopement to the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves. In ſome Parts it is very thick, and is abundantly repleniſhed with Fat; in others it is very thin and unprovided with any; but wherever it extends, it is wholly inſenſible, or void of all Senſation, all Feeling.</p>
               <p>It may be compared to a quilted Coverlet, the Cotton, or other Stuffing of which, is unequally diſtributed; greatly abounding in ſome Places, with none at all in others, ſo that in theſe the Stuff above and below, touch each other. Within this Membrane, or Coverlet, as it were, ſuch extraneous or foreign Subſtances are moved about; and as there is a general Communication through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Extent of the Membrane, it is no ways ſurprizing, that they are moved from one Part to another very diſtant, in a long Courſe and Duration of Movement. Officers and Soldiers very often experience, that Bullets which do not paſs through the Parts where they have entered, are transferred to very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and remote ones.</p>
               <p>The general Communication throughout this Membrane is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated by Facts, which the Law prohibits; this is the Butchers inflating, or blowing up, the cellular Membrane thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Carcaſe of a Calf, by a ſmall Inciſion in the Skin, into which they introduce a Pipe or the Nozzle of a ſmall Bellows; and then, on blowing forcibly, the Air evidently puffs up the whole Body of the Calf into this artificial Tumour or Swelling.</p>
               <p>Some very criminal Impoſtors have availed themſelves of this wicked Contrivance, thus to bloat up Children into a Kind of Monſters, which they afterwards expoſe to View for Money.</p>
               <p>In this cellular Membrane the extravaſated Waters of hydropic Patients are commonly diffuſed; and here they give Way to that Motion, to which their own Weight diſpoſes them. But here I may be aſked—As this Membrane is croſſed and interſected in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of it, by Nerves, Veins, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which unavoidably occaſions grievous Symptoms, how comes it, that ſuch do not enſue upon the Intruſion of ſuch nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Subſtances? To this I anſwer, 1, that ſuch Symptoms do ſometimes really enſue; and, 2, that nevertheleſs they muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but ſeldom, by Reaſon that all the aforeſaid Parts, which traverſe and interſect this Membrane, being harder than the Fat it contains; ſuch foreign Subſtances muſt almoſt neceſſarily, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012243_0239_0F8A6D595EF8B600"/>
ever they rencounter thoſe Parts, be turned aſide towards the Fat which ſurrounds them, whoſe Reſiſtance is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leſs; and this he more certainly ſo, as theſe Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are always of a cylindrical Form. — But to return from this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Digreſſion.</p>
               <p>§ 428. To all theſe Methods and Expedients, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recommended on the important Subject of this Chapter, I ſhall further add ſome general Directions.</p>
               <p>1. It is often uſeful, and even neceſſary, to take a conſiderable Quantity of Blood from the Arm; but eſpecially if the Patient's Reſpiration, or Breathing, is extremely oppreſſed; or when we cannot ſpeedily ſucceed in our Effort to remove the obſtructing Subſtance; as the Bleeding is adapted to prevent the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the frequent Irritations from ſuch Subſtances occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and as by its diſpoſing the whole Body into a State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, it might poſſibly procure an immediate Diſcharge of the offending Subſtance.</p>
               <p>2. Whenever it is manifeſt that all Endeavours, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or to puſh down the Subſtance ſtopped in the Paſſage, are ineffectual, they ſhould be diſcontinued; becauſe the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occaſioned by perſiſting in them, would be as dangerous as the Obſtruction itſelf; as there have been Inſtances of People's dying in Conſequence of the Inflammation; notwithſtanding the Body, which cauſed the Obſtruction, had been entirely removed.</p>
               <p>3. While the Means already adviſed are making uſe of, the Patient ſhould often ſwallow, or, if he cannot, he ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently receive by Injection through a crooked Tube or Pipe, that may reach lower down than the <hi>Glottis,</hi> ſome very emollient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as warm Water, either alone or mixed with Milk, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Barley, of Mallows, or of Bran. A two-fold Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may ariſe from this; the firſt is, that theſe ſoftening Liquors ſmooth and ſooth the irritated Parts; and ſecondly, an Injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrongly thrown in, has often been more ſucceſsful in looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the obſtructing Body, than all Attempts with Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>4. When after all we are obliged to leave this in the Part, the Patient muſt be treated as if he had an inflammatory Diſeaſe; he muſt be bled, ordered to a Regimen, and have his whole Neck ſurrounded with emollient Pultices. The like Treatment muſt alſo be uſed, though the obſtructing Subſtance be removed; if there is Room to ſuppoſe any Inflammation left in the Paſſage.</p>
               <p>5. A proper Degree of Agitation has ſometimes looſened the inhering Body, more effectually than Inſtruments. It has been experienced that a Blow with the Fiſt on the Spine, the Middle of the Back, has often diſengaged ſuch obſtructed and obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies; and I have known two Inſtances of Patients who had Pins ſtopt in the Paſſage; and who getting on Horſeback to ride out in Search of Relief at a neighbouring Village, found each of them the Pin diſengaged after an Hour's Riding: One ſpat it out, and the other ſwallowed it, without any ill Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="unknown:012243_0240_0F8A6D5B6904F230"/>6. When there is an immediate Apprehenſion of the Patient's being ſuffocated; when bleeding him has been of no Service; when all Hope of freeing the Paſſage in time is vaniſhed, and Death ſeems at Hand, if Reſpiration be not reſtored; the Operation of <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> or opening of the Wind-pipe, muſt be directly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; an Operation neither difficult to a tolerably knowing and expert Surgeon, nor very painful to the Patient.</p>
               <p>7. When the Subſtance that was ſtopt paſſes into the Stomach, the Patient muſt immediately be put into a very mild and ſmooth Regimen. He ſhould avoid all ſharp, irritating, inflaming Food; Wine, ſpirituous Liquors, all ſtrong Drink, and Coffee; taking but little Nouriſhment at once, and no Solids, without their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been thoroughly well chewed. The beſt Diet would be that of farinaceous mealy Soups, made of various leguminous Grains, and of Milk and Water, which is much better than the uſual Cuſtom of ſwallowing different Oils.</p>
               <p>§ 429. The Author of Nature has provided, that in eating, nothing ſhould paſs by the <hi>Glottis</hi> into the Wind-pipe. This Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune nevertheleſs does ſometimes happen; at which very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant there enſues an inceſſant and violent Cough, an acute Pain, with Suffocation; all the Blood being forced up into the Head, the Patient is in extreme Anguiſh, being agitated with violent and involuntary Motions, and ſometimes dying on the Spot. A <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> Grenadier, by Trade a Shoe-maker, was eating and working at the ſame time. He tumbled at once from his Seat, without ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a ſingle Word. His Comrades called out for Aſſiſtance; ſome Surgeons ſpeedily arrived, but after all their Endeavours he diſcovered no Token of Life. On opening the Body, they found a Lump, or large Morſel, of Beef, weighing two Ounces, forced into the Wind-pipe, which it plugged up ſo exactly, that not the leaſt Air could paſs through it into the Lungs.</p>
               <p>§ 430. In a Caſe ſo circumſtanced, the Patient ſhould be ſtruck often on the Middle of the Back; ſome Efforts to vomit ſhould be excited; he ſhould be prompted to ſneeze with Powder of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Valley, Sage, or any cephalic Snuffs, which ſhould be blown ſtrongly up his Noſe.</p>
               <p>A Pea, pitched into the Mouth in playing, entered into the Wind-pipe, and ſprung out again by vomiting the Patient with Oil. A little Bone was brought up from another, by making him ſneeze, with powdered Lilly of the Valley.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if all theſe Means of aſſiſting, or ſaving the Patient are evidently ineffectual, <hi>Bronchotomy</hi> muſt be ſpeedily performed (See No. 6, of the preceding Section.) By this Operation, ſome Bones, a Bean, and a Fiſh-bone have been extracted, and the Patient has been delivered from approaching Death.</p>
               <p>§ 431. Nothing ſhould be left untried, when the Preſervation of human Life is the Object. In thoſe Caſes, when an obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body can neither be diſengaged from the Throat, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Stomach, nor be ſuffered to remain there without
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:012243_0241_0F8A6D5C41B3B6F8"/>
ſpeedly killing the Patient, it has been propoſed to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into this Paſſage, the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> through which ſuch a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to be extracted; and to employ the like Means, when a Subſtance which had ſlipt even into the Stomach itſelf, was of a Nature to excite ſuch Symptoms, as muſt ſpeedily deſtroy the Patient.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> is ſo fully and ſtrongly cloſed, that the Patient can receive no Food by the Mouth, he is to be nouriſhed by Glyſters of Soup, Gelly, and the like.</p>

                  <p>§ 434. If a Wound has penetrated into any of the Cavities, and has wounded any Part contained in the Breaſt, or in the Belly: Or if, without having entered into one of the Cavities, it has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſome great Blood-veſſel; or if it has wounded a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nerve, which occaſions Symptoms much more violent, than would otherwiſe have happened; if it has penetrated even to and injured the Bone: it ſhort, if any great and ſevere Symptom ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenes, there is an abſolute Neceſſity for calling in a Surgeon. But whenever the Wound is not attended with any of theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; when it affects only the Skin, the fat Membrane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, the fleſhy Parts and the ſmall Veſſels, it may eaſily and ſimply be dreſſed without ſuch Aſſiſtance; ſince, in general all that is truly neceſſary in ſuch Caſes is, to defend the Wound from the Impreſſions of the Air; and yet not ſo, as to give any material Obſtruction to the Diſcharge of the Matter, that is to iſſue from the Wound.</p>
                  <p>§ 435. If the Blood does not particularly flow out of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Veſſel, but trickles almoſt equally from every Spot of the
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:012243_0243_0F8A6D5EA4DE1088"/>
Wound, it may very ſafely be permitted to bleed, while ſome Lint is ſpeedily preparing. As ſoon as the Lint is ready, ſo much of it may be introduced into the Wound as will nearly fill it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being forced in; which is highly improper, and would be attended with the ſame Inconveniences as Tents and Doſſils. It ſhould be covered over with a Compreſs dipt in ſweet Oil, or with the Cerecloth No. 65; though I prefer the Compreſs for the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Dreſſings: and the whole Dreſſing ſhould be kept on, with a ſtandage of two Fingers Breadth, and of a Length proportioned to the Size of the Part it is to ſurround: It ſhould be rolled on tight enough to ſecure the Dreſſings, and yet ſo moderately, as to bring on no Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>This Bandage with theſe Dreſſings are to remain on twenty-four or forty-eight Hours; Wounds being healed the ſooner, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs frequently dreſt. At the ſecond Dreſſing all the Lint muſt be removed, which can be done with Eaſe, and with reaſonable Speed, to the Wounded; and if any of it ſhould ſtick cloſe, in Conſequence of the clogged and dried Blood, it ſhould be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, adding a little freſh Lint to it; this Dreſſing in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects exactly reſembling the firſt.</p>
                  <p>When from the Continuance of this ſimple Dreſſing, the Wound is become very ſuperficial, it is ſufficient to apply the Cerecloth, or Plaiſter, without any Lint.</p>
                  <p>Such as have conceived an extraordinary Opinion of any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oils, impregnated with the Virtues of particular Plants, may, if that will increaſe their Satisfaction, make Uſe of the common Oil of Yarrow, of Trefoil, of Lillies, of Chamomile, of Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, or of red Roſes; only being very careful, that ſuch Oils are not become ſtale and rank.</p>
                  <p>§ 436. When the Wound is conſiderable, it muſt be expected to inflame before Suppuration (which, in ſuch a Caſe, advances more ſlowly) can enſue; which Inflammation will neceſſarily be attended with Pain, with a Fever, and ſometimes with a Raving, or Wandering, too. In ſuch a Situation, a Pultice of Bread and Milk, with the Addition of a little Oil, that it may not ſtick too cloſe, muſt be applied inſtead of the Compreſs or the Plaiſter: which Pultice is to be changed, but without uncovering the Wound, thrice and even four times every Day.</p>
                  <p>§ 437. Should ſome pretty conſiderable Blood-veſſel be opened by the Wound, there muſt be applied over it a Piece of Agaric of the Oak, No. 67, of which no Country Place ought to be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. It is to be kept on, by applying a good deal of Lint over it; covering the whole with a thick Compreſs, and then with a Bandage a little tighter than uſual. If this ſhould not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prevent the Bleeding from the large Veſſel, and the Wound be in the Leg or Arm, a ſtrong Ligature muſt be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Wound with a <hi>Turniquet,</hi> which is formed in a Moment with a Skain of Thread, or of Hemp, that is paſſed round the Arm circularly, into the Middle of which is inſerted a Piece of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012243_0244_0F8A6D5F0A041E10"/>
Wood or Stick of an Inch Thickneſs, and four or five Inches long; ſo that by turning round this Piece of Wood, any Tight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Compreſſion may be effected at Pleaſure; exactly as a Country-man ſecures a Hogſhead, or a Piece of Timber on his Cart, with a Chain and Ring. But Care muſt be taken, 1, to diſpoſe the Skain in ſuch a Manner, that it muſt always be two Inches wider than the Part it ſurrounds: and, 2, not to ſtrain it ſo tight as to bring on an Inflammation, which might termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a Gangrene.</p>
                  <p>§ 438. All the boaſted Virtues of a Multitude of Ointments are downright Nonſenſe or Quackery. Art, ſtrictly conſidered, does not in the leaſt contribute to the healing of Wounds; the utmoſt we can do amounting only to our removing thoſe Accidents, which are ſo many Obſtacles to their Re-union. On this Account, if there is any extraneous Body in the Wound, ſuch as Iron, Lead, Wood, Glaſs, Bits of Cloth or Linen, they muſt be extracted, if that can be very eaſily done; but, if not, Application muſt be made to a good Surgeon, who conſiders what Meaſures are to be taken, and then dreſſes the Wound, as I have already adviſed.</p>
                  <p>Very far from being uſeful, there are many Ointments that are pernicious on theſe Occaſions; and the only Caſes in which they ſhould be uſed, are thoſe in which the Wounds are diſtinguiſhed with ſome particular Appearances, which ought to be removed by particular Applications: But a ſimple recent Wound, in a healthy Man, requires no other Treatment but what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready directed, beſides that of the general Regimen.</p>
                  <p>Spirituous Applications are commonly hurtful, and can be ſuitable and proper but in a few Caſes, which Phyſicians and Surgeons only can diſtinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>When Wounds happen in the Head, inſtead of the Compreſs dipt in Oil, or of the Cerecloth, the Wound ſhould be covered with a Betony Plaiſter; or, when none is to be had in time, with a Compreſs ſqueezed out of hot Wine.</p>
                  <p>§ 439. As the following Symptoms, of which we ſhould be moſt apprehenſive, are ſuch as attend Inflammations, the Means we ought to have Recourſe to are thoſe which are moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them; ſuch as Bleeding, the uſual Regimen, moderate Coolers and Glyſters.</p>
                  <p>Should the Wound be very inconſiderable in its Degree, and in its Situation, it may be ſufficient to avoid taking any thing heating; and above all things to retrench the Uſe of any ſtrong Drink, and of Fleſh-meat.</p>
                  <p>But when it is conſiderable, and an Inflammation muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, there is a Neceſſity for Bleeding; the Patient ſhould be kept in the moſt quiet and eaſy Situation; he ſhould be ordered immediately to a Regimen; and ſometimes the Bleeding alſo muſt be repeated. Now all theſe Means are the more indiſpenſably neceſſary, when the Wound has penetrated to ſome internal Part; in which Situation, no Remedy is more certain than that of an
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012243_0245_0F8A6D5FC785C800"/>
extremely light Diet. Such wounded Perſons as have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed incapable of living many Hours, after Wounds in the Breaſt, in the Belly, or in the Kidneys, have been completely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by living for the Courſe of ſeveral Weeks, on nothing but Barley, or other farinaceous, mealy Ptiſans, without Salt, without Soup, without any Medicine; and eſpecially without the Uſe of any Ointments.</p>
                  <p>§ 440. In the ſame Proportion that Bleeding, moderately and judiciouſly employed, is ſerviceable, in that very ſame an Exceſs of it becomes pernicious. Great Wounds are generally attended with a conſiderable Loſs of Blood, which has already exhauſted the wounded Perſon; and the Fever is often a Conſequence of this copious Loſs of Blood. Now if under ſuch a Circumſtance, Bleeding ſhould be ordered and performed, the Patient's Strength is totally ſunk; the Humours ſtagnate and corrupt; a Gangrene ſupervenes, and he dies miſerably, at the End of two or three Days, of a <hi>Series</hi> of repeated Bleedings, but not of the Wound. Notwithſtanding the Certainty of this, the Surgeon frequently boaſts of his ten, twelve, or even his fifteen Bleedings; aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hearers of the inſuperable Mortality of the Wound, ſince the letting out ſuch a Quantity of Blood could not recover the Patient; when it really was that exceſſive artificial Profuſion of it, that downright diſpatched him.—The Pleaſures of Love are very mortal Pleaſures to the Wounded.</p>
                  <p>§ 441. The Balſams and vulnerary Plants, which have often been ſo highly celebrated for the Cure of Wounds, are very nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, when taken inwardly; becauſe the Introduction of them gives or heightens the Fever, which ought to have been abated.</p>

                  <p>§ 442. A Contuſion, which is commonly called a Bruiſe, is the Effect of the forcible Impreſſion or Stroke of a Subſtance not ſharp or cutting, on the Body of a Man, or any Animal; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an Impreſſion be violently made on the Man, as when he is ſtruck by a Stick, or by a Stone thrown at him; or whether the Man be involuntarily forced againſt a Poſt, a Stone, or any hard Subſtance by a Fall; or whether, in ſhort, he is ſqueezed and oppreſſed betwixt two hard Bodies, as when his Finger is ſqueezed betwixt the Door and the Door-Poſt, or the whole Body jammed in betwixt any Carriage and the Wall. Theſe Bruiſes, however, are ſtill more frequent in the Country than Wounds, and commonly more dangerous too; and indeed the more ſo, as we cannot judge ſo exactly, and ſo ſoon, of the whole Injury that has been incurred; and becauſe all that is immediately viſible of it is often but a ſmall Part of the real Damage attending it: ſince it frequently happens tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Manner of breathing, his Aſpect, the Quickneſs, Smallneſs, and Irregularity of his Pulſe, made me apprehenſive at once, that ſome Matter was formed within his Breaſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he ſtill kept up, and went about, working alſo at ſome Part of his Trade. He had fallen in removing ſome Caſks or Hogſheads; and the whole Weight of his Body had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently impreſſed upon the right Side of his Breaſt. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he was ſenſible of no Hurt at firſt; but ſome Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he began to feel a dull heavy Pain in that Part, which continued and brought on a Dufficulty of Breathing, Weakneſs, broken Sleep and Loſs of Appetite. I ordered him immediately to Stillneſs and Repoſe, and adviſed him to drink a Ptiſan of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſweetened with Honey, in a plentiful Quantity. He regularly obeyed only the latter Part of my Directions: yet on meeting him a few Days after, he told me he was better. The very ſame Week, however, I was informed he had been found dead in his Bed. The Impoſthume had undoubtedly broke, and ſuffocated him.</p>
                  <p>§ 444. A young Man, run away with by his Horſe, was forced with Violence againſt a Stable-Door, without being ſenſible of any Damage at the Time. But at the Expiration of twelve Days, he found himſelf attacked by ſome ſuch Complaints, as generally occur at the Beginning of a Fever. This Fever was miſtaken for a putrid one, and he was very improperly treated, for the Fever it really was, above a Month. In ſhort, it was agreed at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, that Matter was collected in the Breaſt. In Conſequence of this he was more properly attended, and at length happily cured by the Operation of <hi>Empyema,</hi> after languiſhing a whole Year. I have publiſhed theſe two Inſtances, to demonſtrate the great Danger of neglecting violent Strokes or Bruiſes; ſince the firſt of theſe Patients might have eſcaped Death; and the ſecond a tedious and afflicting Diſorder, if they had taken, immediately after each Accident, the neceſſary Preca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

                  <p>§ 445. Whenever any Part is bruiſed, one of two things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enſues, and commonly both happen together; eſpecially if the Contuſion is pretty conſiderable: Either the ſmall Blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the contuſed Part are broken, and the Blood they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is ſpread about in the adjoining Parts; or elſe, without ſuch an Effuſion of it, theſe Veſſels have loſt their Tone, their active Force, and no longer contributing to the Circulation, their Contents ſtagnate. In each of theſe Caſes, if Nature, either without or with the Aſſiſtance of Art, does not remove the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, an Inflammation comes on, attended with an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unkindly Suppuration, with Putrefaction and a Gangrene; not to mention the Symptoms that ariſe from the Contuſion of ſome particular Subſtance, at a Nerve, a large Veſſel, a Bone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence we may alſo conceive the Danger of a Contuſion, happening to any inward Part, from which the Blood is either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally

effuſed, or the Circulation wholly obſtructed in ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Organ. This is the Cauſe of the ſudden Death of Perſons after a violent Fall; or of thoſe who have received the violent Force of heavy deſcending Bodies on their Heads; or of ſome violent Strokes, without any evident external Hurt or Mark.</p>
                  <p>There have been many Inſtances of ſudden Deaths, after one Blow on the Pit of the Stomach, which has occaſioned a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Spleen.</p>

And thus in fact has it been, that many ſuch, who had before enjoyed a firm State of Health, have immediately loſt it after a Fall (which ſeemed at firſt to have affected them little or not at all) and languiſhed ſoon after to the Moment of their Death, which ſuch Accidents very generally accelerate.</p>
                  <p>§ 446. Different external and internal Remedies are applicable in Contuſions. When the Accident has occured in a ſlight De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and there has been no great nor general Shock, which might produce an internal Soreneſs or Contuſion, external Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations may be ſufficient.

                  <p>The beſt Application is Vinegar, diluted, if very ſharp, with twice as much warm Water; in which Mixture Folds of Linen are to be dipt, within which the contuſed Parts are to be involved; and theſe Folds are to be re-moiſtened and re-applied every two Hours on the firſt Day.</p>

Water, and the like; but a long Abuſe ought not to be eſtabliſhed by Preſcription. Theſe Liquids which coagulate the Blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſolving it, are truly pernicious; notwithſtanding they are ſometimes employed without any viſible Diſadvantage, on very ſlight Occaſions. Frequently by determining the ſettled Blood towards the Interſtices of the Muſcles, the fleſhy Parts; or ſometimes even by preventing the Effuſion, or viſible Settling of the Blood, and fixing it, as it were, within the bruiſed Veſſels, they ſeem to be well; though this only ariſes from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centring and concealing the Evil, which, at the End of a few Months, breaks forth again in a very troubleſome Shape. Of this I have ſeen ſome miſerable Examples, whence it has been abundantly evinced, that Applications of this Sort ſhould never be admitted; and that Vinegar ſhould be uſed inſtead of them. At the utmoſt it ſhould only be allowed, (after there is Reaſon to ſuppoſe all the ſtagnant Blood reſolved and reſorbed into the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation) to add a third Part of the Arquebuſade Water to the Vinegar; with an Intention to reſtore ſome Strength to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed and weakened Parts.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe Sacs or Suffuſions of coagulated Blood, which are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the Skin, ſhould never be opened, except for ſome ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reaſon: ſince however large they may be, they inſenſibly diſappear and diſſipate; inſtead of which Termination, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they ſometimes terminate in a dangerous Ulceration.</p>

                  <p>A Man from <hi>Pully-petit</hi> came to conſult me ſome Months ago, concerning his Father, who had a high Fall out of a Tree. He had been twenty-four Hours without Feeling or Senſe, and without any other Motion than frequent Efforts to vomit; and Blood had iſſued both from his Noſe and Ears. He had no viſible outward Hurt neither on his Head, nor any other Part; and, very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for him, they had not as yet exerted the leaſt Effort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him. I immediately directed a plentiful Bleeding in the Arm; and a large Quantity of Whey ſweetened with Honey to be drank, and to be alſo injected by Way of Glyſter. This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was very punctually obſerved; and fifteen Days after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to <hi>Lauſanne,</hi> which is four Leagues from <hi>Pully-petit,</hi> and told me he was very well. It is proper, in all conſiderable Bruiſes, to open the Patient's Belly with a mild cooling Purge, ſuch as No. 11, 23, 32, 49. The Preſcription No. 24, and the honeyed Whey are excellent Remedies, from the ſame Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>§ 450. In theſe Circumſtances, Wine, diſtilled Spirits, and whatever has been ſuppoſed to revive and to rouſe, are mortal. For this Reaſon, People ſhould not be too impatient, becauſe the Patients remain ſome time without Senſe or Feeling. The giving of Turpentine is more likely to do Miſchief than Good; and if it has been ſometimes ſerviceable, it muſt have been in Conſequence of its purging the Patient, who probably then needed to be purged. The Fat of a Whale <hi>(Sperma coeti)</hi> Dragon's Blood, Crabs-Eyes, and Ointments of whatſoever Sort are at leaſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dangerous Medicines, if the Caſe be very hazardous; either by the Miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>§ 451. When an aged Perſon gets a Fall, which is the more dangerous in Proportion to his Age and Groſſneſs; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould not ſeem in the leaſt incommoded by it, if he is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and ſtill ſomewhat vigorous, he ſhould part with three or four Ounces of Blood. He ſhould take immediately a few ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Cups of a lightly aromatic Drink, which ſhould be given him hot; ſuch, for Inſtance, as an Infuſion of Tea ſweetened with Honey, and he ſhould be adviſed to move gently about. He muſt retrench a little from the uſual Quantity of his Food, and accuſtom himſelf to very gentle, but very frequent Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>§ 452. Sprains or Wrenches, which ſo often happen, produce a Kind of Contuſion, in the Parts adjoining to the ſprained Joint. This Contuſion is cauſed by the violent Friction of the Bone againſt the neighbouring Parts; and as ſoon as the Bones are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned into their proper Situation, the Diſorder ſhould be
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:012243_0250_0F8A6D65079106E8"/>
treated as a Contuſion. Indeed if the Bones ſhould not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves return into their proper natural Poſition, Recourſe muſt be had to the Hand of a Surgeon.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Remedy in this Caſe is abſolute Reſt and Repoſe, after applying a Compreſs moiſtened in Vinegar and Water, which is to be renewed and continued, till the Marks of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion entirely diſappear; and there remains not the ſmalleſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of an Inflammation. Then indeed, and not before, a little Brandy or Arquebuſade Water, may be added to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar; and the Part (which is almoſt conſtantly the Foot) ſhould be ſtrengthened and ſecured for a conſiderable Time with a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; as it might otherwiſe be liable to freſh Sprains, which would daily more and more enfeeble it; for if this Evil is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked too much in its Infancy, the Part never recovers its full Strength; and a ſmall Swelling often remains to the End of the Patient's Life.</p>
                  <p>If the Sprain is very ſlight and moderate, a Plunging of the Part into cold Water is excellent; bat if this is not done at once immediately after the Sprain, or if the Contuſion is violent, it is even hurtful.</p>
                  <p>The Cuſtom of rolling the naked Foot upon ſome round Body is inſufficient, when the Bones are not perfectly replaced; and hurtful, when the Sprain is accompanied with a Contuſion.</p>
                  <p>It happens continually almoſt, that Country People, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ſuch Accidents, apply themſelves either to ignorant or knaviſh Impoſters, who find, or are determined to find, a Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Diſlocation of the Bones, where there is none; and who, by their violent Manner of handling the Parts, or by the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they ſurround them with, bring on a dangerous Inflammation, and change the Patient's Dread of a ſmall Diſorder, into a very grievous Malady.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the very Perſons who have created, or indeed rather imagined, ſome impoſſible Diſeaſes, ſuch as the Opening, the Splitting of the Stomach, and of the Kidnies. Such monſtrous Words terrify the poor Country People, and diſpoſe them to be more eaſily and effectually duped.</p>

                  <head>Of Ulcers.</head>
                  <p>§ 453. Whenever Ulcers ariſe from a general Fault of the Blood, it is impoſſible to cure them, without deſtroying the Cauſe and Fuel of them It is in fact imprudent to attempt to heal them up by outward Remedies; and a real Misfortune to the Patient, if his Aſſiſtant effectually heals and cloſes them.</p>
                  <p>But, for the greater Part, Ulcers in the Country are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſome Wound, Bruiſe, or Tumour improperly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and eſpecially of ſuch as have been dreſſed with too ſharp, or too ſpirituous Applications. Rancid Oils are alſo one of the Cauſes, which change the moſt ſimple Wounds into obſtinate Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:012243_0251_0F8A6D66F1CE32C8"/>
for which Reaſon they ſhould be avoided ; and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be careful, when they compound greaſy Ointments, to make but little at a Time, and the oftner, as a very conſiderable Quantity of any of them becomes tank before it is all ſold; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſweet freſh Oil may have been employed in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>§ 454. What ſerves to diſtinguiſh Ulcers from Wounds, is the Dryneſs and Hardneſs of the Sides or Borders of Ulcers, and the Quality of the Humour diſcharged from them; which, inſtead of being ripe conſiſtent Matter, is a Liquid more thin, leſs white, ſometimes yielding a diſagreeable Scent, and ſo very ſharp, that if it touch the adjoining Skin, it produces Redneſs, Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Puſtules there; ſometimes a ſerpiginous, or Ring-worm like Eruption, and even a further Ulceration.</p>
                  <p>§ 455. Such Ulcers as are of a long Duration, which ſpread wide, and diſcharge much, prey upon the Patient, and throw him into a ſlow Fever, which melts and conſumes him. Beſides, when an Ulcer is of a long Standing, it is dangerous to dry it up; and indeed this never ſhould be done, but by ſubſtituting in the Place of one Diſcharge, that is become almoſt natural, ſome other Evacuation, ſuch as purging from time to time.</p>
                  <p>We may daily ſee ſudden Deaths, or very tormenting Diſeaſes, enſue the ſudden drying up ſuch Humours and Drains as have been of a long Continuance: and whenever any Quack (and as many as promiſe the ſpeedy Cure of ſuch, deſerve that Title) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Patient of his curing an inveterate Ulcer in a few Days, he demonſtrates himſelf to be a very dangerous and ignorant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddler, who muſt kill the Patient, if he keeps his Word. Some of theſe impudent Impoſtors make uſe of the moſt corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Applications, and even arſenical ones; notwithſtanding the moſt violent Death is generally the Conſequence of them.</p>
                  <p>§ 456. The utmoſt that Art can effect, with Regard to Ulcers, which do not ariſe from any Fault in the Humours, is to change them into Wounds. To this End, the Hardneſs and Dryneſs of the Edges of the Ulcer, and indeed of the whole Ulcer, muſt be diminiſhed, and its Inflammation removed. But ſometimes the Hardneſs is ſo obſtinate, that this cannot be mollified any other Way, than by ſcarifying the Edges with a Lancet. But when it may be effected by other Means, let a Pledget ſpread with the Ointment No. 69, be applied all over the Ulcer; and this Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get be covered again with a Compreſs of ſeveral Folds, moiſtened in the Liquid No. 70, which ſhould be renewed three times daily; though it is ſufficient to apply a freſh Pledget only twice.</p>
                  <p>As I have already affirmed that Ulcers were often the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſharp and ſpirituous Dreſſings, it is evident ſuch ſhould be abſtained from, without which Abſtinence they will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
                  <p>To forward the Cure, ſalted Food, Spices, and ſtrong Drink ſhould be avoided; the Quantity of Fleſh-meat ſhould be leſſened;
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:012243_0252_0F8A6D67C5114590"/>
and the Body be kept open by a Regimen of Puls, or Vegetables, and by the habitual Uſe of Whey ſweetened with Honey.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcers are in the Legs, a very common Situation of them, it is of great Importance, as well as in Wounds of the ſame Parts, that the Patients ſhould walk about but little; and yet never ſtand up without walking. This indeed is one of theſe Caſes, in which thoſe, who have ſome Credit and Influence in the Eſtimation of the People, ſhould omit nothing to make them thoroughly comprehend the Neceſſity of confining themſelves, ſome Days, to undiſturbed Tranquillity and Reſt; and they ſhould alſo convince them, that this Term of Reſt is ſo far from being loſt Time, that it is likely to prove their moſt profitable Time of Life. Negligence, in this material Point, changes the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wounds into Ulcers, and the moſt trifling Ulcers into obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and incurable ones: inſomuch that there is ſcarcely any Man, who may not obſerve ſome Family in his Neighbourhood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Hoſpital <note n="*" place="bottom">This ſeems juſt the ſame as <hi>coming on the Pariſh,</hi> or being received into an Alms-houſe, here; in Conſequence of ſuch an incurable Diſability happening to the poor working Father of a Family. <hi>K.</hi>

                  <p>I conclude this Article on Ulcers with repeating, that thoſe which are owing to ſome internal Cauſe; or even ſuch as happen from an external one, in Perſons of a bad Habit of Body, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently require a more particular Treatment.</p>

                  <p>§ 457. It is but too common, in very rigorous Winters, for ſome Perſons to be pierced with ſo violent a Degree of Cold, that their Hands or Feet, or ſometimes both together, are frozen at once, juſt like a Piece of Fleſh meat expoſed to the Air.</p>

Whence this truly great Founder of Phyſick, when he obſerves elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that Diſeaſes are to be cured by ſomething contrary to their Cauſes, very conſiſtently adviſes, not a direct and violent Contrariety, but a gradual and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated one, a <hi>Sub-contrariety.

Some greaſy Ointments were applied hot to them, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which was, the Neceſſity of cutting off ſix of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>§ 458. In ſhort, there is but one certain Remedy in ſuch Caſes, and this is to convey the Perſon affected into ſome Place where it does not freeze, but where, however, it is but very moderately hot, and there continually to apply, to the frozen Parts, Snow, if it be at Hand; and if not, to keep waſhing them inceſſantly, but very gently (ſince all Friction would at this Juncture prove dangerous in Ice-water, as the Ice thaws in the Chamber. By this Application the Patients will be ſenſible of their Feelings returning very gradually to the Part) and that they begin to recover their Motion. In this State they may ſafely be moved into a Place a little warmer, and drink ſome Cups of the Potion No. 13, or of another of the like Quality.</p>
                  <p>§ 459. Every Perſon may be a competent Judge of the manifeſt Danger of attempting to relieve ſuch Parts by heating them, and of the Uſe of Ice-water, by a common, a daily Experience. Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Pears, Apples and Radiſhes, being put into Water juſt about to Freeze, recover their former State, and prove quickly eatable. But if they are put into warm Water, or into a hot Place, Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is one Sort of Grangene, is the immediate Effect. The following Caſe will make this right Method of treating them ſtill more intelligible, and demonſtrate its Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>A Man was travelling to the Diſtance of ſix Leagues in very cold Weather, the Road being covered with Snow and Ice. His Shoes, not being very good, failed him on his March, ſo that he walked the three laſt Leagues bare-footed; and felt, immediately after the firſt Half-League, ſharp Pains in his Legs and Feet, which increaſed as he proceeded. He arrived at his Journey's End in a Manner nearly deprived of his lower Extremities. They ſet him before a great Fire, heated a Bed well, and put him into it. His Pains imediately became intolerable: he was inceſſantly in the moſt violent Agitations, and cried out in the moſt piercing and affecting Manner. A Phyſician being ſent for in the Night, found his Toes of a blackiſh Colour, and beginning to loſe their Feeling. His Legs and the upper Part of his Feet, which were exceſſively ſwelled, of a purpliſh Red, and varied with Spots of a violet Colour, were ſtill ſenſible of the moſt excruciating Pains. The Phyſician ordered in a Pail of Water from the adjoining Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, adding more to it, and ſome Ice withall. In this he obliged the Patient to plunge his Legs; they were kept in near an Hour, and within that Time, the Pains became leſs violent. After an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Hour he ordered a ſecond cold Bath, from which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient perceiving ſtill further Relief, prolonged it to the Extent of two Hours. During that Time, ſome Water was taken out of the Pail, and ſome Ice and Snow were put into it. Now his Toes, which had been black, grew red; the violet Spots in his Legs diſappeared; the Swelling abated; the Pains became moderate,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:012243_0254_0F8A6D68C63445A8"/>
and intermitted. The Bath was nevertheleſs repeated ſix Times; after which there remained no other Complaint, but that of a great Tenderneſs or extraordinary Senſibility in the Soles of his Feet, which hindered him from walking. The Parts were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bathed with ſome aromatic Fomentations; and he drank a Ptiſan of Sarſaparilla [one of Elder Flowers would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Purpoſe, and have been leſs expenſive.] On the eighth Day from his Seizure he was perfectly recovered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home on Foot on the fifteenth.</p>
                  <p>§ 460. When cold Weather is extremely ſevere, and a Perſon is expoſed to it for a long Time at once, it proves mortal, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of its congealing the Blood, and becauſe it forces too great a Proportion of Blood up the Brain; ſo that the Patient dies of a Kind of Apoplexy, which is preceeded by a Sleepineſs, In this Circumſtance the Traveller, who finds he grows drowſy, ſhould redouble his Efforts to extricate himſelf from the eminent Danger he is expoſed to. This Sleep, which he might conſider as ſome Allevation of his Sufferings, if indulged, would prove his laſt.</p>
                  <p>§ 461. The Remedies in ſuch Caſes are the ſame with thoſe directed in frozen Limbs. The Patient muſt he conducted to an Apartment rather cold than hot, and be rubbed with Snow or with Ice-water. There have been many well atteſted Inſtances of this Method: and as ſuch Caſes are ſtill more frequent in more northern Climates, a Bath of the very coldeſt Water has been found the ſureſt Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Since it is known that many People have been revived, who had remained in the Snow, or had been expoſed to the freezing Air during five, or even ſix ſucceſſive Days, and who had diſcovered no one Mark of Life for ſeveral Hours, the utmoſt Endeavours ſhould be uſed for the Recovery of Perſons in the like Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Situation.</p>

Theſe troubleſome and ſmarting Complaints attack the Hands, Feet, Heels, Ears, Noſe and Lips, thoſe of Children eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and moſtly in Winter; when theſe extremities are expoſed to the ſudden Changes from hot to cold, and from cold to hot Weather. They begin with an Inflation or Kind of Swelling, which, at firſt, occaſions but little Heat, Pain or Itching. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do not exceed this firſt State, and go off ſpontaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any Application: But at other Times, which may be termed the ſecond Degree of the Diſorder (whether it happens from their being neglected, or improperly treated) their Heat, Redneſs, Itching and Pain increaſe conſiderably; ſo that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is often deprived of the free Uſe of his Fingers by the Pain, Swelling and Numbneſs: in which Caſe the Malady is ſtill aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, if effectual Means are not uſed.</p>

                     <pb n="235" facs="unknown:012243_0255_0F8A6D6AF15885C8"/>Whenever the Inflammation mounts to a ſtill higher Degree, ſmall Veſications or Bliſters are formed, which are not long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burſting; when they leave a ſlight Excoriation, or Rawneſs, as it were, which ſpeedily ulcerates, and frequently proves a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep and obſtinate Ulcer, diſcharging a ſharp and ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Matter.</p>
                  <p>The laſt and moſt virulent Degree of Chilblains, which is not infrequent in the very coldeſt Countries, though very rare in the temperate ones, is, when the Inflammation degenerates into a Gangrene.</p>
                  <p>§ 463. Theſe Tumors are owing to a Fulneſs and Obſtruction of the Veſſels of the Skin, which occurs from this Circumſtance, that the Veins, which are more ſuperficial than the Arteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportionably more affected and ſtraitened by the Cold, do not carry off all the Blood communicated to them by the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and perhaps alſo the Particles or Atoms of Cold, which are admitted through the Pores of the Skin, may act upon our Fluids, as it does upon Water, and occaſion a Congelation of them, or a conſiderable Approach towards it.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Complaints are chiefly felt, which in fact is the Caſe, rather on the extreme Parts than on others, it ariſes from two Cauſes, the firſt of which is, that the Circulation's being weaker at the Extremities than elſewhere, the Effect of thoſe Cauſes, that may impair it, muſt be more conſiderably felt there. The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe theſe Parts are more expoſed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from without than the others.</p>
                  <p>They occur moſt frequently to Children, from their Weakneſs and the greater Tenderneſs, and Senſibility of their Organs, which neceſſarily increaſe the Effect of external Impreſſions. It is the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſtrong Alteration from Heat to Cold, that ſeems to contribute the moſt powerfully to the Production of Chilblains; and this Effect of it is moſt conſiderable, when the Heat of the Air is at the ſame Time blended with Moiſture; whence the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and ſuperficial Parts paſs ſuddenly as it were, out of a hot, into a cold Bath. A Man ſixty Years of Age, who never before was troubled with Kibes, having worn, for ſome Hours on a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a Pair of furred Gloves, in which his Hands ſweated, felt them very tender, and found them ſwelled up with Blood; as the common Effect of the warm Bath is to ſoften and relax, and to draw Blood abundantly to the bathed Parts, whence it renders them more ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>This Man, I ſay, thus circumſtanced, was at that Age firſt attacked with Chilblains, which proved extremely troubleſome; and he was every ſucceeding Winter as certainly infeſted with them, within half an Hour after he left off his Gloves, and was expoſed to a very cold Air.</p>
                  <p>It is for this Reaſon, that ſeveral Perſons are never infeſted with Chilblains, but when they uſe themſelves to Muffs, which, we ſcarcely known in hot Countries; nor are they very common
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:012243_0256_0F8A6D6B16B18648"/>
among the more northern ones, in which the extraordinary Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Cold to Heat are very rare and unuſual.</p>
                  <p>Some People are ſubject to this troubleſome Complaint in the Fall; while others have it only in the Spring. The Child of a labouring Peaſant, who has a hard Skin, and one inured to all the Impreſſions of the Seaſons and of the Elements, is, and indeed neceſſarily muſt be, leſs liable to Kibes, than the Child of a rich Citizen, whoſe Skin is often cheriſhed, at the Expence of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But even among Children of the ſame Rank in Life and Circumſtances, who ſeem pretty much of the ſame Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and live much in the ſame Manner; (whence they might of Courſe be ſuppoſed equally liable to the ſame Impreſſions, and to the like Effects of them) there is, nevertheleſs, a very great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with reſpect to their conſtitutional Propenſity to contract Chilblains. Some are very cruelly tormented with them, from the ſetting-in of Autumn, to the very End of the Spring: others have either none an all, or have them but very ſlightly, and for a very ſhort Time. This Difference undoubtedly ariſes from the different Quality of their Humours, and the Texture of their whole Surface, but particularly from that of the Skin of their Hands; though we readily confeſs it is by no Means eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, with Certainty and Preciſion, in what this Difference eſſentially conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Children of a ſanguine Complexion and delicate Skin are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generally ſubject to this Diſorder, which is often regarded much too ſlightly, though it is really ſevere enough to engage our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention more; ſince, even abſtracted from the ſharp Pains which ſmart theſe unhappy Children for ſeveral Months; it ſometimes gives them a Fever, hinders them from ſleeping, and yet confines them to their Bed, which is very prejudicial to their Conſtitutions. It alſo breaks in upon the Order of their different Duties and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; it interrupts their innocent ſalutary Pleaſures; and ſometimes, when they are obliged to earn their daily Bread by doing ſome Work or other, it ſinks them down to Miſery. I knew a young Man, who from being rendered incapable by Chilblains, of ſerving out his Apprenticeſhip to a Watch-maker, is become a lazy Beggar.</p>
                  <p>Chilblains which attack the Noſe, often leave a Mark that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Phyſiognomy, the Aſpect of the Patient for the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Life: and the Hands of ſuch as have ſuffered from very obſtinate ones, are commonly ever ſenſible of their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
                  <p>§ 464. With Reſpect, therefore, to theſe afflicting Tumours and Ulcerations, we ſhould, in the firſt Place, do our utmoſt to prevent them; and next to exert our beſt Endeavours to cure ſuch as we could not prevent.</p>
                  <p>§ 465. Since they manifeſtly depend on the Senſibility of the Skin, the Nature of the Humours, and the Changes of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Heat to Cold, in order to prevent them, in the firſt
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:012243_0257_0F8A6D6C1D505560"/>
Place, the Skin muſt be rendered firmer or leſs tender. 2, That vicious Quality of the Temperament, which cantributes to their Exiſtence, muſt be corrected; and, 3, the Perſons ſo liable, muſt guard themſelves as well as poſſible, againſt theſe Changes of the Weather.</p>
                  <p>Now the Skin of the Hands, as well as that of the whole Body, may be ſtrengthened by that Habit of waſhing or bathing in cold Water, which I have deſcribed at large, § 384; and in fact, I have never ſeen Children, who had been early accuſtomed and inured to this Habit, as much afflicted with Chilblains as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But ſtill a more particular Regard ſhould be had to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Skin of the Hands, which are more obnoxious to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order than the Feet, by making Children dip them in cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and keep them for ſome Moments together in it every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and every Evening too, before Supper, from the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the Fall. It will give the Children no Sort of Pain, during that Seaſon, to contract this Habit; and when it is once contracted, it will give them no Trouble to continue it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Winter, even when the Water is ready to freeze every where. They may alſo be habituated to plunge their Feet into cold Water twice or thrice a Week; and this Method, which might be leſs adapted for grown Perſons, who had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, muſt be without Objection with reſpect to ſuch Children, as have been accuſtomed to it; to whom all its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences muſt be uſeful and ſalutary.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time Care muſt be taken not to defeat or leſſen the Effect of the cold bathing, by ſuffering the Bather or Waſher, to grow too warm between two Baths or Dippings; which is alſo avoiding the too ſpeedy Succeſſions of Heat and Cold. For this Purpoſe, 1, the Children muſt be taught never to warm their Hands before the Fire at ſuch Times, and ſtill leſs before the Stoves, which very probably are one of the principal Cauſes of Chilblains, that are leſs uſual in Countries which uſe no ſuch Stoves, and among thoſe Individuals who make the leaſt Uſe of them, where they are. Above all, the Uſe of <hi>Cavettes</hi> (that is, of Seats, or little Stairs, as it were, contrived between the Stove and Wall) is prejudicial to Children, and even to grown People, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral Accounts. 2, They ſhould never accuſtom themſelves to wear Muffs. 3, It would be alſo proper they ſhould never uſe Gloves, unleſs ſome particular Circumſtances require it; and I recommend this Abſtinence from Gloves, eſpecially to young Boys: but if any ſhould be allowed them, let the Gloves be thin and ſmooth.</p>
                  <p>§ 466. When Chilblains ſeem to be nouriſhed by ſome Fault in the Temperament or Humours, the Conſideration of a Phyſician becomes neceſſary, to direct a proper Method of removing or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering it. I have ſeen Children from the Age of three, to that of twelve or thirteen Years, in whom their Chilblains, raw and flead, as it were, for eight Months of the Year, ſeemed to be a
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:012243_0258_0F8A6D6C8CFDE5B0"/>
particular Kind of Iſſue, by which Nature freed herſelf of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Superfluity of Humours, when the Perſpiration was diminiſhed by the Abatement of the violent Heats. In ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I have been obliged to carry them through a pretty long Courſe of Regimen and Remedies; which, however, being neceſſarily various from a Variety of Circumſtances, cannot be detailed here. The milder Preparations of Antimony are often neceſſary in ſuch Caſes; and ſome Purges conduce in particular ones to allay and to ſhorten the Diſorder.</p>
                  <p>§ 467. The firſt Degree of this Complaint goes off, as I have already ſaid, without the Aid of Medicine; or ſhould it prove ſomewhat more obſtinate, it may eaſily be diſſipated by ſome of the following Remedies. But when they riſe to the ſecond Degree, they muſt be treated like other Complaints from Congelation, or Froſt-biting (of which they are the firſt Degree) with cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Ice-water and Snow.</p>
                  <p>No other Method or Medicine is nearly as efficacious as very cold Water, ſo as to be ready to freeze, in which the Hands are to be dipt and retained for ſome Minutes together, and ſeveral Times daily. In ſhort it is the only Remedy which ought to be applied, when the Hands are the Parts affected; when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has the Courage to bear this Degree of Cold; and when he is under no Circumſtance which may render it prejudicial. It is the only application I have uſed for myſelf, after having been attacked with Chilblains for ſome Years paſt, from having accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed myſelf to too warm a Muff.</p>
                  <p>There enſues a ſlight Degree of Pain for ſome Moments after plunging the Hand into Water, but it diminiſhes gradually. On taking the Hand out, the fingers are numbed with the Cold, but they preſently grow warm again; and within a Quarter of an Hour, it is entirely over.</p>
                  <p>The Hands on being taken out of the Water, are to be well dried, and put into Skin Gloves; after bathing three or four Times, their Swelling ſubſides, ſo that the Skin wrinkles: but by continuing the cold Bathing, it grows tight and ſmooth again; the Cure is compleated after uſing it three or four Days; and, in general, the Diſorder never returns again the ſame Winter.</p>
                  <p>The moſt troubleſome raging Itching is certainly aſſwaged by plunging the Hands into cold Water.</p>
                  <p>The Effect of Snow is, perhaps, ſtill more ſpeedy: the Hands are to be gently and often rubbed with it for a conſiderable Time; they grow hot, and are of a very high Red for ſome Moments, but entire Eaſe very quickly ſucceeds.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, a very ſmall Number of Perſons, who muſt have extremely delicate and ſenſible Skins, do not experience the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Application. It ſeems too active for them; it affects the Skin much like a common bliſtering Plaiſter; and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a large Flow of Humours there, it increaſes, inſtead of leſſening, the Complaint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="unknown:012243_0259_0F8A6D6D59C6A200"/>§ 468. When this laſt Reaſon indeed, or ſome other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance exiſts; ſuch as the Child's Want of Courage, or its Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the monthly Diſcharges in a Woman; a violent Cough, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Colics; and ſome other Maladies, which have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be renewed or aggravated by the Influence of Cold at the Extremities, do really forbid this very cold Application, ſome others muſt be ſubſtituted.</p>
                  <p>One of the beſt is to wear Day and Night, without ever putting it off, a Glove made of any ſmooth Skin, ſuch as that of a Dog; which ſeldom fails to extinguiſh the Diſorder in ſome Days Time.</p>
                  <p>When the Feet are affected with Chilblains, Socks of the ſame Skin ſhould be worn; and the Patient kept cloſe to his Bed for ſome Days.</p>
                  <p>§ 469. When the Diſorder is violent, the Uſe of cold Water prohibited, and the Gloves juſt recommended have but a ſlow Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the diſeaſed Parts ſhould be gently fomented or moiſtened ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times a Day, with ſome Decoction, rather more than warm; which at the ſame Time ſhould be diſſolving and emollient. Such is that celebrated Decoction of the Scrapings, the Peal of Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, whoſe Efficacy is ſtill further increaſed, by adding one ſixth Part of Vinegar to the Decoction.</p>
                  <p>Another Decoction, of whoſe great Efficacy I have been a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but which dies the Hands yellow for a few Days, is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription No. 71. Many others may be made, of nearly the ſame Virtues, with all the vulnerary Herbs, and even with the <hi>Faltranc.</hi>

                  <p>As ſoon as the Hands affected are taken out of theſe Decoctions, they muſt be defended from the Air by Gloves.</p>
                  <p>§ 470. Vapours or Steams are often more efficacious than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions; whence inſtead of dipping the Hands into theſe already mentioned, we may expoſe them to their Vapours, with ſtill more Succeſs. That of hot Vinegar is one of the moſt powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; thoſe of <note n="†" place="bottom">This is, or ſhould be, the ſame with the <hi>Bitumen Judaicum,</hi> formerly kept in the ſhops; but which is never directed, except in that ſtrange Medley the <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle, according to the old Preſcription.

                     <hi>Aſphalt</hi> or of Turpentine have frequently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded too. It may be needleſs to add that the affected Parts muſt be defended from the Air, as well after the Steams as the Decoctions; ſince it is from this Circumſtance of keeping off the Air, that the Cerecloths are of Service; and hence alſo the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Suet has ſometimes anſwered.</p>

                  <p>§ 471. When the Noſe is affected with a Chilblain, the Steam of Vinegar, and an artificial Noſe, or Covering for it, made of Dog-ſkin, are the moſt effectual Applications. The ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equally proper for the Ears and the Chin, when infeſted with them. Frequently waſhing theſe Parts in cold Water is a good Preſervative from their being attacked.</p>
                  <p>§ 472. Whenever the Inflammation riſes very high, and brings on ſome Degree of a Fever, the Patient's uſual Quantity of ſtrong Drink and of Fleſh-meat muſt be leſſened; his Body ſhould be kept open by a few Glyſters; he ſhould take every Evening a Doſe of Nitre as preſcribed No. 20; and if the Fever proves ſtrong, he ſhould looſe ſome Blood too.</p>
                  <p>As many are troubled with obſtinate Chilblains, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be denied the Uſe of ſtrong Liquor and Fleſh.</p>

When this Diſtemper prevails in its third Degree, and the Parts are ulcerated; beſides keeping the Patients ſtrictly to the Regimen of Perſons in a Way of Recovery, and giving them a Purge of Manna, the ſwelled Parts ſhould be expoſed to the Steams of Vinegar; the Ulcerations ſhould be covered with a Diapalma Plaiſter; and the whole Part ſhould be inveloped in a ſmooth ſoft Skin, or in thin Cerecloths.</p>
                  <p>§ 474. The fourth Degree of this Diſeaſe, in which the Parts become gangrenous, muſt be prevented by the Method and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which remove an Inflammation; but if unhappily a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene has already appeared, the Aſſiſtance of a Surgeon proves indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>

                  <head>Of Ruptures.</head>
                  <p>§ 475. <hi>Hernias</hi> or Ruptures, which Country People term <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burſten,</hi> are a Diſorder which ſometimes occurs at the very Birth; though more frequently they are the Effects of violent crying, of a ſtrong forcing Cough, or of repeated Efforts to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the firſt Months of Infancy.</p>
                  <p>They may happen afterwards indiſcriminately at every Age, either as Conſequences of particular Maladies, or Accidents, or from People's violent Exertions of their Strength. They hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen much oftener to Men than Women; and the moſt common Sort, indeed the only one of which I propoſe to treat, and that but briefly, is that which conſiſts in the Deſcent of a Part of the Guts, or of the Cawl, into the Bag or Cod-piece.</p>
                  <p>It is not difficult to diſtinguiſh this Rupture. When it occurs in little Children, it is almoſt ever cured by making them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wear a Bandage, which ſhould be made only of Fuſtian, with a little Pillow or Pincuſhion, ſtuffed with Linen Rags, Hair
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:012243_0261_0F8A6D6EE3B80330"/>
or Bran. There ſhould be at leaſt two of theſe Bandages, to change them alternately; nor ſhould it ever be applied, but when the Child is laid down on its Back, and after being well aſſured that the Gut or Cawl, which had fallen down, has been ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Cavity of the Belly; ſince without this Precaution it might occaſion the worſt Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>The good Effect of the Bandage may be ſtill further promoted, by applying upon the Skin, and within the Plait or Fold of the Groin (under which Place the Rings, or Paſſage out of the Belly into the Bag lie) ſome pretty aſtringent or ſtrengthening Plaiſter, ſuch as that commonly uſed for Fractures, or that I have already mentioned, § 144. Here we may obſerve by the Way, that rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Children ſhould never be ſet on a Horſe, nor be carried by any Perſon on Horſeback, before the Rupture is perfectly cured.</p>
                  <p>§ 476. In a more advanced Age, a Bandage only of Fuſtian is not ſufficient; one muſt be procured with a Plate of Steel, even ſo as to conſtrain and incommode the Wearer a little at firſt: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it ſoon becomes habitual, and is then no longer incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to him.</p>
                  <p>§ 477. Ruptures ſometimes attain a monſtrous Size; and a great Part of the Guts fall down into the <hi>Scrotum</hi> or Bag, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Symptom of an actual Diſeaſe. This Circumſtance, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, is accompanied with very great Inconvenience, which diſables Perſons affected with it to work; and whenever the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady is ſo conſiderable, and of a long Standing too, there are commonly ſome Obſtacles that prevent a compleat Return of the Guts into the Belly. In this State indeed, the Application of the Bandage or Truſs is impracticable, and the miſerable Patients are condemned to carry their grievous Burthen for the Remainder of their Lives; which may however be palliated a little by the Uſe of a Suſpenſory and Bag, adapted to the Size of the Rupture. This Dread of its increaſing Magnitude is a ſtrong Motive for checking the Progreſs of it, when it firſt appears. But there is another ſtill ſtronger; which is, that Ruptures expoſe the Patient to a Symptom frequently mortal. This occurs when that Part of the Inteſtines fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi> inflames; when ſtill increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Bulk, and being extremely compreſſed, acute Pains come on: for now from the Increaſe of the Rupture's Extent, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which gave Way to it's Deſcent, cannot admit of its Return or Aſcent; the Blood-veſſels themſelves being oppreſſed, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation increaſes every Moment; the Communication between the Stomach and the Fundament is often entirely cut off; ſo that nothing paſſes through, but inceſſant Vomitings come on [this being the Kind of <hi>Miſerere,</hi> or Iliac Paſſion I have mentioned, § 320] which are ſucceeded by the Hickup, Raving, Swooning, cold Sweats, and Death.</p>
                  <p>§ 478. This Symptom ſupervenes in Ruptures, when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements become hard in that Part of the Guts fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>; when the Patient is overheated with Wine, Drams, an

inflammatory Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or when he has received a Stroke on the ailing Part, or had a Fall.</p>
                  <p>§ 479. The beſt Means and Remedies are, 1, as ſoon as ever this Symptom or Accident is manifeſt, to bleed the Patient very plentifully, as he lies down in his Bed and upon his Back, with his Head a little raiſed, and his Legs ſomewhat bent, ſo that his Knees may be erect. This is the Attitude or Poſture they ſhould always preſerve as much as poſſible. When the Malady is not too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, the firſt Bleeding often makes a complete Cure; and the Guts return up as ſoon as it is over. At other Times this Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is leſs ſucceſsful, and leaves a Neceſſity for its Repetition.</p>
                  <p>2, A Glyſter muſt be thrown up conſiſting of a ſtrong Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the large white Beet Leaves, with a ſmall Spoonful or Pinch of common Salt, and a Bit of freſh Butter of the Size of an Egg.</p>
                  <p>3, Folds of Linen dipt in Ice-water muſt be applied all over the Tumour, and conſtantly renewed every Quarter of an Hour.— This Remedy, when immediately applied, has produced the moſt happy Effects; but if the Symptom has endured violently more than ten or twelve Hours, it is often too late to apply it; and then it is better to make Uſe of Flannels dipt in a warm Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mallow and Elder Flowers, ſhifting them frequently. It has been known however, that Ice-water, or Ice itſelf has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as late as the third Day. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pieces of Ice applied between two Pieces of Linen, directly upon the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſoon as poſſible after its firſt Appearance, is one of thoſe extraordinary Remedies, which we ſhould never heſitate to make immediate Uſe of. We may be certain by this Application, if the Rupture is ſimple and not complicated by ſome aggravating Cauſe, to remove ſpeedily, and with very little Pain, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that might be attended with the moſt dreadful Conſequences. But the Continuance of this Application muſt he proportioned to the Strength of the Perſon ruptured, which may be ſufficiently eſtimated by the Pulſe. <hi>E. L.</hi>

                  <p>5, And laſtly, If all theſe Attempts are fruitleſs, the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be reſolved on, without loſing a Moment's Time; as this local Diſeaſe proves ſometimes mortal in the Space of two Days; but for this Operation an excellent Surgeon is indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary. The happy Conſequence with which I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, in a moſt deſperate Caſe ſince the firſt Edition of this Work, on the ſixth Day after a Labour, has convinced me, ſtill more than any former Obſervation I had made, that the Trial of it ought never to be omitted, when other Attempts have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing. It cannot even haſten the Patient's Death, which muſt be inevitable without it, but it rather renders that more gentle, where it might fail to prevent it. When it is performed as Mr. LEVADE effected it, in the Caſe I have juſt referred to, the Pain attending it is very tolerable and ſoon over.</p>

                  <p>A certain Woman in this Place, but now dead, had the great and impudent Temerity to attempt this Operation, and killed her Patients after the moſt excruciating Torments, and an Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or cutting away, of the Teſticle; which Quacks and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Surgeons always do, but which a good Surgeon never does in this Operation.

Every Perſon knows what Boils are at Sight, which are conſiderably painful when large, highly inflamed, or ſo ſituated as to incommode the Motions, or different Poſitions, of the Body. Whenever their Inflammation is very conſiderable; when there are a great many of them at once, and they prevent the Patients from ſleeping, it becomes neceſſary to enter them into a cooling Regimen; to throw up ſome opening Glyſters; and to make them drink plentifully of the Ptiſan, No. 2. Sometimes it is alſo neceſſary to bleed the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Should the Inflammation be very high indeed, a Pultice of Bread and Milk, or of Sorrel a little boiled and bruiſed, muſt be applied to it. But if the Inflammation is only moderate, a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage Plaiſter, or one of the ſimple Diachylon, may be ſufficient.

a <hi>Pus</hi> like that of an Abſceſs, comes out, after which the Germ, or what is called the Core, of it may be diſcerned. This is a purulent Matter or Subſtance, but ſo thick and tenacious, that it appears like a ſolid Body; which may be drawn out entirely in the Shape of a ſmall Cylinder, like the Pith of Elder, to the Length of ſome Lines of an Inch; ſometimes to the Length of a full Inch, and even more. The Emiſſion of this Core is commonly followed by the Diſcharge of a certain Quantity, according to the Size of the Tumour, of liquid Matter, ſpread throughout the Bottom of it. As ſoon as ever this Diſcharge is made, the Pain goes entirely off; and the Swelling diſappears at the End of a few Days, by continuing to apply the ſimple Diachylon, or the Ointment No. 66.</p>

                  <head>Of Fellons or Whitlows.</head>
                  <p>§ 482. The Danger of theſe ſmall Tumours is much greater than is generally ſuppoſed. It is an Inflammation at the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or End of a Finger, which is often the Effect of a ſmall Quantity of Humour extravaſated, or ſtagnant, in that Part; whether this has happened in Conſequnce of a Bruiſe, a Sting, or a Bite. At other times it is evident that it has reſulted from no external Cauſe, but is the Effect of ſome inward one.</p>
                  <p>It is diſtinguiſhed into many Kinds, according to the Place in which the Inflammation begins; but the eſſential Nature of the Malady is always the ſame, and requires the ſame Sort of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Hence ſuch as are neither Phyſicians nor Surgeons, may ſpare themſelves the Trouble of enquiring into the Diviſions of this Diſtemper; which, though they vary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Danger of it, and diverſify the Manner of the Surgeons Operation, yet have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the general Treatment of it; the Power and Activity of which muſt be regulated by the Violence of the Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>§ 483. This Diſorder begins with a ſlow heavy Pain, attended by a ſlight Pulſation, without Swelling, without Redneſs, and without Heat; but in a little Time the Pain, Heat, and Pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Throbbing become intolerable. The Part grows very large and red; the adjoining Fingers and the whole Hand ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up. In ſome Caſes a Kind of red and inflated Fuſe or Streak may be obſerved, which, beginning at the affected Part, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued almoſt to the Elbow; neither is it unuſual for the Patients to complain of a very ſharp Pain under the Shoulder; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole Arm is exceſſively inflamed and ſwelled. The Sick have not a Wink of Sleep, the Fever and other Symptoms quickly increaſing. If the Diſtemper riſes to a violent Degree indeed, a <hi>Delirium</hi> and Convulſions ſupervene.</p>
                  <p>This Inflammation of the Finger terminates, either in Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or in a Gangrene. When the laſt of theſe occurs, the Patient is in very great Danger, if he is not very ſpeedily reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it has proved neceſſary more than once to cut off the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:012243_0265_0F8A6D74095FDB48"/>
Arm, for the Preſervation of his Life. When Suppuration is effected, if the Matter lies very deep, and is ſharp; or if the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a Surgeon has arrived too late, the Bone of the laſt <hi>Phalanx,</hi> or Row of Bones of the Finger, is generally carious and loſt. But how gentle ſoever the Complaint has been, the Nail is very generally ſeparated and falls off.</p>
                  <p>§ 484. The internal Treatment in Whitlows, is the ſame with that in other inflammatory Diſtempers. The Patient muſt enter upon a Regimen more or leſs ſtrict, in Proportion to the Degree of the Fever; and if this runs very high, and the Inflammation be very conſiderable, there may be a Neceſſity for ſeveral Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>The external Treatment conſiſts in allaying the Inflammation; in ſoftening the Skin; and in procuring a Diſcharge of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſoon as it is formed. For this Purpoſe,</p>
                  <p>1, The Finger affected is to be plunged, as ſoon as the Diſorder is manifeſt, in Water a little more than warm: the Steam of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water may alſo be directed into it; and by doing theſe things almoſt conſtantly for the firſt Day, a total Diſſipation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady has often been obtained. But unhappily it has been generally ſuppoſed, that ſuch ſlight Attacks could have but very ſlight Conſequences, whence they have been neglected until the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has greatly advanced; in which State Suppuration becomes abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>2, This Suppuration therefore may be forwarded, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally involving the Finger, as it were, in a Decoction of Mallow Flowers boiled in Milk, or with a Cataplaſm of Bread and Milk. This may be rendered ſtill more active and ripening, by adding a few white Lilly Roots, or a little Honey. But this laſt muſt not be applied before the Inflammation is ſomewhat abated, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration begins; before which Term, all ſharp Applications are very dangerous. At this Time, Yeaſt or Leaven may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly uſed, which powerfully promotes Suppuration. The Sorrel Pultice, mentioned § 480, is alſo a very efficacious one.</p>
                  <p>§ 485. A ſpeedy Diſcharge of the ripe Matter is of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Importance, but this particularly requires the Attention of the Surgeon; as it is not proper to wait till the Tumour breaks and diſcharges of itſelf; and this the rather, as from the Skin's prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes extremely hard, the Matter might be inwardly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed between the Muſcles, and upon their Membranes, before it could penetrate through the Skin. For this Reaſon, as ſoon as Matter is ſuſpected to be formed, a Surgeon ſhould be called in, to determine exactly on the Time, when an Opening ſhould be made; which had better be performed a little too ſoon than too late; and a little too deep, than not deep enough.</p>
                  <p>When the Orifice has been made, and the Diſcharge is effected, it is to be dreſſed up with the Plaiſter No. 66, ſpread upon Linen, or with the Cerecloth; and theſe Dreſſings are to be renewed daily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="unknown:012243_0266_0F8A6D74C9ED4668"/>§ 486. When the Whitlow is cauſed by a Humour extravaſated very near the Nail, an expert Surgeon ſpeedily checks its Progreſs, and cures it effectually by an Inciſion which lets out the Humour. Yet, notwithſtanding this Operation is in no wiſe difficult, all Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons are not qualified to perform it, and but too many have no Idea at all of it.</p>
                  <p>§ 487. Fungous, or, as it is commonly called, proud Fleſh, ſometimes appears during the incarning or healing of the Inciſion. ſuch may be kept down with ſprinkling a little <hi>Minium</hi> (red Lead) or burnt Alum over it.</p>
                  <p>§ 488. If a <hi>Caries,</hi> a Rottenneſs of the Bone, ſhould be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, there is a Neceſſity for a Surgeon's Attendance, as much as if there was a Gangrene; for which Reaſon I ſhall add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with reſpect to either of theſe Symptoms; only obſerving, there are three very eſſential Remedies againſt the laſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the Bark, No. 14, a Drachm of which muſt be taken every two Hours; Scarifications throughout the whole gangrened Part; and Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with a Decoction of the Bark, and the Addition of Spirit of Sulphur. This Medicine is certainly no cheap one; but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of other bitter Plants, with the Addition of Spirit of Salt, may ſometimes do inſtead of it. And here I take leave to inſiſt again upon it, that in moſt Caſes of gangrened Limbs, it is judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious not to proceed to an Amputation of the mortified Part, till the Gangrene ſtops, which may be known by a very perceivable Circle, (and eaſily diſtinguiſhed by the moſt ignorant Perſons) that marks the Bounds of the Gangrene, and ſeparates the living from the mortified Parts.</p>

                  <p>§ 489. It is very common for the Hands, Feet or Legs, to be pierced by the forcible Intruſion of ſmall pointed Subſtances, ſuch as Thorns or Prickles, whether of Roſes, Thiſtles or Cheſtnuts, or little Splinters of Wood, Bone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But if any ſuch pointed penetrating Body cannot be directly extracted, or if a Part of it be left within, it cauſes an Inflammation, which, in its Progreſs, ſoon produces the ſame Symptoms as a Whitlow: or if it happens in the Leg, it inflames and forms a conſiderable Abſceſs there.</p>
                  <p>§ 490. To prevent ſuch Conſequences, if the penetrating Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſtill near the Surface, and an expert Surgeon is at Hand, he muſt immediately make a ſmall Inciſion, and thence extract it. But if the Inflammation were already formed, this would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and even dangerous.</p>

Nothing however, but the groſſeſt Prejudice, could make any one imagine, that this Fat attracted the Splinter, Thorn, or any other obtruded Subſtance by any ſympathetic Virtue; no other Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in Nature being clearly demonſtrated, except that very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one between wrong Heads, and abſurd extravagant Opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</p>
                  <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary that the injured Part ſhould be kept in the eaſieſt Poſture, and as immovable as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>§ 491. Sometimes the Thorn, after having very painfully pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated thro' the Teguments, the Skin, enters directly into the Fat; upon which the Pain ceaſes, and the Patient begins to conclude no ſharp prickly Subſtance had ever been introduced into the Part; and of courſe ſuppoſes none can remain there. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſome Days after, or, in other Inſtances, ſome Weeks, freſh Pains are excited, to which an Inflammation and Abſceſs ſucceed, which are to be treated as uſual, with Emollients, and ſeaſonably opened.</p>

In the hotter Climates where it is wild, and grows very rankly, they ſometimes boil the Leaves and Stalks (beſides eating them as a cooling Salad) and find the whole an inſipid mucilaginous Pot-herb. But Dr. TISSOT obſerves to me, that its Juice will inflame the Skin; and that ſome Writers on Diet, who diſapprove it internally, affirm they have known it productive of bad Effects. Yet none ſuch have ever happened to myſelf, nor to many others who have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently eaten of it.

               <p>Swoonings reſult from many different Cauſes, of which I ſhall only enumerate the principal; and theſe are, 1, Too large a Quantity of Blood. 2, A Defect or inſufficient Proportion of it, and a general Weakneſs. 3, A Load at and violent Diſorders of the Stomach. 4, Nervous Maladies. 5, The Paſſions; and, 6, ſome Kinds of Diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>§ 495. An exceſſive Quantity of Blood is frequently a Cauſe of Swooning; and it may be inferred that it is owing to this Cauſe, when it attacks ſanguine, hearty and robuſt Perſons; and more eſpecially when it attacks them, after being combined with any additional or ſupervening Cauſe, that ſuddenly increaſed the Motion of the Blood; ſuch as heating Meats or Drinks, Wine,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:012243_0270_0F8A6D7B07F03230"/>
ſpirituous Liquors; ſmaller Drinks, if taken very hot and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſuch as Coffee, Indian Tea, Bawm Tea and the like; a long Expoſure to the hot Sun, or being detained in a very hot Place; much and violent Exerciſe; over intenſe and aſſiduous Study or Application, or ſome exceſſive Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch Caſes, firſt of all the Patient ſhould be made to ſmell to, or even to ſnuff up, ſome Vinegar; and his Forehead, his Temples and his Wriſts ſhould be bathed with it; adding an equal Quantity of warm Water, if at Hand. Bathing them with diſtilled or ſpirituous Liquors would be prejudicial in this Kind of Swooning.</p>
                  <p>2, The Patient ſhould be made, if poſſible, to ſwallow two or three Spoonfuls of Vinegar, with four or five times as much Water.</p>
                  <p>3, The Patient's Garters ſhould be tied very tightly above his Knees; as by this Means a greater Quantity of Blood is retained in the Legs, whence the Heart may be leſs overladen with it.</p>
                  <p>4, If the Fainting proves obſtinate, that is, if it continues longer than a Quarter of an Hour, or degenerates into a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copè,</hi> an Abolition of Feeling and Underſtanding, he muſt be bled in the Arm, which quickly revives him.</p>
                  <p>5, After the Bleeding the Injection of a Glyſter will be highly proper; and then the Patient ſhould be kept ſtill and calm, only letting him drink every Half Hour, ſome Cups of Elder-flower Tea, with the Addition of a little Sugar and Vinegar.</p>
                  <p>When Swoonings which reſult from this Cauſe occur frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame Perſon, he ſhould in order to eſcape them, purſue the Directions I ſhall hereafter mention, § 544, when treating of Perſons who ſuperabound with Blood.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame Cauſe, or Cauſes, which occaſion theſe Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, alſo frequently produce violent Palpitations, under the ſame Circumſtances; the Palpitation often preceding or following the <hi>Deliquium,</hi> or Swooning.</p>

                  <p>3, Theſe ſhould be conveyed into their Mouths; and they ſhould be forced, if poſſible, to ſwallow ſome Drops of Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Water, or of Brandy, or of ſome other potable Liquor, mixed with a little Water; while ſome hot Wine mixed with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Cinnamon, which makes one of the beſt Cordials, is getting ready.</p>
                  <p>4, A Compreſs of Flanel, or of ſome other woollen Stuff, dipt in hot Wine, in which ſome aromatic Herb has been ſteeped, muſt be applied to the Pit of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>5, If the Swooning ſeems likely to continue, the Patient muſt be put into a well heated Bed, which has before been perfumed with burning Sugar and Cinnamon; the Frictions of the whole Body with hot Flanels being ſtill continued.</p>
                  <p>6, As ſoon as the Patient, can ſwallow, he ſhould take ſome Soup or Broth, with the Yolk of an Egg; or a little Bread of Biſcuit, ſoaked in the hot ſpiced Wine.</p>
                  <p>7, Laſtly, during the whole Time that all other Precautions are taken to oppoſe the Cauſe of the Swooning, Care muſt be had for ſome Days to prevent any <hi>Deliquium</hi> or Fainting, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them often, and but little at a Time, ſome light yet ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening Nouriſhment, ſuch as Panada made with Soup inſtead of Water, new laid Eggs very lightly poached, light roaſt Meats with ſweet Sauce, Chocolate, Soups of the moſt nouriſhing Meats, Jellies, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>§ 497. Thoſe Swoonings, which are the Effect of Bleeding, or of the violent Operation of ſome Purge, are to be ranged in this Claſs.</p>
                  <p>Such as happen after artificial Bleeding, are generally very moderate, commonly terminating as ſoon as the Patient is laid

upon the Bed: and Perſons ſubject to this Kind ſhould be bled lying down, in order to prevent it. But ſhould the Fainting continue longer than uſual, ſome Vinegar ſmelt to, and a little ſwallowed with ſome Water, is a very good Remedy.</p>
                  <p>The Treatment of ſuch Faintings or Swoonings, as are the Conſequences of over violent Vomits or Purges, may be ſeen hereafter § 552.</p>

                  <head>Of Faintings occaſioned by a Load, or Uneaſineſs, at Stomach.</head>
                  <p>§ 498. It has been already obſerved, § 308, that Indigeſtions were ſometimes attended with Swoonings, and indeed ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ones, as required ſpeedy and very active Succour too, ſuch as that of a Vomit. The Indigeſtion is ſometimes leſs the Effect of the Quantity, than of the Quality, or the Corruption of the Food, contained in the Stomach. Thus we ſee there are ſome Perſons, who are diſordered by eating Eggs, Fiſh, Craw-Fiſh, or any fat Meat; being thrown by them into inexpreſſible Anguiſh attended with Swooning too. It may be ſuppoſed to depend on this Cauſe, when theſe very Aliments have been lately eaten; and when it evidently neither depends on the other Cauſes I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; nor on ſuch as I ſhall ſoon proceed to enumerate.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould in Caſes of this Sort, excite and revive the Patients as in the former, by making them receive ſome very ſtrong Smell, of whatever Kind is at hand; but the moſt eſſential Point to to make them ſwallow down a large Quantity of light warm Fluid; which may ſerve to drown, as it were, the indigeſted Matter; which may ſoften its Acrimony; and either effect the Diſcharge of it by vomiting, or force it down into the Chanel of the Inteſtines.</p>
                  <p>A light Infuſion of Chamomile Flowers, of Tea, of Sage, of Elder-flowers, or of <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> operate with much the ſame Efficacy; though the Chamomile and Carduus promote the Operation of vomiting rather more powerfully; which warm Water alone will ſometimes ſufficiently do.</p>
                  <p>The Swooning ceaſes, or at leaſt conſiderably abates in theſe Caſes, as ſoon as ever the Vomiting commences. It frequently happens too, that, during the Swooning, Nature herſelf brings on a certain <hi>Nauſea,</hi> a Wambling and ſickiſh Commotion of the Stomach, that revives or rouſes the Patient for a Moment; but yet not being ſufficient to excite an actual Vomiting, it lets him ſoon ſink down again into this temporary Diſſolution, which often continues a pretty conſiderable Time; leaving behind it a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Stomach, Vertigos, and a Depreſſion and Anxiety, which do not occur in the former Species of this Malady.</p>
                  <p>Whenever theſe Swoonings from this Cauſe are entirely termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, the Patient muſt be kept for ſome Days to a very light Diet, and take, at the ſame Time, every Morning faſting, a Doſe
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:012243_0273_0F8A6D7E35F051B0"/>
of the Powder, No. 38, which relieves and exonerates the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of whatever noxious Contents might remain in it; and then reſtores its natural Strength and Functions.</p>
                  <p>§ 499. There is another Kind of Swooning, which alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from a Cauſe in the Stomach; but which is, nevertheleſs, very different from this we have juſt been treating of; and which requires a very different Kind of Aſſiſtance. It ariſes from an extraordinary Senſibility of this important Organ, and from a general Weakneſs of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſubject to this Malady are valetudinary weakly Perſons, who are diſordered from many ſlight Cauſes, and whoſe Stomachs are at once very feeble and extremely ſenſible. They have almoſt continually a little Uneaſineſs after a Meal, though they ſhould indulge but a little more than uſual: or if they eat of any Food not quite ſo eaſy of Digeſtion, they have ſome Quality or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion after it: Nay, ſhould the Weather only be unfavourable, and ſometimes without any perceivable aſſignable Cauſe, their Uneaſineſs terminates in a Swoon.</p>
                  <p>Patients ſwooning, from theſe Cauſes, have a greater Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for much Tranquillity and Repoſe, than for any other Remedy; and it might be ſufficient to lay them down on the Bed: But as the Byſtanders in ſuch Caſes find it difficult to remain inactive Spectators of Perſons in a Swoon, ſome ſpirituous Liquid may be held to their Noſe, while their Temples and Wriſts are rubbed with it; and at the ſame Time a little Wine ſhould be given them. Frictions are alſo uſeful in theſe Caſes.</p>
                  <p>This Species of Swooning is oftener attended with a little Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhneſs than the others.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of theſe Swoonings, which ariſe from nervous Diſorders.</head>
                  <p>§ 500. This Species of Swooning is almoſt wholely unknown to thoſe Perſons, for whom this Treatiſe is chiefly intended. Yet as there are ſome Citizens who paſs a Part of their Lives in the Country; and ſome Country People who are unhappily afflicted with the Ailments of the Inhabitants of large Towns and Cities, it ſeemed neceſſary to treat briefly of them.</p>
                  <p>By Diſorders of the Nerves, I underſtand in this Place, only that Fault or Defect in them, which is the Cauſe of their exciting in the Body, either irregular Motions, that is, Motions without any external Cauſe, at leaſt any perceivable one; and without our Will's conſenting to the Production of them: or ſuch Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are greatly more conſiderable than they ſhould be, if they had been proportioned to the Force of the Impreſſion from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. This is very exactly that State, or Affection termed the <hi>Vapours</hi>; and by the common People, the <hi>Mother</hi>: And as there is no Organ unprovided with Nerves; and none, or hardly any Function, in which the Nerves have not their Influence; it may be eaſily comprehended, that the Vapours being a State or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:012243_0274_0F8A6D7E9E9F5718"/>
which ariſes from the Nerves exerting irregular involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motions, without any evident Cauſe; and all the Functions of the Body depending partly on the Nerves; there is no one Symptom of other Diſeaſes which the Vapours may not produce or imitate; and that theſe Symptoms, for the ſame Reaſon, muſt vary infinitely, according to thoſe Branches of the Nerves which are diſordered. It may alſo hence be conceived, why the Vapours of one Perſon have frequently no Reſemblance to thoſe of another: and why the Vapours of the very ſame Perſon, in one Day, are ſo very different from thoſe of the next. It is alſo very conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Vapours are a certain, a real Malady; and that Oddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Symptoms, which cannot be accounted for, by People unacquainted with the animal Oeconomy, has been the Cauſe of their being conſidered rather as the Effect of a depraved Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, than as a real Diſeaſe. It is very conceivable, I ſay, that this ſurprizing Oddity of the Symptoms is a neceſſary Effect of the Cauſe of the Vapours; and that no Perſon can any more prevent his being invaded by the Vapours, than he can prevent the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of a Fever, or of the Tooth-ach.</p>
                  <p>§ 501. A few plain Inſtances will furniſh out a more compleat Notion of the Mechaniſm, or Nature, of Vapours. An Emetic, a vomiting Medicine, excites the Act, or rather the Paſſion, the Convulſion of Vomiting, chiefly by the Irritation it gives to the Nerves of the Stomach; which Irritation produces a Spaſm, a Contraction of this Organ. Now if in Conſequence of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid or defective Texture of the Nerves, which conſtitutes the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, thoſe of the Stomach are excited to act with the ſame Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as in Conſequence of taking a Vomit, the Patient will be agitated and worked by violent Efforts to vomit, as much as if he had really taken one.</p>
                  <p>If an involuntary unuſual Motion in the Nerves, that are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the Lungs, ſhould conſtrain and ſtraiten the very little Veſicles, or Bladders, as it were, which admit the freſh Air at every Reſpiration, the Patient will feel a Degree of Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; juſt as if that Straitening or Contraction of the Veſſels were occaſioned by ſome noxious Steam or Vapour.</p>
                  <p>Should the Nerves which are diſtributed throughout the whole Skin, by a Succeſſion of theſe irregular morbid Motions, contract themſelves, as they may from external Cold, or by ſome ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Application, Perſpiration by the Pores will be prevented or checked; whence the Humours, which ſhould be evacuated through the Pores of the Skin, will be thrown upon the Kidnies, and the Patient will make a great Quantity of thin clear Urine, a Symptom very common to vapouriſh People; or it may be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Glands of the Inteſtines, the Guts, and terminates in a watery <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> or Looſeneſs, which frequently proves a very obſtinate one.</p>
                  <p>§ 502. Neither are Swoonings the leaſt uſual Symptoms at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Vapours; and we may be certain they ſpring from
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:012243_0275_0F8A6D7F4EA7A1F8"/>
this Source, when they happen to a Perſon ſubject to the Vapours; and none of the other Cauſes producing them are evident, or have lately preceded them.</p>
                  <p>Such Swoonings, however, are indeed very rarely dangerous, and ſcarcely require any medical Aſſiſtance. The Patient ſhould be laid upon a Bed; the freſh Air ſhould he very freely admitted to him; and he ſhould be made to ſmell rather to ſome diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and fetid, than to any fragrant Subſtance. It is in ſuch Faintings as theſe that the Smell of burnt Leather, of Feathers, or of Paper, have often proved of great Service.</p>
                  <p>§ 503. Patients alſo frequently faint away, in Conſequence of faſting too long: or from having eat a little too much; from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined in too hot a Chamber; from having ſeen too much Company; from ſmelling too over-powering a Scent; from being too coſtive; from being too forcibly affected with ſome Diſcourſe or Sentiments; and, in a Word from a great Variety of Cauſes, which might not make the leaſt Impreſſion on Perſons in perfect Health; but which violently operate upon thoſe vapouriſh People, becauſe, as I have ſaid, the Fault of their Nerves conſiſts in their being too vividly, too acutely affected; the Force of their Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being nowiſe proportioned to the external Cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as that particular Cauſe is diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt, which has occaſioned the preſent Swooning; it is manifeſt that this Swooning is to be remedied, by removing that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cauſe of it.</p>

                  <head>Of Swoonings occaſioned by the Paſſions.</head>
                  <p>§ 504. There have been ſome Inſtances of Perſons dying within a Moment, through exceſſive Joy. But ſuch Inſtances are ſo very rare and ſudden, that Aſſiſtance has ſeldom been ſought for on this Occaſion. The Caſe is otherwiſe with reſpect to thoſe produced from Rage, Vexation, and Dread or Horror. I ſhall treat in a ſeparate Article of thoſe reſulting from great Fear; and ſhall briefly conſider here ſuch as enſue from Rage, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Grief or Diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>§ 505. Exceſſive Rage and violent Affliction are ſometimes fatal in the Twinkling of an Eye; though they oftner terminate in fainting only. Exceſſive Grief or Chagrin is eſpecially accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this Conſequence; and it is very common to ſee Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus affected, ſink into ſucceſſive Faintings for ſeveral Hours. It is plainly obvious that very little Affiance can be given in ſuch Caſes: it is proper, however, they ſhould ſmell to ſtrong Vinegar; and frequently take a few Cups of ſome hot and temperately cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Drink, ſuch as Bawn-Tea, or Lemonade with a little Orange or Lemon-peel.</p>
                  <p>The calming, aſſwaging Cordial, that has ſeemed the moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to me, is one ſmall Coffee Spoonful of a Mixture of three

                  <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed that Swoonings or Faintings, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Paſſions, can be cured by Nouriſhment. The phyſical State or Condition, into which vehement Grief throws the Body, is that, of all others, in which Nouriſhment would be moſt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it: and as long as the Vehemence of the Affliction endures, the Sufferer ſhould take nothing but ſome Spoonfuls of Soup or Broth, or a few Morſels of ſome light Meat roaſted.</p>
                  <p>§ 506. When Wrath or Rage has riſen to ſo high a Pitch, that the human Machine, the Body, entirely exhauſted, as it were, by that violent Effort, ſinks down at once into exceſſive Relaxation, a Fainting ſometimes ſucceeds, and even the moſt perilous Degree of it, a <hi>Syncopé.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſufficient, or rather the moſt that can be done here, to let the Patient be perfectly ſtill a while in this State; only making him ſmell to ſome Vinegar. But when he is come to himſelf, he ſhould drink plentifully of hot Lemonade, and take one or more of the Glyſters No. 5.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there remain in theſe Caſes Sickneſſes at Stomach, Reachings to vomit, a Bitterneſs in the Mouth, and ſome verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Symptoms which ſeem to require a Vomit. But ſuch a Medicine muſt be very carefully avoided, ſince it may be attended with the moſt fatal Conſequence: and Lemonade with Glyſters generally and gradually remove theſe Swoonings. If the <hi>Nauſea</hi> and Sickneſs at Stomach continue, the utmoſt Medicine we ſhould allow beſides, would be that of No. 23, or a few Doſes of No. 24.</p>

                  <p>§ 507. Swoonings, which ſupervene in the Courſe of other Diſeaſes, never afford a favourable Prognoſtic; as they denote Weakneſs, and Weakneſs is an Obſtacle to Recovery.</p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of putrid Diſeaſes, they alſo denote an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at Stomach, or a Maſs of corrupt Humours; and they ceaſe as ſoon as an Evacuation ſupervenes, whether by Vomit or by Stool.</p>
                  <p>When they occur at the Beginning of malignant Fevers, they declare the high Degree of their Malignancy, and the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Patient's natural Strength.</p>
                  <p>In each of theſe Caſes Vinegar, uſed externally and internally, is the beſt Remedy during the Exacerbation or Height of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm; and Plenty of Lemon-Juice and Water after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="unknown:012243_0277_0F8A6D811115DEF0"/>§ 508. Swoonings which ſupervene in Diſeaſes, accompanied with great Evacuations, are cured like thoſe which are owing to Weakneſs; and Endeavours ſhould be uſed to reſtrain or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Evacuations.</p>
                  <p>§ 509. Thoſe who have any inward Abſceſs or Impoſthume are apt to ſwoon frequently. They may ſometimes be revived a little by Vinegar, but they prove too frequently mortal.</p>
                  <p>§ 510. Many Perſons have a ſlighter or a deeper Swooning, at the End of a violent Fit of an intermitting Fever, or at that of each Exacerbation of a continual Fever; this conſtantly ſhews the Fever has run very high, the Swooning having been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that great Relaxation, which has ſucceeded to a very high Tenſion. A Spoonful or two of light white Wine, with an equal Quantity of Water, affords all the ſuccour proper in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
                  <p>§ 511. Perſons ſubject to frequent Swoonings, ſhould neglect nothing that may enable them to remove them when known; ſince the Conſequences of them are always detrimental, except in ſome Fevers, in which they ſeem to mark the <hi>Criſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every ſwooning Fit leaves the Patient in Dejection and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the Secretions from the Blood are ſuſpended; the Humours diſpoſed to Stagnation; Grumoſities, or Coagulations, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are formed; and if the Motion of the Blood is totally intercepted, or conſiderably checked, <hi>Polypuſes,</hi> and theſe often incurable, are formed in the Heart, or in the larger Veſſels; the Conſequences of which are dreadful, and ſometimes give Riſe to internal Aneuriſms, which always prove mortal, after long Anxiety and Oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Swoonings which attack old People, without any manifeſt Cauſe, always afford an unfavourable Prognoſtic.</p>

                  <head>Of Haemorrhages, or an involuntary Loſs of Blood.</head>
                  <p>§ 512. Haemorrhages of the Noſe, ſupervening in inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Fevers, commonly prove a favourable <hi>Criſis</hi>; which Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould carefully avoid ſtopping; except it becomes exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and ſeems to threaten the Patient's Life.</p>
                  <p>As they ſcarcely ever happen in very healthy Subjects, but from a ſuperfluous Abundance of Blood, it is very improper to check them too ſoon; leſt ſome internal Stuffings and Obſtructions ſhould prove the Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>A Swooning ſometimes enſues after the Loſs of only a moderate Quantity of Blood. This Swooning ſtops the Haemorrhage, and goes off without any further Aſſiſtance, except the Smelling to Vinegar. But in other Caſes there is a Succeſſion of fainting Fits, without the Blood's ſtopping; while at the ſame time ſlight convulſive Motions and Twitchings enſue, attended with a Rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it becomes really neceſſary to ſtop the Bleeding: and indeed, without waiting till theſe violent Symptoms appear, the
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:012243_0278_0F8A6D8186C22210"/>
following Signs will ſufficiently direct us, when it is right to ſtop the Flux of Blood, or to permit its Continuance—As long as the Pulſe is ſtill pretty full; while the Heat of the Body is equally extended to the very Extremities; and the Countenance and Lips preſerve their natural Redneſs, no ill Conſequence is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from the Haemorrhage, though it has been very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and even ſomewhat profuſe.</p>
                  <p>But whenever the Pulſe begins to faulter and tremble; when the Countenance and the Lips grow pale, and the Patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of a ſickneſs at Stomach, it is abſolutely neceſſary to ſtop the Diſcharge of Blood. And conſidering that the Operation of Remedies does not immediately follow the Exhibition or Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, it is ſafer to begin a little too early with them, than to delay them, though ever ſo little too long.</p>
                  <p>§ 513. Firſt of all then, tight Bandages, or Ligatures, ſhould be applied round both Arms, on the Part they are applied over in order to Bleeding; and round the lower Part of both Thighs, on the gartering Place; and all theſe are to be drawn very tight, with on Intention to detain and accumulate the Blood in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
                  <p>2, In order to increaſe this Effect, the Legs are to be plunged in warm Water up to the Knees; for by relaxing the Blood veſſels of the Legs and Feet, they are dilated at the ſame time, and thence receive, and, in Conſequence of the Ligatures above the Knees, retain the more Blood. If the Water were cold, it would repel the Blood to the Head; if hot, it would increaſe the Motion of it; and, by giving a greater Quickneſs to the Pulſe, would even contribute to increaſe the Haemorrhage.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon however, as the Haemorrhage is ſtopt, theſe Ligatures [on the Thighs] may be relaxed a little, or one of them be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely removed; allowing the others to continue on an Hour or two without touching them: but great Precaution ſhould be taken not to ſlacken them entirely, nor all at once.</p>
                  <p>3, Seven or eight Grains of Nitre, and a Spoonful of Vinegar in half a Glaſs of cool Water, ſhould be given to the Patient every half Hour.</p>
                  <p>4. One Drachm of white Vitriol muſt be diſſolved in two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Spoonfuls of Spring Water; and a Tent of Lint, or Bits of ſoft fine Linen Dipt in this Solution, are to be introduced into the Noſtrils, horizontally at firſt, but afterwards to be intruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and as high as may be, by the Aſſiſtance of a flexible Bit of Wood or Whalebone. But ſhould this Application be ineffectual, the Mineral Anodyne Liquor of HOFFMAN is certain to ſucceed: and in the Country, where it often happens that neither of theſe Applications are to be had ſpeedily, Brandy, and even Spirit of Wine, mixt with a third Part Vinegar, have anſwered entirely well, of which I have been a Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Preſcription No. 67, which I have already referred to, on the Article of Wounds may alſo be ſerviceable on this Occaſion. It
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:012243_0279_0F8A6D84EAFFACD8"/>
muſt be reduced to Powder, and conveyed up the Noſtrils as high as may be, on the Point or extremity of a Tent of Lint, which may eaſily be covered with it. Or a Quill, well charged with the Powder, may be introduced high into the Noſtrils, and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents be ſtrongly blown up from its other Extremity: though after all the former method is preferable.</p>
                  <p>5, When the Flux of Blood is totally ſtopt, the Patient is to be kept as ſtill and quiet as poſſible; taking great Care not to extract the Tent which remains in the Noſe; nor to remove the Clots of coagulated Blood which fill up the Paſſage. The looſening and removing of theſe ſhould be effected very gradually and cautiouſly; and frequently the Tent does not ſpring out ſpontaneouſly, till after many Days.</p>
                  <p>§ 514. I have not, hitherto, ſaid any thing of artificial Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe Caſes, as I think it at beſt unſerviceable; ſince, though it may ſometimes have ſtopt the morbid Loſs of Blood, it has at other times increaſed it. Neither have I mentioned Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes here, whoſe conſtant Effect is to determine a larger Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood to the Head.</p>
                  <p>Applications of cold Water to the Nape of the Neck ought to be wholly diſuſed, having ſometimes been attended with the moſt embarraſſing Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>In all Haemorrhages, all Fluxes of Blood, great Tranquillity, Ligatures, and the Uſe of the Drinks No. 2 or 4, are very uſeful.</p>
                  <p>§ 515. People who are very liable to frequent Haemorrhages, ought to manage themſelves conformably to the Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the next Chapter, § 544. They ſhould take very little Supper; avoid all ſharp and ſpirituous Liquors; Apartments that are over hot; and cover their Heads but very lightly.</p>
                  <p>When a Patient has for a long time been ſubject to Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if they ceaſe, he ſhould retrench from his uſual Quantity of Food; accuſtom himſelf to artificial Bleedings at proper Intervals; and take ſome gentle opening Purges, eſpecially that of No. 24, and frequently a little Nitre in an Evening.</p>

                  <head>Of Convulſions.</head>
                  <p>§ 516. Convulſions are, in general, more terrifying than dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; they reſult from many and various Cauſes; and on the Removal or Extirpation of theſe, their Cure depends.</p>
                  <p>In the Fit itſelf very little is to be done, or even attempted.</p>
                  <p>As nothing does ſhorten the Duration, nor even leſſen the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, of an epileptic Fit, ſo nothing at all ſhould be attempted in it; and the rather, becauſe Means and Medicines often aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Diſeaſe. We ſhould confine our Endeavours ſolely to the Security of the Patient, by preventing him from giving himſelf any violent Strokes; by getting ſomething, if poſſible, between his Teeth, ſuch as a ſmall Roller of Linen to prevent his Tongue
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:012243_0280_0F8A6D85AC1BE2A8"/>
from being hurt, or very dangerouſly ſqueezed and bruiſed, in a ſtrong Convulſion.</p>
                  <p>The only Caſe which requires immediate Aſſiſtance in the Fit, is, when it is ſo extremely violent, the Neck ſo ſwelled, and the Face ſo very red, that there is Room to be apprehenſive of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polexy, which we ſhould endeavour to obviate, by drawing eight or ten Ounces of Blood from the Arm.</p>
                  <p>As this terrible Diſeaſe is common in the Country, it is doing a real Service to the unfortunate Victims of it, to inform them how very dangerous it is to give themſelves blindly up to take all the Medicines, which are cried up to them in ſuch Caſes. If there be any one Diſeaſe, which requires a more attentive, delicate and exquiſite Kind of Treatment, it is this very Diſeaſe. Some Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it are wholly incurable: and ſuch as may be ſuſceptible of a Cure, require the utmoſt Care and Conſideration of the moſt enlightened and moſt experienced Phyſicians: while thoſe who pretend to cure all epileptic Patients with one invariable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, are either Ignorants, or Impoſtors, and ſometimes both in one.</p>
                  <p>§ 517. Simple Convulſion Fits, which are not epileptic, are frequently of a long Continuance, perſevering, with very few and ſhort Intervals, for Days and even for Weeks.</p>
                  <p>The true genuine Cauſe ſhould be inveſtigated as ſtrictly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though nothing ſhould be attempted in the Fit. The Nerves are, during that Term, in ſo high a Degree of Tenſion and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that the very Medicines, ſuppoſed to be ſtrongly indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, often redouble the Storm they were intended to appeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thin watery Liquors, moderately imbued with Aromatics, are the leaſt hurtful, and the moſt innocent Things that can be given; ſuch as Bawm, Lime-tree, and Elder-flower Tea. A Ptiſan of Liquorice Root only has ſometimes anſwered better than any other.</p>

                  <head>Of ſuffocating or ſtrangling Fits.</head>
                  <p>§ 518. Theſe Fits (by whatever other Name they may be called) whenever they very ſuddenly attack a Perſon, whoſe Breathing was eaſy and natural juſt before, depend almoſt conſtantly on a Spaſm or Contraction of the Nerves, in the Veſicles of the Lungs; or upon an Infarction, a Stuffing of the ſame Parts, produced by viſcid clammy Humours.</p>
                  <p>That Suffocation which ariſes from a Spaſm is not dangerous, it goes off of itſelf, or it may be treated like Swoonings owing to the ſame Cauſe. See § 502.</p>
                  <p>§ 519. The Suffocation, which is the Effect of a ſanguineous Fulneſs and Obſtruction, may be diſtinguiſhed by its attacking ſtrong, vigorous, ſanguine Perſons, who are great Eaters, uſing much juicy nutritious Food, and ſtrong Wine and Liquors, and who frequently eat and inflame themſelves; and when the Fit has
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:012243_0281_0F8A6D8605DA98A0"/>
come on after any inflaming Cauſe; when the Pulſe is full and ſtrong, and the Countenance red.</p>
                  <p>Such are cured, 1, by a very plentiful Diſcharge of Blood from the Arm, which is to be repeated if neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>2, By the Uſe of Glyſters.</p>
                  <p>3, By drinking plentifully of the Ptiſan No. 1; to each Pot of which, a Drachm of Nitre is to be added; and,</p>
                  <p>4, By the Vapour of hot Vinegar, continually received by Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration or Breathing. See § 55.</p>
                  <p>§ 520. There is Reaſon to think that one of theſe Fits is owing to a Quantity of tough viſcid Humours in the Lungs, when it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks Perſons, whoſe Temperament, and whoſe Manner of living are oppoſite to thoſe I have juſt deſcribed; ſuch as valetudinary, weakly, phlegmatick, pituitous, inactive, and ſqueamiſh Perſons, who feed badly, or on fat, viſcid, and inſipid Diet, and who drink much hot Water, either alone, or in Tea-like Infuſions. And theſe Signs of Suffocation, reſulting from ſuch Cauſes, are ſtill more probable, if the Fit came on in rainy Weather, and during a ſoutherly Wind; and when the Pulſe is ſoft and ſmall, the Viſage Pale and hollow.</p>
                  <p>The moſt efficacious Treatment we can adviſe, is, 1, To give every half Hour half a Cup of the Potion, No. 8, if it can readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be had. 2, To make the Patient drink very plentifully of the Drink No. 12; and 3, to apply two ſtrong Bliſters to the fleſhy Parts of his Legs.</p>
                  <p>If he was ſtrong and hearty before the Fit, and the Pulſe ſtill continues vigorous, and feels ſomewhat full withal, the loſs of ſeven or eight Ounces of Blood is ſometimes indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A Glyſter has alſo frequently been attended with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Effects.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe afflicted with this oppreſſing Malady are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as ſoon as they expectorate, and ſometimes even by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting a little.</p>
                  <p>The Medicine No. 25, a Doſe of which may be taken every two Hours, with a Cup of the Ptiſan No. 12, often ſucceeds very well.</p>
                  <p>But if neither this Medicine, nor the Preſcription No. 8 are at Hand, which may be the Caſe in Country Places; an Onion of a moderate Size ſhould be pounded in an Iron or Marble Mortar; upon this, a Glaſs of Vinegar is to be poured, and then ſtrongly ſqueezed out again through a Piece of Linen. An equal Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Honey is then to be added to it. A Spoonful of this Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe remarkable Efficacy I have been a Witneſs of, is to be given every half Hour.</p>

                  <head>Of the violent Effects of Fear.</head>
                  <p>§ 521. Here I ſhall inſert ſome Directions to prevent the ill Conſequences of great Fear or Terror, which are very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial at every Term of Life, but chiefly during Infancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:012243_0282_0F8A6D86D553DE90"/>The general Effects of Terror are a great Straitening and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of all the ſmall Veſſels, and a Repulſion of the Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the large and internal ones. Hence follows the Suppreſſion of Perſpiration, the general Seizure or Oppreſſion, the Trembling, the Palpitations and Anguiſh, from the Heart and the Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcharged with Blood; and ſometimes attended with Swoonings, irremediable Diſorders of the Heart, and Death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: A heavy Drowſineſs, Raving, and a Kind of furious or raging <hi>Delirium</hi> happen in other Caſes, which I have frequently obſerved in Children, when the Blood Veſſels of the Neck were ſwelled or ſtuffed up; and Convulſions, and even the Epilepſey have come on, all which have proved the horrible Conſequence of a moſt ſenſeleſs and wicked Foolery or Sporting. One half of thoſe Epilepſies which do not depend on ſuch Cauſes as might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt before the Child's Birth, are owing to this deteſtable Cuſtom; and it cannot be too much inculcated into Children, never to frighten one another; a Point which Perſons, intruſted with their Education, ought to have the ſtricteſt Regard to.</p>
                  <p>When the Humours that ſhould have paſſed off by Perſpiration, are repelled to the Inteſtines, a tedious and very obſtinate Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the frequent Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>§ 522. Our Endeavours ſhould be directed, to re-eſtabliſh the diſordered Circulation; to reſtore the obſtructed Perſpiration; and to allay the Agitation of the Nerves.</p>
                  <p>The popular Cuſtom in theſe Caſes has been to give the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Patient ſome cold Water directly; but when the Fright has been conſiderable, this is a very pernicious Cuſtom, and I have ſeen ſome terrible Conſequences from it.</p>
                  <p>They ſhould, on the contrary, be conveyed into ſome very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Situation, leaving there but very few Perſons, and ſuch only as they are thoroughly familiar with. They ſhould take a few Cups of pretty warm Drink, particularly of an Infuſion of Lime-tree Flowers and Bawm. Their Legs ſhould be put into warm Water, and remain there an Hour, if they will patiently permit it, rubbing them gently now and then, and giving them every half-quarter of an Hour, a ſmall Cup of the ſame Drink. When their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and Tranquillity are returned a little, and their Skin ſeems to have recovered its wonted and general Warmth, Care ſhould be taken to diſpoſe them to Sleep, and to perſpire plentifully. For this Purpoſe they may be allowed a few Spoonfuls of Wine, on putting them into Bed, with one Cup of the former Infuſion; or, which is more certain and effectual, a few Drops of SYDEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM's Liquid Laudanum, No. 4; but ſhould not that be near at hand, a ſmall Doſe of <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle.</p>
                  <p>§ 523. It ſometimes happens that Children do not ſeem at firſt extremely terrified ; but the Fright is renewed while they ſleep, and with no ſmall Violence. The Directions I have juſt given
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:012243_0283_0F8A6D88D920FBC0"/>
muſt then be obſerved, for ſome ſucceſſive Evenings before they are put to Bed.</p>
                  <p>Their Fright frequently returns about the latter End of the Night, and agitates them violently every Day. The ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be continued in ſuch Caſes; and we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſpoſe them to be aſleep at the uſual Hour of its Return.</p>
                  <p>By this very Method I have diſſipated the diſmal Conſequences of Fear on Women in Childbed, which is ſo commonly, and often ſpeedily, mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>If a Suffocation from this Cauſe is violent, there is ſometimes a Neceſſity for opening a Vein in the Arm.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Patients ſhould gradually be inured to an almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, but gentle, Kind of Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>All violent Medicines render thoſe Diſeaſes, which are the Conſequences of great Fear, incurable. A pretty common one is that of an Obſtruction of the Liver, which has been productive of a Jaundice <note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen this actually verified by great and diſagreeable Surprize, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed with much Concern, in a Perſon of exquiſite Senſations. <hi>K.</hi>

He ſays the latter is ſmaller, ſofter, leſs durable in the Fire, and the Vapour of it leſs dangerous than that of Charcoal.</note> Charcoal is burnt in a Chamber cloſe ſhut, which is direct Poiſon to a Perſon ſhut up in it. The ſulphureous Oil, which is ſet at Liberty and diffuſed by the Action of Fire, expands itſelf through the Chamber; while thoſe who are in it perceive a Diſorder and Confuſion in their Heads; they contract Virtigos, Sickneſs at Stomach, a Weakneſs, and very unuſual Kind of Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; become raving, convulſed and trembling, and if they fail of Preſence of Mind, or of Strength, to get out of the Chamber, they die within a ſhort Time.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen a Woman who had vertiginous Commotions in her Head for two Days, and almoſt continual Vomitings, from her having been confined leſs than ſix Minutes in a Chamber (and that notwithſtanding both one Window and one Door were open) in

                  <p>The Condition of the Brain, in the diſſected Bodies of Perſons thus deſtroyed, proves that they die of an Apoplexy; notwiſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is very probable that Suffocation is alſo partly the Cauſe of their Deaths; as the Lungs have been found ſtuffed up with Blood and livid.</p>
                  <p>It has alſo been obſerved in ſome other Bodies thus deſtroyed, that Patients killed by the Vapour of burning Coals, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their whole Bodies ſwelled out to one third more than their Magnitude, when living. The Face, Neck, and Arms are ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if they had been blown up; and the whole human Machine appears in ſuch a State, as the dead Body of a Perſon would, who had been violently ſtrangled; and who had made all poſſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for a long time, before he was overpowered.</p>
                  <p>§ 525. Such as are ſenſible of the great Danger they are in, and retreat ſeaſonably from it, are generally relieved as ſoon as they get out into the open Air; or if they have any remaining Uneaſineſs, a little Water and Vinegar, or Lemonade, drank hot, affords them ſpeedy Relief. But when they are ſo far poiſoned, as to have loſt their Feeling and Underſtanding, if there be any Means of reviving them, ſuch Means conſiſt,</p>
                  <p>1, In expoſing them to a very pure, freſh and open Air.</p>
                  <p>2, In making them ſmell to ſome very penetrating Odour, which is ſomewhat ſtimulating and reviving, ſuch as the volatile Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, the <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note * Page 251.</note> 
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt; and afterwards to ſurround them, as it were, with the Steam of Vinegar.</p>
                  <p>3, In taking ſome Blood from their Arm.</p>
                  <p>4, In putting their Legs into warm or hot Water, and chaſing them well.</p>
                  <p>5, In making them ſwallow, if practicable, much Lemonade, or Water and Vinegar, with the Addition of Nitre: and,</p>
                  <p>6, In throwing up ſome ſharp Glyſters.</p>
                  <p>As it is manifeſt there is ſomething ſpaſmodic in theſe Caſes, it were proper to be provided with ſome antiſpaſmodic Remedies, ſuch as the Mineral Anodyne Liquid of HOFFMAN. Even Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um has ſometimes been ſucceſsfully given here, but it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to Phyſicians only to direct it in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>A Vomit would be hurtful; and the Reachings to vomit ariſe only from the Oppreſſion on the Brain.</p>
                  <p>It is a common but erroneous Opinion, that if the Coal be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:012243_0285_0F8A6D89F5A7E6A0"/>
to burn a Minute or ſo in the open Air or in a Chimney, it is ſufficient to prevent any Danger from the Vapour of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence it amounts even to a criminal Degree of Imprudence, to ſleep in a Chamber while Charcoal or ſmall Coal is burning in it; and the Number of ſuch imprudent Perſons, as have never awaked after it, is ſo conſiderable, and ſo generally known too, that the Continuance of this unhappy Cuſtom is aſtoniſhing.</p>
                  <p>§ 526. The Bakers, who make uſe of much ſmall Coal, often keep great Quantities of it in their Cellars, which frequently abound ſo much with the Vapour of it, that it ſeizes them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently the Moment they enter into the Cellar. They ſink down at once, deprived of all Senſation, and die if they are not drawn out of it ſoon enough to be aſſiſted, according to the Directions I have juſt given.</p>
                  <p>One certain Means of preventing ſuch fatal Accidents, is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going into the Cellar, to throw ſome flaming Paper or Straw into it, and if theſe continue to flame out and conſume, there is no Reaſon for dreading the Vapour: but if they ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, no Perſon ought to venture in. But after opening the Vent-hole, a Bundle of flaming Straw muſt be ſet at the Door, which ſerves to attract the external Air ſtrongly. Soon after the Experiment of the flaming Paper muſt be repeated, and if it goes out, more Straw is to be ſet on Fire before the Cellar Door.</p>
                  <p>§ 527. Small Coal, burnt in an open Fire, is not near ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as <hi>Charcoal,</hi> properly ſo called, the Danger of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from this, that in extinguiſhing it by the uſual Methods, all thoſe ſulphureous Particles of it, in which its Danger conſiſt, are concentred. Nevertheleſs, ſmall Coal is not entirely deprived of all its noxious Quality, without ſome of which it could not ſtrictly be Coal.</p>
                  <p>The common Method of throwing ſome Salt on live Coals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are conveyed into a Chamber: or of caſting a Piece of Iron among them, to imbibe ſome Part of their deadly narcotic Sulphur, is not without its Utility; though by no Means ſufficient to prevent all Danger from them.</p>
                  <p>§ 528. When the moſt dangerous Symptoms from this Cauſe diſappear, and there remains only ſome Degree of Weakneſs, of Numbneſs, and a little Inappetency, or Loathing at Stomach, nothing is better than Lemonade with one fourth Part Wine, half a Cup of which ſhould frequently be taken with a ſmall Cruſt of Bread.</p>
                  <p>§ 529. The Vapour which exhales from Wine, and in general from all fermenting Liquors, ſuch as Beer, Cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contains ſomething poiſonous, which kills in the like Manner, with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of Coal; and there is always ſome Danger in going into a Cellar, where there is much Wine in the State of Fermentation; if it has been ſhut up cloſe for ſeveral Hours. There have been many Examples of Perſons ſtruck dead on entering one, and of others who have eſcaped out of it with Difficulty.</p>

And when the Perſons unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately afflicted are brought out, they are to be treated like thoſe, who were affected with the Coal-Vapour.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw a Man about eight Years ſince, who was not ſenſible of the Application of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, till about an Hour after he was ſtruck down, and who was entirely freed at laſt by a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bleeding; though he had been ſo inſenſible, that it was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hours before he diſcovered a very great Wound he had, which extended from the Middle of his Arm to his Arm-pit; and which was made by a Hook intended to be uſed, in Caſe of a Houſe catching Fire, to aſſiſt Perſons in eſcaping from the Flames.</p>
                  <p>§ 530. When ſubterraneous Caves that have been very long ſhut are opened; or when deep Wells are cleaned, that have not been emptied for ſeveral Years, the Vapours ariſing from them produce the ſame Symptoms I have mentioned, and require the ſame Aſſiſtance. They are to be cleanſed and purified by burning Sulphur and Salt Petre in them, or Gunpowder, as compounded of both.</p>
                  <p>§ 531. The offenſive Stink of Lamps and of Candles, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when their Flames are extinguiſhed, operate like other Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, though with leſs Violence, and leſs ſuddenly. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there have been Inſtances of People killed by the Fumes of Lamps fed with Nut Oil, which had been extinguiſhed in a cloſe Room. Theſe laſt Smells or Fumes prove noxious alſo, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their Greaſineſs, which being conveyed, together with the Air, into the Lungs, prevent their Reſpiration: And hence we may obſerve, that Perſons of weak delicate Breaſts find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quickly oppreſſed in Chambers or Apartments, illuminated with many Candles.</p>

                  <p>§ 532. There are a great Number of Poiſons, whoſe Manner of acting is not alike; and whoſe ill Effects are to be oppoſed by different Remedies: but Arſenic, or Ratſbane, and ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Plants are the Poiſons which are the moſt frequently produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Miſchief in Country Places.</p>

Guts; with rending and often bloody Vomitings and Stools, Convulſions, Faintings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beſt Remedy of all is pouring down whole Torrents of Milk or, where there is not Milk, of warm Water. Nothing but a prodigious Quantity of ſuch weak Liquids can avail ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Patient. If the Cauſe of the Diſorder is immediately known, after having very ſpeedily taken down a large Quantity of warm Water, Vomiting may be excited with Oil, or with melted But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by tickling the Inſide of the Throat with a Feather. But when the Poiſon has already inflamed the Stomach and the Guts, we muſt not expect to diſcharge it by vomiting. Whatever is healing or emollient, Decoctions of mealy Puls, of Barley, of Oatmeal, of Marſhmallows, and Butter and Oil are the moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ever the tormenting Pains are felt in the Belly, and the Inteſtines ſeem attacked, Glyſters of Milk muſt be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thrown up.</p>
                  <p>If at the very Beginning of the Attack, the Patient has a ſtrong Pulſe, a very large Bleeding may be conſiderably ſerviceable by its delaying the Progreſs, and diminiſhing the Degree of Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And even though it ſhould happen that a Patient overcomes the firſt Violence of this dreadful Accident, it is too common for him to continue in a languid State for a long Time, and ſometimes for all the Remainder of his Life. The moſt certain Method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this Miſery, is to live for ſome Months ſolely upon Milk, and ſome very new laid Eggs juſt received from the Hen, and diſſolved or blended in the Milk, without boiling them.</p>
                  <p>§ 534. The Plants which chiefly produce theſe unhappy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are ſome Kinds of Hemlock, whether it be the Leaf or the Root, the Berries of the <hi>Bella Donna,</hi> or deadly Nightſhade, which Children eat by Miſtake for Cherries; ſome Kind of Muſhrooms; the Seed of the <hi>Datura,</hi> or the ſtinking Thorn-apple.</p>
                  <p>All the Poiſons of this Claſs prove mortal rather from an nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotic, or ſtupefying, than from an acrid, or very ſharp Quality: Vertigos, Faintings, Reachings to vomit, and actual Vomitings are the firſt Symptoms produced by them.</p>
                  <p>The Patient ſhould immediately ſwallow down a large Quantity of Water, moderately ſeaſoned with Salt, or with Sugar; and then a Vomiting ſhould be excited as ſoon as poſſible by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription No. 34 or 35: or, if neither of theſe is very readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, with Radiſh-ſeed pounded, to the Quantity of a Coffee Spoonful, ſwallowed in warm Water, ſoon after forcing a Feather or a Finger into the Patient's Throat, to expedite the Vomiting.</p>
                  <p>After the Operation of the Vomit, he muſt continue to take a large Quantity of Water, ſweetened with Honey or Sugar, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a conſiderable Quantity of Vinegar, which is the true Specific, or Antidote, as it were, againſt theſe Poiſons: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines muſt alſo be emptied by a few Glyſters.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII. Of Medicinces taken by Way of Precaution, or Prevention.</head>
               <p>SECT. 538. I HAVE pointed out, in ſome Parts of this Work, the Means of preventing the bad Effects of ſeveral Cauſes of Diſeaſes; and of prohibiting the Return of ſome habitual Diſorders. In the preſent Chapter I ſhall adjoin ſome Obſervations, on the Uſe of the principal Remedies, which are employed as general Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; pretty regularly too at certain ſtated Times, and almoſt always from meer Cuſtom only, without knowing, and often with very little Conſideration, whether they are right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the Uſe, the Habit of taking Medicines, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no indifferent Matter: it is ridiculous, dangerous, and even criminal to omit them, when they are neceſſary, but not leſs ſo to take them when they are not wanted. A good Medicine taken ſeaſonably, when there is ſome Diſorder, ſome <hi>Diſarrangement</hi> in the Body, which would in a ſhort time occaſion a Diſtemper, has often prevented it. But yet the very ſame Medicine, when given to a Perſon in perfect Health, if it does not directly make him ſick, leaves him at the beſt in a greater Propenſity to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Diſeaſes: and there are but too many Examples of People, who having very unhappily contracted a Habit, a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take Phyſick, have really injured their Health, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired their Conſtitutions, however naturally ſtrong, by an Abuſe of thoſe Materials, which Providence has given for the Recovery and Re-eſtabliſhment of it: an Abuſe which, though it ſhould not injure the Health of the Perſon, would occaſion thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when he ſhould be really ſick, to be leſs efficacious and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him, from their having been familiar to his Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ond thus he becomes deprived of the Aſſiſtance he would have received from them, if taken only in thoſe Times and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which they were neceſſary for him.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of Bleeding.</head>
                  <p>§ 539. Bleeding is neceſſary only in theſe four Caſes. 1, When there is too great a (Quantity of Blood in the Body. 2, When there is any Inflammation, or an inflammatory Diſeaſe. 3, When ſome Cauſe ſupervenes or is about to ſupervene, in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would ſpeedily produce an Inflammation, or ſome
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:012243_0290_0F8A6D8D89B8F3E0"/>
other dangerous Symptoms, if the Veſſels were not relaxed by Bleeding. It is upon this Principle that Patients are bled after Wounds, and after Bruiſes; that Bleeding is directed for a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Woman, if ſhe has a violent Cough; and that Bleeding is performed, by way of Precaution, in ſeveral other Caſes. 4, We alſo adviſe Bleeding ſometimes to aſſwage an exceſſive Pain, though ſuch Pain is not owing to Exceſs of Blood, nor ariſes from any inflamed Blood; but in order to appeaſe and moderate the Pain by Bleeding; and thereby to obtain Time for deſtroying the Cauſe of it by other Remedies. But as theſe two laſt Reaſons are in Effect involved or implied in the two firſt; it may be very generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that an Exceſs of Blood, and an inflamed State of it, are the only two neceſſary Motives for Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>§ 540. An Inflammation of the Blood is known by the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms accompanying thoſe Diſeaſes, which that Cauſe produces. Of theſe I have already ſpoken, and I have at the ſame time regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Practice of Bleeding in ſuch Caſes. Here I ſhall point out thoſe Symptoms and Circumſtances, which manifeſt an Exceſs of Blood.</p>
                  <p>The 1ſt, then, is the general Courſe and Manner of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's living, while in Health. If he is a great Eater and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges in juicy nutritious Food, and eſpecially on much Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat; if he drinks rich and nouriſhing Wine, or other ſtrong Drink, and at the ſame time enjoys a good Digeſtion; if he takes but little Exerciſe, ſleeps much, and has not been ſubject to any very conſiderable Evacuation, he may well be ſuppoſed to abound in Blood. It is very obvious that all theſe Cauſes rarely occur in Country People; if we except only the Abatement of their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe during ſome Weeks in Winter, which indeed may contribute to their generating more Blood than they ordinarily do.</p>
                  <p>The labouring Country-man, for much the greater Part of his Time, lives only on Bread, Water and Vegetables; Materials but very moderately nouriſhing, as one Pound of Bread proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly does not make, in the ſame Body, more Blood than one Ounce of Fleſh, though a general Prejudice ſeems to have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a contrary Opinion. The 2d is the total Stopping or long Interruption of ſome involuntary Bleeding or Haemorrhage, to which he had been accuſtomed. 3, A full and ſtrong Pulſe, and Veins viſibly filled with Blood, in a Body that is not lean and thin, and when he is not heated. 4, A florid lively Ruddineſs. 5. A conſiderable and unuſual Numbneſs; Sleep more profound, of more Duration, and yet leſs tranquil and calm, than at other Times; a greater Propenſity than ordinary to be fatigued after moderate Exerciſe or Work; and a little Oppreſſion and Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from walking. 6, Palpitations, accompanied ſometimes with very great Dejection, and even with a ſlight fainting Fit; eſpecially on being in any hot Place, or after moving about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably. 7, Vertigos, or Swimmings of the Head, eſpecially on bowing down and raiſing it up at once, and after ſleeping. 8,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:012243_0291_0F8A6D8E598B6DC0"/>
Frequent Pains of the Head, to which the Perſon was not former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject; and which ſeem not to ariſe from any Defect in the Digeſtions. 9, An evident Senſation of Heat, pretty generally diffuſed over the whole Body. 10, A ſmarting Sort of Itching all over, from a very little more Heat than uſual. And laſtly, frequent Haemorrhages, and theſe attended with manifeſt Relief, and more Vivacity.</p>
                  <p>People ſhould, notwithſtanding, be cautious of ſuppoſing an unhealthy Exceſs of Blood, from any one of theſe Symptoms on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: many of them muſt concur; and they ſhould endeavour to be certain, that even ſuch a Concurrence of them does not reſult from a very different Cauſe, and wholly oppoſite in Effect to that of an Exceſs of Blood.</p>
                  <p>But when it is certain, from the whole Appearance, that ſuch an Exceſs doth really exiſt, then a ſingle, or even a ſecond Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is attended with very good Effects. Nor is it material, in ſuch Caſes, from what Part the Blood is taken.</p>
                  <p>§ 541. On the other hand, when theſe Circumſtances do not exiſt, Bleeding is in no wiſe neceſſary: nor ſhould it ever be practiſed in theſe following Conditions and Circumſtances; except for ſome particular and very ſtrong Reaſons; of the due Force of which none but Phyſicians can judge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when the Perſon is in a very advanced Age, or in very early Infancy. 2, When he is either naturally of a weakly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or it has been rendered ſuch by Sickneſs, or by ſome other Accident. 3, When the Pulſe is ſmall, ſoft, feeble, and intermits, and the Skin is manifeſtly pale. 4, When the Limbs, the Extremities of the Body, are often cold, puffed up and ſoft. 5, When their Appetites has been very ſmall for a long time; their Food but little nouriſhing, and their Perſpiration too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, from great Exerciſe. 6, When the Stomach has long been diſordered, and the Digeſtion bad, whence very little Blood could be generated. 7, When the Patient has been conſiderably emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, whether by Haemorrhages, a Looſeneſs, profuſe Urine or Sweat: or when the <hi>Criſis</hi> of ſome Diſtemper has been effected by any one of theſe Evacuations. 8, When the Patient has long been afflicted with ſome depreſſing Diſeaſe; and troubled with many ſuch Obſtructions as prevent the Formation of Blood. 9, Whenever a Perſon is exhauſted, from whatever Cauſe. 10, When the Blood is in a thin, pale, and diſſolved State.</p>
                  <p>§ 542. In all theſe Caſes, and in ſome others leſs frequent, a ſingle Bleeding often precipitates the Patient into an abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable State, an irreparable Train of Evils. Mary diſmal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it are but too obvious.</p>
                  <p>Whatever, therefore, be the Situation of the Patient, and however naturally robuſt, that Bleeding, which is unneceſſary, is noxious. Repeated, re-iterated Bleedings, weaken and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, haſten old Age, diminiſh the Force of the Circulation, thence fatten and puff up the Body; and next by weakening, and
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:012243_0292_0F8A6D8F076CD548"/>
laſtly by deſtroying, the Digeſtions, they lead to a fatal Dropſy. They diſorder the Perſpiration by the Skin, and leave the Patient liable to Colds and Defluxions: They weaken the nervous Syſtem, and render Perſons ſubject to Vapours, to the hypochondriac Diſorders, and to all nervous Maladies.</p>
                  <p>The ill Conſequence of a ſingle, though erroneous Bleeding is not immediately diſcernible: on the contrary, when it was not performed in ſuch a Quantity, as to weaken the Patient perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, it appears to have been rather beneficial. Yet I ſtill here inſiſt upon it, that it is not the leſs true that, when unneceſſary, it is prejudicial; and that People ſhould never bleed, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times has been done, for meer Whim, or, as it were, for Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It avails nothing to affirm, that within a few Days after it, they have got more Blood than they had before it, that is, that they weigh more than at firſt, whence they infer the Loſs of Blood very ſpeedily repaired. The Fact of their augmented Weight is admitted; but this very Fact teſtifies againſt the real Benefit of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ding; ſince it is a Proof, that the natural Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body are leſs compleatly made; and that Humours, which ought to be expelled, are retained in it. There remains the ſame Quantity of Blood, and perhaps a little more; but it is not a Blood ſo well made, ſo perfectly elaborated; and this is ſo very true, that if the thing were otherwiſe; if ſome Days after the Bleeding they had a greater Quantity of the ſame Kind of Blood, it would amount to a Demonſtration, that more re-iterated Bleedings muſt neceſſarily have brought on an inflammatory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, in a Man of a robuſt Habit of Body.</p>
                  <p>§ 543. The Quantity of Blood which a grown Man may part with, by way of Precaution, is about ten Ounces.</p>
                  <p>§ 544. Perſons ſo conſtituted as to breed much Blood, ſhould carefully avoid all thoſe Cauſes which tend to augment it, (See § 540, No. 1.) and when they are ſenſible of the Quantity aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, they ſhould confine themſelves to a light frugal Diet, on Puls, Fruits, Bread and Water; they ſhould often Bathe their Feet in warm Water, taking Night and Morning the Powder No. 20; drink of the Ptiſan No. 1; ſleep but very moderately, and take much Exerciſe. By uſing theſe Precautions they may either prevent any Occaſion for Bleeding, or ſhould they really be obliged to admit of it, they would increaſe and prolong its good Effects. Theſe are alſo the very Means which may remove all the Danger that might enſue from a Perſon's omitting to bleed, at the uſual Seaſon or Interval, when the Habit, the Faſhion of Bleeding had been inveterately eſtabliſhed in him.</p>
                  <p>§ 545. We learn with Horror and Aſtoniſhment, that ſome have been bled eighteen, twenty and even twenty-four times in two Days; and ſome others, ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">How ſhocking is this! and yet how true in ſome Countries! I have been moſt certainly aſſured, that Bleeding has been inflicted and repeated in the laſt ſinking and totally relaxing Stage of a Sea-Scurvy, whoſe fatal Termination it doubtleſs accelerated. This did not happen in our own Fleet; yet we are not as yet wholly exempt on Shore, from ſome Abuſe of Bleeding, which a few raw unthinking Operators are apt to conſider as a meer Matter of Courſe. I have in ſome other Place ſtigmatized the Madneſs of Bleeding in Convulſions, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Exhauſtion and Emptineſs, with the Abhorrence it deſerves. <hi>K.</hi>

of ſome Months. Such Inſtances irrefragably demonſtrate the continual Ignorance of their Phyſician or Surgeon; and ſhould the Patient eſcape, we ought to admire the inexhauſtible Reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nature, that ſurvived ſo many murderous Inciſions.</p>
                  <p>§ 546. The People entertain a common Notion, which is, that the firſt time of bleeding certainly ſaves the Life of the Patient; but to convince them of the Falſity of this ſilly Notion, they need only open their Eyes, and ſee the very contrary Fact to this occur but too unhappily every Day; many People dying ſoon after their firſt Bleeding. Were their Opinion right, it would be impoſſible that any Perſon ſhould die of the firſt Diſeaſe that ſeized him, which yet daily happens. Now the Extirpation of this abſurd Opinion is really become important, as the Continuance of it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome unhappy Conſequences: their Faith in, their great Dependance on, the extraordinary Virtue of this firſt Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes them willing to omit it, that is, to treaſure it up againſt a Diſtemper, from which they ſhall be in the greateſt Danger; and thus it is deferred as long as the Patient is not extremely bad, in Hopes that if they can do without it then, they ſhall keep it for another and more preſſing Occaſion. Their preſent Diſeaſe in the Mean time riſes to a violent Height; and then they bleed, but when it is too late, and I have ſeen Inſtances of many Patients, who were permitted to die, that the firſt Bleeding might be reſerved for a more important Occaſion. The only Difference between the firſt Bleeding, and any ſubſequent one is, that the firſt commonly gives the Patient an Emotion, which is rather hurtful than ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>

                  <head>Of Purges.</head>
                  <p>§ 547. The Stomach and Bowels are emptied either by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, or by Stools, the latter Diſcharge being much more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than the firſt, which is not effected without a violent Motion, and one indeed to which Nature is repugnant. Nevertheleſs, there are ſome Caſes, which really require this artificial Vomiting; but theſe excepted (ſome of which I have already pointed out) we ſhould rather prefer thoſe Remedies, which empty the Belly by Stool.</p>
                  <p>§ 548. The Signs which indicate a Neceſſity for Purging, are, 1, a diſagreeable Taſt or Savour of the Mouth in a Morning, and eſpecially a bitter Taſt; a ſoul furred Tongue and Teeth, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Eructations or Belchings, Windineſs and Diſtenſion.</p>
                  <p>2, A Want of Appetite, which increaſes very gradually, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:012243_0294_0F8A6D934E42B9F0"/>
any Fever; which degenerates into a Diſguſt or total Averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Food; and ſometimes communicates a bad Taſt to the very little ſuch Perſons do eat.</p>
                  <p>3, Reachings to vomit in a Morning faſting, and ſometimes throughout the Day; ſuppoſing ſuch not to depend on a Woman's Pregnancy, or ſome other Diſorder, in which Purges would be either uſeleſs or hurtful.</p>
                  <p>4, A Vomiting up of bitter or corrupted Humours.</p>
                  <p>5, A manifeſt Senſation of a Weight, or Heavineſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the Loins, or the Knees.</p>
                  <p>6, A Want of Strength ſometimes attended with Reſtleſſneſs, ill Humour, or Peeviſhneſs, and Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>7, Pains of the Stomach, frequent Pains of the Head, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigos; ſometimes a Drowſineſs, which increaſes after Meals.</p>
                  <p>8, Some Species of Cholics; irregular Stools which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very great in Quantity, and too liquid for many Times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; after which an obſtinate Coſtiveneſs enſues.</p>
                  <p>9, A Pulſe leſs regular, and leſs ſtrong, than what is natural to the Patient, and which ſometimes intermits.</p>
                  <p>§ 549. When theſe Symptoms, or ſome of them, aſcertain the Neceſſity of Purging a Perſon, not then attacked by any manifeſt Diſeaſe (for I am not ſpeaking here of Purges in ſuch Caſes) a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per purging Medicine may be given him. The bad Taſt in his Mouth; the continual Belchings; the frequent Reachings to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; the actual Vomitings and Melancholy diſcover, that the Cauſe of his Diſorder reſides in the Stomach, and ſhew that a Vomit will be of Service to him. But when theſe Signs or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are not evident, the Patient ſhould take ſuch purging or opening Remedies, as are particularly indicated by the Pains, whether of the Loins; from the Cholic; or by a Senſation of Weight or Heavineſs in the Knees.</p>
                  <p>§ 550. But we ſhould abſtain from either vomiting or purging, 1, Whenever the Complaints of the Patients are founded in their Weakneſs, and their being already exhauſted. 2, When there is a general Dryneſs of the Habit, a very conſiderable Degree of Heat, ſome Inflammation, or a ſtrong Fever. 3, Whenever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is exerting herſelf in ſome other ſalutary Evacuation; whence purging muſt never be attempted in critical Sweats, during the monthly Diſcharges, nor daring a Fit of the Gout. 4, Nor in ſuch inveterate Obſtructions as Purges cannot remove, and really do augment. 5, Neither when the nervous Syſtem is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly weakened.</p>
                  <p>§ 551. There are other Caſes again, in which it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to purge, but not to give a Vomit. Theſe Caſes are, 1. When the Patient abounds too much with Blood, (See § 540) ſince the Efforts which attend vomiting, greatly augment the Force of the Circulation; whence the Blood-Veſſels of the Head and of the Breaſt, being extremely diſtended with Blood, might burſt, which muſt prove fatal on the Spot, and
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:012243_0295_0F8A6D939247AC18"/>
has repeatedly proved ſo. 2, For the ſame Reaſon they ſhould not be given to Perſons, who are ſubject to frequent Bleeding from the Noſe, or to coughing up or vomiting of Blood; to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are ſubject to exceſſive or unſeaſonable Diſcharges of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the <hi>Vagina,</hi> the Neck of the Womb; nor to thoſe who are with Child. 3, Vomits are improper for ruptured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>§ 552. When any Perſon has taken too acrid, too ſharp, a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or a Purge, which operates with exceſſive Violence; whether this conſiſts in the moſt vehement Efforts and Agitations, the Pains, Convulſions or Swoonings, which are their frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; or whether that prodigious Evacuation and Emptineſs their Operation cauſes, (which is commonly termed a <hi>Super-purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) and which may hurry the Patient off; Inſtances of which are but too common among the lower Claſs of the People, who much too frequently confide themſelves to the Conduct of ignorant Menſlayers: In all ſuch unhappy Accidents, I ſay, we ſhould treat theſe unfortunate Perſons, as if they had been actually poiſoned by violent corroding Poiſons, (See § 533) that is, we ſhould ſill them, as it were, with Draughts of warm Water, Milk, Oil, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Water, Almond-Milk, emollient Glyſters with Milk, and the Yolks of Eggs; and alſo bleed them plentifully, if their Pains are exceſſive, and their Pulſes ſtrong and feveriſh.</p>
                  <p>The Super purgation, the exceſſive Diſcharge is to be ſtopt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having plied the Patient plentifully with diluting Drinks, by giving the calming anodyne Medicines directed in the Removal of acute Pains, § 536, No. 6.</p>
                  <p>Flanels dipt in hot Water, in which ſome <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, are very ſerviceable: and ſhould the Evacuations by Stool be exceſſive, and the Patient has not a high Fever, and a parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kind of Heat, a Morſel of the ſame Treacle, as large as a Nutmeg, may be diſſolved in his Glyſter.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould the Vomiting ſolely be exceſſive, without any Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Number of emollient Glyſters with Oil and the Yolk of an Egg, muſt be increaſed; and the Patient ſhould be placed in a warm Bath.</p>
                  <p>§ 553. Purges frequently repeated, without juſt and neceſſary Indications, are attended with much the ſame ill Effects as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Bleedings. They deſtroy the Digeſtions; the Stomach no longer, or very languidly, exerts it Functions; the Inteſtines prove inactive; the Patient becomes liable to very ſevere Cholics; the Plight of the Body, deprived of its ſalutary Nutrition, falls off; Perſpiration is diſordered; Defluxions enſue; nervous Maladies come on, with a general Languor; and the Patient proves old, long before the Number of his Years have made him ſo.</p>
                  <p>Much irreparable Miſchief has been done to the Health of Children, by Purges injudiciouſly given and repeated. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from attaining their utmoſt natural Strength and frequently contract their due Growth. They ruin their Teeth;

                     </gap> generally received, that Perſons who have little or no Appetite need purging; ſince this iſ often very falſe, and moſt of thoſe Cauſes, which leſſen or deſtroy the Appetite, cannot be removed by purging; though many of them may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by it.</p>
                  <p>Perſons whoſe Stomachs contain much glairy viſcid Matter ſuppoſe, they may be cured by Purges, which ſeem indeed at firſt to relieve them; but this proves a very ſlight and deceitful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Theſe Humours are owing to that Weakneſs and Laxity of the Stomach, which Purges augment; ſince, notwithſtanding they carry off Part of theſe viſcid Humours generated in it, at the Expiration of a few Days there is a greater Accumulation of them than before; and thus, by a Re-iteration of purging Medicines, the Malady ſoon becomes incurable, and Health is irrecoverably loſt. The real Cure of ſuch Caſes is effected by directly oppoſite Medicines. Thoſe referred to, or mentioned, § 272, are highly conducive to it.</p>
                  <p>§ 554. The Cuſtom of taking ſtomachic Medicines infuſed in Brandy, Spirit of Wine, Cherry Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is always dangerous; for notwithſtanding the preſent immediate Relief ſuch Infuſions afford in ſome Diſorders of the Stomach, they really by ſlow De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees impair and ruin that Organ; and it may be obſerved, that as many as accuſtom themſelves to Drams, go off, juſt like exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Drinkers, in Conſequence of their having no Digeſtion; whence they ſink into a State of Depreſſion and Languor, and die dropſical.</p>
                  <p>§ 555. Either Vomits or Purges may be often beneficially omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even when they have ſome Appearance of ſeeming neceſſary, by abating one Meal a Day for ſome Time; by abſtaining from the moſt nouriſhing Sorts of Food; and eſpecially from thoſe which are fat; by drinking freely of cool Water, and taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Exerciſe. The ſame Regimen alſo ſerves to ſubdue, without the Uſe of Purges, the various Complaints which often invade thoſe, who omit taking purging Medicines, at thoſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Intervals, in which they have made it a Cuſtom to take them.</p>
                  <p>§ 556. The Medicines, No. 34 and 35, are the moſt certain Vomits. The Powder, No. 21, is a good Purge, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is in no Wiſe feveriſh.</p>
                  <p>The Doſes recommended in the Table of Remedies are thoſe, which are proper for a grown Man of a vigorous Conſtitution. Nevertheleſs there are ſome few, for whom they may be too weak: in ſuch Circumſtances they may be increaſed by the Addition of a third or fourth Part of the Doſe preſcribed. But ſhould they not operate in that Quantity, we muſt be careful not to double the Doſe, much leſs to give a three-fold Quantity, which has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:012243_0297_0F8A6D0E2FF10688"/>
been done, and that even without its Operation, and at the Riſque of killing the Patient, which has not ſeldom been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. In Caſe of ſuch Purging not enſuing, we ſhould rather give large Draughts of Whey ſweetened with Honey, or of warm Water, in a Pot of which an Ounce, or an Ounce and a half of common Salt muſt be diſſolved; and this (Quantity is to be taken from Time to Time in ſmall Cups, moving about with it.</p>
                  <p>The Fibres of Country People who inhabit the Mountains, and live almoſt ſolely on Milk, are ſo little ſuſceptible of Senſation, that they muſt take ſuch large Doſes to purge them, as would kill all the Peaſantry in the Vallies. In the Mountains of <hi>Valais</hi> there are Men who take twenty, and even twenty-four Grains of Glaſs of Antimony for a ſingle Doſe; a Grain or two of which were ſufficient to poiſon ordinary Men.</p>

Yet it is certain in this Point, they are ſo inveterately attached to this Prejudice, that it is but too common to ſee Country-People die, in waiting for the Sign or Quarter moſt favourable to the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and effect of a Medicine, which was truly neceſſary five or ſix Days before either of them. Sometimes too that particular Medicine is given, to which a certain Day is ſuppoſed to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious and favourable, in preference to that which is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent againſt the Diſeaſe. And thus it is, that an ignorant Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack Maker determines on the Lives of the human Race; and contracts the Duration of them with Impunity.</p>
                  <p>§ 558. When a Vomit or a Purge is to be taken, the Patient's Body ſhould be prepared for the Reception of it twenty-four Hours beforehand; by taking very little Food, and drinking ſome Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of warm Water, or of a light Tea of ſome Herbs.</p>
                  <p>He ſhould not drink after a Vomit, until it begins to work; but then he ſhould drink very plentifully of warm Water, or a light Infuſion of Chamomile Flowers, which is preferable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="unknown:012243_0298_0F8A6D0EDD7E5E88"/>It is uſual after Purges, to take ſome thin Broth or Soup dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Operation; but warm Water ſweetened with Sugar or Honey, or an Infuſion of Succory Flowers, would ſometimes be more ſuitable.</p>
                  <p>§ 559. As the Stomach ſuffers, in ſome Degree, as often as either a Vomit, or a Purge, is taken, the Patient ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how he lives, and orders himſelf for ſome Days after taking them, as well in Regard to the Quantity as Quality of his Food.</p>
                  <p>§ 560. I ſhall ſay nothing of other Articles taken by Way of Precaution, ſuch as Soups, Whey, Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are but little uſed among the People; but confine myſelf to this general Remark, that when they take any of theſe precautionary Things, they ſhould enter on a Regimen or Way of living, that may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with them, and contribute to the ſame Purpoſe. Whey is commonly taken to refreſh and cool the Body; and while they drink it, they deny themſelves Puls, Fruits, and Sallads. They eat nothing then, but the beſt and heartieſt Fleſh-meats they can come at; ſuch Vegetables as are uſed in good Soups, Eggs, and good Wine; notwithſtanding this is to deſtroy, by high and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aliments, all the attemperating cooling Effects expected from the Whey.</p>
                  <p>Some Perſons propoſe to cool and attemperate their Blood by Soups and a thin Diet into which they cram Craw fiſh, that heat conſiderably, or <hi>Naſturtium,</hi> Creſſes which alſo heat, and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat their own Purpoſe, Happily in ſuch a Caſe, the Error in one Reſpect often cures that in the other; and theſe Kinds of Soup, which are in no Wiſe cooling, prove very ſerviceable, in Conſequence of the Cauſe of the Symptoms, which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remove, not requiring any Coolers at all.</p>
                  <p>The general phyſical Practice of the Community, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily is but too much in Faſhion, abounds with ſimilar Errors. I will juſt cite one, becauſe I have ſeen its diſmal Effects. Many People ſuppoſe Pepper cooling, though their Smell, Taſt, and common Senſe concur to inform them of the contrary. It is the very hotteſt of Spices.</p>
                  <p>§ 561. The moſt certain Preſervative, and the moſt attainable too by every Man, is to avoid all Exceſs, and eſpecially Exceſs in eating and in drinking. People generally eat more than thoroughly conſiſts with Health, or permits them to attain the utmoſt Vigour, of which their natural Conſtitutions are capable. The Cuſtom is eſtabliſhed, and it is difficult to eradicate it: notwithſtanding we ſhould at leaſt reſolve not to eat, but through Hunger, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under a Subjection to Reaſon; becauſe, except in a very few Caſes, Reaſon conſtantly ſuggeſts to us not to eat, when the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach has an Averſion to Food. A ſober moderate Perſon is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Labour, I may ſay, even of exceſſive Labour of ſome Kinds; of which greater Eaters are abſolutely incapable. Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of itſelf cures ſuch Maladies as are otherwiſe incurable, and may recover the moſt ſhattered and unhealthy Perſons.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII. Of Mountebanks, Quacks, and Conjurers.</head>
               <p>SECT. 562. ONE dreadful Scourge ſtill remains to be treated of, which occaſions a greater Mortality than all the Diſtempers I have hitherto deſcribed; and which, as long as it continues, will defeat our utmoſt Precautions to preſerve the Health and Lives of the common People. This, or rather, theſe Scourges, for they are very numerous, are Quacks; of which there are two Species: The Mountebanks, or travelling Quacks, and thoſe pretended Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in Villages and Country-Places, both male and female, known in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> by the Name of Conjurers, and who very effectually unpeople it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, the Mountebanks, without viſiting the Sick, or thinking of their Diſtempers, ſell different Medicines, ſome of which are for external Uſe, and theſe often do little or no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but their internal ones are much oftener pernicious. I have been a Witneſs of their dreadful Effects, and we are not viſited by one of theſe wandering Caitiffs, whoſe Admiſſion into our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not mortally fatal to ſome of its Inhabitants. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious alſo in another Reſpect, as they carry off great Sums of Money with them, and levy annually ſome thouſands of Livres, amongſt that Order of the People, who have the leaſt to ſpare. I have ſeen, and with a very painful Concern, the poor Labourer and the Artiſan, who have ſcarcely poſſeſſed the common Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life, borrow wherewithal to purchaſe, and at a dear Price, the Poiſon that was to compleat their Miſery, by increaſing their Maladies; and which, where they eſcaped with their Lives, has left them in ſuch a languid and inactive State, as has reduced their whole Family to Beggary.</p>
               <p>§ 563. An ignorant, knaviſh, lying and impudent Fellow will always ſeduce the groſs and credulous Maſs of People, incapable to judge of and eſtimate any Thing rightly; and adapted to be the eternal Dupes of ſuch, as are baſe enough to endeavour to dazzle their weak Underſtandings; by which Method theſe vile Quacks will certainly defraud them, as long as they are tolerated. But ought not the Magiſtrates, the Guardians, the Protectors, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Fathers of the People to interpoſe, and defend them from this Danger, by ſeverely prohibiting the Entrance of ſuch Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fellows into a Country, where Mens Lives are very eſtimable, and where Money is ſcarce; ſince they extinguiſh the firſt, and carry off the laſt, without the leaſt Poſſibility of their being in any wiſe uſeful to it. Can ſuch forcible Motives as theſe ſuffer our Magiſtrates to delay <hi>their</hi> Expulſion any longer, <hi>whom</hi> there never was the leaſt Reaſon for admitting?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="unknown:012243_0300_0F8A6D111BE4C710"/>§ 564. It is acknowledged the Conjurers, the reſiding Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, do not carry out the current Money of the Country, like the itinerant Quacks; but the Havock they make among their Fellow Subjects is without Intermiſſion, whence it muſt be very great, as every Day in the Year is marked with many of their Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims. Without the leaſt Knowledge or Experience, and offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed with three or four Medicines, whoſe Nature they are as thoroughly ignorant of, as of their unhappy Patients Diſeaſes; and which Medicines, being all violent ones, are very certainly ſo many Swords in the Hands of raging Madmen. Thus armed and qualified, I ſay, they aggravate the ſlighteſt Diſorders, and make thoſe that are a little more conſiderable, mortal; but from which the Patients would have recovered, if left ſolely to the Conduct of Nature; and, for a ſtill ſtronger Reaſon, if they had confided to the Guidance of her experienced Obſervers and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
               <p>§ 565. The Robber who aſſaſſinates on the High-way, leaves the Traveller the Reſources of defending himſelf, and the Chance of being aided by the Arrival of other Travellers: But the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who forces himſelf into the Confidence of a ſick Perſon, is a hundred times more dangerous, and as juſt an object of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Bands of Highway-men, and their Individuals, that enter into any Country or Diſtrict, are deſcribed as particularly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Publick. It were equally to be wiſhed, we had alſo a Liſt of theſe phyſical Impoſtors and Ignorants male and female; and that a moſt exact Deſcription of them, with the Number, and a brief Summary of their murderous Exploits, were faithfully pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. By this Means the Populace might probably be inſpired with ſuch a wholeſome Dread of them, that they would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expoſe their Lives to the Mercy of ſuch Executioners.</p>
               <p>§ 566. But their Blindneſs, with reſpect to theſe two Sorts of maleficient Beings, is inconceivable. That indeed in Favour of the Mountebank is ſomewhat leſs groſs, becauſe, as they are not perſonally acquainted with him, they may the more eaſily credit him with ſome Part of the Talents and the Knowledge he arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. I ſhall therefore inform them, and it cannot be repeated too often, that whatever oſtentatious Dreſs and Figure ſome of theſe Impoſtors make, they are conſtantly vile Wretches, who, incapable of earning a Livelyhood in an honeſt Way, have laid the Foundation of their Subſiſtence on their own amazing Stock of Impudence, and that of the weak Credulity of the People; that they have no ſcientific Knowledge; that their Titles and Patents are ſo many Impoſitions, and inauthentic; ſince by a ſhameful Abuſe, ſuch Patents and Titles are become Articles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which are to be obtained at very low Prices; juſt like the ſecond-hand laced Cloaks which they purchaſe at the Brokers. That their Certificates of Cures are ſo many Chimeras or Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that in ſhort, if among the prodigious Multitudes of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:012243_0301_0F8A6D1201C71400"/>
People who take their Medicines, ſome of them ſhould recover, which it is almoſt phyſically impoſſible muſt not ſometimes be the Caſe, yet it would not be the leſs certain, that they are a pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Set of Men. A Thruſt of a Rapier into the Breaſt has ſaved a Man's Life by ſeaſonably opening an Impoſthume in it, which might otherwiſe have killed him: and yet internal pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Wounds, with a ſmall Sword, are not the leſs mortal for one ſuch extraordinary Conſequence. Nor is it even ſurprizing that theſe Mountebanks (which is equally applicable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers) who kill thouſands of People, whom Nature alone, or aſſiſted by a Phyſician, would have ſaved, ſhould now and then cure a Patient, who had been treated before by the ableſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. Frequently Patients of that Claſs, who apply to theſe Mountebanks and Conjurers (whether it has been, that they would not ſubmit to the Treatment proper for their Diſtempers; or whether the real Phyſician tired of the intractible Creatures has diſcontinued his Advice and Attendance) look out for ſuch Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as aſſure them of a ſpeedy Cure, and venture to give them ſuch Medicines as kill many, and cure one (who has had Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution enough to overcome them) a little ſooner than a juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Phyſician would have done. It is but too eaſy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, in every Pariſh, ſuch Liſts of their Patients, and of their Feats, as would clearly evince the Truth of whatever has been ſaid here relating to them.</p>
               <p>§ 567. The Credit of this Market, this Fair-hunting Doctor, ſurrounded by five or ſix hundred Peaſants, ſtaring and gaping at him, and counting themſelves happy in his condeſcending to cheat them of their very ſcarce and neceſſary Caſh, by ſelling them, for twenty times more than its real Worth, a Medicine whoſe beſt Quality were to be only a uſeleſs one; the Credit, I ſay, of this vile yet tolerated Cheat, would quickly vaniſh, could each of his Auditors be perſuaded, of what is ſtrictly true, that except a little more Tenderneſs and Agility of Hand, he knows full as much as his Doctor; and that if he could aſſume as much Impudence, he would immediately have as much Ability, would equally deſerve the ſame Reputation, and to have the ſame Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence repoſed in him.</p>
               <p>§ 568. Were the Populace capable of reaſoning, it were eaſy to diſabuſe them in theſe Reſpects; but as it is, their Guardians and Conductors ſhould reaſon for them. I have already proved the Abſurdity of repoſing any Confidence in Mountebanks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; and that Reliance ſome have on the Conjurers is ſtill more ſtupid and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The very meaneſt Trade requires ſome Inſtruction: A Man does not commence even a Cobler, a Botcher of old Leather, without ſerving an Appreticeſhip to it; and yet no Time has been ſerved, no Inſtruction has been attended to, by theſe Pretenders to the moſt neceſſary, uſeful and elegant Profeſſion. We do not confide the mending, the cleaning of a Watch to any, who have
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:012243_0302_0F8A6D1288887A90"/>
ſpent ſeveral Years in conſidering how a Watch is made; what are the requiſites and Cauſes of its going right; and the Defects or Impediments that make it go wrong: and yet the preſerving and rectifying the Movements of the moſt complex, the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and exquiſite, and the moſt eſtimable Machine upon Earth, is entruſted to People who have not the leaſt Notion of its Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; of the Cauſes of its Motions; nor of the Inſtruments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to rectify their Deviations.</p>
               <p>Let a Soldier diſcarded from his Regiment for his roguiſh Tricks, or who is a Deſerter from it, a Bankrupt, a diſreputable Eccleſiaſtic, a drunken Barber, or a Multitude of ſuch other worthleſs People, advertiſe that they mount, ſet and fit up all Kinds of Jewels and Trinkets in Perfection; if any of theſe are not known; if no Perſon in the Place has ever ſeen any of their Work; or if they cannot produce authentic Teſtimonials of their Honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their Ability in their Buſineſs, not a ſingle Individual will truſt them with two Pennyworth of falſe Stones to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in ſhort they muſt be famiſhed. But if, inſtead of profeſſing themſelves Jewellers, they poſt themſelves up as Phyſicians, the Croud purchaſe, at a high Rate, the Pleaſure of truſting them with the Care of their Lives, the remaining Part of which they rarely fail to empoiſon.</p>
               <p>§ 569. The moſt genuine and excellent Phyſicians, thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Men, who, born with the happieſt Talents, began to inform their Underſtandings from their earlieſt Youth; who have afterwards carefully qualified themſelves by cultivating every Branch of Phyſic; who have ſacrificed the beſt and moſt pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Days of their Lives, to a regular and aſſiduous Inveſtigation of the human Body; of its various Functions; of the Cauſes that may impair or embarraſs them, and informed themſelves of the Qualities and Virtues of every ſimple and compound Medicine; who have ſurmounted the Difficulty and Loathſomneſs of living in Hoſpitals among thouſands of Patients; and who have added the medical Obſervations of all Ages and Places to their own; theſe few and extraordinary Men, I ſay, ſtill conſider themſelves as ſhort of that perfect Ability and conſummate Knowledge, which they contemplate and wiſh for, as neceſſary to guarding the precious <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of human Life and Health, confided to their Charge. Nevertheleſs, we ſee the ſame ineſtimable Treaſures, intruſted to groſs and ſtupid Men, born without Talents; brought up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Education or Culture; who frequently can ſcarcely read; who are as profoundly ignorant of every Subject that has any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Phyſic, as the Savages of <hi>Aſia</hi>; who awake only to drink away; who often exerciſe their horrid Trade merely to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſtrong Liquor, and execute it chiefly when they are drunk: who, in ſhort, became Phyſicians, only from their Incapacity to arrive at any Trade or Attainment! Certainly ſuch a Conduct, in Creatures of the human Species, muſt appear very aſtoniſhing,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:012243_0303_0F8A6D13D437E740"/>
and even melancholly, to every ſenſible thinking Man; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the higheſt Degree of Abſurdity and Extravagance.</p>
               <p>Should any Perſon duly qualified enter into an Examination of the Medicines they uſe, and compare them with the Situation and Symptoms of the Patients to whom they give them, he muſt be ſtruck with Horror; and heartily deplore the Fate of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Part of the human Race, whoſe Lives, ſo important to the Community are committed to the Charge of the moſt murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Set of Beings.</p>
               <p>§ 570. Some of theſe Caitiffs however, apprehending the Force and Danger of that Objection, founded on their Want of Study and Education, have endeavoured to elude it, by infuſing and ſpreading a falſe, and indeed, an impudent impious Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, which prevails too much at preſent; and this is, that their Talents for Phyſic are a ſupernatural Gift, and, of Courſe, greatly ſuperior to all human Knowledge, it were going out of my Province to expatiate on the Indecency, the Sin, and the Irreligion of ſuch Knavery, and incroaching upon the Rights and perhaps the Duty of the Clergy; but I intreat the Liberty of obſerving to this reſpectable Order of Men, that this Superſtition, which is attended with dreadful Conſequences, ſeems to call for their utmoſt Attention: and in general the Expulſion of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the more to be wiſhed, as a Mind, imbued with falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, is leſs adapted to imbibe a true and valuable Doctrine. There are ſome very callous hardened Villains among this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Band, who, with a view to eſtabliſh their Influence and Revenue as well upon Fear as upon Hope, have horridly ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to incline the Populace to doubt, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their boaſted Gift and Power from Heaven or from Hell! And yet theſe are the Men who are truſted with the Health and Lives of many others.</p>
               <p>§ 571. One Fact which I have already mentioned, and which it ſeems impoſſible to account for is, that great Earneſtneſs of the Peaſant to procure the beſt Aſſiſtance he can for his ſick Cattle. At whatever Diſtance the Farrier lives, or ſome Perſon who is ſuppoſed qualified to be one (for unfortunately there is not one in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi>) if he has conſiderable Reputation in this way, the Country-man goes to conſult him, or purchaſes his Viſit at any Price. However expenſive the Medicines are, which the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctor directs, if they are accounted the beſt, he procures them for his poor Beaſt. But if himſelf, his Wife or Children fall ſick, he either calls in no Aſſiſtance nor Medicines; or contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch as are next at hand, however pernicious they may be, though nothing the Cheaper on that Account; for certainly the Money, extorted by ſome of theſe phyſical Conjurers from their Patients, but oftner from their Heirs, is a very ſhameful Injuſtice, and calls loudly for Reformation.</p>
               <p>§ 572. In an excellent Memoir or Tract, which will ſhortly be publiſhed on the Population of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> we ſhall find an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:012243_0304_0F8A6D1463E86DB8"/>
and very affecting Remark, which ſtrictly demonſtrates the Havock made by theſe immedical Magicians or Conjurers; and which is this: That in the common Courſe of Years, the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Numbers and Deaths of the Inhabitants of any one Place, is not extremely different in City and Country: but when the very ſame epidemical Diſeaſe attacks the City and the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, the Difference is enormous; and the Number of Deaths of the Inhabitants of the Villages, where the Conjurer exerciſes his bloody Dominion, is found, upon Compariſon, greatly more than the Deaths in the City.</p>
               <p>I find in the ſecond Volume of the Memoirs of the oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Society of <hi>Berne,</hi> for the Year 1762, another Fact equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, which is related by one of the moſt intelligent and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Obſervers, concerned in that Work, "Pleureſies and Peripneumonies (he ſays) prevailed at <hi>Cottens a la Côte</hi>; and ſome Peaſants died under them, who had conſulted the Conjurers, and taken their heating Medicines; while of thoſe, who purſued a directly oppoſite Method, almoſt every one recovered."</p>
               <p>§ 573. But I ſhall employ myſelf no longer on this Topic, on which the Love of my Species alone has prompted me to ſay thus much; though it deſerves to be conſidered more in Detail, and is, in Reality, of the greateſt Conſequence. None, methinks, could make themſelves eaſy with reſpect to it ſo much as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, if they were conducted only by lucrative Views; ſince theſe Conjurers diminiſh the Number of thoſe poor People, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſult the real Phyſicians, and with ſome Care and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but without the leaſt Profit, to thoſe Gentlemen. But what good Phyſician is mean and vile enough to purchaſe a few Hours of Eaſe and Tranqillity at ſo high, ſo very odious a Price?</p>
               <p>§ 574. Having thus clearly ſhewn the Evils attending this cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nuiſance, I wiſh I were able to preſcribe an effectual Remedy againſt it, which I acknowledge it is far from being eaſy to do.</p>
               <p>The firſt neceſſary Point probably was, to publiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the great and public Danger, and to diſpoſe the State to employ their Attention on this fatal, this mortal Abuſe; which, joined to the other Cauſes of Depopulation, has a manife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to render <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> a Deſart.</p>
               <p>§ 575. The ſecond, and doubtleſs the moſt effectual Means, which I have already mentioned is, not to admit any travelling Mountebank to enter this Country; and to ſet a Mark on all the Conjurers: It may probably alſo be found convenient, to inflict corporal Puniſhment on them; as it has been already adjudged in different Countries by ſovereign Edicts. At the very leaſt they ſhould be marked with public Infamy, according to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtom practiſed in a great City in <hi>France.</hi> "When any Mountebanks appeared in <hi>Montpelier,</hi> the Magiſtrates had a Power to mount each of them upon a meagre miſerable Aſs, with his Head to the Aſs's Tail. In this Condition they were led through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole City, attended with the Shouts and Hooting of the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:012243_0305_0F8A6D1746A752C8"/>
Children and the Mob, beating them, throwing Filth and Ordure at them, reviling them, and dragging them all about."</p>
               <p>§ 576. A third conducive Means would be the Inſtructions and Admonitions of the Clergy on this Subject, to the Peaſants in their ſeveral Pariſhes. For this Conduct of the common People, amounting, in Effect, to Suicide, to Self-murder, it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to convince them of it. But the little Efficacy of the ſtrongeſt and repeated Exhortations on ſo many other Articles, may cauſe us to entertain a very reaſonable Doubt of their Succeſs on this. Cuſtom ſeems to have determined, that there is nothing in our Day, which excludes a Perſon from the Title and Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an honeſt or honourable Man, except it be meer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed Theft; and that for this ſimple and obvious Reaſon, that we attach ourſelves more ſtrongly to our Property, than to any thing elſe. Even Homicide is eſteemed and reputed honourable in many Caſes. Can we reaſonably expect then to convince the Multitude, that it is criminal to confide the Care of their Health to theſe Poiſoners, in Hopes of a Cure of their Diſorders? A much likelier Method of ſucceeding on this Point would certainly be, to convince the deluded People, that it will coſt them leſs to be honeſtly and judiciouſly treated, than to ſuffer under the Hands of theſe Executioners. The Expectation of a good and cheap Health-market will be apt to influence them more, than their Dread of a Crime would.</p>
               <p>§ 577. A fourth Means of removing or reſtraining this Nuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would be to expunge, from the Almanacs, all the aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rules relating to Phyſic; as they continually conduce to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and increaſe ſome dangerous Prejudices and Notions in a Science, the ſmalleſt Errors in which are ſometimes fatal. I had already reflected on the Multitude of Peaſants that have been loſt, from poſtponing, or miſtiming a Bleeding; only becauſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Deciſion of an Almanac had directed it at ſome other Time. May it not alſo be dreaded, to mention it by the way, that the ſame Cauſe, the Almanacs, may prove injurious to their rural Oeconomy and Management; and that by adviſing with the Moon, which has no Influence, and is of no Conſequence in Vegetation or other Country Buſineſs, they may be wanting in a due Attention to ſuch other Circumſtances and Regulations, as are of real Importance in them.</p>
               <p>§ 578. A fifth concurring Remedy againſt this popular Evil would be the Eſtabliſhment of Hoſpitals, for the Reception of poor Patients, in the different Cities and Towns of <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There may be a great many eaſy and concurring Means of erecting and endo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="286" facs="unknown:012243_0306_0F8A6D17DF367698"/>
Benefit to the Community, than any other Application of Money could produce. We muſt either admit, that the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the Body of the People is uſeleſs to the State, or agree, that Care ſhould be taken to preſerve and continue them, A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpectable <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who, after a previous and thorough Conſideration of this ſubject, had applied himſelf very aſſiduouſly and uſefully on the Means of increaſing the Riches and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his Countrymen, complains, that in <hi>England,</hi> the very Country in which there are the moſt Hoſpitals, the Poor who are ſick are not ſufficiently aſſiſted. What a deplorable Deficience of the neceſſary Aſſiſtance for ſuch muſt then be in a Country, that is not provided with a ſingle Hoſpital? That Aid from Surgery and Phyſic, which abounds in Cities, is not ſufficiently diffuſed into Country Places; and the Peaſants are liable to ſome ſimple and moderate Diſeaſes, which, for want of proper Care, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into a State of Infirmity, that ſinks them into premature Death.</p>
               <p>§ 579. In fine, if it be found impoſſible to extinguiſh theſe Abuſes (for thoſe ariſing from Quacks are not the only ones, nor is that Title applied to as many as really deſerves it) beyond all Doubt it would be for the Benefit and Safety of the Public, upon the whole, entirely to prohibit the Art, the Practice of Phyſic it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

Another Abuſe, leſs fatal indeed than thoſe already mentioned (but which, however, has real ill Conſequences, and at the beſt, carries out a great deal of Money from us, though leſs at the Expence of the common People, than of thoſe in eaſy Circumſtances) is that Blindneſs and Facility, with which many ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed upon, by the pompous Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome <hi>Catholicon,</hi> ſome univerſal Remedy, which they purchaſe at a high Rate, from ſome foreign Pretender to a mighty Secret or <hi>Noſtrum.</hi> Perſons of a Claſs or two above the Populace do not care to run after a Mountebank, from ſuppoſing they ſhould depretiate themſelves by mixing with the Herd. Yet if that very Quack, inſtead of coming among us, were to reſide in ſome foreign City; if, inſtead of poſting up his lying Puffs and Pretenſions at the Corners of the Streets, he would get them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Gazettes, and News-papers; if, inſtead of ſelling his boaſted Remedies in Perſon, he ſhould eſtabliſh Shops or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for that Purpoſe in every City; and finally, if inſtead of ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them twenty times above their real Value, he would ſtill dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Price; inſtead of having the common People for his Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers, he would take in the wealthy Citizen, Perſons of all Rank, and from almoſt every Country. For ſtrange as it ſeems it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a Perſon of ſuch a Condition, who is ſenſible in every other reſpect; and who will ſcruple to confide his Health to the Conduct of ſuch Phyſicians as would be the juſteſt objects of his Confidence, will venture to take, through a very unaccountable Infatuation, the moſt dangerous Medicine, upon the Credit of an impoſing Advertiſement, publiſhed by as worthleſs and ignorant a Fellow as the Mountebank whom he deſpiſes, becauſe the latter blows a Horn under his Window; and yet who differs from the former in no other reſpects except thoſe I have juſt pointed out.</p>

Scarcely a Year paſſes, without one or another ſuch advertiſed and vaunted Medicine's getting into high Credit; the Ravages of which are more or leſs, in Proportion to its being more or leſs in Vogue. Fortunately, for the human Species, but few of theſe <hi>Noſtrums</hi> have attained an equal Reputation with <hi>Ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haud</hi>'s Powders, an Inhabitant of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and unworthy the Name of a Phyſician; who has over-run <hi>Europe</hi> for ſome Years with a violent Purge, the Remembrance of which will not be effaced before the Extinction of all its Victims.

where they have been introduced, the Size and the Contents of the Volume would make a very terrible one.</p>
               <p>§ 582. It is ſome Comfort, however, that all the other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines thus puffed and vended have not been altogether ſo faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor yet quite ſo dangerous: but all poſted and advertiſed Medicines ſhould be judged of upon this Principle (and I do not know a more infallible one in Phyſics, nor in the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic) that whoever advertiſes any Medicince, as a univerſal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for all Diſeaſes, is an abſolute Impoſtor, ſuch a Remedy being impoſſible and contradictory. I ſhall not here offer to detail ſuch Proofs as may be given of the Verity of this Propoſition: but I freely appeal for it to every ſenſible Man, who will reflect a little on the different Cauſes of Diſeaſes; on the Oppoſition of theſe Cauſes; and on the Abſurdity of attempting to oppoſe ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſes, and their Cauſes, by one and the ſame Remedy.</p>
               <p>As many as ſhall ſettle their Judgments properly on this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will never be impoſed upon, by the ſuperficial Gloſs of thoſe Sophiſms contrived to prove, that all Diſeaſes proceed from one Cauſe; and that this Cauſe is ſo very tractable, as to yield to one boaſted Remedy. They will perceive at once, that ſuch an Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be founded in the utmoſt Knavery or Ignorance; and they will readily diſcover where the Fallacy lies. Can any one expect to cure a Dropſy, which ariſes from too great a Laxity of the Fibres, and too great an Attenuation or Thinneſs of the Blood, by the ſame Medicines that are uſed to cure an inflammatory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, in which the Fibres are too ſtiff and tenſe, and the Blood too thick and denſe? Yet conſult the News-papers and the Poſts, and you will ſee publiſhed in and on all of them, Virtues juſt as contradictory; and certainly the Authors of ſuch poiſonous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions ought to be legally puniſhed for them.</p>
               <p>§ 583. I heartily wiſh the Public would attend here to a very natural and obvious Reflection. I have treated in this Book but of a ſmall Number of Diſeaſes, moſt of them acute ones: and I am poſitive that no competent well qualified Phyſician has ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed fewer Medicines, in the Treatment of the Deſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nevertheleſs I have preſcribed ſeventy-one, and I do not ſee which of them I could retrench, or diſpenſe with the Want of, if I were obliged to uſe one leſs. Can it be ſuppoſed then, that any one ſingle Medicine, compounded or ſimple, ſhall cure thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times as many Diſeaſes as thoſe I have treated of?</p>
               <p>§ 584. I ſhall add another very important Obſervation, which doubtleſs may have occured to many of my Readers; and it is this, that the different Cauſes of Diſeaſes, their different Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Differences which ariſe from the neceſſary Alterations that happen throughout their Progreſs and Duration; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of which they are ſuſceptible; the Varieties which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the State of different Epidemics, of Seaſons, of Sexes, and of many other Circumſtances; that theſe Diverſitieſ, I ſay, oblige us very often to vary and change the Medicines; which
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:012243_0309_0F8A6D1B07AB5930"/>
proves how very tickliſh and dangerous it is to have them directed by Perſons, who have ſuch an imperfect Knowledge of them, as thoſe who are not Phyſicians muſt be ſuppoſed to have. And the Circumſpection to be uſed in ſuch Caſes ought to be proportioned to the Intereſt the Aſſiſtant takes in the Preſervation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; and that Love of his Neighbour with which he is animated.</p>
               <p>§ 585. Muſt not the ſame Arguments and Reflections unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuggeſt the Neceſſity of an entire Tractibility on the Part of the Patient, and of his Friends and Aſſiſtants? The Hiſtory of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which have their ſtated times of Beginning, of manifeſting and diſplaying themſelves; of arriving at, and continuing in their Height, and of decreaſing; do not all theſe demonſtrate the Neceſſity of continuing the ſame Medicines, as long as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Diſtemper is the ſame; and the Danger of changing them often, only becauſe what has been given has not afforded immediate Relief? Nothing can injure the Patient more than this Inſtability and Caprice. After the Indication which his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuggeſts, appears to be well deduced, the Medicine muſt be choſen that is likelieſt to reſiſt the Cauſe of it; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as long as no new Symptom or Circumſtance ſupervenes, which requires an Alteration of it; except it ſhould be evident, that an Error has been incurred in giving it. But to conclude that a Medicine is uſeleſs or inſignificant, becauſe it does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or abate the Diſtemper as ſpeedily, as the Impatience of the Sick would naturally deſire it; and to change it for another, is as unreaſonable, as it would be for a Man to break his Watch becauſe the Hand takes twelve Hours to make a Revolution round the Dial-plate.</p>
               <p>§ 586. Phyſicians have ſome Regard to the State of the Urine of ſick Perſons, eſpecially in inflammatory Fevers; as the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions occurring in it help them to judge of the Changes that may have been made in the Character and Conſiſtence of the Humours in the Maſs of Blood; and thence may conduce to determine the Time, in which it will be proper to diſpoſe them to ſome Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But is is groſs Ignorance to imagine, and utter Knavery and Impoſture to perſuade the Sick, that the meer Inſpection of their Urine <hi>ſolely</hi> ſufficiently enables others to judge of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and to direct the beſt Remedies for it. This Inſpection of the Urine can only be of Uſe when it is duly inſpected; when we conſider at the ſame Time the exact State, and the very Looks of the Patient; when theſe are compared with the Degree of the Symptoms of the Malady; with the other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations; and when the Phyſician is ſtrictly informed of all external Circumſtances, which may be conſidered as foreign to the Malady; which may alter or affect the Evacuations, ſuch as particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Food, particular Drinks, different Medicines, or the very Quantity of Drink. Where a Perſon is not furniſhed with an exact Account of theſe Circumſtances, the merr Inſpection of the Urine is of no Service, it ſuggeſts no Indication, nor any Expedient; and
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:012243_0310_0F8A6D1BD42420C0"/>
meer common Senſe ſufficiently proves, and it may be boldly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whoever orders any Medicine, without any other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Diſeaſe, than what an Inſpection of the Urine affords, is a rank Knave, and the Patient who takes them is a Dupe.</p>
               <p>§ 587. And here now any Reader may very naturally aſk, Whence can ſuch a ridiculous Credulity proceed, upon a Subject ſo eſſentially intereſting to us as our own Health?</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to this it ſhould be obſerved, that ſome Sources, ſome Cauſes of it ſeem appropriated meerly to the People, the Multitude. The firſt of theſe is, the mechanical Impreſſion of Parade and Shew upon the Senſes. 2, The Prejudice they have conceived, as I ſaid before, of the Conjurers curing by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Gift. 3, The Notion the Country People entertain, that their Diſtemper and Diſorders are of a Character and Species pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves, and that the Phyſicians, attending the Rich, know nothing concerning them. 4, The general Miſtake that their employing the Conjurer is much cheaper. 5, Perhaps a ſheepiſh ſhame-faced Timidity may be one Motive, at leaſt with ſome of them. 6, A Kind of Fear too, that Phyſicians will conſider their Caſes with leſs Care and Concern, and be likely to treat them more cavalierly; a Fear which increaſes that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the Peaſant, and which indeed every Man has in his Equal, being founded in Equality itſelf. And 7, The Diſcourſe and Converſation of ſuch illiterate Empirics being more to their Taſt, and more adapted to their Apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>But it is leſs eaſy to account for this blind Confidence, which Perſons of a ſuperior Claſs (whoſe Education being conſidered as much better are regarded as better Reaſoners) repoſe in theſe boaſted Remedies; and even for ſome Conjurer in Vogue. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs even ſome of their Motives may be probably aſſigned.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that great Principle of <hi>Seity</hi> or <hi>Selfneſs,</hi> as it may be called, innate to Man, which attaching him to the Prolongation of his own Exiſtence, more than to any other thing in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, keeps his Eyes, his utmoſt Attention, continually fixed upon this Object; and compels him to make it the very Point, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all his Advances and Proceedings; notwithſtanding it does not permit him to diſtinguiſh the ſafeſt Paths to it from the dangerous ones. This is the ſureſt and ſhorteſt Way, ſays ſome Collector at the Turnpike, he pays, paſſes, and periſhes from the Precipices that occur in his Route.</p>
               <p>This very Principle is the Source of another Error, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in repoſing, involuntarily, a greater Degree of Confidence in thoſe, who flatter and fall in the moſt with us in our favourite Opinions. The well appriſed Phyſician, who foreſees the Length and the Danger of a Diſeaſe; and who is a Man of too much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to affirm what he does not think, muſt, from a neceſſary Conſtruction of the human Frame and Mind, be liſtened to leſs favourably, than he who flatters us by ſaying what we wiſh. We endeavour to elongate, to abſent ourſelves, from the Sentiments,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:012243_0311_0F8A6D1EC7CBC210"/>
the Judgment of the firſt; we ſmile, from Self-complacency, at thoſe of the laſt, which in a very little time are ſure of obtaining our Preference.</p>
               <p>A third Cauſe, which reſults from the ſame Principle is, that we give ourſelves up the moſt readily to his Conduct, whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſeems the leaſt diſagreeable, and flatters our Inclinations the moſt. The Phyſician who enjoins a ſtrict Regimen; who inſiſts upon ſome Reſtraints and Self-denials; who intimates the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Time and Patience for the Accompliſhment of the Cure, and who expects a thorough Regulation through the Courſe of it, diſguſts a Patient who has been accuſtomed to indulge his own Taſt and Humour; the Quack, who never heſitates at complying with it, charms him. The Idea of a long and ſomewhat diſtant Cure, to be obtained at the End of an unpleaſant and unrelaxing Regimen, ſuppoſes a very perilous Diſeaſe: this Idea diſpoſes the Patient to Diſguſt and Melancholy, he cannot ſubmit to it without Pain; and he embraces, almoſt unconſciouſly, meerly to avoid this, an oppoſite Syſtem which preſents him only with the Idea of ſuch a Diſtemper, as will give way to a few Doſes of Simples.</p>
               <p>That Propenſity to the New and Marvellous, which tyrannizes over ſo large a Proportion of our Species, and which has advanced ſo many abſurd Perſons and Things into Reputation, is a fourth and very powerful Motive. An irkſome Satiety, and a Tireſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it were, from the ſame Objects, is what our Nature is apt to be very apprehenſive of; though we are inceſſantly conducted towards it, by a Perception of ſome Void, ſome Emptineſs in ourſelves, and even in Society too: But new and extraordinary Senſations rouſing us from this diſagreeable State, more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than any Thing elſe, we unthinkingly abandon ourſelves to them, without foreſeeing their Conſequences.</p>
               <p>A fifth Cauſe ariſes from ſeven Eighths of Mankind being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by, or following, the other Eighth; and, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Eighth that is ſo very forward to manage them, is the leaſt fit and worthy to do it; whence all muſt go amiſs, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and embarraſſing Conſequences enſue from the Condition of Society. A Man of excellent Senſe frequently ſees only through the Eyes of a Fool, of an intriguing Fellow, or of a Cheat; in this he judges wrong, and his Conduct muſt be ſo too. A Man of real Merit cannot connect himſelf with thoſe who are addicted to cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and yet ſuch are the Perſons, who frequently conduct others.</p>
               <p>Some other Cauſes might be annexed to theſe, but I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only one of them, which I have already hinted, and the Truth of which I am confirmed in from ſeveral Years Experience; which is, that we generally love thoſe who reaſon more abſurdly than ourſelves, better than thoſe who convince us of our own weak Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>I hope the Reflections every Reader will make on theſe Cauſes of our ill Conduct upon this important Head, may contribute to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or diminiſh it; and to deſtroy thoſe Prejudices whoſe fatal Effects we may continually obſerve.</p>

GREAT Conſideration and Experience are neceſſary to form a right Judgment of the State of a Patient, whom the Phyſician has not perſonally ſeen; even though he ſhould receive the beſt Information it is poſſible to give him, at a Diſtance from the Patient. But this Difficulty is greatly augmented, or rather changed into an Impoſſibility, when his Information is not exact and ſufficient.

               <p>For Example, in the Quinſey, the Condition of the Throat muſt be exactly enquired into. In Diſeaſes of the Breaſt, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be given of the Patient's Pains; of his Cough; of the Oppreſſion, and of his Breathing, and Expectoration. I ſhall not enter upon a more particular Detail; common Senſe will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently extend this Plan or Specimen to other Diſeaſes; and though theſe Queſtions may ſeem numerous, it will always be eaſy to write down their Anſwers in as little Room, as the Queſtions take up here.

Form it into Pills weighing two Grains each; adding as much of the Powder of dry Hemlock Leaves, as the Pills will eaſily take up. Begin the Uſe of this Medicine by giving one Pill Night and Morning.

                     <p>Our learned and candid Author has a very long Note in this Place, ſtrongly in Favour of <hi>Storck</hi>'s Extract of Hemlock; in which it is evident he credits the greater Part of the Cures affirmed by Dr. STORCK to have been effected by it. He ſays he made ſome himſelf, out not of the right Hemlock, which we think it very difficult to miſtake, from its peculiar rank fetid Smell, and its purple ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Stalk. After firſt taking this himſelf, he found it mitigated the Pain of Cancers, but did not cure them. But then addreſſing himſelf to Dr. <hi>Storck,</hi> and exactly following his Directions in making it, he took of Dr. <hi>Storck</hi>'s Extract, and of his own, which exactly reſembled each other, to the Quantity of a Drachm and a half daily; and finding his Health not in the leaſt impaired by it; he then gave it to ſeveral Patients, curing many ſcrophulous and cancerous Caſes, and mitigating others, which he ſuppoſes were incurable. So that he ſeems ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded Dr. STORCK's Extract is always innocent [which in fact, except in a very few Inſtances, none of which were fatal, it has been with us] and he thinks it a Specific in many Caſes, to which nothing can be ſubſtituted as an equivalent Remedy; that it ſhould he taken with entire Confidence, and that it would be abſurd to neglect its Continuance.</p>
                     <p>The Tranſlator of this Work of Dr. TISSOT's has thought it but fair to give all the Force of this Note here, which muſt be his own, as his Editor at <hi>Lyons</hi> ſeems to entertain a very different Opinion of the Efficacy of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; for which Opinion we refer back to his Note, § 375, of this Treatiſe, which the Reader may compare with this of our Author's. <hi>K.</hi>

               <p>No. 58. Take of the Roots of Graſs and of Succory well waſhed, each one Ounce. Boil them a Quarter of an Hour in a Pint of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then diſſolve in it half an Ounce of Sedlitz, or of <hi>Epſom</hi> Salt, and two Ounces of Manna; and ſtrain it off to drink one Glaſs of it from half Hour to half Hour, till its Effects are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.

               <p>No. 59. Is a Cataplaſm or Pultice made of Crumb of Bread, with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile Flowers boiled in Milk, and the Addition of ſome Soap, ſo that each Pultice may contain half a Quarter of an Ounce of this laſt Ingredient. And when the Circumſtances of female Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have not afforded them that regular Attendance, which the Repetition of the Pultice requires, as it ſhould be renewed every three Hours, I have ſucceſsfully directed the Hemlock Plaiſter of the Shops.</p>
               <p>No. 60. Take a ſufficient Quantity of dry Hemlock Leaves: Secure them properly between two Pieces of thin Linen Cloth, ſo as to make a very flexible Sort of ſmall Matraſs, letting it boil few Moments in Water, then ſqueeze it out and apply it to the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part. It muſt thus be moiſtened and heated afreſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied every two Hours.</p>
               <p>No. 61. Take of the Eyes of the Craw-fiſh, or of the true white Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, two Drachms; of Cinnamon powdered four Grains. Rub them very well together, and divide the whole into eight Doſes. One of theſe is to be given in a Spoonful of Milk, or of Water, before the Infant ſucks.</p>
               <p>No. 62. Take of an Extract of Walnuts, made in Water, two Drachms; and diſſolve it in half an Ounce of Cinnamon Water. Fifty Drops a Day of this Solution is to be given to a Child of two Years old: and after the whole has been taken, the Child ſhould be purged. This Extract is to be made of the unripe Nuts, when they are of a proper Growth and Conſiſtence for pickling.</p>
               <p>No. 63. Take of Rezin of Jalap two Grains, Rub it a conſiderable time with twelve or fifteen Grains of Sugar, and afterwards with three or four ſweet Almonds; adding, very gradually, two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Spoonfuls of Water. Then drain it through clear thin Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen as the Emulſion of Almonds was ordered to be. Laſtly, add a Tea Spoonful of Syrup of Capillaire to it. This is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Draught, and may be given to a Child of two Years old: and if they are older, a Grain or two more of the Rezin may be allowed. But under two Years old, it is prudent to purge Children rather with Syrup of Succory, or with Manna.</p>

Dip in this Slips of Linen Cloth not worn too thin, and let them dry: or ſpread it thin and evenly over them.</p>
               <p>No. 66. Take of Oil of Roſes one Pound; of red Lead half a Pound; of Vinegar four Ounces.

Remove it then from the Fire, and ſpread it on Sheets or Slips of Paper, of what Size you think moſt convenient. The Ointment of <hi>Chambauderie,</hi> ſo famous in many Families on the Continent, is made of a Quarter of a Pound of yellow Wax, of the Plaiſter of three Ingredients (very nearly the ſame with No. 66) of compound Diachylon, and of common Oil, of each the ſame Quantity, all melted together, and then ſtirred about well, after it is removed from the Fire, till it grows cold. To make a Sparadrap, or Oil-cloth (which is Linen, covered with, or dipt in an emplaſtic Subſtance or Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) it muſt be melted over again with the Addition of a little Oil, and applied to the Linen as directed at No. 65.</p>

It is to be beat well with a Hammer, till it becomes ſoft and very pliable. This is the only Preparation it requires, and a Slice of it of a proper Size is to be applied directly over the burſting, open Blood-veſſels. It conſtringes and brings them cloſe together; ſtops the Bleedings; and generally falls off at the End of two Days. 3. The third Part, adherring to the ſecond, may ſerve to ſtop the Bleeding from the ſmaller Veſſels; and the fourth and laſt Part may be reduced to Powder, as conducing to the ſame Purpoſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Our Author atteſts his ſeeing the happieſt Conſequences from this Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which M.
