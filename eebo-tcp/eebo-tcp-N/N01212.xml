            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When Rational Men conſidered the marvellous Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, the Exquiſite Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, and Order of the whole Frame of Nature, and how the Diſcordant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements are tuned to an Harmonious Conſent, and what a Line of Goodneſs, Uſefulneſs, and mutual Reſpect runs thro' the Univerſe of Beings; And that all this could not come to paſs by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Concourſe of Atomes, nor be produced by it ſelf, nor have been from Eternity; For Men could not beget Men from Eternity; there muſt needs be a going back to ſome Firſt Man, who could not beget himſelf; And if Arts had been advancing in Infinite A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before us, the Exquiſitely Rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of theſe Latter Days would have been made long before; And the Short Hyſtory we have of the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records of the World is utterly inconſiſtent with the Suppoſition of the

Precedaneous Eternity of the World: I ſay when Rational Men conſidered theſe things, they could not but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is a Being of Supream Wiſdom and Power and Goodneſs, the Creator and Governour of the World, which is GOD; for the Glory of the Work ſhewed them the Super-eminent Glory of the Artificer, as you find it in the Verſe before the Text. Thus they were Endowed with the Knowledge of GOD; and conſequently of their Duty, wherein they reaſonably ſtood Bound to their Creator.</p>

Evil is the contrary of Good. Good is that which is agreeable to Mans Primitive Conſtitution, when he was made after the Image of the Glorious GOD, the Infinite GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS. This Good, in our Text is called the Glorifying of GOD as GOD. To Glorify GOD is not to add Splendor &amp; Excellency to Him; for who can add to what is Infinite? But to let the Divine

So that all other Evils are but Pictures of Evil (or as Shadows that follow the Subſtance) in Compariſon of This Evil, that alienates Men from the Life of GOD, &amp; from the GOD, in whom Life is bound up. <hi>The Worſt Evil,</hi> becauſe tis the Prime, Abſolute, Superlative Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Irreconcileable Hatred of GOD, an Evil the whole Nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is wholly Evil, &amp; can never be made Good; whence it is Emphatically called,

Yea, tis ſuch an Evil as all the Good that men can do on Earth can't make Reparation of, or Atonement for; and as all the Judgments &amp; Torments on Sinners in Earth &amp; in Hell can't poſſibly make any Satisfaction for, or Expiation of. Tis Therefore ſurely a very Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Evil; and the Worſt Kind of Evil.</p>
            <p n="3">III. FOR Men to Run directly againſt Their Light &amp; Knowledge to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of this Evil of Sin, is in it ſelf a Woful Crime; Which being Added to the Evil that is Committed, doth greatly Increaſe &amp; Multiply Guilt, &amp; Debars the Sinner from Excuſe. As there are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Torment in Hell, &amp; 'twill be more Tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> than for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi> ſo there are Degrees of Guilt &amp; Heinouſneſs in Sins, tho' the Leaſt Sin deſerves Everlaſting Puniſhment. Tho' all Guilt is extreamly to be Trembled at, yet
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001450_0014_0FB2F3DA30CDB2B8"/>
eſpecially the Guilt of Sins againſt Light.</p>
            <p>To Demonſtrate that Sins againſt Knowledge are Much Viler and More Heinous than Sins of Unavoidable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and more Inexcuſable, We will offer theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> THAT Sin that is Choſen &amp; Loved and Acted, As it is Sin, as it is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Gods</hi> Law, &amp; is Preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Will of GOD carries a greater heinouſneſs, than that ſinful Action that is not Acted, <hi>Eo Nomine,</hi> as it is Sinful; becauſe the Sinfulneſs of it is not known when tis committed; To fight againſt GOD and His Law Directly, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch a Thing as Forbidden of God, and yet to Chuſe it, and therein to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a mans own wiſdom before GOD's Wiſdom, and a mans own will and luſt before GOD's Will, &amp; a mans own Self-love before GOD's Love to Him; to do this Deliberately &amp; Reſolvedly, is more contrary to the Glorifying of GOD as GOD than to do an ill thing indirectly and indeliberately, and therefore it is the more Heinous; now the Ignorant ſinner doth this or that, which he reckons
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001450_0015_0FB2F3DCF9A5EB58"/>
may conduce to his Temporal Wealth, Eaſe, or Honour, not knowing that he tranſgreſſeth againſt the Lord; But he that ſins againſt his Light <hi>Knows</hi> that in what he doth, he Tranſgreſſeth and Violateth the Law and Will of GOD, yet being ſwayed by ſome Outward Conſiderations which Preponderate with him, he counts it Good, yea Beſt for him for the time being to Venture to Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; He directly &amp; deliberately chuſeth to Act contrary to GOD in thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Preferring his own wiſdom and will to GOD's Wiſdom &amp; Will; thus he embraceth Sin, as Sin, conſidering it to be forbidden Fruit, which the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Sinner doth not; Therefore the Knowing Sinner is far more Guilty than the Other.</p>
            <p>Sometimes alſo the Vicious Appetite of ſome Wretches makes out after ſome Things, meerly Becauſe GOD has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them; and if the LORD had not forbidden them, They would not have been Deſired at all: But ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately to Love Sin, as Sin, is moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly Heinous &amp; Vile. Such have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001450_0016_0FB2F3E42A99F9B0"/>
no Plea of Ignorance, and Unwitting Miſtake for their EXCUSE, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> THOSE Sins are more Heinous in the ſight of God than others, that have in them a more Powerful Enmity unto GOD, &amp; His Law, &amp; Glory, than others have; Now that ſins againſt Knowledge have ſuch a Powerful Enmity is Evident, foraſmuch as the Inlightned Conſciences of men who commit Them, Interrupt them, Conteſt againſt them, Oppoſe them, Condemn them; Terrible Flames of Light ſtand in their Way; Yet theſe Knowing ſinners Powerfully break thro' all, to Commit ſin; ſo ſtrong and great is their Diſaffection to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; ſo mighty is their Enmity to Holineſs. Their ſin therefore is the more heinous. Moreover, GOD prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally looks at the Heart; and the more of the Heart and Will there is in any Sin, the more heinous is it in the ſight of GOD: The leſs Will the leſs Sin; The more Will the more Sin: Now ſurely there's Abundance of the Heart, Will, &amp; Affections in ſinning when
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001450_0017_0FB2F3E8349420F8"/>
the will to ſin, like a mighty River, riſeth up &amp; breaks over all Banks of Oppoſition; Vanquiſheth the Force of Light, Law, &amp; Conſcience; and carries all before it. Even thus it is when <hi>Men</hi> ſin againſt <hi>their</hi> Knowledge, and therefore their ſin is the more heinous. Such men have no Pleas of Meer Infirmity, and Involuntary Weakneſs for their EXCUSE.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> THE more Ingratitude there is in any Sins, the more Vile and Heinous they are. Every Benefit is a new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; ſo that there is a Baſe Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in Ingratitude; To render Evil for Good is Diabolical, Now the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD &amp; CHRIST, and Divine Things, &amp; the Knowledge of Duty <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſingular Favours and Benefits, Rich Talents and Bleſſings; Men are greatly beholden to Heaven for 'em; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual World and the Souls of Men can no more ſubſiſt without Knowledge, than the Natural &amp; Corporeal World can ſubſiſt without the Light of the Sun: Now Knowledge is given to ſhew men the Strait Way to Life Eternal, and to prevent Tranſgreſſion. Wherefore it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001450_0018_0FB2F3EB2FADB810"/>
is not Good that the Soul be without Knowledge. The moſt Gracious GOD may ſay now to Sinners, 'I put the Bright &amp; Flaming <hi>Sword</hi> into the Hands of your <hi>Conſciences</hi> to keep you from the Broad Way of Iniquity, that leads to Deſtruction, &amp; I gave you the Pillar of Fire, the Manifeſtations of My Glories, to guide you into the Strait Path that leads to Eternal Life; and yet you do wickedly Tranſgreſs; why will you thus Abuſe my Kindneſs? Your Iniquity is Heinous. You cannot ſay, that you had no Means afforded you to Prevent and Reclaim you from ſin; You have no ſuch Plea for your EXCUSE.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> THOSE Sins that make a wider ſeparation from GOD than other ſins do, &amp; that Provoke Fiercer Wrath than other ſins and give more terrible Stabs to mens Conſciences than other ſins do, and make men more Obdurate, &amp; harder to be wrought upon by the Means of Grace than other ſins do, &amp; make mens Caſes more Deſperate, &amp; Irrecoverable than other ſins do, &amp; which if followed in mens Courſe, do Evidence them to be

Chriſtleſs, and Graceleſs, more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins do, and which will coſt a Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer Repentance, if ever men be Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered &amp; Saved, than other ſins are like to do, are doubtleſs more Heinous than other ſins; But ſins againſt Light and Knowledge are thoſe Sins that will ſo do. Therefore they are more Heinous. Sins of Ignorance have leſs of Malignity, &amp; therefore don't Divide mens Souls ſo much and ſo far from GOD, as ſins of Knowledge. To ſin without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unwittingly, doth expoſe and lay open Sinners to far leſs Wrath &amp; Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to ſin with Knowledge, and to ſin againſt Knowledge; Leſs is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and leſs is Threatned, even fewer Stripes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. GOD hath much more to ſay againſt men and to Charge men with (and ſo have their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences alſo) when their Vice &amp; Luſt are too hard for their Light, and when with open Eyes and open Violence they in an hoſtile manner, do break in upon His Declarative Glory, than when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily they happen to interfere &amp; juſtle with it in the Dark, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5.6,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001450_0020_0FB2F3F29E39EE28"/>
7, 23. Verily he that is Born of GOD, that is, a New Creature ſinneth not, ſo as to hold a Courſe of Known Sins, without Repentance. But has in him a Powerful Principle that holds a Courſe of Watchfulneſs &amp; Warfare againſt all Known ſins, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.4, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. No man that has the SPIRIT of CHRIST can make a Trade of Known Sins. In this Regard, Known ſins are more Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and Deadly than ſins of Ignorance and Infirmity, The Latter not being ſo Excluſive of a ſtate of Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as the Former are, if made a Practice. Moreover, By a Courſe of Sinning againſt their Knowledge and Conſciences, men harden <hi>their</hi> Hearts exceedingly and are not eaſily to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. If their Knowledge &amp; Light have not had Power ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and withold them from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, How can we imagine that it ſhould have Ability to Recover 'em to Repentance! If the more Ignorant <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> might have ſuch <hi>Light,</hi> There were greater hopes of their Recovery by it, than of ſuch as have forcibly broke thro'
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001450_0021_0FB2F3F61A0652B0"/>
the oppoſing Dictates of their Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſciences, Having Armed and Strengthned themſelves againſt them, with great Reſolution and Panoply of Sophiſms, wherewith they ſuppreſs their Light and keep it under, leſt it ſhould powerfully affect 'em with its Influences. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. So there was more Hope that the Light of the Day of Chriſt ſhould Recover the Dark ſinners of <hi>Tyre</hi> &amp; <hi>Sidon,</hi> than the ſinners of <hi>Chorazin</hi> &amp; <hi>Bethſaida</hi> that were wonted to, &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Rebellions againſt the Light. Furthermore, For many ſins of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. (And of many Evils that men may have done they may be ignorant as long as they Live; for what man can know and underſtand his own Errors? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19 12) GOD may take up with a General Repentance, of him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in CHRIST JESUS the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; But a General Repentance will not ſuffice for ſins againſt Knowledge, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.5. So that ſinners againſt light &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge make ſad work for a bitter &amp; very Particular and Manifold Repentance. Tis handed down to us from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001450_0022_0FB2F3F7E2C7C730"/>
that after <hi>Peter</hi> had Denied his LORD againſt his <hi>Light,</hi> he could never Hear the Cock-crowing, without Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Reflections, as long as he Lived. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, "The <hi>Greater</hi> ſimple <hi>Ignorance</hi> is, the <hi>Leſſer</hi> is the <hi>Sin;</hi> For GOD requires a <hi>Particular</hi> Repentance for Known ſins, but accepts a <hi>General</hi> Repentance for Unknown. And Mr. <hi>Cholmly</hi> ſaith, "Renouncing of Evil is <hi>Virtual</hi> &amp; <hi>Actual: Virtual</hi> Renouncing of Evil is when in a Preparedneſs of Mind, a man is Ready to Renounce it, ſo ſoon as it ſhall appear to him to be Sinful and Damnable; <hi>Actual</hi> Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Evil is when a man doth both in Word and Practice ſeparate himſelf: This <hi>Actual</hi> Renouncing of it <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> to Salvation as ſoon as a man ſhall Know &amp; be Convinced of the Evil; But the <hi>Virtual</hi> is <hi>Sufficient</hi> in Caſe of Non-conviction of the Evil, and Error; and is Included in <hi>General Repentance.</hi> But to Cloſe this <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument, It may be ſufficient to Infer &amp; Aver that men now cannot Plead in EXCUSE for their Committing of <hi>Iniquities</hi> againſt their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001450_0023_0FB2F3FC8069BA68"/>
Light and Knowledge, that thoſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities do not ſtrike 'em off from God in a dreadful manner, or that they do not Provoke His Fiercer Wrath; or that they do not deeply ſtab ther own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; or that they do not wofully Harden them; or that they do not mightily Obſtruct, Prevent and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Efficacy of the Light and Means of Grace for their <hi>Recovery;</hi> or that tis poſſible that men ſhould be in a ſtate of Salvation, Living in an Allowed Courſe of 'em; or that it will not Coſt men a very particular pungent &amp; ſoaking Repentance, if ever they be Saved from them. So that ſins againſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are the more Heinous, Vile, and Inexcuſable ſort of Iniquities.</p>
            <p>BUT we proceed to the <hi>USES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE hence INFER that KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE, (eſpecially) of GOD, of His Alſufficiency and Glories, of our Way to Him by CHRIST JESUS, and of our Duty before Him is an Excellent Thing, a Rich Talent, a Worthy <hi>Divine</hi> Gift; Elſe it were not ſo Heinous &amp; Criminal

Knowledge is a Diſtinguiſhing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, tis not vouchſafed to all Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20. Thoſe that have

more knowledge than others, are more beholden to GOD; they have alſo the more to Anſwer for; where more is given, GOD will require the more, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. Oh! How greatly ſhould we Bleſs GOD for the Holy Scriptures, that are Profitable for Inſtruction, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. And, Oh! how kindly are <hi>They</hi> to be treated, and ſpoken Comfortably unto who Teach the Good Knowledge of the LORD, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.22. And, Oh! how carefully ſhould this Precious Talent of Knowledge be Improved by us?</p>
            <p n="2">II. We HENCE further Infer, that 'twould be a very fooliſh and wicked thing to caſt off <hi>Knowledge,</hi> on account of its being an occaſional Aggravation of mens Sins. Is our Vice and Luſt too hard for our Light &amp; Knowledge, tis a ſign that our Knowledge is too Small, &amp; Feeble, &amp; Unſanctified; and it doth admoniſh us to Labour and Pray for more, and ſtronger, and better Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that may be able to over-power our Corruptions and Luſts: And if any man lack Wiſdom, or Sanctified Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001450_0026_0FB2F404EC26BC00"/>
(and greater Degrees of it,) let him Ask it of GOD, who giveth Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and Upbraideth not, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. If ever we overcome Sin, and eſcape the Pollutions of the World, it muſt be by and thro' the Knowledge of the <hi>Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 19.20 All Treaſures of Wiſdom are ſtored up in CHRIST, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. And exhibited in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and diſpenſed by the HOLY SPIRIT, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.14, 15. If we Periſh for want of 'em, tis our own fault. Surely our Neceſſity ſhould put us upon Diligence and Importunity.</p>
            <p>'Twere an horrible Abuſe of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> to ſay, If Knowing Sinners be the moſt Guilty, then let us know leſs, that we may be leſs Guilty. Verily, When Light may be had, tis an heinous Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to go without it, and it aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates a mans other Tranſgreſſions, which he commits for want of Knowledge, that he was willingly &amp; wilfully Ignorant. Who ſo palpably culpably Blind as he that will not ſee? — Its an Evidence that men do ſuperlatively love their ſins, when they Refuſe, Reject, and ſhut their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001450_0027_0FB2F4094ABDC950"/>
Eyes hard againſt the Light, that might hinder them from committing 'em. This is THE CONDEMNATION that Light is come and men reject it, &amp; love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19 Tho' ſimple unavoidable <hi>Ignorance</hi> Diminiſhes Guilt, yet willing, wilful, affected and obſtinate <hi>Ignorance</hi> doth greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and increaſe it, and render mens ſins moſt Inexcuſable, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.32. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6 So that if men caſt off Knowledge on pretenſe of its Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sin, They will ſave nothing by it; But if they ſhall get greater Degrees &amp; Strength of Sanctify'd Knowledge, twill prevent the Danger of their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their knowledge unto the increaſe of their Guilt &amp; Condemnation. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we then over Erroneous Perſons, and other Tranſgreſſors in this Land of Light; whom it will nothing avail in the Day of Judgment to pretend that they went according to their Light and to their Conſciences, and that they did not know that ſuch Opinions were Errors, and that ſuch Actions were
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001450_0028_0FB2F40B91633F88"/>
Irregular &amp; Naught; ſince they might and ought to have known the ſame, but they had no mind to it, &amp; 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills; They were Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their notions &amp; ways; and could not bear to think of admitting any Light, or Convictions, that might Alter them. Moſt Dreadful is their Danger: The Good LORD Deliver them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Hence we Infer, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Unwilling Ignorance in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and teachable Souls is not ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as that of Knowing Preſumption is, ſince their ſimple Ignorance doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Extenuate their Tranſgreſſions, which they would never have Committed &amp; Continued had they had Knowledge. Their ſins are Sins, and Expoſe them to be beaten with Stripes; <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. And need the Blood of the Great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Expiate them; <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.27, 28 But they are not ſuch great Sins, In Them, being Committed Ignorantly, as they would be in Others that had More Knowledge. Such ſins of Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Ignorance may be found in Gracious and Godly Perſons, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001450_0029_0FB2F40CFAA2A690"/>
themſelves in no known Sins, and would not allow themſelves in theſe if they knew 'em. Doth the Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity allow them to Eſcape with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Repentance, why ſhould Ours Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from our Pity and Prayers and Friendſhip and Fellowſhip, as if they were to be Excluded from Heaven? Surely we ought to have Charity for the Saints of old, that lived in ſinful Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy, not knowing it to be Sinful; as Chriſt had for thoſe who followed Him not, yet were not without ſome true ſparks of Faith and Godlineſs in their Souls, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 9 49.</p>
            <p>The Merciful GOD, may take men to Heaven at laſt; altho' to Chaſtize them for keeping Company with the Erroneous, &amp; for Reading their Books, and Frequenting their Aſſemblies, or for other Faults, and to afflict &amp; puniſh the Church by them, He may Refuſe to Deliver them from ſome of their Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Ignorance and Errors ſo long as they Live. The Sophiſtry of ſome Books may ſo Cloud the Truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant the Unwary &amp; Unskilful Reader,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001450_0030_0FB2F40E659C4BC0"/>
tho' a Pious Perſon, as that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Light of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he may be in a Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in ſome leſſer Points, all his days. But it muſt be thankfully acknowledged as a Choice undeſerved Favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when by the SPIRIT of GOD we are not only Savingly Illuminated in the <hi>Fundamental Truths</hi> and Ways of GOD and of CHRIST, But alſo have Eyes to diſcern and behold the <hi>Other Verities;</hi> ſince elſe tho' we may have Sound Vitals; Yet we may have Feeble Feet, Weak Hands, &amp; Faltering Tongue, little to our own benefit or the Comfort of others. Well, The Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inference beſpeaks our Charity to Erring Saints in the Caſes wherein they are Unwillingly Ignorant, and commit Faults through meer Ignorance; Both doth not Encourage us to follow the Example of their Error. To Swear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a ſin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and Ignorance perhaps in <hi>Joſeph;</hi> but to Swear by the Life of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign would be a ſin of Iniquity in us, for we have More and Greater Light than <hi>Joſeph</hi> then had. Some men follow
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001450_0031_0FB2F413406A3B50"/>
the Erring Examples of the Saints, hoping to 'ſcape as eaſily and well as they did, and ſuppoſe themſelves to have as little Guilt upon them as They had: But lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle do they Conſider that an Evil Act, may be Infirmity in One Man, and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in Another Man: The one ſinning therein, Ignorantly, and the other, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Knowingly and Preſumptouſly; The one, not at all Violating his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Conſcience in the Doing of it; and the other Perſon horribly ſinning againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We hence Infer that the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge of all the Earth is to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all His Judgments upon <hi>New-England.</hi> Our ſins are of a ſcarlet Die and intolerable Heinouſneſs. <hi>New-England</hi> Sinners have known the Way of the Lord, and the Judgments of their GOD; but they have Revolting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Hearts; their Tranſgreſſions are Many, and their Backſlidings Strong; Many of 'em have altogether Broken the Yoke that GOD has put upon 'em, and Burſt the Covenant-Bonds; God's &amp; Theirs; How ſhall the LORD Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

            <p>Had men a right ſenſe of the weight of the Guilt and Heinouſneſs of their ſins againſt Goſpel-Light, (for they weigh very Heavy in the Balances of the Sanctuary) they would Cry out of the ſame as moſt Intolerable; as a Burden too heavy for 'em to Bear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to ſink 'em into the Loweſt Depths of Hell They could not be ſo merry and jolly as they are; nor ſo active &amp; diligent to lay on more weight.</p>
            <p>But Dreadful Plagues are upon ther Hearts, and they are long kept under Judgment, &amp; in Extreameſt Danger of Eternal Deſtruction; Some Hundreds (or may I ſay, Thouſands?) have ſpent the Flower of their Age in ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Knowledge &amp; Conſcience; they have followed after Vanity, regardleſs of inward Religion and of the Fear of the Lord; Many ſweet Influences and Motions of the Bleſſed and Eternal SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT they have put by, and neglected, &amp; Diſobeyed: And now the Preaching of the Word from Year to Year operates
