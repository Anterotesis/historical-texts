            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>She was one, who in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the uſual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and ſtudiouſly inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly beſtowed upon our Sex; in which ſhe became ſo good a Proficient, that ſhe well underſtood the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> fluently diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it; and made a conſiderable Progreſs in <hi>Greek</hi> alſo; wrote ſeveral Hands well; was a good <hi>Arithmetician,</hi>

<pb facs="unknown:003191_0005_0FF0168C1FAFCD18"/>which ſhe would often ſpeak: Admiring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able and delighting: For ſhe was of a thoughtful compoſed Temper, yet of a quick Apprehenſion, and ingenious; which, being ſeaſoned with Truth, (in which ſhe had many ſweet Openings) theſe meeting in a Temper converſable, and concerned for the Good of others, made her Converſation Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and deſirable. She was one who loved the Bleſſed Truth (and they who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to it) from a Child, being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced thereof; tho' ſhe was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyed with a bare Profeſſion of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in her ſelf and others; alſo furniſhed with good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to defend it, being ready to give an Anſwer to every one that asked <hi>a Reaſon of the Hope which was in her,</hi> with Meekneſs and Fear: Not forward to begin a Diſpute, yet ſound in what the undertook, and never (that I know of) foil'd in an Argument; for ſhe had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0006_0FF0168F65A50DF0"/>that ſhe was in her Place, and called by him to what ſhe did for him: Would often mention the Paſſage of <hi>

            <p>Nor was ſhe proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Modeſty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of her ſelf, than any one elſe had of her, who knew her Qualifications.</p>
            <p>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which ſhe valued for Service more than Sight; and ſlighted in Compariſon of thoſe better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Mind, which ſhe preferr'd above ſplendid or coſtly Apparel.</p>
            <p>She was one who loved to read the Holy Scriptures, and ſuch uſeful Authors, as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which ſhe ſpent much Time: God having furniſhed her with an extraordinary Memory, to retain the ſame.</p>
            <p>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; ſetting apart ſome Time of the Day for Retirement; and would frequently ſay to me, in the Evenings, <hi>Let us go aſide, and wait upon the Lord; we have daily need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it?</hi> and would recite the Paſſage of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings

            <p>Neither did ſhe neglect publick Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to worſhip God; for ſhe was diligent in frequenting religious Meetings, not being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was one who willingly and chearfully ſufferted for the Truth, encomaging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One juſt, honeſt, and true to her Word, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and ſelt-denying; keeping within the Limits preſcribed for Health, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, more than to gratify a luxurious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; ſolid and grave in her Carriage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulneſs; not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auſtere; yet rather reſerved, than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free; baſhful, than bold.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſhe was one whoſe Modeſty, Charity, Friendſhip, and religious Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, came not ſhort of her excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; to which I refer the Reader, for a fuller Character of their Author, than I am capable of giving; her own Pen having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the rich Treaſure of her pious Mind. But what I have written, is from an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I believe, knew her better than my ſelf: For ſhe was as much without Reſerve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another for we loved entirely, communicated ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tho' Verſe is not ſo commonly uſed in Divine Subjects, as Proſe, and but too much abuſed by the extravagant Wits of the Age; yet the, like a skilful Chymiſt, had learned to ſeparate the purer Spirits, and more refined Parts of Poetry, from the earthly, worthleſs Droſs; and made uſe of her Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, rather to convince and prevail upon the Mind, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and raiſe the Soul upon Wings of Divine Contemplation, than to pleaſe the any Fancy with Strains of Wit, and unprofitable Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhe was ever careful to avoid.</p>
            <p>And tho' living Teſtimonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Verſe, which hath an harmonious delighting Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of ſome more than Proſe, eſpecially young People, and is more apt to imprint it felt in the Memory: Therefore, her Subject being divine, and ſo ſenſibly and ſolidly managed; as it hath been of Service to thoſe few who have had the Peruſal of it, ſo, I hope, will be attended with a General Benefit.</p>

            <head>A Teſtimony concerning my dear Friend, <hi>Mary Molineux.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <hi>Mary Molineux,</hi> I have more to teſtify, than I ſhall commit to Writing, having had intimate Acquaintance and Fellowſhip with her above Sixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, vertuous modeſt Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, deſerveth ſingular Remembrance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe and Deportment, was always ſolid ſenſible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and ſympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exerciſes and Afflictions: She was one to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Exerciſes; as I often have done, to my Comfort and Refreſhment. My
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0008_0FF01692AC669F78"/>Heart is moved, in the Remembrance of her Faithfulneſs and Integrity, from the Day that I was firſt acquainted with her, with Sorrow for the Loſs of ſo near a Friend; who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſhe was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and Spiritual, yet I never knew her <hi>lifted up</hi> in any of them, nor <hi>exalted above her Meaſure;</hi> but rather reſerved than in any wiſe forwardly divulging her Gifts to the publick Cenſure, without weighty Conſideration; ſo that ſhe would not caſt her Pearls before Swine: Yet not ſo much reſerved, but that to her near intimate Friends, whom ſhe knew in the Fellowſhip and Bond of Truth, ſhe was very free and tender. I remember, that ſeveral Years ago, when ſhe was a ſingle Woman, upon the Peruſal of ſome Copies of her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſhe gave me, I felt ſuch Unity of Spirit with them, that I ſaid, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in Print; but ſhe was not then free, that her Name ſhould be expoſed; ſhe not ſeeking Praiſe amongſt Men, but to communicate the Exerciſe of peculiar Gifts amongſt her near Friends and Acquaintance: But now, ſince it hath pleaſed the Lord to remove her out of the Earthly Tabernacle, into Everlaſting Reſt, in which, I am well ſatisfied, ſhe is for ever bleſſed, I think it would be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her Memory, and alſo a wronging of
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0009_0FF01695844C5F50"/>others, to keep ſuch worthy Things unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; with which I believe, the moſt that are of open Underſtandings, and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Hearts, will have (in ſome meaſure) U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I deſire and hope, they may truly tend to the Benefit of all moderate Readers, and to the Praiſe of him, who is the only Author of every good and perfect Gift.</p>

In which Impriſonment, I believed that ſhe ſhould be my Wife; but never intended to expreſs any thing thereof, whilſt we were both Priſoners, there; and after ſhe was releaſed, I ſaw her and was in Company with her ſeveral Times, before I expreſſed any thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was above Eleven Years; her Life and
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8"/>Converſation was ſerious, innocent, ſweet and ſavoury; and ſhe was very loving, diligent, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, and kindly affectionate towards me and our Children; and generally loving and tender towards all People, eſpecially ſuch as were in any Diſtreſs, Sickneſs, or Affliction, tho' never ſo poor; and the Lord bleſſed her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as well in Advice, as Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Remedies, to ſeveral; ſo that they have acknowledged their Recoveries to have been thereby, thro' his Bleſſing: And what ſhe did therein, was free. She was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom ſhe was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition ſhe frequently gave, which many received in Love and good Eſteem of her. The Lord opened her Underſtanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon ſeveral Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, ſo as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but, learning of Chriſt the Truth, to be <hi>lowly in Heart,</hi> ſhe choſe rather to appear little to Men. She was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make Peace amongſt them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in ſpeaking to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in ſecret. Her Heart was inclined towards
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8"/>God, therefore ſhe was juſt in her Dealing with all People, with whom ſhe had to do. She was convinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt in her Heart, which ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore (ſhe retaining her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to the End of her Time) a Crown of endleſs Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath beſtowed upon her. She was very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſuffering Perſecution for the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Truth, and in enduring hard Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, occaſioned by my ſeveral Impriſonments for the ſame Cauſe, whilſt ſhe was my Wife. And thro' ſeveral Sickneſſes and Afflictions the Lord ſupported her, to perſevere in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Faithfulneſs, and Conſtancy to him. She was very punctual in Performance of her Undertakings, and quick, diſcreet and diligent in her Buſineſs; yet ſtill ſhe uſed to take a Time for private Retirement in Evenings alone, (except I was with her) to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light, Love and Grace in her Heart; and to ſee that, with the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, ſhe had Oyl in her Burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that ſhe might be ready to enter into the Marriage-Chamber, whenſoever the Lord, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom of her Soul, came. She was alſo very diligent, in attending the Aſſemblies of the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> with
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0011_0FF0169A045B0168"/>them, to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodneſs in her Soul. And that Day-week next before her laſt Illneſs ſeized her (after a more than uſual Manner) ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>That the feeling and enjoying of the ſweet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</hi> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faithful to God, might <hi>come</hi> to <hi>taſte and ſee how good the Lord is;</hi> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings, and Converſation, were acceptable, prevalent and ſerviceable, to the Invitation, Convincement, Strengthning and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome to ſeek after the Lord, and his bleiſed Way and Truth, inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction, and Cauſe of rejoycing. And that many more may receive Benefit by her Writings, I am deſirous and concerned to publiſh them, and refer all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Readers, in the Fear of God, to peruſe them; not doubting but ſuch may receive Advantage thereby; tho' ſhe was not free to commit them to publick View in her Life-Time, yet ſhe had nothing againſt the publiſhing thereof afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003191_0011_0FF0169A045B0168"/>
And now I ſhall give a brief Account of what I was, and am a Witneſs of, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her laſt Illneſs; and ſome of the ſweet, ſenſible and precious Words which ſhe ſpake in the Time thereof, being very ſenſible to the End; ſo that ſhe ſpake no impertinent or unſenſible Word therein, that I know of, who conſtantly attended her.</p>
            <p>Upon the Eighth Day of the 10th Month, 1695. ſhe was ſeized with violent Pain and Sickneſs, which continued, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs: And one Morning, ſoon after, ſhe ſaid to me thus; <hi>I have had ſuch a Dream, as I have ſeldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life;</hi> and then ſhe told it me thus; viz. <hi>She dreamed, that ſhe was going at the Side of a pleaſant broad River, and ſometimes ſhe came to Breaches; which, Brooks running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches ſhe paſſed over, but ſometimes with Difficulty, and then ran faſt on ſtill, till ſhe came to another Breach; and having paſſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Breaches, ſome greater, and ſome leſſer, at laſt ſhe came to a Breach which was greater than any of the reſt, and ſhe ſaid within her ſelf, How ſhall I get over this Breach? But ſhe went on, and paſſed thro' it, and it was fair on the other Side; and ſhe awaked.</hi> Now, as ſhe looked upon this Dream to be an Emblem of her Life, ſo I cannot (nor could not ſince ſhe told it me) expound it otherwiſe than thus; <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8"/>the pleaſant broad River ſignified the Lord her Creator, (who is to his People <hi>a Place of broad Rivers,</hi> Iſa. 31.21.) and the Shore thereof, upon which ſhe walked, ſignified Time, and the Breaches, which ſhe paſſed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which ſhe paſſed thro' in her Time; and the laſt and greateſt Breach, which ſhe came to, and paſſed over, ſignified her laſt Sickneſs and Death. From which Dream (as a ſignificant Parable) all may learn and conſider how faſt they are haſtning or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards their laſt and greateſt Breach; even the Death or Diſſolution of their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacles; and none knoweth how near they are to it. About Nine Days after her ſaid Illneſs began, ſhe ſaid to me thus, viz. <hi>I am well content, if the Lord ſee meet, that he take me away by this Diſtemper, rather to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what is in this World I can deſire, to ſtay to enjoy, except it is my Love, and my little Lads;</hi> meaning me, and our two Children. Of whom ſhe then ſaid thus, <hi>I would rather have my Children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all Manner of Worldly Riches.</hi> About the ſame Time, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am thinking of honeſt</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Johnſon, (who was a near Friend to us) <hi>that ſlept much of the Time of his Illneſs, before his Departure; methinks it ſeemeth like an eaſie Paſſage.</hi> And ſoon after that, ſhe began to
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8"/>be inclind to Sleepineſs, and ſlept more and more, till the End; yet, at her awaking, was ſtill ſenſible and chearful: And tho' ſhe was daily weaker and weaker, yet ſhe would ſtill ſit up five or ſix, or more Hours in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, and diſcourſe freely and chearfully, till within five Days of her Departure. I often deſired her to to accept of the Advice of ſome Phyſitian, but ſhe was ſtill averſe thereto, in this Illneſs, tho' in others ſhe had complied. On the 20th Day of her Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Evening, diſcourſing very freely (as formerly) ſhe told me, <hi>She was well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that if the Lord took her away by that Diſtemper, ſhe ſhould be eternally Happy;</hi> with many other ſenſible and comfortable Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Tho' ſhe was ſo weak, that the ſame Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought ſhe had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, ſhe ſpoke chearfully and ſlept. At her awaking, that Night, I asked her, How ſhe was? She anſwered, <hi>Thro' Mercy, indifferent.</hi> And after a little Pauſe, ſhe very ſenſibly ſaid, <hi>Amictum iri, vet Amiciendum eſſe;</hi> which is in <hi>Engliſh, To be cloathed hereafter,</hi> in two Expreſſions of it: Whereby I underſtood, that ſhe was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how the Lord would cloath her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when her Mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I deſired her in Engliſh Words, (for they that were preſent, underſtood not
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638"/>
               <hi>Latin,</hi>) that if ſhe had any thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing farther to communicate to me, that ſhe would do it; but ſhe, (as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts) quickly replied in <hi>Latin, Why ſpeakeſt thou ſuch Things? Doſt not thou underſtand me?</hi> I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Latin, Yes, I very well underſtand thee, and that thou ſpeakeſt of Spiritual Things:</hi> She anſwered, <hi>Yes, but ſhe had nothing concerning outward Things, farther to communicate to me.</hi> The next Morning, about the Ninth Hour, I again thought ſhe had been departing; but after a little Time, ſomewhat recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Breath, and ſeeing me expreſs, to Friends that were preſent, ſomething or my Concern for her, ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>Ne nimis ſolicitus eſto;</hi> that is, in <hi>Engliſh, Be not thou overmuch careful,</hi> or <hi>troubled;</hi> which Advice took Impreſſion in my Heart: And that was the laſt <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence that ſhe ſpake, that I know of; and ſhe never ſpake in <hi>Latin,</hi> in this Illneſs, that I remember, except when Company was preſent, that ſhe would ſpeak only to me? A little after, moſt of the Company being gone out, I asked her, how ſhe was? She anſwered, <hi>Drawing nearer and nearer.</hi> And many ſweet and loving Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe ſpake to me that Day, and the Day next after; but afterwards was ſcarcely able to anſwer to any Queſtion, but continued
<pb facs="unknown:003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638"/>moſtly ſleeping, as it were, ſweetly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly: And on the Third Day of the 11th Month, 1695, in the Evening, ſhe departed, without any Noiſe, Sigh, or Groan.</p>
            <p>And ſo, tho' the Lord, who in his Love, joyned us together, and gave us for Bleſſings to each other, and bleſſed us with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Increaſe of his Love in our Hearts, even to the end of her Time, hath ſeen meet to take from me her Company, which I valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all other Temporal Enjoyments; the Loſs whereof is great to me: Yet being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that ſhe is entred into Reſt, in the Boſom of God's Love, with him, to live in Peace and Happineſs for ever; and alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear, in that, thro' his Aſſiſtance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Underſtanding given me, I have endeavoured fully to diſcharge my Duty of endeared Love to her in every reſpect, in her laſt (as well as former) Exerciſes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am, in the Love of God, comforted, and can chearfully and freely ſay, The Lord's Will is worthy to be done in all things, and his Name to be bleſſed, praiſed and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, over all, for ever,</p>

            <l>She ſweetly wrote of Charity Divine,</l>

            <l>More bright, than in her <hi>Words,</hi> which did extend,</l>

               <l>As in a Cliff, or ſecret hiding place,</l>
               <l>Free from the dangers of Tempeſtuous Seas;</l>
               <l>Wherein, as any doth ſecurely ſtand,</l>
               <l>Such cannot be unmindful of a Friend</l>
               <l>That doth in ſuch like Habitation dwell,</l>

               <l>Their Exerciſes, with Endearments free;</l>
               <l>Love circulating thus in Sympathy.</l>

               <l>With many more quite loſt and ſcattered,</l>
               <l>For want of Penning, when thy Letter came,</l>

               <head>A Third Letter to Counſin <hi>F. R.</hi>

               <l>CAN I be ſilent, tho' I ſeem t' intrude</l>

               <l>Firmly engag'd in mutual Sympathy,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Bonds of ſacred Friendſhip,</hi> which were then</l>
               <l>Suppos'd Immortal? Can my ſluggiſh Pen</l>
               <l>Forget its uſeful Office, though it want</l>

               <l>That innate Vertue, which in thee doth lye,</l>
