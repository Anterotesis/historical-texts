            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed the ſovereign and gracious God, <hi>in whoſe Hand our Times are,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain that we ſhould live under ſome peculiar Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for our precious Souls. For to the <hi>ordinary Means,</hi> we have ſuper-added the Manifeſtation of the Spirit, in <hi>extraordinary Works</hi> of Grace. We have lately heard glad Tidings from one Place &amp; another, that many are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Way to Zion, with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thitherward; and ſome are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what God hath done for their Souls. Yea, God hath brought this Work home to our own Doors, &amp; we hear many cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved.</hi> And There are a Number hopefully rejoicing in God's Salvation. Of ſuch a Seaſon as this it may well be ſaid, <hi>I have heard thee in a Time accepted, and in the Day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have I ſuccoured thee: behold, Now is the accepted Time; Behold, Now is the Day of Salvation,</hi> I hope God's People are
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8"/>
reaping the Fruit of their Prayers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on extraordinary Days of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerv'd with an eſpecial View to this great Bleſſing, the plentiful Effuſion of the holy Spirit And ſhall we not prize and improve this rich Gift? Shall we not redeem this precious Time in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our own Salvation? conſidering that God who alone can work in us to will and to do, ſays to us, <hi>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call upon him while he is near. To Day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt be very criminal if we ſleep or loiter away ſuch a Day of Grace. They who are guilty of ſuch a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sin, run a dreadful Hazard of ſwift Deſtruction, double Damnation. O there's great Reaſon to fear that another like Seaſon will never, never return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. O Sleeper! Awake, &amp; hearken, there's a Noiſe, and a Shaking among the dry Bones. Some it may be of your own Acquaintance, ſecure like you a little while ago, are now in deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, &amp; can no longer reliſh thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures in which you were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Now, Deſtruction from God is a Terror to them, and they are
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8"/>
fleeing from the Wrath to come. What a Reproof doth God give to your Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity in the Awakenings of others? Now then hear God's Voice, <hi>Turn ye at my Reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto you.</hi> Or, if you are ſtill deaf to God's Calls, let the Thunder of thoſe amazing Words make your Ears to tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed,— I alſo will laugh at your Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and mock when your fear cometh. When your Fear cometh as Deſolation, and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as a Whirlwind.</hi> And tremble leaſt you ſhould be ſuddenly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that without Remedy. But then, Let awakened Sinners be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to preſs into the Kingdom of Heaven. Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. Improve the Five Talents now put into your Hands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom much is given, of him ſhall much be required.</hi> O look diligently, leſt any Man fail of the Grace of God! Continue ſeeking till Chriſt be revealed to you as the Lord your Righteouſneſs, and as the God of Judgment: That you may glory in this, that you underſtand, &amp; know the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8"/>
Lord, who exerciſeth Loving-kindneſs, Judgment &amp; Righteouſneſs in the Earth. And here, among you with whom the Spirit is ſtriving at this Day, we behold many of our young People. O our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! God is drawing nigh to you in a diſtinguiſhing manner, and will not you from this Time cry unto him <hi>My Father, thou art the Guide of my Youth?</hi> Shall any of you be proſane as <hi>Eſau,</hi> who for one Morſel of Meat ſold his Birth-right; and then, when he would have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bleſſing, was rejected? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. May you all thirſt for God, and ſeek him early, till that Promiſe ſhall be more abundantly fulfilled in you, <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed and my Bleſſing on thine Offspring.</hi> And is it poſſible for Parents &amp; elder Perſons to behold theſe Things, and not be moved? Can you ſee your Children in Pain, and travailing till Chriſt be formed in them, and you be unconcern'd about the New-Birth? Are they taken, and can you bear to be left behind; left to periſh in your Sins, as far diſtant as Heaven &amp; Hell? Is the eleventh Hour running, and you not effectually called? What a ſad Token is this! The Lord have Mercy upon you!
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8"/>
But there are conſiderable Numbers of elder as well as younger Perſons, of whom I am perſwaded better Things, and Things that accompany Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to you our aſcended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks, <hi>Hold faſt till I come.</hi> Be not aſhamed or afraid, to confeſs Chriſt before Men; &amp; to ſtand up for him. And here the Providence of God gives me Advantage to preſs upon you that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; If ye are riſen with Chriſt, <hi>ſeek thoſe Things which are above;</hi> ſet your Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth. For as it was with God's ancient People, <hi>a Day of Darkneſs and Gloomineſs,</hi> and then God comforted his People with that gracious Promiſe, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Joel 2</note> So it pleaſeth God to ſend down the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter from Heaven into the Hearts of his People, while it is a dark Day with us upon temporal Accounts. May the Spirit of Judgment ſanctify the Frowns of God upon us to rebuke our Pride, our Covetouſneſs, our Luxury; and all thoſe fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, whereby we have been conformed to this World. And now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Curſe devouring the Earth,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004803_0004_100DF1E337D08360"/>
may we all unite in ſeeking the Bleſſings of the heavenly Paradiſe, where Satan &amp; the Curſe can never enter. That we may even now ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Altho' the Fig-Tree ſhall not bloſſom—and the Fields ſhall yield no Meat, the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I forbear, and would only further ſay, that the remarkable Work of Grace begun and going on among us, gave Encouragement to me to ſtudy and preach the following Sermons. At firſt, I deſign'd to publiſh only upon the Head of Conviction of Sin, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon which Subject it pleaſed God to own and bleſs much beyond my Expectation. May the Praiſe be given to that God who hath choſen the weak Things of the World, that no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence. Since that, I have been prevail'd upon to go on with the Subject, and alſo to publiſh the other Diſcourſes; that we may ſee in ſome meaſure how the Spirit of God carrieth on his good Work in the Hearts of his People from legal Conviction to ſaving Converſion, and then ſends forth Judgment to Victory, not withs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanding all Oppoſition from the Enemies of our Salvation. Senſible of the Defects which attend this Performance, I humbly commend it to God for His Bleſſing, beſeeching him to teach us to Profit by all the Means of Grace which he gives us richly to enjoy.</p>

I now proceed to ſhew you the great and comprehenſive Gift which our
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0"/>
Lord receiv'd of the Father, when he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on high, the Gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, by whom He works Faith and Repentance in the Hearts of his People, and ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them for all the Bleſſings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And here our Lord aſſureth us that hiſ Diſciples, and ſo his Churches would be great Gainers by his withdraw from them on Earth, to his exalted State in Heaven; for then, and not till then, ſhould the Spirit be given in a more plentiful and extenſive manner, in virtue of CHRIST'S Interceſſion at the Father's Right Hand; and that to make Application of the Redemption purchas'd by Him, and to communicate all ſpiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to his People, <hi>Ver. 7 Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth, It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him into you.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we alſo read, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not, yet glorified.</hi> And we have the fulfilment of our Saviours Promiſe, Acts 2.4. v. <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts, particularly the Gift of Tongues, whereby the Apoſtle, were qualified to preach the Goſpel to other Nations. And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD was alſo pour'd out in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner as a Spirit of Grace and Conſolation, 41, 42, v. <hi>Then they that gladly
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0"/>
received his Word were baptized: and the ſame Day there were added unto them about three thouſand Souls. And they continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread and in Prayers.</hi> But I return to the Text, in which we have the Errand on which the Holy Ghoſt is ſent, and the Work he ſhould perform in virtue of his Miſſion, deſcribed. For tho' the Three Perſons in the adorable Trinity are <hi>One</hi> in the eſſential Perfections of the divine Nature, yet in the Covenant of Redemption, the Son voluntarily agreeth to fulfill the Father's Will by taking our Nature in the fulneſs of Time, and purchaſing eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his People; and the Holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth that the ſaving Benefits of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ſhall be applied to all whom the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath choſen in him before the Foundation of the World, that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love. Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably it is here ſaid, And when he is come, he will reprove, <hi>&amp;c. When he is come,</hi> i. e. In the peculiar Manifeſtations of his gracious Preſence; for in his divine Eſſence, the Spirit is immenſe and omnipreſent. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 139.7. <hi>He will reprove the World of Sin,</hi>—Not only Jews but Gentiles. Poſſibly ſome may be ſtumbled that the Spirit is call'd the Comforter, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40"/>
then it is ſaid that he ſhould Reprove. But now, the Word is of a larger Signification, it ſignifieth <hi>Advocate,</hi> and is thus tranſlated by <hi>Beza.</hi> We have the ſame Word appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, 1 Joh. 2.1. And accordingly, the Spirit is call'd <hi>another Comforter</hi> or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, Joh. 14.16. When our Lord aſcended to appear in the Preſence of God for his People, and tranſact their Affairs in the Court of Heaven as their Advocate with the Father; He ſent his holy Spirit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs of the Kingdom of Grace here upon Earth. And this Work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Men of Sin well ſuits with this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an Advocate. As ſuch the Spirit of God ſhews Sinners that the Charge laid againſt them in God's Word is juſt, that the World may become guilty before God and that Sinners ſelf-condemned may ſeek Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo be prepared for the Joy of God's Salvation. And this agreeth alſo with the Word here tranſlated <hi>Reprove,</hi> which ſignifieth to convince by evident Argument and ſolid Reaſon. "I will convince them of their Sins, and after reprove, admoniſh and check them for the ſame" And there's then a particular Sin mentioned, Cont. v. 9 <hi>Of Sin, becauſe they believe not in me.</hi> The hainous Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in that Day was that they rejected Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40"/>
promiſed to their Fathers and ſent to them as the only Name whereby they could be ſaved. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not, Joh. 1.11.</hi> Saving a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the Election of Grace. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief, they were broken off,</hi> Rom. 11.20. Accordingly when the Spirit of God was poured out and <hi>Peter</hi> preached to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. He charg'd them home with the great Sin of rejecting and crucifying the Lord of Glory; upon which many are pricked to the Heart, and ſay in deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>Men and Brethren, What ſhall we do?</hi> 37. v. And doth not this Sin of Unbelief much prevail in this Age? Many ſeem to be inſenſible how great the Evil of this Sin is, tho' the Word of God declareth, that <hi>He who believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son,</hi> 1 Joh 5.10. It's to be fear'd that there are many under the Goſpel, who ſatisfy themſelves with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Attendance on religious Duties, while they refuſe to ſubmit to Chriſt, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his great Salvation. But now, when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, He will ſhew them the great Evil of an Heart of Unbelief, and make them ſenſible of this, that <hi>he who believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Again, The Spirit reproveth of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004803_0007_100DF1E8AF007498"/>
               <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He will convince Men that <hi>Jeſus</hi> who ſuffered an accurſed Death as if he had been the vileſt Malefactor, being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified between two Thieves, is indeed the <hi>juſt One;</hi> and ſuffered the Juſt for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that he is the Lord our Righteouſneſs. He will convince Sinners that they can't be juſtified but by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt received by Faith. Now his going to the Father was a Demonſtration of this, that he was Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs. — <hi>And of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> That all Judgment is committed to the Son as Lord and Chriſt, and that he hath Power as Mediator and in virtue of His O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto Death, to caſt down Satan from his uſurped Throne, and deliver poor Sinners from his deſtoying Power. Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably where our Saviour ſpeaks of his being litted up upon the Croſs, He ſays, <hi>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now ſhall the Prince of this World be caſt out,</hi> Joh. 12.31.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the Words of my Text, I return to conſider that Part which I purpoſe more particularly to ſpeak to; the Work of the Spirit in reproving Men of Sin.</p>

               <q>IT is the Work of the Holy Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and reprove Men of Sin.</q>
               <p>The Spirit of God is the great Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of common and ſaving Grace. There is a <hi>ſaving Conviction</hi> of Sin, which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men when he enlightens them to diſcern ſpiritual Things after a ſpiritual manner. When God gives them the Light of the Knowledge of his Glory, they ſee that Evil in Sin as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, his Nature and revealed Will, which cauſes them to mourn for it with that godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance to Salvation. <hi>Now mine Eye ſeeth thee. Wherefore I abbor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Job 42.5, 6. They look unto Jeſus as pierced by their Sins and mourn, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Thus it is when the Spirit of Grace converts Men, and turns them from Sin to God, by working a ſaving Change in their Hearts. And there is a <hi>legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men before Converſion, whereby they are awakened out of their carnal Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Sin, and bro't under deep Concern about Deliverance from it as a deſtroying Evil. Now it is a matter of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to ſuch as are under this Work,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0"/>
that it be carried on till it iſſue in a ſaving Converſion to God. For the divine Spirit, who acts with ſovereign Liberty, may be provok'd to depart, and leave Men to periſh in their Sins. Thus the Spirit of God ſtrove with the Sinners of the old World, whoſe departed Spirits are call'd <hi>Spirits in Priſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 3, 19. Their Bodies were deſtroy'd by the Flood, and their Souls are now ſhut up in Hell, Where they are kept in durance to the Judgment of the great Day. And indeed it is plain from Scripture that theſe lower Workings of the Spirit, if I may ſo call them, have been in ſome preparatory to ſaving Converſion, while others have ſtifled them. I ſhall give you an Inſtance of each from the Word of God, to awaken your Hopes and Fears, the great Springs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Endeavours. The rough and hardy <hi>Jaylor</hi> came trembling, and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> ſaying, Sirs, <hi>What muſt I to be ſaved?</hi> They anſwer, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſave</hi> And it ſeems the Spirit ſoon converted him even that ſame Night; yea gave him the Joy of God's Salvation. <hi>He rejoyced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God with all his Houſe,</hi> Acts 16 29,— 34. O that this may be the happy Caſe of the many now under Convictions! <hi>Felix</hi> alſo trembled, as <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. Behold the Judge quaking for Fear before his Priſoner! We may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a greater than <hi>Paul</hi> was there, even the <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> reproving this Man for his Crimes by the Spirit accompanying <hi>Paul's</hi> faithful Miniſtry: But then he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily endeavour'd to put off his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ſaying to <hi>Paul, Go thy way for this Time; when I have a convenient Seaſon, I will call for thee.</hi> And for ought any thing that appears, the Spirit ceaſed ſtriving with him. We read indeed that <hi>Felix</hi> ſent for <hi>Paul</hi> again; but not to hear the Word of God, and inquire how he ſhould improve his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions; but becauſe he hoped that Money ſhould have been given him of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might looſe him, v. 26. A baſe Thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! And after two Years, to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> a Pleaſure, he left <hi>Paul</hi> bound, v. 27, Upon the whole, it is highly probable, that the convenient Seaſon, he pretended to wait for, never came. O it is a dangerous Thing to reſiſt the Spirit of God ſtriving with us, and as it were bid him depart from us!</p>
               <p>I would now ſpeak particularly to the Doctrine under theſe following Heads;</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction, II. We may conſider the Means he uſeth to convince Men of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004803_0009_100DF1ECDA7A1768"/>
Sin. <hi>III.</hi> Offer ſome Deſcription of this Work of Conviction.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I. THE Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a Work going before and preparatory to ſaving Converſion in God's choſen People, is evident from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Experience. The Son of Man is come to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt; and the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> is repreſented as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his periſhing Condition, before he reſolveth to <hi>ariſe and go to his Father,</hi>— Luke 15.17, 18. And our compaſſionate Redeemer inviteth them that <hi>labor and are heavy laden to come to him for reſt,</hi> Matth. 11.28. And we find from Examples upon Record in Scripture, as well as of later Date down to our own Times, that God takes this Courſe with Men, convincing them of Sin and bringing them under a deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about their Souls before he grants them the Joy of his Salvation. Now whatever <hi>Inſtruments</hi> may be uſed in this Work, we muſt acknowledge that the Spirit of God is the <hi>great Efficient.</hi> He ſtriveth with Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. And accordingly <hi>Stephen</hi> charged his Hearers with the great Sin of reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. How ſharp were his Arrows in their Hearts who heard <hi>Peter's</hi> Sermon upon occaſion of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004803_0009_100DF1ECDA7A1768"/>
wonderful Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt in the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt: Act.</hi> 2. They were <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Heart,</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> And in a little Time ſeem to have been ſubdued to the Obedience of Faith. Agreably, the Spirit of God is called a Spirit of Bondage, Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear.</hi> Indeed the holy Spirit can't be the Author of Sin whereby Men are brought into Bondage; but then He makes Sinners ſenſible of this cruel Bondage, and brings them to groan after Deliverance.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We proceed to conſider the Means which the Spirit of God uſeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of Sin.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>THE great Inſtrument is the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly the Word is call'd the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 6.17. <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. But then the ſame Spirit that moved thoſe holy Men who wrote the Scriptures, muſt accompany them with his divine Influence; or there will be ſad Occaſion to take up that Lamentation, <hi>Who hath believed our Report? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> Iſa. 58.1. When the Spirit is withdrawn, we find that the Miniſtry of the Word has little
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350"/>
or no good Effect upon the Hearts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They are unmov'd as the Seats they ſit upon: Their Ears are heavy and their Eyes ſhut, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. But when this almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spirit is pleas'd to take his Word into his own Hand, and wound the Sinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with it, he can no longer make light of the Commands or Threatnings; they come home to him, and reach his very Heart: <hi>He is convinced of all, he is judged of all,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.23. He is convinced of the Sins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath tranſgreſſed God's holy Law, and his Heart condemneth him for them. Now the Word of God <hi>is quick, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and ſharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. The Law of God is call'd a <hi>fiery Law,</hi> Deut. 33.2. And it may well be ſo call'd, not only as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd out of the midſt of the Fire, from the burning Mountain; but alſo, as in it we have God's burning Wrath, and fiery Indignation againſt Sinners revealed from Heaven. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when the Word of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Spirit, and ſo comes with Power upon the Hearts of Sinners, they feel Pain and Anguiſh, and are ſenſible of the deadly Wounds Sin hath given them. <hi>Is not my Word like as a Fire, ſaith the Lord:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350"/>
and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces?</hi> Jer. 23.29. When the Spirit takes it into his Hand, he breaks the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners carnal Confidences. By the <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Knowlege of Sin,</hi> and by it the Spirit reproves Men for their Sins, and convinceth them of their loſt periſhing Condition as Tranſgreſſors of God's Law. So ſharp and cutting were God's Reproofs of his ancient People by his Word in the Mouth of his holy Prophets, that he ſays, <hi>Therefore have I hewed them by the Prophets: I have ſlain them by the Words of my Mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 6.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit convinceth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth Men of Sin by <hi>God's providential Diſpenſations, particularly by afflictive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the Holy Spirit makes uſe of the divine Goodneſs to lead Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Rom, 2.4. And draweth them as with the Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably it is promis'd that the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould <hi>fear the Lord, and his Goodneſs</hi> in the latter Days, <hi>Hoſ</hi> 3.5. But I am now conſidering the Reproof given by Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When Sinners reſiſt the Spirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in and by his Word, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes the Rod, and teacheth them as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the Men of <hi>Succoth</hi> with Briars and Thorns of the Wilderneſs. And when they are thus torn and wounded, they are bro't to conſider what an evil Thing Sin
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88"/>
is, and their need of a Saviour to deliver them from it. Thus God ſaid to his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent People by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah. Thine own Wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings ſhall reprove thee: know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil Thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi> Chap. 2.9. Outward Proſperity is apt to make Men careleſs and ſecure; to ſay with the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans, I am rich, and increaſed with Goods, and have need of nothing.</hi> But now, When God brings Men into Straits and under Difficulties, He ſometimes awakeneth them to a ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon their ſpiritual Poverty, Miſery and Wretchedneſs, <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy Proſperity, but thou ſaidſt, I will not hear: this hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou obeyedſt not my Voice. The Wind ſhall eat up all thy Paſtors, and thy Lovers ſhall go into Captivity, ſurely then ſhalt thou be aſhamed and confounded for all thy Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Jer. 22.21, 2. And thus it was with <hi>Ephraim</hi> when he bore the Reproach of the Sins of his Youth under God's Chaſtiſements, Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoke: turn thou me and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for thou art the Lord my God.</hi> Tho' theſe Words nextly refer to God's People,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88"/>
they may be fitly applied to particular Perſons. When God corrects Men, and by his Spirit opens their Ears to Diſcipline, he ſhaws them the Neceſſity of their turning to God, and maketh them concern'd to obtain convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. <hi>Turn thou me</hi>—. O that this may be the happy Caſe of the many young People who are under Convictions at this Time! <hi>Dear Children!</hi> Ask the Spirit of Grace as a Spirit of Regeneration and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you may have your weary Souls reviv'd with that good Word which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Is Ephraim a dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my Bowels are troubled for him: I will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But to return, When Perſons are ſecure, God cometh upon them, takes away their Health, and brings them ſeriouſly to conſider their latter End. God ſhaketh me over the Grave, ſays the awakened Sinner, and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, if I die in my Sins, if I die out of Chriſt? Again, God comes &amp; taketh away their earthly Goods, and ſo convinceth them of the Evil of truſting in uncertain Riches, and awakens them to ſeek that good Part which can't be taken away. Again, God bereaveth Men of their near and dear Friends, and ſo quickens them to ſeek the Favour and Friendſhip of the eternal God, making them taſte the Bitterneſs of Sin as it hath brought
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0"/>
Death into the World, and ſhewing them the Vanity of Creatures. We read of thoſe Sinners, Pſal. 78.34, 5. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer.</hi> And was it not thus with this People in the Time of the EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE, when God threatned to ſend us down quick into the Pit? Did not Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes tremble as the <hi>Jailor,</hi> and inquire with great Concern, what muſt we do to be ſaved? How did People flock to God's Houſe, and with what aw did they attend to his Word, while the Foundations of the Earth were ſhaken under us! Yea, I humbly apprehend that there is Reaſon to believe that the mighty Voice uttered from the deep Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Earth, together with the ſtill Voice of God's Word, was ſanctified not only for the Conviction, but alſo for the Convenſion of Numbers of People, by the Spirit of God. So far as we can judge, there were a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whom the Terrors of that dreadful Night awakened, whom the Spirit effectually call'd. While it is to be fear'd that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made on a far greater Number wore off, and dyed away. I the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this remarkable Providence, becauſe I apprehend that the Time of it was a Seaſon in which God was pleaſed in a general and extraordinary manner to ſtrive with this
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0"/>
People. Since that we have been viſited with a very mortal Sickneſs, in which God hath cut off many of our Children; but I cannot learn that People have been awakened in any Proportion to the exceeding Awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Spirit makes uſe of <hi>His Works of Grace to convince and awaken Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At ſometimes the Spirit is awfully reſtrain'd, and then Converſions are rare and doubtful. At other Seaſons, God is pleas'd to pour out His Spirit upon his People, and then his Works of Grace, are as the Light which goeth forth. Many ask the Way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with their Faces thitherward, and not a few declare God's Works of Grace towards them with rejoicing. Convictions and Converſions become more frequent and apparent, ſo far as our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reacheth. It is true, the ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others can't be certainly known by us in the ordinary Way, becauſe we are not able to look directly into the Heart, but muſt judge by outward Appearances. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to exerciſe Judgment with Charity. But then there are ſometimes Fruits of the Spirit ſo evident, that they can't be conceal'd or denied. There is the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit</hi> in his divine Operations. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Perſons that were before quiet in their Sins and unconcerned, are ſo awakened that they can't ſtifle their Convictions, nor
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70"/>
conceal their Diſtreſs; but are made to cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> How ſhall we eſcape the Wrath to come? And when a Son or Daughter, or any other in a Family are thus wrought upon, the Houſe is alarm'd with it, and thus their Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are happily preſs'd with Concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their own Souls by the Convictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to uſe them as Means for this End. And when ſuch a Work of Grace ſpreads and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thro' the good Hand of God upon his People, it will be ſtill more obſervable, and ſuch as are conſiderate, will be ready to ſay admiring, What hath God wrought! Yea, all that behold it, muſt now ſee, if they will open their Eyes, that there's more in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than a lifeleſs Formality, and outward Attendance on Ordinances. When the Work of God is thus reviv'd among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Form of Godlineſs will be animated with the inward Life and Power of it. God's own Children will be quicken'd to ariſe and trim their Lamps, that their Light may ſhine before others. And ſuch as were Strangers to Religion before, will now preſs into the Kingdom of Heaven. That Deſcription well agreeth to ſuch a Seaſon. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force,</hi> Matth. 11 12. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt will be encouraged and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in their Work, and ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70"/>
Convictions will be awakened to a more diligent Attendance on the Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Now ſuch things as theſe, under the Influence of the bleſſed Spirit, muſt have an happy tendency to rouſe the ſleepy ſecure Sinner, and reprove him for his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Indifferency in the great Concerns of his Soul. And thus the holy Spirit maketh uſe of the Works of his Grace to convince Men of their Sin and Danger, while they behold a great Alteration in others for the better; but have not felt the like in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That God who formeth the Spirit of Man within him, hath <hi>faſhioned their Hearts alike;</hi> ſo that as in Water, Face anſwereth to Face; <hi>ſo the Heart of Man to Man.</hi> Pſal, 33.15. Prov. 27.29. Whence ariſeth a kind of Sympathy and Affection reſpecting each other; ſo that what toucheth the one; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the other. And this is in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner obſervable in ſuch as are near and dear to each other. When the Child is in Diſtreſs, the tender Parent is preſently touched with the feeling of it's Sorrow: When the Brother crieth out in Anguiſh of Soul, the kind Siſter can't forbear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with him. Accordingly, When it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the holy Spirit to uſe theſe Inclinations and Affections in Men as Means, good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by the divine Bleſſing, wonderfully propagate and multiply.

of the ſurpriſing Work of God in the Converſion of many hundred Souls in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> and the neighbouring Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "There is no one Thing that I know of that God has made ſuch a Means of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Work amongſt us, as the News of others Converſion; in the awakening Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and engaging them earneſtly to ſeek the ſame Bleſſing, and in the quickening of Saints."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Mr. Edward's <hi>Narrative,</hi> P. 39.</note> And as more lately, we have receiv'd <hi>good News</hi> of this kind from more diſtant Places upon this Continent; ſo I can't but hope that God's ſending one and another of his Servants among us who had been perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally acquainted with theſe later wonderful Works of Grace, together with their very laborious and fervent Preaching, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of others his Servants; has been bleſ'd to convince many of their Sins, and awaken them to a ſerious Concern about their Souls. Yea, It is hopeful that there are a Number converted, and brought home to Chriſt. Let us give the Praiſe to the God of all Grace: And let Paſtors and Parents, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their ſeveral Places uſe their beſt Endeavours to forward this good Work; for tho' the Work is the Lord's, and he alone can carry it on with victorious Succeſs; yet he delights to uſe his People as Inſtruments,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004803_0014_100DF1F7FB56A4B0"/>
and expects that in the way of Duty they ask His Bleſſing in the more plentiful and extenſive Effuſions of his Spirit. Thus when God had promiſed to give his People a <hi>new Heart; to put his Spirit within them,</hi> and cauſe them to walk in his Statutes: He adds, <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them,</hi> Ezek. 36.37.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The 3d Head is <hi>to give ſome Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work of the Spirit in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall at preſent, only obſerve a few Things in general relating to it,</p>
               <p>This Work of the Spirit is by Divines commonly call'd <hi>Preparatory,</hi> as it goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaving Converſion, and is wrought in order to it, reſpecting ſuch as are afterwards effectually call'd by the Spirit. By this Work, ſays the excellent Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> "We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand certain inherent Qualifications, coming between the carnal Reſt of the Soul in the State of Sin, and Converſion wrought in the Miniſtry both of the Law and Goſpel, by the common Work of the Spirit concurring; whereby the Soul is put into a miniſterial Capacity of believing immediately, <hi>i. e.</hi> of immediate receiving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt." This is the order in which God proceeds in the Work of his Grace on the Souls of ſuch as are grown to Years of Underſtanding: He maketh them ſenſible of their Sin and Miſery,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0"/>
and ſo brings them to ſeek <hi>Jeſus</hi> who ſaveth his People from their Sins, and to ſubmit to him. Indeed this Work is neither the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nor meretorious Cauſe of their ſaving Converſion; however in this Way God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeneth his People to a diligent Attendance on the Means of Grace, till he ſhall work in them to will and to do, and make them his <hi>willing People, in the Day of his Power.</hi> And here, we may obſerve that we muſt not preſume to limit and reſtrain the infinite Spirit of God in this matter, who is call'd the <hi>free Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.12. No doubt there may be great Variety as to Degrees of Terror, as to the Time Perſons are kept under it, and the like. And we muſt take heed that in this reſpect we do not make our particular Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences general Rules to judge of the State of Men <hi>God opened the Heart of Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Jailor came trembling</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Conſternation. And it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſome have been kept under a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage for a conſiderable Time, while other convinced Sinners have been in a ſhort Time ſurpris'd with a Viſit from the holy Spirit of God as a Spirit of Adoption, which ſuppoſeth the New-Birth. Again, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expreſſions of deep Concern in Tears, wringing the Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perſons under like inward deep Concern of Mind may conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably differ according to different Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tempers. Again, Some may have
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0"/>
been more hainous Tranſgreſſors than others, and God may impreſs their Minds with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Fears in ſome Proportion. Again, It's no improbable Suppoſition, that ſome have been converted in early Childhood before they were capable of giving a diſtinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Work. Nor need it ſeem ſtrange, if ſuch as have been favour'd with a pious Education and good Impreſſions from their Childhood, ſhould be more at a loſs in this Matter, than ſuch as have been ſuddenly ſurpris'd as <hi>Saul,</hi> while going on in open Rebellion againſt God, and ſo knock'd down under the fearful Apprehenſions of his Wrath, and then rais'd with the wonderful Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the free Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt ſuper-abounding where Sin had abounded. Therefore ſuch as find upon ſtrict and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination, that they abhor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Sin as it is contrary to the declarative Glory &amp; revealed Will of God, and ſo turn from all Sin unto God, as their chief Good and higheſt End; that they are willing to ſubmit to Chriſt as their Prince and Saviour, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to his Righteouſneſs for their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God, and taking his Yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: I ſay, theſe Perſons ought not to diſtreſs themſelves, becauſe they can't give ſuch a diſtinct Account of the Time and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this Work of Conviction, as ſome others can; nor yet have experienc'd ſo great Terrors as others haye felt before they were
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990"/>
born of the Spirit. Such as have been made ſenſible of their loſt and periſhing Condition by the Fall, and then made willing to receive Jeſus Chriſt in all his Offices as their only Saviour; have the Things found in them which go before, and accompany Salvation; and ſhould be encourag'd to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon their God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, It is happy for ſuch as are able to give a more clear and diſtinct Account of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Seaſon and Manner of this Work of the Spirit; for this has a tendency to bring their Minds to a better Settlement as to their Aſſurance of the ſaving Work of Grace wrought after it. On the other hand, Perſons who have been under great Terrors, and now receive the Word with Joy, muſt rejoice with holy Fear, and look to it that they have that contrite and humble Spirit with which the high and lofty One dwells, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and the Heart of the contrite One; For there is a Joy which is no true Sign of ſaving Converſion. The ſtony-ground Hearers we have deſcrib'd by our Lord, who ſearcheth the Heart, Matth. 13.20. <hi>He that received the Seed into ſtony Places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it:</hi> The ſtony Heart was not taken away, nor was there any Root of ſaving Grace; and accordingly in Time of Trial they wither'd. And then there's no ſaving Virtue in legal Terrors to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990"/>
convert Men; this Change is wrought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exceeding greatneſs of God's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. However, neither do I ſpeak theſe Things to damp their Joy who upon their Converſion may have receiv'd the <hi>Spirit of God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with their Spirits, that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> And I make no doubt but this is the happy Caſe of many, when the Spirit is poured out plentifully. When there were <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> Souls added, we read that <hi>they gladly receiv'd the Word,</hi> Acts 2.41. But then, I am concern'd that we may all obey that Word, and obtain the Benefit of it. <hi>Let every Man prove his own Work, and then ſhall he have rejoicing in himſelf alone, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6.4.</p>
               <p>I would only further ſay at preſent, that when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, he ſhews them the guilt and derſtroying Power of their Sins; maketh them ſenſible of their Miſery and Danger as they lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Curſes of the Law, and brings them to ſeek Deliverance with earneſtneſs and deep Concern. And thus the Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them to hearken to the gracious Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Offers of the Goſpel, while he alſo ſhews them their utter Inability to come up to the Terms of the Gospel in their own Strength, and their great Unworthineſs that God ſhould work in them to will and to do. And therefore, that if they are ſav'd, it muſt be from the free ſovereign Grace of God,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004803_0017_100DF1FF9441BEC8"/>
who has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy. And as to ſuch whom the Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, he changeth their Hearts, renews them in the Spirit of their Minds reſpecting every Power of the Soul; and ſo perſwadeth and enableth them to Truſt in Jeſus Chriſt <hi>as the only Name given among Men wherely we muſt be ſaved;</hi> taking their Encouragement from the Grace of God, the Merits of Chriſt, and free Offers of the Goſpel. When Chriſt is thus formed in the Heart, the poor Creature ſo highly ſavour'd, is ready to cry out, Lord this Salvation is too great and good for me; but thou art worthy to be believed and obey'd, and nothing is too great or wonderful for thee. <hi>Be it unto me according to thy Word.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>His Preſence with God's People is better to them, even then the bodily Preſence of Chriſt upon Earth; for our Saviour aſſur'd his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that it was expedient for them that he ſhould go away, that the <hi>Comforter might come unto them.</hi> And He is the Diſpenſer of all Grace. The Love of God is ſhed abroad in the Heart, and the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt bro't home to the Soul, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt. We are bleſſed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004803_0017_100DF1FF9441BEC8"/>
in His Name; common and ſaving Grace are communicated by him to periſhing Sinners: and therefore we ought to aſcribe Bleſſing and Glory and Honour to him, who is <hi>called God,</hi> Act 5.3, 4. <hi>There are Three that bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5 7. Let us then fall down and worſhip that God who is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghoſt. And let us be ſenſible that the Application of the Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt is from the Holy Spirit. When we behold many convinced of Sin, and ſome in a judgment of Charity converted; let us look above Men and Means, and ſay, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</hi> We have in a publick and ſolemn manner ſought the Lord for this great Gift, and now we ſhould bleſs God for it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Him to give his Spirit more abundantly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it the Spirit of God who reproveth Men of Sin? <hi>Learn the dangerous State of ſuch as are ſecure in Sin, or ſtifle their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's a dreadful Thing for Men to be ſuffer'd to have an accurſed quiet falſe Peace in the Ways of Sin, Luk. 11.21. <hi>When a ſtrong Man armed keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace.</hi> Alas! Satan ruleth in the Hearts of theſe miſerable Creatures without controul, and they are led Captive by him at his Will.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004803_0018_100DF201449F1B00"/>
They hug their Chains, and are unconcern'd about Deliverance, while they are permitted to enjoy the Pleaſure's of Sin without remorſe of Conſcience. <hi>They ſport themſelves with their own Deceivings,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.13. And God threatens to bring ſudden and irrecoverable Ruin upon them. <hi>When they ſhall ſay, Peace and ſafety; then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a Woman with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſ 5.3. And it is a very dangerous Sign when Perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the Means of Grace, and yet are ſleeping in carnal Security: They ſleep as on the Top of a Maſt, and are in Danger every Moment of falling, and of being drown'd in eternal Perdition. O hear God's Voice then without Delay, leſt you lift up your Eyes in Torments, and in utter Deſpair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a vaſt Gulph fix'd between you and the Seat of the Bleſſed! <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life,</hi> Eph. 5, 14. O cry to God for his Spirit to convince and convert you! For ſurely, it's better to endure ſome preſent Pain and Diſtreſs, while yet there is Hope; than to be ſhut out into outer Darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth forever. O let me not ſeem to you, while thus warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you to flee from the Wrath to come, as <hi>Lot</hi> to his Sons-in-law, as one that mocketh! <hi>Lot went out, and ſpake unto his Sons in law, which married his Daughters, and ſaid, Up,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004803_0018_100DF201449F1B00"/>
get ye out of this Place; for the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this City: but he ſeemed as one that mocked unto his Sons in law,</hi> Gen. 19.14. Thus we may ſuppoſe they ſlept ſecurely that Night; but what came in the Morning? <hi>The Lord rain'd upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Fire from the Lord out of Heaven,</hi> 24 v. And when the Fire from Heaven had deſtroyed their Bodies, their miſerable Souls were caſt into Hell. <hi>Even as Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha, and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to Fornication, and going after ſtrange Fleſh, are ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire</hi> Jude <hi>v</hi> 7. O eſcape for your Lives then this Night, leſt by to Morrow you be conſumed! Or have you been favoured with Convictions, but have ſtifled and loſt them? Can you remember when the Spirit of God moved on your Hearts, exciting you to pray, and attend to the preaching of the Word; to put away Sin, and to reform your Lives? But now theſe good Motions ceaſe, and the Spirit is departed from you. Is this your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy State? Know it, Your Caſe is very hazardous, yet not deſperate. Fear then, leſt God ſhould puniſh you with the <hi>Men that are ſettled on their Lees.</hi> Juſtify God in this Matter, and confeſs that you have greatly ſinn'd by vexing his good Spirit. At the ſame Time, take heed and beware of going on deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately in your Sins, as if there was no Hope.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004803_0019_100DF20365791FD8"/>
Even ſuch as you have found Mercy. Seek to God then the more earneſtly to revive his Work in your Souls. Be the more ſenſible from this of the deep Corruption of your Hearts, and of the Enmity of your carnal Minds againſt God; and deprecate that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgment of judicial Blindneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart. Bemoan your ſelves, and ſay, <hi>O that it was with me, as in Months paſt</hi> And let that be your earneſt and continued Prayer, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence; and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let ſuch as are under the Convictions of the Spirit, bleſs God for them; and in the uſe of all Proper Means ſeek the Lord that theſe may end in a ſaving Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hath God ſent his Spirit to convince you of Sin, and ſhew to you your need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? Be encouraged to ask the holy Spirit to reveal Chriſt unto you, as the <hi>Lord your Righteouſneſs;</hi> that you may embrace Him as he is freely offer'd in the Goſpel. Are you brought to attend God's Word with Fear and Concern? O ſeek the inward and effectual Call of the Spirit! that you may now ſay, Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth. Hear the Words of our Saviour, and let them ſtrengthen the Hands which hang down and confirm the feeble Knees, when you may be ready to faint and wax weary in yoar Minds. Luke 11.9. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you: Seek, and ye ſhall find: Knock, and it ſhall be

You are not far from the Kingdom of God, O ſtrive to enter then, looking to God to work in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure! And take heed you do not <hi>quench the Spirit</hi> by returning to your Sins, or to your ſinful Companions. Now follow hard after God by a conſtant and diligent Attendance to the Means of Grace. Be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſervent in <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your Sins and crying for Mercy in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. Get alone, think upon your Ways and <hi>meditate</hi> upon divine Things. <hi>Study the Word of God,</hi> which is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Soul; and take heed how you hear it. For <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing hy the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. Wait at the Poſts of Wiſdom's Doors, and labour to be found in thoſe Ways in which Chriſt walks. And yet take heed and beware of depending on your religious Duties and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reformations. Say with your ſelf, An Intereſt in Chriſt I muſt have; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly while you uſe the Means, ſeek Reſt to your Souls in Him. Be willing to bear the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004803_0020_100DF205D0C75D48"/>
Spirit's Reproofs, tho' ſharp and pungent; but if Terrors be overbearing, beſeech the Lord that he would not lay more upon you, than he ſhall enable you to bear. Indeed there may be ſome few ready to complain with <hi>Heman, While I ſuffer thy Terrors, I am diſtracted.</hi> But bleſſed be God! This is not the ordinary Caſe. And where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe of Reaſon hath been diſturbed, I am ſatisfied it was not ſo much from any direct Impreſſions of the good Spirit of God, as from natural Diſorders of Body, or moral Diſtempers of mind. Our gracious God would not have, no not the <hi>inceſtuous Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, ſwallowen up with over-much Sorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.7. However, Pray God to ſhew you the plague of your own Heart, and be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Wound Sin hath given you is incurable unleſs it will pleaſe the great God our Saviour to be the <hi>Phyſician.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſpairing in your ſelf, Look to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſay, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me whole. Thy Blood cleanſeth from all Sin, and thy divine Spirit is able to apply it. <hi>Heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt Thee.</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> tempt you to return to your carnal Security, or to deſpair as if your Sins were ſo great that God would not pardon them; reſiſt him, and cry to God to <hi>bruiſe him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Feet.</hi> And labour to be furniſhed with pertinent Texts of Scripture whereby you may anſwer and confute ſuch evil Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004803_0020_100DF205D0C75D48"/>
Thus if you are tempted by Satan or your own Luſts, to return to your Evil Courſes; anſwer, It is written, <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. Or if tempted to ſay, mine Iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven; anſwer, It is written, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; tho' they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool,</hi> Iſa. 1.18. And inſtead of yielding to the Temptation, Plead with God in the Words of <hi>David, For thy Names ſake, O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is great.</hi> Pſal. 25 12. And do not perplex your ſelf as if you had committed <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is unto Death.</hi> The good Impreſſions you now receive from the Spirit ſtriving with you, make it evident that this is not your Caſe. Again, If you <hi>ſeem to grow worſe and worſe</hi> after conſiderable Labour and Striving, be not diſcouraged as if it was in vain for you to ſtrive any Longer. The Spirit of God rather diſcovereth to you more and more the deep Corruption of your Hearts, which is an hopeful Symptom, and ſhould be improv'd to convince you more thorowly of your need of the infinite. Power &amp; Grace of God to ſave you. And then, <hi>If you are continued for a conſiderable Time under this Work, and cant find Reſt;</hi> do not grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, and ſay it is in vain to wait for the

Lord any longer: But rather reſolve that by his Help you will hope and wait for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God. I pray conſider, how long God hath waited upon you, it may be <hi>Ten, Twenty,</hi> or <hi>Thirty Years;</hi> and will you think it hard to wait upon God a few Months or Years? O be not ſo unrreaſonable and undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful! It is of the Lord's Mercies you are not conſumed, and it muſt be of his free undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Mercy, if you are ſaved. Certainly then you are well-treated, and have a rich Reward of all your Pains, if God ſhall come at the laſt and ſave you, even when this frail ſhort Life is juſt expiring. Or, <hi>If others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened after you, obtain Grace and Comfort before you,</hi> let not your Eye be evil, becauſe God is good. Is it not lawful for Him to do what He will with his own? O take heed then and beware of entertaining hard Tho'ts of God! Lie down at the Foot of ſovereign Grace, and wait God's Time without Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and Complaint. Again, Are <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Thoughts injected?</hi> Caſt them out with Abhorrence, and be not diſmayed. The evil One who caſts theſe fiery Darts, muſt bear the Blame and Puniſhment. In a Word, <hi>Do not perplex yourſelves with anxious Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about your Election.</hi> This is abſord and prepoſterous at this Time. Hear that Word then, <hi>The ſecret Things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe Things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our Children forever,

that we may do all the Words of this Law,</hi> Deut. 29.29. Your Duty is plainly reveal'd; <hi>Give Diligence to make your Calling and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure: for if ye do theſe Things, ye ſhall never fall.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. Make ſure of the effectual Call of the Spirit, and then you may ſafely conclude that God has loved you with an everlaſting Love, and ſo drawn you to himſelf.

               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:004803_0023_100DF20D822F4F98"/>Before I ſpeak particularly to this Head, I would obſerve to you, that the infinite Spirit of God hath the neareſt Acceſs to our Spirits which are his Creatures, and can make Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon them as he pleaſeth: And he convinceth Sinners by an inward Application to the Powers of the Soul, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Conſcience, &amp;c. before a ſaving Change is wrought in the Heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this Work of Conviction <hi>the Spirit of God brings Home the Senſe of Sin and the Guilt to the Heart and Conſcience of the Sinner.</hi> And then his Spirit is wounded, and his Heart mov'd with Fear. Tho' Men will generally acknowledge that they are Sinners, yet alas! there are many unconverted Perſons who flatter themſelves in their evil Ways as if Sin had not Dominion over them, and they were not walking in the Path of the Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Many are in a lamentable manner ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Strictneſs and Purity of God's Law, and at the ſame Time very much Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their own deceitful Hearts. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Paul,</hi> while Phariſee, was not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the firſt Motions of evil Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence were Sin. Rom. 7.7. And <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſays, <hi>In all my Labours they ſhall find none Iniquity in me that is Sin:</hi> Tho' the Balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Deceit were in his Hand, and he loved to oppreſs. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7, 8. How many falſe Pleas and vain Excuſes do Men frame to blind
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004803_0023_100DF20D822F4F98"/>
and bribe their Conſciences? whereby they are laid aſleep in carnal Security. <hi>There is a Way which ſeemeth right unto a Man; but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. So deceitful and deſperately wicked are the Hearts of Men. But when the Spirit of God comes with the Word to ſhew Men their Iniquity, he detects and lays open this Deceit, and maketh the Sinner know that he has offended the holy, heart-ſearching God, and ſtands condemned by His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law. Conſcience is awakened to do it's Office, and as it were ſays to the Sinner, <hi>Thou are the Man:</hi> And now, he beholdeth his Sin in it's hainous Nature and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſelf-judged, maketh that Confeſſion before the Lord, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this Evil in they Sight,</hi> Pſal. 51.4. When the Spirit of God reproveth Men of Sin, they dare not deny the Fact, nor excuſe the Fault or Crime cleaving to it. But rather deprecate God's entering into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>If thou Lord, ſhouldſt mark Iniquities:</hi> O Lord, <hi>who ſhall ſtand</hi> Pſal 130.3. Surely none can ſtand in the Judgment, ſays the convinced Sinner; and as for me, I am now ſenſible that I muſt fall under the condemning Sentence of the Law, vile Wretch that I am. And tho; this may be at firſt from Conviction of ſome particular Sin, as here of the Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; yet the Spirit of God leads Men up
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004803_0024_100DF20F461EAE50"/>
to the Conſideration of their guiltineſs and vileneſs as Children of Apoſtate <hi>Adam;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that they ſinned in him and fell with him, and that as they proceed from him they bring a corrupt Nature into the World with them, empty of Grace, and bent unto Sin. And now they are ready to ſubſcribe that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity: and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Now God's Word is ſet home upon their Hearts, in which it is declared, that all are under Sin; there's none Righteous, no not one. Their <hi>Mouths are ſtop'd, and they become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19. And they are ready to acknowledge that they were expos'd to the Wrath and Curſe of God as a Generation of Vipers, even from their early Childhood. And whatever have been their outward Attendance on religious Duties, and blameleſs Behaviour before Men; they now find that they are Children of Wrath, even as others. This was the Caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' he had liv'd as a ſtrict Phariſee, a blameleſs Life according to his underſtanding of the Law. <hi>I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law once; but when the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, Sin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. While a Phariſee, tho' he had the Law in the Letter of it, yet he was wihtout the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreadfully ignorant of the ſpiritual Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Uſe of it, as alſo of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s Purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Obligation and ſo he tho't himſelf

alive, in a good Condition; and that he was in a fair Way to obtain Life by the Deeds of the Law: But when the Commandment was ſet home upon his Conſcience, and the Spirit of God convinced him of his Sin by the Law, his vain Hopes died away, and he found himſelf in a State of ſpiritual Death, dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. And this is the Caſe of the cloſeſt Hypocrites and moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Formaliſts, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to convince and reprove them of Sin: When he thus by his Word of Providence ſheweth them their Work, and their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that they have exceeded; they can no longer cover their Sins, nor flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their evil Ways. Their own Hearts condemn them, and they ſee themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Judgment of that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is greater than their Hearts, and knoweth all Things. And accordingly they are ready to fall down before God and confeſs with them, <hi>We are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind, have taken us away,</hi> Iſa. 64.6. Whence followeth deep Concern, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt overwhelming Anguiſh and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of Soul. Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Work <hi>the Spirit of God maketh Men ſenſible of the deadly Evil of Sin, and of their miſerable State <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Guilt,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004803_0025_100DF21245323340"/>
and Dominion of it.</hi> As the Spirit of God ſhews Sinners the Guilt and Power of their Sins, ſo he declareth to them the dreadful Puniſhment which they lie expos'd to as Tranſgreſſors of the Law; that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Sin is Death, not only temporal, but eternal Death. <hi>Is not Deſtruction to the Wicked? and a ſtrange Puniſhment to the Workers of Iniquity?</hi> Job 31.3. Yes ſurely, and when the Spirit of God pleaſeth, he can make the ſtouteſt Sinner ſenſible of it. Such is the Folly and Madneſs bound up in the Hearts of Men, that they are ready to make a mock of Sin. While aſleep in carnal Security, they dream of enjoying the Pleaſures of Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enduring the Puniſhment. <hi>He flattereth himſelf in his own Eyes, until his Iniquity be found to be hateful.</hi> Pſ. 36.2. Thus it is ſaid of the <hi>Young Man,</hi> void of Underſtanding, when enticed by the Adultereſs, <hi>He goeth after her ſtraightway, as an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a Fool to the correction of the ſtocks: Till a Dart ſtrike through his Liver, as a Bird haſteth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for his Life,</hi> Prov. 7.22, 23. Men do not know, they will not conſider the End of Sin, tho' faithfully warn'd in God's Word; and ſo they often go on in the Ways which lead to Death, till they are ſuddenly deſtroy'd. <hi>The ſimple paſson, and are puniſhed,</hi> Prov. 22.3. And the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> the Devil, is ſtill ready to tempt us as he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Eve, Ye ſhall not ſurely

die:</hi> This ſubtle Tempter ſeeks to allure Men, by ſetting before them the carnal Pleaſures and Profits of Sin; and at the ſame Time laboureth to divert their Minds from all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration of the Puniſhement. Alas, how ſucceſsfully! It is ſuppoſed that there might be found among God's People, Man or Woman, that would ſay, <hi>I shall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, to add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt:</hi> But the Lord threatens, <hi>That he will not ſpare him, but the Anger of the Lord and his Jealouſy ſhall ſmoke againſt that Man, and all the Curſes written in this Book ſhall lie upon him,</hi> Deut. 29.18, 20. And accordingly, when the Spirit of God ſhoots the Arrows of Conviction into the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Heart, he ſheweth him the daring Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this, and maketh him know that Sin is an evil Thing, and will be bitterneſs in the End. The Spirit makes Men feel the Plague of their own Hearts, and the deadly Wounds Sin hat given them. Now they find that Deſcription agreeth to them; <hi>The whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart is faint. From the ſole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no ſoundneſs in it; but Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores,</hi> Iſa. 1.5, 6. When the Word of God is thus impreſs'd upon the Sinner's Heart, it is <hi>like Fire,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Light it gives to diſcern the Evil of Sin, and the Pain and Miſery inflicted on the Soul conſequent upon this. Thus the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004803_0026_100DF214C6D80F58"/>
Spirit of God ſhews Men the great Evil of an Heart of Unbelief whereby they depart from the living God, and reject the only Saviour, by ſuch a Word as that, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16. The great Evil of an hard and impenitent Heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Warth, by ſuch a Word as that, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 1 3 3. And their Conſciences are inflamed with painful Apprehenſions of the burning Wrath of God due to them for their Sins. Now that Word cometh home to them, <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. And ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their miſerable State, they cry out with the <hi>Prodigal, I periſh.</hi> Luke 15.17. They no longer dream that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin can be ſeparated from the Puniſhment; but now find they have to do with an holy heart-ſearching jealous God, that will by no means clear the guilty. God ſpeaks to them by his Word, together with the inward Impreſſions of his Spirit, as Pſal. 50.21, 21. <hi>Theſe Things haſt thou done and I kept ſilence: thou thoughteſt that I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a one as they ſelf: but I will reprove thee, and let them in order before thine Eyes. Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leaſt I tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> And while the Spirit of God is thus a spirit of Bondage, the Sinner trembleth for Fear of God, and is afraid of his Judgments. Thus
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004803_0026_100DF214C6D80F58"/>
We read <hi>The Sinners in Zion are afraid, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hath ſuriſed the Hypocrites: who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſhall dwell with the devouring Fire? Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi> Iſa. 33.14. They now know the Terrors of the Lord, and find that he is of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Eyes than to behold Evil, and can't look on Iniquity without Abhorrence. They are in Anguiſh while their Sins lie heavy upon them, and the iron Yoke galls their Conſciences. And are ready to complain that their Iniquities are gone over their Heads, as an heavy Burden too heavy for them to bear. Yea, now the Sinner is ſometimes almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with Fear leſt God ſhould take him away with a Stroke, and caſt him into Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Spirit of God reproveth of Sin, <hi>He brings the Sinner to humble himſelf before God.</hi> When the Arrows of Conviction are ſharp in the Hearts of the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>the People fall down under him,</hi> Pſal. 45.5 Thus it is when our Lord rides forth on the Word of Truth accompanied with the holy Spirit, the Sinner lieth proſtrate at his Feet, ſenſible that it is a dreadful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God, as an Avenger of Sin. Now there is a Work of Humiliation wrought, in which the Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the Sinner's Spirit is quelled, and he is caſt down convinced that he can't reſiſt God,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004803_0027_100DF2176B571BA8"/>
and proſper. He is made ſenſible that God can break him in Pieces, and that none is able to deliver out of his Hand. Such a Word as that is ſet home upon his Conſcience. <hi>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my Hand. For I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and ſay, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering Sword, and mine hand take hold on Judgment; I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</hi> And when the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Sinner finds himſelf thus in the Hands of that God, who is able to ſave or deſtroy forever; he lieth down in the Duſt before him. Now the lofty Looks of Men are humbled, and God is exalted. Thus when God denounced dreadful Threatnings againſt <hi>Ahah,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>And it came to paſs when Ahah heard thoſe Words, that he rent his Cloathes, and put Sackcloth upon his Fleſh, and faſted, and lay in Sacrcloth, and went ſoftly,</hi> 1 Kings 21.27. Yea, ſuch was his Humiliation, though here was no true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Repentance, that God was pleas'd to take a gracious Notice of it, and mitigate the Judgment threatned, 29th <hi>ver. Seeſt thou how Ahah humbleth himſelf before me? becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days.</hi> In like manner, the cruel hardy <hi>Jailor</hi> fell
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004803_0027_100DF2176B571BA8"/>
down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> as the Servants of the moſt high God, humbly to intreat them to ſhew him the Way of Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29, 30. Had he done this to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, they would have rejected it with Abhorrence. He did it, as a judicous Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor ſuppoſeth, "being moved by the Fear of God's Judgments thus to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf"<note n="*" place="bottom">Calvin.</note>When Men are thus convinced, their haughty and ſtubborn Spirits are bro't down, they are forced to quit their carnal Confidences as Refuges of Lies, and are bro't before God, as the Servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> came in his Name, before the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with Ropes upon their Heads; and with that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Requeſt, <hi>I pray thee let me live.</hi> To allude to thoſe Words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.31, 32. For they now find that they lie at God's Mercy, and have a dread of his fiery Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation leſt it ſhould conſume them. We read, that <hi>The Wicked, through the Pride of his Countenance, will not ſeek after God,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. But when God cometh upon the Sinner by his Spirit to ſhew him his Sin and Miſery, and the Danger he is in of being broken to Pieces in the Day of his Wrath; then you ſhall hear him cry, <hi>Mercy Lord,</hi> Mercy for a miſerable Sinner, or I periſh!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:004803_0028_100DF2191745A058"/>4. When the Spirit doth thus convince of Sin, <hi>He maketh the Sinner confeſs his Sin, and exciteth him to reform his Life.</hi> Tho' in this Work there is not a Principle of ſaving Grace infus'd in Oppoſition to Sin, yet Sin is made bitter from the Fruits of it; ſo that while the Spirit of God doth in this manner ſtrive with the Sinner, and impreſſeth on his Mind a dread of God's Wrath, he dare, not go on in his evil Courſes, and can't, reliſh the Pleaſures of Sin, as when he liv'd in carnal Security, fearing leſt that Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould be fulfill'd upon him; <hi>How much ſhe hath glorified herſelf, and lived delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſo much Torment and Sorrow give her,</hi> Rev. 18.7. His Caſe is like that expreſs'd Job 20.12—14. <hi>Though Wickedneſs be ſweet in his Mouth, though he hide it under his Tongue; Though he ſpare it, and forſake it not; but keep it ſtill within his Mouth: Yet his Meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the Gall of Aſps within him.</hi> And now the Burden of Sin lieth ſo heavy upon the Conſciences of Men, that they are compel'd as it were to ſeek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by confeſſing their Sins before God; and they find themſelves conſtrain'd to cry out of their ſad and wretched State before Men. When <hi>Samuel</hi> reproved <hi>Saul</hi> for not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroying <hi>Amalek,</hi> tho' at firſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to excuſe himſelf, yet when the Prophet declared to him that becauſe he had rejected the Word of the Lord, God had
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004803_0028_100DF2191745A058"/>
alſo rejected him from being King; being convicted in his Conſcience, he ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.24. And now the Sinner is ſick of his Sin, and caſts it up. He can't now drink down Iniquity like Water with greedineſs and delight, as he did before; but rather abſtains from the outward Commiſſion of it, and formeth Reſolutions againſt it. If tempted, while the Spirit is thus ſtriving with him, it is as if you ſhould offer pleaſant Drink to a Man, and at the ſame Time aſſure him that there is Poiſon in the Cup He for the preſent at leſt, puts away Sin for Fear of Wrath, and turns from his wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. You may obſerve a viſible Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in him. While theſe ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the Spirit are upon him, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from the Commiſſion of Sin; but then if he is leſt to quench theſe good Motions, and the Spirit is provok'd to depart from him, and ceaſe ſtriving; we have his diſmal Caſe deſcribed, 2 Pet. 2.20,— 22.— <hi>If after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World thro' the Knowlege of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome; the latter End is worſe with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004803_0029_100DF21B99A7E2E8"/>
to his own Vomit again; and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire</hi> O it is a dreadful Thing to Sin againſt ſuch Light, and ſtifle ſuch Convictions of the Spirit! Let ſuch as are favour'd with them take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and beware of this moſt dangerous and provoking Evil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this Work <hi>the Spirit of God ſheweth Men the utter Inſufficiency of Creature-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to afford Relief to their troubled Minds.</hi> While Men are ſecure in Sin, they are very prone to Promiſe themſelves Satisfaction in their outward Enjoyments, and ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd about obtaining the Favour of God. <hi>They ſpend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to the Grave. Therefore they ſay unto God, Depart from us, for we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways,</hi> Job 21.13, 14 The Riches and Pleaſures of this Life often divert Men's Minds from a ſerious Attention to the Calls of the Goſpel. When invited to partake of the rich Proviſion God had made for periſhing Sinners; <hi>They make Light of it, and go their Ways, one to his Farm, another to his Merchandiſe,</hi> Matth. 22.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> They are ready to ſay with the rich Man <hi>Soul, thou haſt much Goods laid up for many Years; take, thine Eaſe, eat, drink and be merry,</hi> Luke 12.19. But now when the Spirit of God convinceth the Sinner of the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition of his Soul, he ſays to him, The

Fool, this Night thy Soul may be required of thee; you hang over the bottomleſs Pit by the ſlender Thread of a frail Life, and may before to Morrow lift up your Eyes in Torments. And when thus reprov'd of their Sin and Folly, their carnal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Satisfaction in Creatures are blaſted, and their Mirth is turned into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs. None of their worldly Enjoyments appear to them as they did before; they have loſt their Reliſh for them. For now they are convinced that theſe Things can't profit in the Day of Wrath, nor redeem them from Deſtruction. Yea, If they have gotten their earthly Poſſeſſions by unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practices, the Spirit of God ſheweth them that they have been treaſuring up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. And now they are ready to ſay, What ſhall it profit us, tho' we gain the whole World, and loſe our Souls? What good will theſe Things do us, if we muſt ſink down under the Weight of God's Wrath, and periſh forever in Hell? Alas! we ſhall be the more miſerable upon the Account of them, in the terrible Day of the Lord. And thus are they brought to realiſe it, that if they would find reſt for their Souls, they muſt ſeek better Things. And are convinced of the great Evil of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Happineſs in Creatures, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:004803_0030_100DF21D96BB2EF0"/>Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, <hi>He exciteth them to ſeek Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the diligent uſe of the Means of Grace and Salvation.</hi> Now they find that nothing can give them Eaſe, while the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Sin lieth heavy upon them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they are concern'd to ſeek the Lord in the Ways of his own Appointment, if haply they may find him who alone is able to ſave them from Sin &amp; Death. Before they might caſt; off Fear, and reſtrain Prayer; but now they cry for Mercy. Indeed the Force of Education and Cuſtom may prevail with Men to attend religious Duties, but then this is done in formality, and with little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about their Souls. Whereas when the holy Spirit cometh upon Men to convince them of their Sin and Danger, his Voice is like that Jonah 1.6. <hi>What meaneſt thou, O Sleeper? ariſe, call upon thy God, if ſo be that God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</hi> And when theſe Convictions are ſtrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are ready to make that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry with great Seriouſneſs, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16.30. And to ſay with them who were pricked in their Heart, Men and Brethren, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And now it may be ſaid of them as of <hi>Saul.</hi> Behold, <hi>he prayeth,</hi> Acts 9.11 No doubt <hi>Saul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a Phariſee, had made many Prayers before this; but now in anguiſh of Spirit we
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004803_0030_100DF21D96BB2EF0"/>
may ſuppoſe he was ready to ſay with the <hi>Publican, Lord be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> The Whole need not the Phyſician; but when Sinners are made to feel the Smart of thoſe deadly Wounds which Sin hath given them, and at the ſame Time hear of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; they are preſſed in Spirit to ſeek to him, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave me, or I periſh.</hi> Now they alſo attend to the preaching of the Word after another manner than before, finding that the Threatnings and Reproofs of God's Word belong to them, and being concern'd to flee from the Wrath to come. Their Fears urge them to mind the Duties of Religion, and to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, leſt their Day of Grace ſhould end before they have obtain'd an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. For now they dread the Damnation of Hell.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Spirit of God beats Men off from a carnal Dependance on their religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſheweth them that their Salvation muſt come from God alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be fear'd that many who have been under Convictions, and ſo turned from open Impiety to ſome outward Reformation and Attendance on religious Duties, ſtop here, and never go out to Chriſt for Salvation. Our Lord aſſureth us that there are <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> in the viſible Church, that content themſelves with an outward Proſeſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004803_0031_100DF220E53B8268"/>
being concerne'd to obtain the Oil of ſaving Grace in their Hearts; and then fall aſleep in carnal Security, until they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked by the Midnight Cry, Go ye out to meet him. And then they are wholly at a loſs, finding the Door of Mercy ſhut againſt them. They cry, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He anſwereth, I know you not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And therefore, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to carry on his Work, he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Men of the great Evil and Danger of their reſting here, without a ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, and Union with Chriſt by Faith. He ſheweth them more and more the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Hearts, and the abſolute Neceſſity of their being renewed in the Spirit of their Minds after the Image of God; that <hi>except they are born again, they can't ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And convinceth them that if they are ſaved after all, it muſt not be according to Works which they have done, but according to the free Grace and Mercy of God, thro' the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. The Promiſe is not made to them <hi>that labour, and are heavy laden;</hi> but to them who being heavy laden with the Burden of their Sins, <hi>Go to Chriſt</hi> upon his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Call and Invitation; <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Matth. 11.28. And our Lord declareth, <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. Now we
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004803_0031_100DF220E53B8268"/>
go to Chriſt in the Exerciſe of Faith. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt. 35. v.</hi> Nor is the Promiſe made to them that attend religious Duties meerly from a ſlaviſh Fear and dread of Wrath, and without any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Regard to the Glory of God. Indeed, It is not Sin for Perſons while Unconverted, to pray to God, hear his Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, Such Duties as theſe God requireth of them, and they are to be exhorted and encouraged to ſeek the Lord in theſe Ways of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, forasmuch as God has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found of Men while in the diligent uſe of Means; but then they muſt be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they fail in the manner of their attending upon theſe religious Duties. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. And therefore, if Men depend on the Diſcharge of theſe religious Duties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of uſing them as Means to lead them to Chriſt that they may be juſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Faith in him, they reſt on a ſandy Foundation which will certainly fail them. Accordingly when the Spirit of God carrieth on his Work, he reproveth this Phariſaic Pride, and convinceth Men of the great Evil of it: So that they dare not ſtand before God, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the Week, I give
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004803_0032_100DF223295C4990"/>
Tithes of all I poſſeſs,</hi> Luke 18.12. No, but rather with the <hi>Publican,</hi> cry for Mercy, after all the Pains they have taken to ſeek the Lord in the Way of Duty. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſheweth Men that <hi>except their Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, they ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. And maketh them ſenſible that notwithſtanding all their Labours in Duty and outward Reformations, God might damn them, ſhould he deal with them in a Way of ſtrict Juſtice; and that if they are ſaved, their Salvation muſt come from the Lord. And thus is the Way of the Lord prepared by the Spirit, that the Son of God may come into the Hearts of his choſen Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and give reſt to their weary Souls. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Work hath not a cauſal Virtue to produce ſaving Grace, as has been hinted. After all, there muſt be a ſaving Change wrought in all the Powers of the Soul by the Spirit of God, that we may receive Jeſus Chriſt upon the gracious Offer and Command of the Goſpel. We muſt have Jeſus Chriſt revealed to us, and have that Faith wrought in us by the Spirit, whereby we may cloſe with him on Goſpel-Terms; and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance whereby we may turn from all Sin unto God. There muſt be ſuch Conviction of our Need of Righteouſneſs, and of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as that we
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004803_0032_100DF223295C4990"/>
may depend on him entirely for Juſtification before God. And there muſt be ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Judgment, as that we may ſubmit to the Son of God as our Lord and Judge, ſaying, <hi>O Lord our God, other lords beſides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name.</hi> Iſa. 26.13. O that this may be the happy Iſſue of the Spirit's ſtriving with elder and youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Perſons! And may none be left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and quench his good Motions! <hi>Come, O Breath, and breathe upon theſe ſlain, that they may live!</hi>

It's true, there may be conſiderable Variety as to the Degree of the Spirit's Operation. Some may have greater Terror, and of longer Continuance than others, as we before obſerved. But then, We have Reaſon to conclude that the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Bondage unto Fear, to every unconverted Perſon grown to Years of Underſtanding and Judgment, before He

is a Spirit of Regeneration and Adoption. And therefore ſuch as are confident of their being in a State of Salvation, without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin, and painful Senſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing and deſtroying Evil of it is; have juſt Reaſon to fear that they deceive themſelves. Our Saviour declareth to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who were puff'd up with a proud and falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves, that they were <hi>wretched,</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> before He counſels them to come to him for <hi>Gold tried in the Fire,</hi> that they might be enriched with ſaving Grace more precious than Gold, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. Let us then examine and try ourſelves, whether we have ever felt the Burden of our Sins too heavy for us to bear, and been made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the vile Corruption of our Hearts; ſo as to cry to God for Deliverance, being convinced that nothing ſhort of his Almighty Power and Grace can ſave us. And here, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Caſe, that ſome of you were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted while very Young, yet it is incumbent on you to inquire, whether you have ſuch a ſpiritual Sight of the Evil of Sin, as to be in bitterneſs upon the Account of it, and to be excited to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. This is plain, That the beſt of Men in this imperfect State have reaſon to cry out, <hi>Lord, Help our Unbelief!</hi> And to groan out that Complaint, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from

Surely then, there's weighty Reaſon why we ſhould all of us look into the State of our Souls, and inquire what Convictions we have experienced, and what hath been the Iſſue of them.

Let your Zeal for the Ordinances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and be manifeſted in your conſtant and diligent Attendance on the publick Worſhip, in an eſpecial Manner on the <hi>Lord's-Day.</hi> And when you wait upon God in the uſe of the Means of Grace, always bear in Mind thoſe Words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to Profit,</hi> Iſa. 58.17. And let that Apoſtolical Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be duely regarded by you, <hi>We beſeech you Brethren, to know them that labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; And to eſteem them very highly in Love for their Works ſake. And be at Peace among your ſelves.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.12, 13.

we are to ſtudy the Things which make for Peace, the more likely ſhall we be to edify one another. When Brethren dwell together in unity, God commandeth the Bleſſing on <hi>Zion,</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. Let us then avoid all unchriſtian Heats and Animoſities, all raſh judging and cenſuring one another: And in oppoſition to this, let all unite their beſt Endeavours, in their ſeveral Places, to promote the great Intereſt of pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion; that Chriſt may increaſe, and his Kingdom flouriſh among us. And may it pleaſe the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to bleſs you and all his People by fulfilling that good Word, Ezek. 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the Houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.

               <q>It is the Work of the Holy Spirit, to convince Men of Righteouſneſs.</q>
               <p>Under this Doctrine and for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, we may conſider the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is here intended by <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is here intended by Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In this I think Expoſitours are generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and the 10th v. applieth it to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:004803_0040_100DF23839ECC028"/>More particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God convinceth Men <hi>that Jeſus of Nazareth is Chriſt the Righteous; the true Meſſiah, and no Impoſtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Words are underſtood by fome as eſpecially intending Chriſt's own <hi>perſonal Righteouſneſs.</hi> Jeſus is the Son of God, and one with the Father in the eſſential Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Rectitude of the divine Nature. <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> John 10.30. And to him thoſe Words, Pſal, 45.6, 7. are applied, Heb. 1.8, 9. <hi>But unto the Son</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a ſceptre of righteouſneſs is the ſceptre of thy kingdom: Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And in his humane Nature taken into perſonal Union with his divine, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from all even the leaſt Sin from his Conception and Birth, and thro'out his whole Life. Thus it was ſaid to the bleſſed Virgin. <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God</hi> Luk. 1.35. And as to his Life, none could ever convince him of Evil; for he did none, nor was Guile found in his Mouth. Yea, his holy Father who ſeeth in ſecret, ſaw no Defect or Blemiſh in him. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed</hi> Matth. 3.17. <hi>Such an high prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb, 7.26. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004803_0040_100DF23839ECC028"/>
He was accuſed as a Deceiver a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners. But even then, Wiſdom was juſtified of her Children, and there were ſome who beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father. The Characters given of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> unite in him, and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> declareth concerning Him, <hi>Ye Men of Iſrael, hear theſe Words; Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, a Man approved of God among you, by Miracles, and Wonders and Signs, which God did by him in the midſt of you,</hi> Act 2.2 2. And tho' he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors, yet we muſt remember that he ſuffered the <hi>Juſt</hi> for the <hi>Unjuſt.</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was cut off, but not for himſelf. Accordingly we find in the ſacred Hiſtory that <hi>Pilate</hi> his Judge pronounc'd him innocent; and <hi>Judas</hi> who had the greateſt Advantages to know his Maſter's Life and Converſation, in great Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror confeſs'd that he had <hi>betrayed the innocent Blood.</hi> And when <hi>Peter</hi> charged the Jews with this horrible Crime, of <hi>denying the holy One and the Juſt,</hi> and deſiring a Murderer to be granted unto them, great Numbers were convinced of their hanious Sin in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Lord of Glory, and brought to truſt in him as the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and only Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is in Chriſt a mediatorial Righteouſneſs to be imputed to his People for their Juſtification before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:004803_0041_100DEE3FC85ECAB0"/>And this is ſuppos'd by worthy Expoſitors to be principally intended in the Words. One of the glorious Titles given to our Lord Jeſus is that, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. It was propheſied of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that he ſhould finiſh the Tranſgreſſion, make an end of Sins, make Reconciliation for Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. And it is no ſmall Part of the Glory of the Goſpel, that in it the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.16, 17. Here it is declared that the Son of God in our Nature was <hi>made Sin</hi> for his People, the Iniquities of God's People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid upon him; that <hi>they might he made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> having his perfect Righteouſneſs imputed to them for their Juſtification, when they receive him by Faith. Indeed this great Doctrine was to the carnal Jews a ſtumbling-Block. <hi>For they being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10.3. And it was to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fooliſhneſs. They imagin'd it was an abſurd Thing to truſt in Chriſt for Righteouſneſs, who was crucified as if he had been the vileſt Malefactor. But now, when the Spirit of God has convinced his People of their Sin, and made them ſenſible that they muſt go out of themſelves for Righteouſneſs, he revealeth the Son to them, in whom God
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004803_0041_100DEE3FC85ECAB0"/>
is reconciling the World to himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Iniquities; and maketh manifeſt <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.21, 22. This divine Spirit ſheweth them the Fulneſs, the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of this Righteouſneſs for their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and enableth them, even when they have the deepeſt Senſe of the greatneſs of their Sins, to rely upon Chriſt, that they may be accepted as Righteous with God. Thus it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> after Chriſt was revealed unto him. Tho' he had ſome of the ſtrongeſt Temptations to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge Confidence in the Fleſh, yet he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all loſs for Chriſt. <hi>But what Things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt. Yea doubtleſs, and I count all Things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> Phil. 3.7,— 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Righteouſneſs may intend <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt communicated to his People for their Sanctification; and to make them meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:004803_0042_100DF23CDAA453E8"/>Chriſt is of God made unto his People <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> alſo <hi>Sanctification.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. As they have His perfect Righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them for their Juſtification before God; ſo they derive <hi>inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> from him when they are renewed after the Image of God. Our Lord Jeſus is the Head of all gracious Influences, and with him is the Spring of our ſpiritual Life. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> Col. 1.19. And <hi>of his fulneſs we receive, &amp; Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. Now when the Spirit of God hath convinced Men that they are by Nature empty of Grace, and utterly impotent to ſpiritual Good, he ſheweth them alſo that Chriſt has purchaſed abundance of Grace and of the Gift of Righteouſneſs to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to his People; and that there is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain open'd in him to cleanſe not only from the Guilt; but alſo from the Defilements of Sin, till Believers ſhall be preſented Fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs before him. The holy Spirit convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Men that Chriſt muſt be the <hi>Author and Finiſher of Faith,</hi> and other Graces in them; and that tho' of themſelves they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet that thro' Chriſt ſtrengthning them, they may do all Things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We proceed to ſhew, <hi>That it is the Work of the Spirit to convince Men of this Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:004803_0042_100DF23CDAA453E8"/>Here I may ſay, that it is the holy Spirit who maketh the effectual Application of the Redemption purchas'd by Chriſt to the Souls of Men. <hi>We are ſaved by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſhed on us abundantly thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. The Grace of our Lord Jeſus, and the Love of God are brought home to his choſen People, by the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt. And in particular, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Evidence and Conviction of the great Doctrines of the Goſpel reſpecting Chriſt's Perſon as God-Man, and reſpecting his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, are from the ſame Spirit. Agreably, our Saviour declared to his Diſciples, ver. 1.3. Cont. <hi>When He the Spirit of Truth come, he will guide you into all Truth.</hi> The Word is emphatical, and ſignifieth not only that the Spirit would diſcover theſe Truths in the Notion of them; but alſo that he would lead his Diſciples into an experimental Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, ſo that they ſhould live and act under the governing Influence of them. It follows, 14. v. <hi>He ſhall glorify me: for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth to the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Glory, to give to the chriſtian <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, in the Knowledge of him, the Eyes of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being enlightned; that they might know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his

Power to them that believe,</hi> according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.16,— 20. And the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, declareth that <hi>theſe Things are revealed by the Spirit:</hi> for the Spirit ſearcheth all Things, yea, the deep Things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. As the Spirit moved on the Face of the Waters, when Darkneſs was on the Face of the Deep, and created the Light; ſo in the new Creation, he moveth on the Hearts of his People, and gives them the Light of the Knowledge of Chriſt and his <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Spirit of God then is the Author of this Conviction. It is he that reneweth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Knowledge, when he forms the new Man in them. Agreably we read of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4. And when the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had ſaid that Chriſt <hi>came by Water and Blood,</hi> that he might ſave us both from the Guilt and Defilement of Sin; he further obſerveth in the ſame Verſe; <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth Witneſs, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.6. It is the divine Spirit then who declareth to Men that we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thro' the Blood of Jeſus, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We may conſider <hi>the Means which the Spirit of God uſeth to convince Men of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:004803_0043_100DF241E6BB4C68"/>1. The Spirit of God <hi>maketh uſe of his Word</hi> to convince Men of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour declareth that <hi>the Scriptures teſtify of him,</hi> John 5.39. And if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſult the Prophecies, Types and Promiſes of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> relating to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and then compare them with the Revelation and Hiſtory of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we ſhall find a wonderful Harmony and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between them, and be obliged to acknowledge that in ſending <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ſave his People from their Sins, God has perform'd the Mercy promis'd to the Fathers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his holy Covenant. Now <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy came not in old Time by the Will of Man: but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. Accordingly it is ſaid of them who prophecied of the Grace which ſhould come unto us; that they ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched diligently <hi>what manner of Time the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, which was in them did ſignify, when it teſtifyed beforehand the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. If we read, Pſal, 22. Iſa, 7.14.53. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and many other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Promiſes of the Old Teſtament, we ſhall ſee that the Spirit of God in and by his inſpired Word did teſtify of Chriſt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the perfect Righteouſneſs which he was to bring in for the Juſtification of Sinners. <hi>By his Knowledge,</hi> by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  </gap> 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. Our Saviour while in the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry upon Earth, applied to himſelf the famous Prophecy we have recorded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, — 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the Poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach Deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the Blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 4 18, 19. ver 21, 2. <hi>This Day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears. And ail bare him witneſs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his Mouth.</hi> And after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he had rebuk'd two of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for being ſo ſlow of Heart to believe all that the Prophets had ſpoken, it is ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the Things concerning himſelf,</hi> Luke 24.27. And it is plain our Lord accompanied his Word with the Light and Heat of his divine Spirit; for they ſaid one to another, <hi>Did not our Heart burn</hi> within us, while he talked with us by the Way, and <hi>while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> Ver. 32. And after Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, when the Spirit of God was poured out from on High, the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of Chriſt did
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004803_0044_100DF243E14B77D0"/>
evidently prove from the Scriptures that Jeſus was the Chriſt, to the ſaving Conviction of great Numbers, and the Confuſion of his implacable Enemies. Thus it was when the preaching of the Word was attended with the Power of the Holy Ghoſt. Many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and turned to the Lord. The full Evidence of Scripture, when thus impreſs'd on the Mind, can't be gainſayed. We read of <hi>Apollos</hi> who was mighty in the Scriptures, and fervent in the Spirit, that <hi>he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Scriptures, that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi> Acts 18 28. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that there was a Vail over the Hearts of the <hi>Jews</hi> in reading of the Old Teſtament; which is done away in Chriſt, 2 Cor. 3.14. He then adds, ver. 18. <hi>We all with open Face, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> So clear and powerful is the Reflection of the Glory of Chriſt from the Word of God, when the Spirit removeth the Vail of ſpiritual Blindneſs. Now the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhineth into the Heart, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>by his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:004803_0045_100DF2467A19D720"/>We read of Chriſt, that he was <hi>delivered for our Offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. "By the Merit of his Death, he paid our Debt, in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he took out our Acquittance" When he ſuffered on the Croſs, the Sins of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were laid upon him as their Surety, and had he not given full Satisfaction to divine Juſtice for them, he muſt have been held in the Priſon of the Grave, he could never have riſen from the dead. But Jeſus is riſen according to his Word and Promiſe, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three Days I will raiſe it up.</hi> Joh. 2.19. We have inconteſtible Proof of this important Fact in the holy Scriptures, particularly from many faithful Witneſſes who ſealed their Teſtimony with their Blood. Now this great Work of Chriſt's Reſurrection is aſcrib'd to the Father, to the Son himſelf; and he is alſo ſaid to be <hi>quickened by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. And he is ſaid to be <hi>declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1.4. And indeed this is a ſtrong Proof that our Saviour was the Perſon he profeſſed himſelf to be, the Son of God by eternal Generation.

And there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of Fire, and it ſat upon each of them: And they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> Acts 2.2.—4. And while many of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Languages were amazed to hear the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpeak the wonderful Works of God in their own Tongues, and others mocked. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> declared that this was the Work of the Holy Ghoſt given by our aſcended Saviour. <hi>Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Father the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> 33.

And no doubt, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts, there was alſo given to the Apoſtles by the ſame Spirit, a great Increaſe of ſpiritual Knowledge and Faith, Zeal and Courage, Humility and Patience, Love to God and Man, and other Graces, to carry them well thro' their Services and Sufferings for the Name of Jeſus. Our Saviour promiſed his Diſciples, that he would give them <hi>a Mouth and Wiſdom which all their Adverſaries ſhould not be able to gainſay, orreſiſt,</hi> Luk. 21.15.

And required them not to be anxiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd how or what they ſhould ſpeak when brought before Governours and Kings for his ſake; for ſays our Lord, <hi>It is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which is in you,</hi> Matth. 10.20. Accordingly when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had wrought a wonderful Miracle in reſtoring a Man lame from his Mother's Womb, and <hi>Peter</hi> fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, had declared that it was by the Name of Jeſus, that the Man ſtood before them whole, and then that there was no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved: It is obſerved, Acts 4.13. <hi>Now when they ſaw the boldneſs of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jeſus.</hi> Yea, theſe Enemies of Chriſt were convicted by their own Conſciences that a notable Miracle had been done, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And no leſs wonderful was the Succeſs of their Miniſtry, while the A poſtles went about thus miraculouſly furniſhed, and preached a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour.

win Chriſt, and enjoy the Bleſſedneſs of the inviſible World where He is! Such was the wonderful Succeſs of the Goſpel when preached <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven.</hi> Accordingly, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, <hi>That God hath choſen the fooliſh Things of this World, to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak Things of the World to confound the mighty; And baſe Things of the World, and Things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things which are.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28 Here thoſe Words may be well applied, <hi>Not by Mighty, nor by Power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Zoch. 4.6 Now ſurely the Spirit of Truth and Holineſs would never have wrought ſuch Works of Grace by the preaching of the Name of Jeſus, had not He been Chriſt the Righteous. 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Without controverſy, great is the myſtery of godlineſs: God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtifyed in the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. I would offer <hi>ſome brief Deſcription of this Work of the Spirit, in convincing Men of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Work the Spirit of God doth not only give external Evidence in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's Word; but alſo applieth himſelf inwardly to the Heart, and opens the Underſtanding to diſcern theſe ſpiritual Things concerning Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8"/>
after a ſpiritual manner. So that ſuch as are thus favoured, ſee the Son, and believe on him as the true Meſſiah and only Saviour, with that Faith which <hi>is the Evidence of Things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. The Spirit of God enlightens the Minds of his People with the ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Agreeably the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, 1 Joh. 2.30. <hi>Ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all Things,</hi> i.e. All Things concerning Chriſt and the chriſtiain Religion neceſſary to Salvation. The Spirit of God may be compared to <hi>Oyl,</hi> as this was uſed for Light, and in Medicine. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit heals the viſive Faculty of the Soul, and removeth ſpiritual Blindneſs. He reneweth his People in Knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Lord had declared to the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans</hi> that they were blind, he counſels them to <hi>anoint their Eyes with Eye-ſalve, that they might ſee,</hi> Rev. 3.18. And when this Work is wrought by the Illumination of the Spirit, the Goſpel-Revelation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, appeareth in a new Light. The <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſeth</hi> upon the convinced Sinner, <hi>with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Wings</hi> "or in his Beams". The Doctrine of God our Saviour appeareth in it's Reality, Importance and Excellency.</p>
               <p>And accordingly,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8"/>1. The <hi>Work of the Spirit in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, is a ſaving Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed there may be ſome Perſwaſion of theſe Things from Education, there may be a notional Knowledge and hiſtorical Faith; yea we may have the common Illumination of the Spirit, and receive the Revelations of the Goſpel with a tranſient Joy; and yet not ſee the glorious Beauty and divine Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as to count all Things but loſs for the Excellency of the Knowledge of him. But when the Spirit convinceth Men of Righteouſneſs in the Senſe in which I now conſider the Words, there is a Renovation of the Soul in all it's Powers by vital Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Habits of Grace infuſed; ſo that Men are <hi>called out of Darkneſs, into God's marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Light.</hi> However, I do not ſuppoſe by this, that in paſſive Converſion the Spirit of God firſt giveth the Light of this ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Chriſt, and then this Light worketh an habitual Change in the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. No, I humbly conceive that in paſſive Converſion there is the habitual Change of all the Faculties of the Soul wrought at once, by the divine Operation of the Holy Spirit: And then the Underſtanding, now ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, beholds Jeſus Chriſt, in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the Will &amp; Affections are drawn to cloſe with him and cleave unto him; yea ſo as to incline them to act agreable to the Diſcovery made of this glorious Object.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004803_0050_100DF275AD8A3400"/>
This is then a ſaving Work of the Spirit of God. When <hi>Peter</hi> therefore had made that Confeſſion of his Faith, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> Our Lord pronounc'd him Happy, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 16.16, 17. Thus;to know Chriſt is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Work <hi>the Spirit of God giveth the convinced Sinner ſatisfying Evidence of Chriſt's Ability and readineſs to juſtify and ſave all that come to God by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He convinceth them that how many &amp; great ſoever their Sins have been, yet in Chriſt they may have a Righteouſneſs every way ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their Juſtification before God, and to give them a ſure Title to eternal Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new and everlaſting Covenant. While Men entertain ſlighty Tho'ts of the Evil of Sin, and of the Puniſhment due to them for it; they may alſo entertain law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Apprehenſions of Chriſt, and yet nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a carnal Confidence that He is both able and ready to ſave them: But when Men are convinced of the heinous Evil of Sin as it is an Offence againſt the infinitely glorious God, and ſo deſerveth eternal Puniſhment; now they may be ready to ſay, Can this Man ſave us? Who is able to deliver us? Surely none but the Almighry God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem

us. Unleſs the Arm of the Lord be revealed, all our Hope of Deliverance is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. But now, in this Article of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the Spirit of God revealeth Chriſt as Jehovah our Righteouſneſs, as the God of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to whom belong the Iſſues from Death; and then the convinced Sinner is able to ſay, <hi>In the Lord have I Righteouſneſs, and Strength.</hi> Now He ſeeth that He who is God hath purchas'd the Church with his own Blood, and given his Life a Ranſom for many. And this maketh it manifeſt that God may be juſt and yet juſtify the Sinner that believeth in Jeſus; yea, <hi>that thro' Faith in his Blood God declareth his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Rom. 3 25. And we have the Virtue of the Blood of Chriſt further declared by a Compariſon from the legal Sacrifices. <hi>For if the Blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the Aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the Unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh; How much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, offered himſelf without Spot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead Works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14. If we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the eternal Spirit here, of the God-head of our Lord, this gave the higheſt Virtue and Value to his Offering. And then the Holy Ghoſt ſanctified the Man Chriſt Jeſus in an extraordinary manner to this great Work, &amp; ſtrengthned him to the moſt perfect Exerciſe of Grace in the diſcharge of it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004803_0051_100DEE46F1C5E1E0"/>
ſuch as are convinced of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, behold a Fountain of Merit and Grace open'd in Chriſt to waſh away their Sins: They ſee that this divine Perſon is worthy to receive the Gift of the Ho<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Yea, the Spirit of God ſheweth theſe Things in ſuch an agreable as well as convincing Light, that the enlightned Mind is ſatisfied in this Way of obtaining the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life. This Light is ſweet to the Soul, and the Believer determineth with the Apoſtle to know nothing <hi>ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified</hi> See 1 Cor. 2.2. And then the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Chriſt's readineſs to ſave all that go to God by him. And now, they receive the Calls of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, not as the Word of Men, but of God, tho' Men may be the Inſtruments. Now they know Chriſt's Voice when He ſays, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, &amp; are heavy laden &amp; I will give you reſt. All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. They are convinced that they have a divine War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to bear them out in this important Act of truſting in Chriſt for Righteouſneſs, and a divine Promiſe of eternal Life, upon their obeying the Goſpel Call.</p>
               <p>Which leads me to ſay,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now the Call is effectual. God's People are willing in the Day of His Power. They have the great Truths of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and their Objections drawn from their own great Sinfulneſs, anſwered. And thus our Saviour taketh Poſſeſſion of the Hearts of Men, not by Violence; but by a ſweet, and yet powerful divine Influence whereby they are perſwaded to embrace Him as the Lord their Righteouſneſs. Being thus drawn by the Spirit, they freely go out to Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their own Righteouſneſs as filthy Rags, and putting on this beſt Robe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as every Way ſufficient to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Nakedneſs. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God.

And ſtill the Sin and Danger of this is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we have had the Spirit of God ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with us. When this is done againſt the Light and Conviction of our Conſciences, it is highly provoking unto God; and when there is added over and above a malicious Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Holy Ghoſt in his divine Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; this ſeems to contain in it the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of that Sin which is unto Death, and ſhall not be forgiven. When our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had caſt out a Devil by the Spirit of God, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> blaſphemed, ſaying, <hi>This Fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebuh the Prince of the Devils;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to them, <hi>that the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto Men,</hi> Matth. 12.31. And we have that awful Word for our Warning; <hi>It is impoſſible for them who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly Gift, and were made Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance: ſeeing they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> Heb. 6.4,—6. This falling away ſeems to refer to a total and wilful Apoſtacy join'd with a malicious Oppoſition to the Chriſtian Religion after we have been convinced that it is of God, and have made a Profeſſion of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall in denying his Lord, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004803_0053_100DF254562F69B0"/>
other heinous Tranſgreſſions of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, do not come under this Head. How dreadful then muſt be the Condition of ſuch Apoſtates! How aggravated their Sin and Puniſhment! <hi>Of how much ſorer Puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under Foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was ſanctified, an unholy Thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. O let us then take heed and beware of all Approaches towards this great Sin! Let us not indulge an Evil Heart of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, nor reſiſt the Spirit of God ſtriving with us. But let not any that are ſeeking the Lord with trembling, imagine that this is their Caſe, and ſo diſcourage themſelves, as if there was no Hope for them: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>USE 3. <hi>Let ſuch as are ſenſible of their Sin and Guilt, cry to God for his Spirit to give them the ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs; and to enable them to receive. Him as their only Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hath the Spirit of God convinced you of your loſt and periſhing Condition? Pray to the Father then to open your Eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Son, who is come to ſeek &amp; ſave that which was loſt: He who is mighty to ſave inviteth you to come unto him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth he will in no wiſe caſt out them that
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004803_0054_100DF2560B9DA5E8"/>
come unto him. Do not ſay then, that your Hope is loſt, and that you are utterly cut off; but rather reſolve that you will look and wait for God's Salvation. Do not Attempt to patch up a Righteouſneſs of your own; but caſt away your filthy Rags, and go out unto Chriſt for <hi>white Raiment,</hi> that you may be clothed, and that the Shame of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs may not appear. Seek of God that <hi>fine Linnen, clean &amp; white, which is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Saints,</hi> whereby they ſtand and are accepted as Righteous before God, even the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith. <hi>Put on Chriſt,</hi> and the holy God, looking on you as united to Him by a true and living Faith, will behold no Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in you ſo as to enter into Judgment, and condemn you for it. <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Rom. 8.1. Go to Chriſt then and ſay, Lord, I am guilty, I can't conceal it. My own Heart condemneth me, and thou art greater than my Heart, and knoweſt all Things. But now I humbly and thankfully accept thine offer to be my Surety and Advocate with the Father. I put my Cauſe into thine Hand, O plead it, and anſwer for me! Let the Hand-writing which is againſt me be found cancel'd in virtue of thy precious Blood, and let me be found juſtified thro' the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is Chriſt Jeſus. Lord I believe
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004803_0054_100DF2560B9DA5E8"/>
that there's Virtue enough in thy precious Blood to waſh away all my Sins, tho' they have been as Scarlet, and Red like Crimſon: Help thou mine Unbelief! Thus do by God's Grace, and you may have <hi>Confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God now, and ſhall not be aſhamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at his Coming.</hi> No, If you appear cloathed with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhall be openly acquitted in the Day of Judgment. But then remember that to whom Chriſt is made of God <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> he is alſo made <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and look to it that your Faith be that living Faith which purifieth the Heart, and worketh by Love. For <hi>that Faith which hath not Works is dead, being alone,</hi> James 2.17. And will leave you in a State of Death, and Damnation. That Faith by which God's Children depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſtification before God, is alſo a vital Principle of new Obedience. Look unto Jeſuus then, not only as to the <hi>Lord your Righteouſneſs;</hi> but alſo as to <hi>your Head of Influence,</hi> of whoſe Fulneſs his People receive and Grace for Grace. When you go forth to meet the Bridegroom, look to it that you have the Oyl of ſaving Grace in your Hearts. Thus ſtand with your Lights burning, like unto Men that wait for their Lord; ſo ſhall <hi>you be found of your Judge in Peace, without Spot, and Blameleſs.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Means which the Spirit uſeth to convince Men of this Judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall give ſome brief Diſcription of this Work of the Spirit in convincing Men of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What are we to underſtand by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>We may underſtand it of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judgment which Men paſs'd on Jeſus Chriſt, as if he ſuffer'd for his own Crimes, and his Diſciples ought to ſuffer for confeſſing his Name before Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that in his Humiliation, <hi>his Judgment was taken away,</hi> Acts 8.33. Tho' <hi>Pilate</hi> declared, having examin'd him before his Accuſers, that he found no fault in him touching thoſe Things whereof they accuſed him; yet the Voices of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and of the High Prieſts prevailed; ſo that <hi>Pilate</hi> gave Sentence it ſhould be as they requeſted, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. Many were ignorant of the Goſpel Revelation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128"/>
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this World knew: For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. And the chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is mention'd as <hi>a Sect</hi> or Hereſy <hi>every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> Acts 28.22. Thus was the holy Jeſus ſet <hi>for a Sign which ſhould be ſpoken againſt,</hi> Luke 2.34. But when the Spirit of God came to diſcharge his Office as an Advocate in behalf of our aſcended Saviour, he convinced many of the great Wrong they had done in this Matter, and rebuked them ſharply; ſo that they were brought to judge and condemn themſelves. Thus after our Lord had appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſaying by a Voice from Heaven, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt,</hi> and the Spirit of God had wrought a thorough Change in him; he freely acknowledged <hi>that he had been a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Judgment we may underſtand <hi>the Power given to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World, and to execute Judgment upon Satan, that grand Uſurper, and all that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him, in Oppoſition to the Kingdom of God.</hi> Agreeably it is ſaid, II ver. <hi>Of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Prince of this World is judged.</hi> After our Lord's Reſurrection he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>All Power is given into me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. When he aſcended on High, he led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128"/>
and broke the Power of the Enemies of our Salvation; ſo that they ſhall not be able to deſtroy ſo much as one of thoſe little Ones who put their Truſt in him. Here then it may be proper to obſerve, that the apoſtate Spirits who left their firſt Habitation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Scripture as united under one Head againſt Chriſt and his Kingdom. The <hi>Devil</hi> that old Serpent, beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and prevailed upon her to eat of the forbidden Fruit, and then by her enticed her Husband. We read, <hi>She took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo unto her Husband, with her, and he did eat,</hi> Geneſis 3 6. And thus were our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> drawn into a Rebellion againſt the Lord their Maker and great Benefactor, which muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to them and their ſinful Progeny, had not God ſent his Son <hi>to deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi> The firſt Promiſe of this was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before they were caſt out of the earthly Paradice, <hi>And I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy Seed and her Seed: it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. Here's a Sentence of Condemnation denounc'd againſt the Devil, and in the ſame Words a precious Promiſe of Deliverance made to God's People. <q>This Seed is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God, who was to be born of a Woman being a Virgin, by the Operation of the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004803_0057_100DF25D85858B30"/>
Holy Ghoſt, to diſpoſſeſs the Devil, thro' the Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Spirit, of all his Force.</q> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Dutch Annotations.</note> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>When the Falneſs of Time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5. And as our Lord was ſent to ſave the loſt Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo to confound the accurſed Plots and Devices of Satan, whereby he fought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare and ruin them forever. <hi>For aſ much then as the Children are Partakers of Fleſh and Blood, be alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame: that thro' Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Heb 2.14. Satan, by the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, has the Power of Death as an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. He is a Murderer, and a Deſtroyer. But now, the Son of God, having <hi>taken on him not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> he died on the Croſs that he might <hi>condemn Sin</hi> in the Fleſh, which is the <hi>Sting of Death,</hi> bear the Curſe of that <hi>Law</hi> which is the <hi>Strength of Sin;</hi> and ſo purchaſe Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God for his People, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, to turn Sinners from the Power of Satan unto God. And thus Satan's Kingdom, which is founded on Sin, falls to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004803_0057_100DF25D85858B30"/>
the Ground, and his deſtroying Power over Man, is taken away. And therefore when the Time of our Lord's Death drew nigh, he ſaid, <hi>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now ſhall the Prince of this Word he caſt out,</hi> John 12.31. That is, <q>My Death will be the Devil's Overthrow; will bring down Sin, and deliver the World from the Tyranny and Dominion of Satan.</q> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Burkitt.</hi>
                  </note> Our mighty Redeemer <hi>ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and triumphed over them on the Croſs,</hi> Col. 2.15. He has purchaſed a glorious Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Satan, and all our ſpiritual Enemies, Sin, this preſent evil World as under the Power the Devil, and Death. Agreably, our Lord ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World,</hi> John 16.33. We read, <hi>I will ranſom them from the Power of the Grave: I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13.14. And then the Word of God declareth, That our Lord <hi>muſt reign 'till all Enemies are put under his Feet,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies thy Footſtool.</hi> And now the <hi>Father hath committed all Judgment to the Son.</hi> He

is the Judge, Lawgiver, and King of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and as the Lord ſtrong and mighty will he go on conquering and to conquer his and his People's Enemies, 'till they ſhall be all put under him; and his People alſo ſhall have Dominion over them, in the great Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may underſtand it <hi>of the laſt and general Judgment, when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear in the Glory of his Father, to judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read, <hi>He bath appointed a Day, in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given Aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> Acts 17.31. While our Lord was upon Earth, he ſpake of this Judgment, <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall be ſit upon the Throne of his Glory. And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations;</hi> — Mat. 25.31, 32. And now he is riſen and aſcended, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt contain him until the Time of Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution of all Things, when there ſhall be an End put to the Diſorder and Confuſion bro't into the World by Sin, and all ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſay, <hi>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; Verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth.</hi> And we have an Earneſt of this in our Lord's Power to caſt out Satan, and
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004803_0058_100DF26072CA80A0"/>
in the wonderful Reformation wrought, when after his Aſcenſion, He ſent <hi>the Rod of his Strength out of Zion,</hi> his Word accompanied with his Spirit, and ſo rul'd in the midſt of his Enemies See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. But we do not as yet ſee all Things put under him, as they ſhall be in the great Day. <hi>Satan</hi> is ſtill obeyed as the God of this World, and works in the Hearts of the Children of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s Reign has not a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod put unto it. And to this Day, the <hi>dark Places of the Earth, are full of the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of cruelty.</hi> So that even in the laſt Days, there are Scoffers who ſay in Deriſion, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> But God by his Word and Spirit ſays to us, Behold, the Lord cometh! Jude 14, 1 5. <hi>v. And</hi> Enoch <hi>alſo, the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, <hi>propheſied of theſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, To execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds which they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly committed, and of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> And in that great and terrible Day of the Lord, the Devil muſt be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, to be tormented for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever. This the <hi>Devils believe, and tremble.</hi> And then ſhall wicked Men have that dreadful Sentence pronounced and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon them, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:004803_0059_100DF2623408D4D0"/>
and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25.41. Sinners have ſometimes ſuch a Conviction of this Judgment as makes them alſo tremble. As <hi>Paul rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned of Judgment to come, Felix trembled,</hi> Acts 24.25. And then ſhall the Saints have their Judgment brought forth as the Light, and their Righteouſneſs as the Noon-Day, when the King ſhall ſay unto them on his right Hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Matth. 25.34. God's People ſhall have a compleat Victory over Satan, this preſent evil World, and the laſt Enemy Death. And all the Fruits of Sin and the Curſe reſpecting them, ſhall be fully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, when <hi>Chriſt ſhall appear a ſecond Time without Sin unto Salvation.</hi> And the Spirit of God now giveth them ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this Judgment, that they look for that <hi>bleſſed Hope, and the glorious Appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. I would conſider <hi>ſome of the Means which the Holy Spirit uſeth to convince Men of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of Judgment by <hi>the miraculous Power given to the Apoſtles to caſt out Devils in the Name of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While our Lord was on Earth, he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Power. He went about doing good, and <hi>healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:004803_0059_100DF2623408D4D0"/>
Acts 10.38. He caſt down Satan, and healed many that were under a bodily Poſſeſſion. Thus our Lord caſt many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils out of a miſerable Man in the Country of the <hi>Gaderenes,</hi> Luke 8.30. <hi>Jeſus asked him, ſaying, What is thy Name? And he ſaid Legion: becauſe many Devils were entred into him.</hi> But at Chriſt's Command they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, 33 <hi>v. Then went the Devils out of the Man.</hi> And when the <hi>Seventy</hi> returned, they ſaid, Lord even the Devils are ſubject to us thro' thy Name. Upon which our Lord ſays, <hi>I beheld Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> Luke 10.18. And after our Saviour Chriſt was exalted, this Power was wonderfully manifeſted by the Hands of the Apoſtles in the Name of Jeſus. They bro't them which were <hi>vexed with unclean Spirits, and they were healed every one,</hi> Acts 5.16. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the evil Spirit that had poſſeſſed a Perſon as a Spirit of Divination; <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee in the Name of Jeſus to come out of her. And he came out the ſame Hour,</hi> Act. 16.18. Now the great Agent in this miraculous Work was the Spirit of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28. And by it he convinced Men of the Dominion of our Lord Jeſus over the Powers of Darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of Judgment <hi>by the Light of the glorious Goſpel, and the Works of Grace wrought by it.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:004803_0060_100DF264874A1E90"/>The Evil Spirits are call'd <hi>the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> Eph, 6.12. Satan's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is founded on the Darkneſs of Sin, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porred by Ignorance and Error. Accordingly, The Holy Spirit uſeth the Light of his Word to ſubdue him. Thus our Lord ſaid to <hi>Paul, I have appeared unto thee for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to make thee a Miniſter and a Witneſs both of theſe Things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe Things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee, To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26.16,—18. Now it is the Spirit of God who furniſheth and ſends forth theſe Miniſters of Chriſt to ſhew Men the miſerable Bondage they are under to Satan, and to invite them to come over to Chriſt, whom God hath ſet <hi>for an Enſign of the People,</hi> Iſa. 11.10. Our Lord while on Earth was anointed by the Spirit to preach Deliverance to the Captives. And after his Aſcenſion he ſent forth his Apoſtles, and others to publish the glad Tidings of the Goſpel.

Now it appears that Chriſt is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the ſtrong One, while the Devil is thus caſt down from his uſurped Throne in the Hearts of Men. <hi>When a ſtrong Man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace. But when a ſtronger than he ſhall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his Spoils.</hi> Luke 11.21.22.

               </p>
               <p>God is known by the Judgments which he executeth. And it hath pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commit this Judgment to the Son, the Power of puniſhing his and his People's implacable Enemies, and of correcting his Covenant-People.

See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. And thus are Sinners ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought to make Supplication to their Judge, ſenſible that it muſt be a fearful Thing to fall into his Hand as an Avenger of Sin. And when the Children of God behold how the Lord puts away the Wicked like Droſs, they cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> Now they are quickned to ſerve the Lord with Reverence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to make it evident to themſelves that they are not of thoſe who muſt be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity in the great Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I proceed in the laſt Place to <hi>give ſome brief Deſcription of this Work of the Spirit in convincing Men of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Spirit the divine Author of this Work, is called <hi>the Spirit of Judgment,</hi> Iſa 4.4. And he may be ſo call'd in part as he convinceth of Judgment. And in this Work the holy Spirit brings home the Evidence of this Judgment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by an inward Application to the Heart and Conſcience, in legal or ſaving Conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:004803_0062_100DF2698342A010"/>I. In this Work <hi>the Spirit of God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Sinner that while he refuſeth to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Chriſt as his Lord Redeemer, he is under the Power of Satan, who is leading him Captive to Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Devil is call'd the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. He is here deſcrib'd as one having others under him, the Prince of Devils, as having been we may ſuppoſe the Arch-Traitour and Leader of Rebellion to the Apoſtate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. His Power is confin'd to this lower World, and is exercis'd over ſuch as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Diſobedience towards their rightful Lord. He may tempt God's Children; but he reigns only in the Hearts of rebellious Sinners: Theſe he leads Captive at his Will; but alas! They are very inſenſible of it. The moſt do not know, will not conſider, that this old Serpent ſeeks to beguile and cheat them of their precious Souls by his Temptations from the Pleaſures, Riches and Honours of this World; and that while he gratifieth the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, he holds them faſt by theſe vile Luſts, as in Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But when the Holy Spirit cometh on Men to deliver them from the deſtroying Power of this unclean Spirit, he opens their Eyes, and ſheweth them this <hi>evil One</hi> in his own Colours. And now they are made
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004803_0063_100DF26BF267C730"/>
ſenſible that as a <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> he ſeeks to devour them; and that none can deliver them but the Lord Jeſus, who is call'd the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</hi> Now they feel that this <hi>fiery Serpent</hi> hath injected his deadly Poyſon into their Souls, and that with the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they muſt periſh, unleſs they look to the Son of God, who was lifted up on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Holy Spirit revealeth Jeſus Chriſt to Sinners as their only and Almighty Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> The Spirit of God convinceth them of the Truth of that Word, <hi>For aſmuch then as the Children were Partakers of Fleſh &amp; Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took Part of the ſame: that thro' Death he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil; And deliver them who thro' Fear of Death were all their Life-Time ſubject to Bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15. And that Chriſt is able to bring forth Judgment to Victory, by reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerable Sinners, and ſo taking the Prey out of the Hand of the Mighty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Spirit of God enableth his People to ſubmit to Chriſt as their Prince and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, renouncing the Devil and all his Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They can ſay, tho' this cruel Lord has had the Dominion over us, yet now will we make
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:004803_0063_100DF26BF267C730"/>
mention of the Name of Chriſt, as our only rightful Lord and Maſter. And they are willing that thoſe Luſts whereby Satan held them, ſhould all be ſlain before the Lord; becauſe theſe alſo are Enemies to Chriſt. Thus they go over to Chriſt, to liſt under his Banner, whom God hath given to be a <hi>Leader and Commander to the People,</hi> to bring many Sons to Glory, as the Captain of their Salvation. <hi>They are willing in the Day of God's Power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. In this reſpect, they are not as preſs'd Men; but as Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers freely offer themſelves, and ſo <hi>come to the help of the Lord, againſt the Mighty.</hi> By the Evidence of the Spirit they diſcern clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Service of Satan is vile Slavery, and the Wages Death; and accordingly they deſert him with an holy Indignation, and a a Deſire of taking an holy Revenge of him: They alſo ſee that the Service of Chriſt is glorious Liberty, and the gracious Reward, eternal Life; and accordingly they willingly ſubſcribe their Hand to the Lord, and enter into an Oath that they will be for him and for no other. And thus are they <hi>delivered from the Power of Darhneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. Satan is caſt down, and caſt out of their Hearts; ſo that tho' he may tempt, he ſhall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain uſurp Dominion over them. The Son of God in Oppoſition to this Uſurper, cometh into their Souls, and taketh Poſſeſſion of them
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:004803_0064_100DF26E9782E008"/>
as his own. And they are enabled to open the everlaſting Doors of their Hearts, that the King of Glory may come in. They ſay to the Son and Lord of <hi>David,</hi> ſomething as <hi>Amaſai</hi> to King <hi>David,</hi> when the Spirit came upon him; <hi>Thine are we</hi> David, <hi>and on thy ſide: Peace, Peace be unto thee, and Peace be to thine Helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</hi> Nor doth the Noiſe of War diſcourage them; for now the Spirit gives them a View of Chriſt as the Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle. They realiſe it that there can be no true Safety, no Victory, no Triumph; but in abiding loyal to Chriſt, and ſtanding firm on his ſide.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God convinceth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Judgment, <hi>by bruiſing Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Feet more and more, and by giving them the lively Hope of a compleat Victory over him, and all their Enemies, at the Day of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's People under this Conviction of the Spirit, behold Satan as a conquered Enemy, and believe that God will fulfill his Word <hi>by bruiſing him under their Feet.</hi> And they happily find that he that has begun the good Work is carrying it on towards Perfection againſt all Oppoſition from their ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The Spirit of God inſpireth them with Courage and Skill to reſiſt the Devil ſtedfaſtly. He teacheth them to Fight the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:004803_0064_100DF26E9782E008"/>
Battles of the Lord, looking to Jeſus Chriſt that they may <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might.</hi> He enableth them to uſe their ſpiritual Weapons with Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Succeſs. He enableth them to <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> that they may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil. To take the <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked; and the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which is the Word of God. The Spirit of God alſo is in his People a <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> helping their Infirmities, and exciting them to cry to the Lord for Grace and Strength to help them, while they are wreſtling againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World. And thus do they receive freſh Supplies and Succours from the Lord, in their times of Need. Agreeably, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, <hi>That</hi> God's People are <hi>more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, thro' Him that loved them.</hi> For I am perſwaded, ſays he, that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor Things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. And the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives Thanks to God, who always <hi>cauſed them to triumph in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.14. Our Jeſus, our <hi>Joſhua,</hi> even now cauſeth his People to put their Feet upon the Necks of their ſpiritual Enemies, and giveth them the Aſſurance of a compleat Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,

Flee youthful Luſts which War againſt the Soul; and while you ſtrive for the Maſtery, be temperate in all Thing. When Satan tempts you to walk in the Ways of your Heart, and after the Sight of your Eyes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſe it that for theſe Things <hi>God will bring you into Judgment;</hi> and then ſay, How can I do this Wickedneſs, and Sin againſt God? How ſhall I be able to lift up my Head, when I muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt? Thus reſiſt the Devil, and he ſhall flee from you. O how lovely a Sight is it, to behold our Youth denying the Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, when he urgeth them to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their carnal Appetites, in this Age of Pleaſure! <hi>I have written unto you, Fathers, becauſe ye have known him that is from the Beginning. I write unto you, young Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

               <p>Again, <hi>Let the weaker Sex willingly offer themſelves</hi> among the People, and engage in this holy War. Ariſe with <hi>Deborah,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> go forth againſt the Enemy, and you ſhall have occaſion to ſing with her, <hi>O my Soul, thou haſt troden down Strength.</hi> You need not fear, having such a Leader to go before you. And for your further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, I may obſerve to you, That in the holy Army of <hi>Martyrs</hi> who overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, we have ſome heroic Examples of Courage and Firmneſs of Mind even among Women, and that when call'd to reſiſt unto Blood, ſtriving againſt Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let our Aged go forth againſt the Enemy,</hi> and fight the Lord's Battles. There's no Diſcharge in this War. No, you muſt be faithful to Death. And if any, we may well expect, that <hi>old Diſciples,</hi> who have for a long time followed Chriſt, ſhould reſiſt the Devil with holy Courage and Skill, as not being ignorant of his Devices. A few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts more, and you ſhall be able to ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> the Aged, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</p>

                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:004803_0069_100DF279A20B0EB0"/>Nor ſhall I forbear to exhort our <hi>Indians and Negroes to ſubmit to Chriſt, and ſtand on his Side.</hi> Your Names indeed are not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in our Muſter-Rolls; but tho' our Lord needs none, he alone is able to ſubdue the Enemy, and whatever Inſtruments are uſed by him, his is the Power and the Victory; yet I ſay, He condeſcendeth to accept the Service of the meaneſt, who are willing hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to eſpouſe his Cauſe. Now then, that God has bro't you out from the dark Places of the Earth, where Satan had his Seat, to a Land of Goſpel-Light, where it is declared that the Son of God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, and hath <hi>redeemed a People to God by his Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation;</hi> ſeeing this is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State of Things, deſpiſe the Slavery of the Devil, ſhake off the Chains of Darkneſs in which you have been bound, and cry to your Saviour, that you may be <hi>delivered from the Bondage of Corruption,</hi> into the <hi>glorious Liberty</hi> of the Children of God. Come over to Chriſt, and you ſhall alſo overcome, and ſit down with him on his Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let Parents and Maſters of Families, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Chriſt,</hi> and train up their Children, and all under their Care for his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Let the Paſtors of the Churches be exhorted to lead forth their Flocks in Oppoſition to the Powers of Darkneſs;</hi> and do your utmoſt by Purity of Doctrine, by the Exerciſe of an

holy Diſcipline, and by your good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that Satan's Kingdom may fall, and Chriſt's Kingdom may be more and more ſet up upon the Ruins of it.</p>
               <p>In a Word and to conclude, In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Seaſon, let us be earneſt with God for the more plentiful Effuſions of his Spirit, that there may ſtand up an <hi>exceeding great Army</hi> to fight the Battles of the Lord, and take the Kingdom of Heaven with an holy Violence. <hi>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O moſt Mighty: with thy Glory and thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And in thy Majeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth, Meekneſs and Righteouſneſs: And thy right Hand ſhall teach thee terrible Things. Let thine Arrows be ſharp in the Heart of the Kings Enemies, and the People fall under thee. Rule thou in the mids of thine Enemies, and make thy People willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi> And let us avoid every Thing that has a Tendency to quench the Spirit, and ſo to hinder the Succeſs of the Goſpel. Let us remember that true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath its Influence on the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. And accordingly, let us ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and then look well to the Ways of our Houſholds, and take Care that we, our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, be well employed in the particular Buſineſs to which God calls us. Let Children be well govern'd. Let them duly attend the School, and be in ſubjection

Let every thing that is good in them be cheriſh'd and encouraged, and at the ſame Time prudent Methods be uſed <hi>that the Good be not evil ſpoken of,</hi> thro' their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infirmity. And let us all <hi>watch and pray, leſt we enter into Temptation.</hi> Let us <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> and not give place to the Devil, tho' he ſhould <hi>be transformed into an Angel of Light.</hi> We may well expect that this malicious and ſubtil Adverſary will be buſy at ſuch a Time as this; and ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be upon our Guard, that we may not be caught in his Snare. Let none be <hi>lifted up with Pride,</hi> leſt they fall into the <hi>Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Do not ſay in vain boaſting, Stand by thy ſelf, <hi>come not near to me, for I am holier than thou.</hi> Where God makes the Difference, give him the Glory; and behave with great Modeſty and Humility. Let not your Zeal be furious and diſorderly, cenſorious And uncharitable; but according to Knowledge, and a found Judgment. <hi>Be zealous therefore, and repent,</hi> remember the firſt Love, and do the firſt Works.

to have apprehended: But this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I preſs toward the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.13, 14. And let ſuch as are under good Impreſſions from the Spirit, take heed to themſelves, and beware of Apoſtacy. O ponder thoſe awful Words! <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb 10.38. But if there ſhould come <hi>a falling away</hi> reſpecting ſome that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed fair, let us not be ſhaken in Mind as if the main Work was not of God; nor take up an evil Report againſt it. Scripture and Experience warn us to fear and prepare for ſuch a Trial. But <hi>O thou God of all Grace, keep us from falling!
