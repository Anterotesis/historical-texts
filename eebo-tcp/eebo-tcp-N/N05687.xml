            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHAT we have now to ſay is in Writing, I will give it the Secretary, who will read it to you, and you may have time to conſider and give your Anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
                  <p>Before we proceed, it is neceſſary that you give us a true and full Account why the <hi>Narridgwock Indians</hi> are not here, as you have engaged for them in the Treaty made at <hi>Boſton,</hi> which now lies on the Table: We have conſidered of what you ſaid to us, at our meeting on Saturday laſt, and as to the Propoſals of the <hi>Norridgwock</hi> and other Tribes, that the Treaty be held at <hi>Mount-Royal,</hi> we ſay, that it's contrary to the Articles of Peace made at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and therefore deſerves no Anſwer, and you know that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways told you, that it was beneath the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh Government</hi> to Treat with the <hi>Indians</hi> in a <hi>French Country;</hi> and as to the Inſinuations of the <hi>Canada Indians,</hi> that our Commiſſioners begun a Treaty there, it is not true, for our Commiſſioners were ſent there to Demand of the <hi>French Governour</hi> in the Name of <hi>King GEORGE</hi> not to aſſiſt the <hi>Indians</hi> in the War againſt us, and alſo to Reſtore all the <hi>Engliſh Captives</hi> in that Government, which they declared to the Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> as ſoon as they Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and that they had no other Buſineſs in that Country.</p>
                  <p>As to the Two Houſes you except againſt, you may Remember you were told at <hi>Boſton,</hi> that <hi>King GEORGE</hi> had a Right to build Houſes where he pleaſed within his Dominions, and we have not built any Houſes on Lands in the <hi>Eaſtern Parts</hi> but what we have

                  <p>We will now give our Anſwer to what was ſaid Yeſterday. And firſt give the Reaſon why the <hi>Narridgwock</hi> Tribe is not here; we ſhall be very plain, and tell the Truth and nothing but the Truth why they are not here. We ſent a Meſſenger over to the <hi>Narridgwocks, St. Francois,</hi> and <hi>Wowenocks,</hi> for them to come over here to the Treaty, to hear what was ſaid: when the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were got to thoſe Tribes they diſcourſed 'em, and deliver'd their Meſſage to come over here, but the <hi>St. Francois, Wowenocks,</hi> and the <hi>Narridgwocks,</hi> made Anſwer, that they would have the <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> Chiefs with theſe Governments come over there to hear the Treaty, There were Six of the <hi>Narridgwock</hi> Indians came over to <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> this Spring, they miſſed of the Meſſengers that were ſent from <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> to <hi>Narridgwock;</hi> then Two went back and Four ſtaid till the <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> Meſſengers return'd with an Anſwer from the <hi>St. Francois,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007216_0008_102B3E91104B8A10"/>with the Two Belts; the Four <hi>Narridgwock</hi> Indians that tarried behind would come here and have been preſent at the Ratification, but the Belts being ſent occaſioned their not coming. When the Belts came to <hi>Penobſcutt,</hi> we had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then from the Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> of his coming down to the Ratification, and the Four <hi>Narridgwock</hi> Indians told the <hi>Penobſcutts,</hi> to go on, and what ever they did was all one as if they were Preſent, &amp; the <hi>Narriagwocks</hi> after that went to <hi>Canada.</hi>

                  <p>It's but a little while ſince they went away, and we have not heard from them ſince. The laſt Man that went away, when he went off he ſaid he would go foremoſt to the <hi>Arreſaguntecock</hi> Indians, and diſcourſe 'em on the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage they have ſent, expecting that the Government and the <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> Chiefs will give an Anſwer alſo to the Belts, as we are Brothers. This is what we Anſwer as to the Firſt Part of what was ſaid to us Yeſterday. Now we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make Anſwer to the Second Part of Yeſterday's Diſcourſe. Every thing of the Treaty is very plain to us, and there is nothing in the Way excepting the Two Houſes; in caſe they could be removed a little further in, as we mentioned Yeſterday. The Governour was mentioning that he would Settle no Lands, but what good Rights and Titles be ſet forth to, and in caſe the Lands were Sold, we have a Number of young People growing up who never were acquainted of the Lands being Sold: The Government is a Great and Rich Government, and if the Lands were Sold, they were Sold for a ſmall Matter, and Coſt but little, and it would be but a ſmall Matter for the Government to make Allowance for them, and give them up.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007216_0009_102B3E931922C8B0"/>Subjects, and the Property veſted in them, the Government cannot Diſclaim them; And now as you have aſſured us, that you very well know all the Articles of the Peace which was made at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and that you are ready to come hither to Ratify them, ſo we are alſo ready to receive the ſaid Ratification, and now expect that it ſhall be done accordingly. We have no more to ſay, but to demand of you what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captives you have ready to Exchange, Purſuant to an Article of the Treaty on that behalf.

We underſtood he Governour was tho'tful why the <hi>Narridgwock</hi> Indians were not here, We are alſo tho'tful, It is a Hindrance, ſo far as we ſhould be glad they ſhould be ſent for again, We are of Opinion if they ſhould be ſent for they would appear here forthwith, the Reaſon why we mention this is becauſe we would be very careful in what we do in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, that none ſhould break in upon our Proceedings: We ſhould be very ſorry if any Thing ſhould happen amiſs as to what we have done, We are not knowing that any are deſign'd or intend to break our Treaty, but we are very tho'tful and Concern'd that none ſhall do it. We inſiſt upon the removal of thoſe two Houſes which was mentioned laſt Winter, we again make mention of them now, and if they were removed, there would be no Difficulty among the Tribes. We can't find any Record in our Memory, nor in the Memory of Our Grand-Fathers, that the <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> Tribe have Sold any Land, As to the Deeds mentioned laſt Winter, made by <hi>Medoccewanda</hi> and <hi>Sheepſout John,</hi> they were not <hi>Penobſcutt</hi> Indians, one belonging to <hi>Machias Medockewondo,</hi> the other towards <hi>Boſton,</hi> If we ſhould find in reality that the Lands were Purchaſed of the right Owners, we ſhould not have inſiſted upon it, nor have opened our Mouths, we would not pretend to tell a Lye about it, for we know that God will be angry with the Man that tells a Lye, We do not remember of any Settlements at <hi>St. George's,</hi> we remember a pretty while, and as long as we remember, the Place where the Garriſon ſtands was fill'd with Great long grown Trees. As to the mentioning of Priſoners as we told you laſt Winter, we had not one in our whole Tribe, ſo we ſay now, We have not one Priſoner in our Tribe, if we had, we would have brought 'em in long before now, all the Priſoners we took, as we took them, they were return'd to <hi>Boſton,</hi> or ſent to <hi>Canada</hi> to the French, and whoſe that are among the French, we have no Command of; We mention it over again, that if we had any Priſoners, we ſhould have brought 'em in long ago, for we underſtand it that the Peace was concluded at the Signing the Articles almoſt a Twelve-Month ago: All the Controverſy now is about a ſmall Tract of Land, which is but a Trifle, and all is finiſhed except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We will reſent ſuch Actions, and join our Young Men with your's in ſuch Caſe, and oblige 'em to be quiet and ſet down; We mean in Caſe any of the Tribes ſhould riſe againſt us, or reſiſt us, we will take effectual Means to ſet 'em down by Force. As to the firſt Treaty, we reckoned our Selves obliged to this, but we account we are under much more and ſtronger Obligations to do it now, ſince the Engagements our whole Tribe have taken upon 'em in Ratifying the Articles of the Treaty, and ſhall take effectual Care that any ſuch Perſons be obliged to ſet down. Major <hi>Maſcarene</hi> told us the Government of <hi>Annapolis</hi> would Ratify the Treaty if we would ſend any Perſons there on our Behalf for that Purpoſe; we don't ſuppoſe he is now going to <hi>Annapolis,</hi> but when he arrives there, we would pray him to take Care that that Government would ſend a Veſſel for us to go there to Ratify the Articles of the Treaty, becauſe the Bay is too bigg for us to paſs over in our Canoes.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007216_0018_102B3EAA01812D78"/>very well in the Place: This we mention Sides-Ways as it were.

Governour, That His Majeſty King GEORGE, by his Laws, did not allow his Governours to meddle with Matters out of their own Provinces, but that all ſuch Facts muſt be tried in the Governments wherein they were committed; and this being ſaid to be done, not in our Government, but in that of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> the Lieut. Governour ſaid he would ſend the Frenchman back thither, where they might proſecute him, and that they would have a good Opportunity of doing it when they ſhould go thither to receive the Ratification of that Government: To which the Indians replied, they were fully ſatisfied, and content that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
