            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>An Arch-Biſhop, namely, Dr. <hi>USHER,</hi> has Written againſt theſe Vanities, particularly in his Catechiſm. Page 279.</p>
               <p>Yea, divers have more lately had the Courage to do ſo.

<q>Such are the Vain Converſations, Empty Viſits, &amp; Publick Meetings of People of Different Sexes, where the Soul is betray'd by the Eye, and Sinful Creatures are proud of poyſoning one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Such are thoſe Methods of Dreſſing, which are grown a Study and a Trade; and Women are aſhamed to appear with the Faces which God has given them, but chooſe rather to be ſeen with thoſe of the Devils making. Waſhing, Painting, PATCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, are become ſerious Occupations, and have turn'd out of Doors Morning Devotions. Such are BALLS, and Playes.</q>

               <p>Father <hi>Le Jeune,</hi> in his <hi>Le Miſſionarie de L' Oratoire,</hi> has a whole Sermon, <hi>Contre Les Bals, Les Danſes, et autres divertiſemens mondains, qui ſent allumettes de Luxure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will faithfully Tranſlate a few paſſages out of it.
<q>The Evil Spirit, has invented and introduced into the World, BALLS, and DANCES, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, which the <hi>Reproved</hi> call <hi>Innocent,</hi> but St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> called, <hi>Lugendas Latitius, The Sports which call for Sorrows.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds to ſhow, how the Sacred Scriptures, which command <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> and <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> condemn <hi>Dances,</hi> and begs his Hearers to think on that word; Job. 21.11, 13. <hi>Their Children DANCE, and in a moment they go down to the Grave</hi>; (or as he renders it,) <hi>into Hell.</hi> Says he; <hi>There are ſome Sins thought Venial, that will End ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He mentions and commends <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard, That ſome of his Hearers had been at a <hi>Ball,</hi> immediately he Preached a powerful Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and among other things that man of God ſaid, (&amp; his words are quoted with Honour by this <hi>Papiſt</hi>;<note place="margin">[The men of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall riſe in Judgment with this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it!]</note>) <hi>If I could Learn, who they were, that were preſent at theſe Follies, I would chaſe them out of the Church; I would not permit them to be preſent at our dreadful Myſteries</hi>; And he goes on to call them, <hi>The Pomps of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papiſt goes on to tell us, That <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves, <hi>We read not of any Dances at the Weddings of the Holy Patriarchs, and that the Weddings <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<q>When you were <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> you Renounced theſe <hi>Follies</hi>; you were Engaged by an Expreſs promiſe, to ſhun theſe <hi>Pomps of the Devil.</hi> If you Return to them, you are guilty of <hi>Perſidy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Forgery,</hi> and <hi>Diſloyalty.</hi> But how then can one grant you the <hi>Communion</hi> which is much more than <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sayes he;
<q>Here you throw away the precious <hi>Time,</hi> which cannot be recovered; the <hi>Time</hi> which is allowed you to work out your Salvation. You Extinguiſh in your ſelves the Spirit of <hi>Piety,</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and of <hi>Repentance</hi>; the Spirit of <hi>Devotion.</hi> That Spirit is a precious Balm; or an Eſſence and a Cordial; nothing ſo eaſily grows Dead and Flat: there needs but <hi>One Diſſolute Hour,</hi> to ruine in you, all that Spirit of Piety, which you have been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for many weeks, by your Meditations, and Supplications. They have no Speech of GOD, at a <hi>Ball,</hi> or at a <hi>Play</hi>; and if at <hi>Collations,</hi> they Speak of GOD, and of Divine Things, of Devotions or of Devout Perſons, it is ordinarily to rally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and tell merry Stories thereof.</q>

                  <q>Here are profuſe Expences of what ſhould be Employ'd for the Comfort of the Poor, and their Succour in their Miſeries.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>If the Young Gentlewomen would be well provided for in a Marriage, they ſhould prefer a man of Senſe and Judgment. Now there is no man of Judgment, who would not chooſe rather a Young Gentlewoman, that ſhould be Wiſe, Modeſt, Reſerv'd, and Retired, than a <hi>Dancer,</hi> a giddy, and an idle Damſel.</q>

                  <q>Whence comes it that the <hi>Caſaiſt</hi> informs me not, that the <hi>Ball</hi> and the <hi>Play,</hi> are any other than Indifferent Things? But think you to be Excuſed from the Judgments of God, becauſe your Faith has been pinn'd on the Sleeve of, an <hi>Alamods Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuist,</hi> who has a mind to render himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant unto your Inclinations, rather than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>M. <hi>Rabutin,</hi> in his Inſtructions to his Children. [In his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> Tom. 2 p. 155.] has theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.
<q>I have ever believed <hi>Balls</hi> to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Of this, not only my <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but my own <hi>Experience</hi> made me ſenſible; and tho' the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi> in this Caſe, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable, yet that of a <hi>Courtier</hi> may be of greater weight. The coldeſt Conſtitutions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed there. They that are Old, cannot go to them, without making a ridiculous Figure, nor the Young, tho' within the Rules of Decency, without Expoſing themſelves to great Dangers. It is my Opinion, then, That A CHRISTIAN OUGHT NOT TO BE AT A BALL; And I think it the Duty of the <hi>Guides</hi> of <hi>Conſciences,</hi> to <hi>Interdict it fox ever unto thoſe who are under their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
                  </q>
A <hi>Queſtion</hi> upon the whole.</p>
               <p>Whether a <hi>Non-conformiſt Minister</hi> can be juſtly Reproached, for his faithful and watchful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to reclaim his Neighbours, from hazarding their own and their Childrens Vertue, by <hi>Vanities,</hi> which have had no <hi>Good Report</hi> by the Vertuous in all Ages, but been decried, not only by <hi>Fathers,</hi> by <hi>Councils,</hi> by Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and by the very <hi>Pagans?</hi>

               <p>Think ſeriouſly upon it; and upon Amos 6.3, 5, 6. <hi>Wo to them that put far away the Evil Day and chaunt to the ſound of the Viol,—but they are not grieved for the Affliction of Joſeph.</hi> And upon Iſa. 22.12, 13, 14. <hi>In that Day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping and to mourning; And behold Joy and Gladneſs; Surely, This <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
