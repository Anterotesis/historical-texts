            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN theſe Words <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks not only as became a <hi>Penitent</hi> and a Convert, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and a Preacher, but alſo as became his <hi>Royal Dignity</hi> and State, the <hi>King of Iſrael.</hi> Not only is it the part of the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> but it belongs alſo to the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Civil Ruler,</hi> to endeavour the <hi>Reclaiming</hi> of <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,</hi> and the <hi>Converſion</hi> of their People from Sin unto GOD.</p>
            <p>IT being therefore <hi>Recommended</hi> to me to day by the <hi>Honourable</hi> the GOVERNMENT over us, to <hi>read</hi> publicly unto You the ROYAL PROCLAMATION Emitted by our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

            </p>
            <p>YOU are therefore preach'd to rather from the <hi>Throne</hi> to day than from the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> But indeed from the <hi>Throne</hi> of GOD (by whom Kings reign, and by whoſe Laws they are to govern) from his <hi>High</hi> Throne you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe <hi>Words</hi> of Holy <hi>David</hi> you may <hi>Obſerve,</hi>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>A gracious Purpoſe and holy Reſolution: I will teach Tranſgreſſors thy Ways.</hi> It is no ways below a <hi>Prince</hi> to do this; but it is the ſpecial Duty and Office of a <hi>Prophet</hi> always to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Who would not hearken to, learn of and obey ſuch a <hi>Teacher? Where the Word of a King is there is Power.</hi> He ſpeaks from GOD, a Greater KING, <hi>whoſe Name is dreadful.</hi>

III. <hi>We had need get ſome happy Experience of our own Converſion, and GOD's free Forgivneſs of our own Sins, in order to our teaching others the ways of GOD, with any hope of being Inſtrumental to convert them.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I do not propoſe any <hi>full Diſcourſe</hi> on either of theſe great and copious Truths, but only a <hi>general Reflection</hi> or two on one and other of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>TRANSGRESSORS muſt be taught GOD's ways.</hi> But who are <hi>Tranſgreſſors?</hi> and what are <hi>GOD's ways?</hi> and who <hi>muſt teach</hi> them? and <hi>why</hi> muſt they needs be taught? and <hi>how</hi> muſt it be done? <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> Very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WHO are Tranſgreſſors?</hi> A general and full <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> gives us 1 Joh. 3.4. <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Law, for Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> So that whoever lives in any ſinful way, in any known and allowed courſe of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Will and Word of GOD, he is a Tranſgreſſor. We are called <hi>Tranſgreſſors from the womb,</hi> and that moſt truly, being born in Sin and by Nature under the Power and Rule of it. Every Act of ſin, and any <hi>one Act</hi> of it, makes a Man a Tranſgreſſor in the ſight of <hi>GOD</hi> and of his own <hi>Conſcience.</hi> The beſt man that lives is a hainous Tranſgreſſor in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001804_0011_0FB84435F0B40C50"/>impartial Judgment of his own Heart: for <hi>in many things we offend all, and he that offends in one point is guilty of all.</hi> Job 13.23. <hi>How many are my Iniquities? make me to know my Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and my Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to be ſure the <hi>Text</hi> means at leaſt <hi>Impenitent and Unconverted</hi> Sinners; and it may be more eſpecially the <hi>openly Irreligious, leud and profane.</hi> In this groſs ſenſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> was numbred with <hi>Tranſgreſſors.</hi> And for ſuch the <hi>Law is made; for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for unholy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. <hi>i.e.</hi> to <hi>reſtrain</hi> from ſuch Ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, by revealing the wrath of GOD from Heaven a gainſt it; or to <hi>doom</hi> them unto Everlaſting Deſtruction in caſe of final Impenitence therein.</p>
            <p>LET us then underſtand here by <hi>Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> all Impenitent and ungodly Sinners, both <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>open:</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> are Tranſgreſſors in the ſight of men, the <hi>firſt</hi> before GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>WHAT are GOD's ways?</hi> which muſt be taught to Tranſgreſſors, and which they need to learn. I anſwer</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> GOD's ways are the holy <hi>Precepts, Rules and Directions of his written Word,</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will; wherein the Indiſpenſible <hi>Duty</hi> of ſinful Man is laid down, what he muſt <hi>be</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001804_0012_0FB84437A98CC3B8"/>and <hi>do</hi> to be ſaved. In theſe are contained the whole <hi>Way</hi> of Holineſs, the way of life, the way to Heaven Luk. 10.25, 26. Or</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> GOD's ways may here in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mean <hi>the Manner of his dealing with Souls in bringing them to Repentance, and graciouſly pardoning them upon their Repentance;</hi> together with the <hi>Neceſſity of inſtant Repentance,</hi> and the <hi>dreadfulneſs of His Wrath in caſe of final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> The penitent and pardoned <hi>David</hi> had well learn'd theſe <hi>Holy Leſſons,</hi> and was well able to Inſtruct Tranſgreſſors both in the way of GOD's <hi>convincing a Soul of Sin, renewing him to Repentance, and ſealing to him his pardon.</hi> He wou'd now teach to Sinners <hi>their way unto GOD</hi> by Repentance, and <hi>GOD's ways of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace</hi> toward them that repent. Pſal. 66.16. <hi>Come all you—and I will declare what GOD hath done for my Soul: I cried unto him with my Mouth</hi> (ſay, under the pains of Guilt) <hi>and he was extolled with my Tongue,</hi> (under the Joyful ſenſe of his pardoning Mercy.)</p>
            <p>TRANSGRESSORS need to be taught theſe things, that they may "neither <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly perſiſt</hi> in their ungodly Courſes, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conviction of the Evil of them <hi>deſpair</hi> of finding Mercy. Tranſgreſſors muſt be taught how <hi>evil and bitter</hi> a thing it is to tranſgreſs GOD's Laws; and how CHRIST
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001804_0013_0FB84438E4543390"/>
               <hi>hath finiſhed Tranſgreſſion, and made an End of Sin, and made Reconciliation for Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>WHO muſt teach</hi> Tranſgreſſors GOD's Ways? <hi>I will,</hi> ſaid <hi>David.</hi> Let us <hi>every one</hi> anſwer like him for our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and ſay—<hi>So will I,</hi> and <hi>ſo will I.</hi> We all <hi>may</hi> do it, and <hi>ought</hi> to do it, each one in his <hi>own place.</hi> Every man in his own <hi>line</hi> is his <hi>Brothers Keeper,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor and Teacher. But more particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> IT is the Immediate Office of the <hi>Miniſters of Religion</hi> to teach Tranſgreſſors GOD's ways. <hi>They</hi> are Called and Separated unto this very Work. GOD has ordained that there be an <hi>Order</hi> of men Devoted to <hi>Inſtruct</hi> others in his Will, to <hi>admoniſh</hi> them not to dare to offend againſt it, to <hi>require</hi> them to Obſerve it, to declare his <hi>Wrath</hi> againſt the Diſobedient, and his <hi>Mercy</hi> to them that obey him. Neceſſity is therefore laid upon <hi>Us,</hi> and wo unto us if we preach not the Goſpel; which is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Repentance and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, as CHRIST Himſelf <hi>came to call Sinners to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Magiſtrates</hi> are alſo ordained of GOD to be His <hi>Miniſters in the Gates,</hi> there to teach Tranſgreſſors his ways. So <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Judges of Iſrael, Samuel, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon; Aſa, Jehoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah; Joſiah, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. taught their People the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001804_0014_0FB8443A752773D0"/>way of the LORD. And the ſame is Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their <hi>Subjects</hi> Obedience to the Divine Laws, and to puniſh the open Contempt and Violation of them. The <hi>Legiſlature</hi> teach GOD's ways in the <hi>Good Laws they Enact</hi> for the promoting his Worſhip and true Religion, Morality and Vertue among their People, and for the puniſhing of Irreligion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, vice and wickedneſs. And while They do <hi>this</hi> and rule according to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> it is as much <hi>Irreligion</hi> and as ſure <hi>Damnation</hi> to diſobey Them, as it is not to comply with the <hi>Word</hi> which we preach. And this ſeems the real <hi>Scope</hi> of what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teaches us in that <hi>famous place,</hi> Rom. 13.1,—5. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers. For there is no Power but of GOD: The Powers that be are ordained of GOD. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of GOD; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: For he is the Miniſter of GOD to thee for Good. But if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Miniſter of GOD, a Revenger to</hi> execute <hi>wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001804_0015_0FB8443BEF211040"/>muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I might go on and ſay, <hi>Chriſtians muſt teach every one his Nei'bour, and every one his Brother,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Know the LORD, and let us walk in his ways.</hi> You are a <hi>People of Religion,</hi> and are to watch over one another in love, as <hi>Brethren in Chriſt:</hi> You muſt love your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in your heart,</hi> and not <hi>ſuffer Sin upon him,</hi> but muſt <hi>in any wiſe rebuke</hi> thy Nei'bour. We muſt be <hi>Exhorting one another daily while it is called to day, leſt any be hardned thro' the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. <hi>Now we exhort you Brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, ſupport the weak,</hi>—and <hi>ever follow that what is good both among your ſelves and toward all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN particular, <hi>Relatives</hi> ſhould teach one another GOD's ways: Parents their Children, Husbands their Wives, Maſters their Servants; every One his Houſhold as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did theirs, <hi>to keep the way of the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we may be all of us <hi>Teachers</hi> to one another, being our ſelves taught of GOD <hi>naturally to care</hi> for each others Souls. And if any one be a <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> and he come in our way, let us wiſely tell him the <hi>Evil of his way</hi> and the <hi>Miſery</hi> therein; the <hi>Excellency</hi> of GOD's ways, and the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of his Converſion into them. But</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001804_0016_0FB84442ABF090D0"/>
4. <hi>WHY muſt Tranſgreſſors needs be taught?</hi> The <hi>Reaſons</hi> are too <hi>many</hi> to give them all, and too <hi>obvious</hi> to need almoſt to name them. For is not the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD written, and the <hi>Preaching</hi> thereof ordained, for this very End? The Law is <hi>nigh</hi> thee, even in thy hand and heart and mouth; and is to <hi>dwell richly in us, teaching and admoniſhing one another;</hi> being <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for Correction and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, The <hi>Relations</hi> wherein GOD has ſet us one toward another cannot be otherwiſe anſwered, or the <hi>Duties</hi> of them diſcharg'd according to his Will and unto his Glory. He has made us of <hi>one Blood,</hi> made us together his <hi>Covenant People,</hi> ſet us in our <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and in a Chriſtian <hi>Brotherbood,</hi> told us how we muſt carry it one to another and <hi>fulfil the Law of love, pleaſe</hi> and honour him, <hi>do good</hi> and be Bleſſings in the World, and be <hi>bleſſed</hi> our ſelves for Evermore.</p>
            <p>TRANSGRESSORS are ſo <hi>hard to learn, dull of hearing</hi> and <hi>ſlow of heart, to believe,</hi> that therefore they ſhould the rather be taught. And <hi>Compaſſion to their Immortal Souls</hi> ſhould be inſtead of a thouſand Arguments with us, to be <hi>at any pains</hi> to teach them. How do we <hi>hate 'em in our hearts</hi> if we ſuffer them to periſh in the ways of Sin? It were more <hi>Inhumane</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001804_0017_0FB84444EEA19770"/>and barbarous than to let a <hi>blind man</hi> go over a Precipice, and not tell him his danger or ſet him in his way: or to ſee a <hi>Mad-man</hi> ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing himſelf and not hold his hand.</p>
            <p>Finally, The <hi>good Order of the World,</hi> the peace and welfare of Mankind, require that Tranſgreſſors be taught GOD's ways. The <hi>Foundations</hi> of the World are elſe <hi>out of courſe,</hi> and the Earth and all its Inhabitants muſt <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</hi> This <hi>bears up the Pillars of it,—I ſaid unto the Fools deal not fooliſhly, and to the wicked lift not up the born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE wou'd be <hi>no living</hi> here on Earth, if it were not for the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which GOD has ſet up among men. Our Sabbaths and the Preaching of GOD's Word are an <hi>unknown Good</hi> to a wicked World tho' ſo few are converted; and ſo is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> that lies on Mankind for fear of the <hi>Sword of the Magiſtrate</hi> and the <hi>laſh of humane Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the laſt and chief <hi>Reaſon</hi> why Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors muſt be taught GOD's ways is their <hi>Converſion and Salvation:</hi> of which hereafter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, <hi>HOW muſt we teach them?</hi> I anſwer</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>AUTHORITATIVLY.</hi> For it is in GOD's cauſe, and in his ſtead, and we may be bold, as an Inferior Officer may command in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001804_0018_0FB84446AFD83EC8"/>King's Name. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> may not fear a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> nor <hi>Miniſters</hi> the <hi>Faces</hi> of any. Our Lord taught <hi>as one having Authority,</hi> and he has veſted his Miniſters in his own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Tit. 2.15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority, let no man deſpiſe thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Great and powerful Motives of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be taught together with the Doctrines and Rules of it:</hi> the <hi>Penalty</hi> with the <hi>Precept,</hi> the Promiſes and Threatnings together with the Commandments. <hi>Life and Death, the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and the Curſe</hi> muſt be ſet before men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Statutes and Judgments. So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes denounced unto Iſrael</hi> that they ſhould ſurely <hi>periſh quickly</hi> in caſe of Diſobedience and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence: and ſo ſaid the <hi>Apoſtle, Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we perſuade men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WE muſt teach Tranſgreſſors with <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love, Affection and Entreaty. What will ye,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, ſhall I come unto you with a Rod? or in love and in the Spirit of Meekneſs?</hi> He had <hi>Authority</hi> to do the one, in caſe of Contumacy; and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> eno' to chuſe the <hi>other</hi> in caſe there were any hopes of prevailing on them by kindneſs and Gentleneſs. Read the Character of the LORD's <hi>Servant,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.24. <hi>The Servant of the LORD muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001804_0019_0FB84447E2F04A48"/>men, apt to teach, patient, in meekneſs Inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves, if GOD peradventure will give them Repentance.</hi> And accordingly the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> JESUS have left us this <hi>Example: I beſeech you by the meekneſs and Gentleneſs of CHRIST: As tho' GOD did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead: Wherefore tho' I might be much bold in Chriſt to Injoyn thee that which is Convenient, yet for Love-ſake 1 ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Entreat thee.</hi> So Gentle is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sinners and Saints, amidſt all its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Terrors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. TRANSGRESSORS muſt be taught with <hi>all Long-ſuffering:</hi> patience as well as leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2 Tim. 4.2. God bears long with the perverſneſs and Obſtinacy of men, and ſtill waits on them to be gracious. Num. 14.11. <hi>How long will this People provoke me? how long ſhall it be e'er ye believe me?</hi> We continue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our Work, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and Year after Year, <hi>in Seaſon and out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and line muſt be upon line, and precept upon a precept, here a little and there a little:</hi> It may be they will yet hearken and receive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction! <hi>When ſhall it once be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, IF Tranſgreſſors will not learn GOD's ways, but <hi>openly defy</hi> and violate his Commandments, <hi>They muſt then be taught as Gideon taught the men of Succoth, with the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001804_0020_0FB8444AD89D21D8"/>briars and thorns of the Wilderneſs.</hi> I mean, That open Tranſgreſſors fall under public <hi>Church-Cenſures,</hi> and under the <hi>laſh of the Civil Law;</hi> both which are ordained by GOD for the opening mens Ears to <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to return from Iniquity. So the cenſur'd <hi>Corinthian</hi> was humbled and reſtored: and ſo <hi>Hymeneus</hi> was delivered to Satan that he <hi>learn</hi> not to blaſpheme. And ſo has the LORD commanded, <hi>Them that Sin rebuke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, that others may fear.</hi> And for the ſame Reaſon is the Civil Magiſtrate <hi>the Miniſter of GOD,</hi> and the Penalties of the Civil Law are GOD's <hi>Ordinance,—that all Iſrael may hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus have I briefly ſaid, <hi>who are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors?</hi> and what are <hi>GOD's ways?</hi> and <hi>who</hi> muſt teach them? and <hi>why</hi> they muſt needs be taught? and <hi>how</hi> it muſt be done?</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>two laſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Enquiries</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a farther <hi>Anſwer</hi> in the next <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>IN teaching Tranſgreſſors GOD's way we muſt propoſe and aim at their CONVERSION unto GOD.</hi> This is the <hi>End of Divine Teaching:</hi> to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan unto GOD. The <hi>Miniſtry of the Word</hi> ſerves unto this glorious <hi>End,</hi> and this we muſt propoſe in all other
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001804_0021_0FB8444BA1B5B708"/>
               <hi>Occaſional Inſtructions</hi> unto any. This is inſtead of a thouſand <hi>Reaſons</hi> why we ſhould <hi>teach,</hi> and why ſinners ſhould hear and <hi>learn:</hi> And this gives us a <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> how to teach, namely, ſo as may <hi>beſt tend to the Converſion</hi> of men from the ways of Sin. How <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> therefore, and with what <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Affectionatneſs and Solemnity,</hi> ſhould we teach you GOD's <hi>Ways?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED our <hi>Solemn Aſſemblies</hi> were a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Pageantry</hi> if it were not that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners is the thing propounded in them. And for want of this Actual Intention it is that the Worſhip of ſo many is a <hi>Mockery.</hi> Moreover, The <hi>Severity</hi> of a Godly and ſtrict <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the Church, and thoſe of <hi>Humane Laws</hi> in the puniſhment of Tranſgreſſors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State, were a <hi>vain thing</hi> if it were not to reclaim men from their evil ways, and reform them.</p>
            <p>WHETHER therefore it be that we teach Sinners from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or whether it be the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> who does it, or the <hi>Judge;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that Chriſtians <hi>privatly inſtruct</hi> and admoniſh them that tranſgreſs againſt GOD; both one and other ought to propoſe and act for this <hi>one End, to Convert a Sinner from the Error of his way, and to ſave a Soul from death,</hi> And this very thing ſhould make Inſtructions
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001804_0022_0FB844520A5101A8"/>and Reproofs <hi>welcome</hi> unto Sinners, whereon in public or in private: <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me it ſhall be a kindneſs, let him reprove me it ſhall be an excellent Oil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I wiſh truly that Teachers and Reprovers of every ſort, as well as thoſe that are Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and corrected by them, wou'd propoſe and act for this one End, <hi>the ſpiritual and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Good of Souls.</hi> It is to be own'd that <hi>Miniſters</hi> themſelves are too often <hi>Defective</hi> in this Actual Intention, tho' it be the very End of their Miniſtry. And more is it to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that the Generality of thoſe who come to <hi>hear</hi> have not at all their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation at heart. <hi>The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the Soul; i. e.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fitted to this End: yet how rarely is it effectual upon the Souls of Sinners? Truly <hi>Brethren,</hi> the fault lies either on <hi>Us</hi> who preach, or on <hi>You</hi> that <hi>hear,</hi> or on <hi>both</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Either <hi>we</hi> don't eno' propoſe and act for your Converſion to GOD, or You <hi>your</hi> ſelves don't do it.</p>
            <p>BUT then, Is it <hi>our</hi> Care alone to miniſter to the Converſion of Souls? by no means. You that are <hi>Parents,</hi> when you teach your Children the way of the Lord, is it not to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> them again unto God? And let <hi>Children</hi> hearken to their Father that begat them and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001804_0023_0FB84454955E9C90"/>unto the Law of their Mother that bare them, that by the Bleſſing of GOD on their good Inſtructions and Charges they may betimes be <hi>born again.</hi> Take heed that all this pious and tender Care of your Parents for your Souls be not loſt, and turn at laſt to your greater Condemnation, and <hi>you mourn at the laſt, How have I hated Inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof, and I have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined my Ear to them that inſtructed me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then there is the other great <hi>Inſtance,</hi> wherein it is to be fear'd that leaſt of all have the world of Mankind any Apprehenſion <hi>of any pious Intention for the Converſion of Sinners: ſoil.</hi> the <hi>legal Conviction</hi> and <hi>Judicial puniſhment</hi> of Tranſgreſſors, by the Civil Magiſtrate and Judge. Never the leſs it is certain that <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> obliges thoſe in the Magiſtracy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe even the Converſion of Criminals and Malefactors from their vile ways unto thoſe of Vertue and true Godlineſs: And convicted Sinners ought to accept of their public Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments and Shames as ſo meant: Which tho' it may ſeem <hi>ſtrange Doctrine</hi> and a <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Expectation</hi> in a corrupt World, yet is in it ſelf the moſt <hi>Juſt and Reaſonable thing</hi> in the world; and renders Magiſtracy ſo much the more <hi>wirthy</hi> of the Ordination of a Holy
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001804_0024_0FB8445565B050C0"/>GOD, and the <hi>Benefit</hi> of it ſo much the more Apparent in a <hi>Chriſtian State.</hi> For if the Civil Powers are ordained of God not only for the preſent peace and good Order of the world, but alſo in ſome meaſure for the Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of men; ſo much the more <hi>Venerable</hi> are they to a people of Religion. Nor is here any <hi>Claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Orders;</hi> for as the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word</hi> tho' it directly ſerve to the bringing Souls to a better Life, yet abundantly ſerves to the peace and good Order of the World at the ſame time, ſo tho' the direct and Immediate End of Civil Government be the outward peace, tranquility and Felicity of the People, yet it has alſo really a further Aim, Influence and Effect, even in the Religion and ſpiritual Good of its Subjects.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>Humane Laws</hi> ſerve under the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> and by <hi>That</hi> theſe are to be fram'd, and to <hi>It</hi> to be ſubordinated. So <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>join</hi> in bringing the Iſrael of GOD on toward <hi>Canaan;</hi> tho' it is JESUS only that gives 'em <hi>Reſt.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Subjection</hi> of the LORD's People muſt be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> and <hi>Conſcientious:</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD is <hi>one and the ſame</hi> in the mouth of the LORD's <hi>Prophet,</hi> or His <hi>Judge:</hi> Do People then reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their <hi>Miniſters</hi> and the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> in their Mouth? and ſhall they not pay a higher
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001804_0025_0FB84456E836A5B0"/>Reverence to their pious <hi>Rulers,</hi> &amp; to a <hi>Divine Sentence</hi> in the Mouth of their KING? 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all men: for Kings and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty: For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of GOD our Saviour; Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the LORD's ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupream, or unto Governours as unto them that are ſent by Him, for the puniſhment of evil doers and for the praiſe of them that do well: For ſo is the Will of GOD that with well doing ye ſhould put to Silence the Ignorance of fooliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE more <hi>Obſervation</hi> lies before us from the Text, and a very <hi>Serious</hi> one it is, and with it I ſhall ſhut up my <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>THAT they whoſe Office it is to teach unto others GOD's ways, and who are to miniſter to the Converſion of Tranſgreſſors unto GOD, had need to get ſome comfortable Experience of their own Converſion, and of GOD's free Forgivneſs of their own Sins. Then</hi> will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, ſays <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> ſoil, <hi>When</hi> thou LORD haſt renewed and forgiven me; <hi>when</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001804_0026_0FB84459E11BC0F8"/>thou ſhalt graciouſly give to me the happy Senſe of my Pardon and Cleanſing.</p>
            <p>TRULY my <hi>Brethren,</hi> how ſhall we take upon us to <hi>teach</hi> others, with any proſpect of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> if we are not our ſelves taught of GOD! with what face or decency can we expect that GOD ſhould <hi>own</hi> us in this <hi>great Service,</hi> or Men regard us, if we our ſelves are the ſervants of Sin! Not but that GOD <hi>ſometimes uſes</hi> them that are wicked to do good unto the Souls of others. But what <hi>Comfort</hi> can there be in this? <hi>if after I have preached unto others I my ſelf ſhould be a Caſtaway,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. to be Inſtrumental to the bringing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to that Salvation, which we are never like to come unto our ſelves! how can one bear to think of it? Wherefore <hi>take heed to thy ſelf, and unto thy Doctrine</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy</hi>) that thou mayſt both <hi>ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16.</p>
            <p>IT can never be expected that we ſhall be <hi>hearty, earneſt and vigilant</hi> in ſeeking the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others, if we have never <hi>felt</hi> our own miſery and periſhing ſtate without the ſaving and free Grace of GOD, nor had any <hi>Experience</hi> of the Work of Converſion in our own Souls. If we have not <hi>car'd</hi> for our own Souls, how ſhall we for the Souls of others! If we have never been apprehenſive of our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001804_0027_0FB8445911EDE3B8"/>own <hi>Danger</hi> in an unconverted State, how ſhall we be zealous for another's <hi>Deliverance</hi> from wrath? Or how ſhall we ſpeak aright of the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD to others, if we know nothing of it <hi>experimentally</hi> our ſelves? How ſhall we <hi>Encourage</hi> others to go unto a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR whom we have never <hi>ſought</hi> unto for Mercy our ſelves? nor receiv'd any <hi>Mercy</hi> from? Yea, <hi>to the wicked GOD ſaith, What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant into thy Mouth? ſeeing thou hateſt Inſtruction and caſteſt my words behind thee.</hi> Pſal. 50.16, 17. And again, <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> Rom. 2.21. Apply this to every <hi>ſort</hi> of Teacher, for the <hi>Preacher of the Word</hi> is not the only Teacher whom the <hi>Reproach</hi> bears upon: It falls as hard on others. <hi>Parents,</hi> who command your Children to know and keep the way of the LORD, are you Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious? <hi>Man</hi> that telleſt thy Nei'bour of the <hi>Blemiſh</hi> in his Eye, haſt thou a <hi>Beam</hi> in thy own? You that by <hi>Commiſſion</hi> ſearch out and puniſh Immoralities in others, are you vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, leud or unjuſt your ſelves? <hi>Sitteſt thou like Ananias to judge others according to Law, and breakeſt thou the Law thy ſelf?</hi> Thus the <hi>Rule</hi> holds univerſally among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and obliges in the <hi>Civil</hi> Order as well as in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001804_0028_0FB8445F245C4DC8"/>
               <hi>Sacred. Thou, when thou art Converted ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if we have <hi>found Grace and Mercy</hi> from GOD to turn to Him from our own Sins, then may we in our places with <hi>good Aſſurance</hi> and Confidence teach the way of GOD to others. For <hi>how can we but ſpeak</hi> the things whereof we know the Certainty, Neceſſity and Excellency by a happy Experiance and deep Conviction in our own Souls? The things that have been <hi>freely given to us</hi> of GOD, and <hi>wro't in us</hi> by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>ready</hi> to declare unto others. We ſhall ſpeak <hi>feelingly</hi> of them and ſo <hi>affectingly; out of the Abundance</hi> of our own hearts <hi>into the hearts</hi> of others.</p>
            <p>HENCE <hi>Penitents</hi> have been ever ſome of the <hi>beſt Preachers</hi> to Sinners: So were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> who had both felt the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of Sin, and known the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of the Grace of GOD; and how to direct others in the way wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD had led them, and to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> them with the Comforts <hi>wherewith they themſelves had been comforted of GOD.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. <hi>For this cauſe I obtained Mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all Long-ſuffering for a pattern to them that ſhould hereafter believe on him to Life Everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>

LET us then <hi>make ſure</hi> firſt of our own Converſion to GOD, and then <hi>lay out</hi> our ſelves for the Converſion of others.</p>
