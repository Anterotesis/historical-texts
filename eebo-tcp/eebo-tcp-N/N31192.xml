            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A moſt <hi>UNACCOUNTABLE RELATION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT there are really Magicians, Conjurers and Witches, who have Commerce and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with evil Spirits, is ſo clear and plain, both from holy Scripture, Councils, Canons, and Civil Laws in all Nations, that none but thoſe Athieſts, who would perſuade themſelves there are no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and conſequently no other Life after this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny'd it; ſince the reality of this Converſe with Spirits, their appearances and poſſeſſions has been ſo clearly demonſtrated, not only in former Ages, but alſo in this, by Perſons of moſt acute Judgment and Learning, wherein they have fully anſwer'd all Objections to the contrary, ſo that I need not enter any further into Controverſy, but ſhall only give you an Account of one Mrs. <hi>Sarah Green,</hi> living at <hi>Beeſley,</hi> in the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who was a Perſon very well brought up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended out of a good Family: At twenty Years of age ſhe was married to Mr. <hi>Thomas Green,</hi> a Farmer of a good Eſtate, who had by her two Children, a Son and a Daughter, his Son being brought up a Clergyman. After they had been married near ſixteen Years, Mr. <hi>Thomas Green</hi> died, having ſettled his Eſtate upon his two Children, and left a Competency ſufficient for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Wife, but ſhe being a very proud wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thought the Subſtance left for her Support
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:041287_0003_101A6B50CEED4618"/>
not ſufficient to maintain her Pride and Greatneſs; in a little Time after ſhe fell into great Diſcontent, retiring herſelf from all Company, and by the ſtrong Temptations of the Devil, ſhe was drawn into the wicked Practice of Witchcraft, and in a ſhort Time after, ſold herſelf Soul and Body to the Devil, for fourteen Years, for the Enjoyment of worldly Pleaſures, and to have her Deſires ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd: She was often ſuſpected by ſeveral Perſons to follow the wicked Practice of Witchcraft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they happen'd to have any Difference with her, they commonly receiv'd Damage, either by Hurt to their Cattle or other Things; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no certain Proof could be made, People durſt not ſpeak their Opinion openly, but near the End of this fourteen Years ſhe grew very ſad and heavy, and ſending for her two Children, and three able Miniſters, ſhe with abundance of Tears ſpoke thus to them: <hi>I have by my wretched Fate, followed Witchcraft ſeveral Years, and have ſold myſelf both Soul and Body to the Devil for fourteen Years, only for the Pleaſures of this World, and to have my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſatisfied during that Time; but now all my Pleaſures and Delights are come to their laſt Period; for there remains only three Days of that Time; and then I ſhall be carried away by infernal Spirits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe everlaſting Flames that will never have an End. And as the Devil was the Author of this my Wickedneſs, by perſwading me to it, ſo he will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be the Puniſher thereof. I deſire you therefore that you would not ceaſe to pray for me, but take me into the Church, and let there be uſed Pſalms
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:041287_0004_101A6B5C0E4AF750"/>
and Prayers for five Nights together; and if you can keep me ſafe during that Time, the Danger will be over.</hi> All theſe Things they perform'd, but it prevail'd nothing, for the firſt two Nights the Miniſters began to ſing Pſalms about her, they heard terrible Noiſes, which frighten'd them very much, the third Night the Noiſe of thoſe Spirits who came for Deſtruction, was ſo great that the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church was ſhaken, and about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a Spirit very dreadful and terrible in Shape reſembling a Bear, but larger, appear'd viſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which ſuddenly ſtruck the Woman dead on the Floor; where ſhe lay 'till the next Day, as on Examination made into this Matter by the Coroner and Jury.</p>
            <p>We whoſe Names are hereafter mention'd do teſtifie this Relation to be true; and deſire that it may be publiſh'd as a Timely warning to all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

            <p>AMongſt the many good Sermons that have been preached or publiſhed for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men's Souls, ſurely no Subject can be more proper than that which teaches us to conſider our latter End, by amending our Lives, and living Soberly, Righteouſly, and Goldly in this preſent Life, that we may be partakers of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the Life to come. And indeed if Men were ſo wiſe as to conſider their latter End, it would be their chief Motive to them to leave their Sins and Wickedneſs, conſidering that the Soul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, but muſt have a Being to all Eternity, and that there are but two Places for it to go to, either Heaven or Hell, for behold the Day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be Stuble, and the Day cometh that ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and ſhall neither leave them Root nor Branch, <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. 10. While a Man
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041287_0006_101A6B5F29CDD010"/>
lives in Wickedneſs and Impiety, he hath not ſo much as the hopes or aſſurance of eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as touching this unhappy Woman, if ſhe had lived a more ſober and godly Life, and inſtead of ſpending her precious Time in Pride and other ungodly Courſes, had ſpent it in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, in Prayers, and hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, then ſhe would have been able to overcome and withſtand the Temptation and Deluſions of the Devil, by which Means ſhe had never come to ſuch a dreadful End; and we hope this terrible Example will be ſufficient Warning to all wicked profane Perſons, how they dare to provoke God in ſuch a dreadful Manner; and will be a Means to move all wicked Perſons every where to amend their Lives. Many ſtrange Judgments and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have happened in this Age. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly conſidered, ought to put us in mind of Amendment of Life, and that our Tho'ts ought always to be on our latter End, and that there is a great Neceſſity for us to turn from our Sins and Wickedneſs, or elſe our Caſe hereafter will be dangerous, as more plainly appears, <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 3, 5. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> So that if we continue in our Sins without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, our Saviour expreſly tells us what will be the Conſequence thereof, Let us therefore reſolve to turn from our evil Ways, while the Door of Mercy is open, that ſo we may eſcape the Wrath to come. God might have cut us off before theſe awakening Judgments came, by which the Lord calls to the Inhabitants of the Earth to learn Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041287_0007_101A6B53E9AD7AB8"/>
ſo that thereby all wicked Perſons might be awakened, and come out of that groſs Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and alſo all of us from a vain wicked and looſe Converſation. Now as other Nations have had proofs of God's diſpleaſure, by the Plague that hath broke out amongſt them, ſo God in a wonderful Manner, has not only given us warning, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t alſo time and ſpace of Repentance; therefore let us ſeek the Lord while he is to be found, that we may be ready prepared for his coming, leſt that Day ſhould come upon us unawares. <hi>Watch therefore for ye know not what Hour your Lord doth come,</hi> Matt. xxiv. 42. We had need always to watch over ourſelves, and be conſtantly upon our Guard, that there we may be able to overcome the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our Ghoſtly Enemy, who goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking who he may devour.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that it is appointed for all Men once to die and after that come to Judgment. Then how happy will it be for them that die well, watch therefore over yourſelves that you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Sin, which is the Wages not only of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral but of Eternal Death. No one is ſure how long he hath to live, therefore to live well is the greateſt Happineſs, that when the Lord cometh we may be found ready to meet him, and go with him into everlaſting Reſt. Then the Terrors of Death ſhall not lay hold of you, nor the Flames of Hell affright you, though Heaven and Earth paſs away with great Noiſe and fervent Heat, the Skies all flaming, and the World conſumed with Fire, no Evil ſhall come nigh you; the Lord ſhall come
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041287_0008_101A6B56A5BA0CF0"/>
with thouſand of Angels and Saints to judge the Earth, whilſt the wicked ones ſhall call for Rocks and Mountains to hide them from his Face; but ſhall be to you a refreſhing Water in a thirſty Land when you hear him ſay well done thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou into thy Maſter's Joy; you ſhall be placed with the Sheep on the right Hand, and when the Wicked ſhall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire prepared for the DEVIL and his Angels, you that have watched the Hour of his coming, and prepared yourſelves to receive him, ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend triumphantly with him, to ſit down at his right Hand in Glory. Tho' the Sun be darkned and the Moon turned into Blood, and the Stars fall from Heaven in that great and eternal day of the Lord, your Bodies ſhall raiſe gloriouſly from the duſt to be united to the Soul, and not a Hair of your Head ſhall be diminiſhed: you ſhall receive the Reward of your Labour. For Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entered the Heart of Man to conceive thoſe Things that are laid up for the Righteous, nor the Torments thoſe feel that by wilful ſinning ſhall fail of that Happineſs.</p>
            <p>The Judgments and Exhortations mentioned, ought to make a deep Impreſſion on our Minds, and give us ſober Thoughts: The which, God of his infinite Mercy give us that we may be always prepared for our latter End. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, be with you all evermore,</hi> AMEN.</p>
