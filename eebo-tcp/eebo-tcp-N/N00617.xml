            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Beseech You, Bretheren, by the Mercies of God,</hi> that you now give your Serious Attention, unto the <hi>Returns</hi> which you are to make for those <hi>Mercies,</hi> declared in</p>
            <bibl>ROM. XII. 1.</bibl>
            <q>
               <hi>I beseech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that yee present your Bodies, a Living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, Holy, Acceptable unto God: Your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Service.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>As <hi>Reasonable</hi> a Thing certainly, as ever was proposed, in the World!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christians,</hi> I have set before you, a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Sacred Scripture, worthy to be <hi>Written,</hi> as once the whole <hi>New Testament</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is a part, was upon the Walls of a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monastery, <hi>In Letters of Gold;</hi> Yea, to be <hi>Written</hi> on the <hi>Fleshly Tables</hi> of our <hi>Hearts</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>We find this passage, in an Epistle Directed unto the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Epistle, which insisting on that Great Article of <hi>Justification</hi> only by Faith in the Obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the main Thing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000752_0004_0FAA51B36CD4CE80"/>
denyed by the present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and on the Conversion of the <hi>Israelitish Nation,</hi> which is to be <hi>Consequent</hi> on, and perhaps a little <hi>Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by, the Destruction to come shortly on the present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in those, as well as in other Notable Things, it mentions matters, wherein the <hi>Apostatical</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is in a peculiar manner concerned.</p>
            <p>But <hi>we</hi> also are concerned in these Things; and <hi>this Day,</hi> Eminently concerned in the Text now to be considered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of this Epistle, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in the first Eleven Chapters, the <hi>Practical,</hi> is comprized in the Five last; And this part, begins with a most Universal, &amp; most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Wherein we may note,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Advice. This is, That we do make our <hi>Bodies,</hi> which by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Next, The <hi>Manner</hi> of pressing it. This is, with, A Compellation, <hi>Brethren:</hi> An Obtestation, <hi>I beseech you;</hi> And a very weighty Argument, <hi>By the Mercies of God;</hi> that is to say, The <hi>Mercies</hi> of God lay upon us, a very powerful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation hereun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Know then, That according to the Stricter No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> its more general Distinction, is into <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> or <hi>Eucharistical</hi> Now Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in that Notion admits but <hi>One,</hi> and this of the <hi>former sort;</hi> by which <hi>One,</hi> even <hi>that of Himself,</hi> our Lord <hi>hath forever perfected them that are Sanctified:</hi> He is a <hi>Poor Priest,</hi> who dreams of any other. We our selves, or any Things that we do, in <hi>Religion,</hi> are capable of being <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> only by way of <hi>Analogy,</hi> &amp; that chiefly to the latter sort; <hi>So,</hi> we <hi>offer up Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</hi> A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> here signifies no more, than a <hi>Thing Devoted unto God.</hi> But what are we thus to <hi>Devote?</hi> Our <hi>Bodies.</hi> Hereby we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our <hi>whole Selves:</hi> but it is Expressed by, <hi>Your Bodies,</hi> for Distinction sake: the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Beasts</hi> were heretofore Offered, and now we are to Offer up <hi>Our own.</hi> This is called, a <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it infinitely <hi>Reasonable,</hi> that we should for ever be the <hi>Devoted Servants</hi> of such a Lord.
