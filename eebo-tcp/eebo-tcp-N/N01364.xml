            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Dead.</hi> We read; Jam. II. 26. <hi>The Body without the Breath, is Dead.

            <p>For a Man to depend on his <hi>own Life,</hi> tis a very Fooliſh Thing. We have that pungent Admonition given unto us; Jam.

               <hi>Hope,</hi> on a <hi>Breath</hi> which is <hi>going forth!</hi> What better this, than to <hi>Build Caſtles in the Air?</hi> Thus we read, Iſa. II. 22. <hi>Ceaſe ye from Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils: For wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Wo to that Man, who has <hi>no Friend,</hi> but a Man whoſe <hi>Breath</hi> is always <hi>going forth!</hi> A moſt uncertain and unſtable <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to ſubſiſt upon! Soul, Retire to the Glorious GOD, and ſay;
<q>What can any <hi>Man</hi> do for me? If a little <hi>Breath</hi> fails, Lo, my <hi>Friend,</hi> and my <hi>Stay</hi> fails. Lord, my welfare is laid up in thy Favour. Thou art my <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Living Friend. Man</hi> will <hi>Dye.</hi> I will expect no more from any <hi>Man,</hi> than what is to be expected from a <hi>Dying Thing.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And then; If a <hi>Man</hi> be our <hi>Enemy,</hi> what need we be much <hi>Afraid</hi> of him? A Man whoſe <hi>Breath</hi> will ſoon fail him, and then his <hi>Wrath</hi> all comes to nothing. When the poor <hi>Animal Dies,</hi> then (as the <hi>Italians</hi> uſe to ſay upon a certain Occaſion,) <hi>all his Malice is dead with him;</hi> Dead, that is, as to any miſchief, that we may ſuffer from it. We are thus adviſed; Iſai. LI. 12. <hi>I even I, am He
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001621_0011_0FB3E48F401E49E8"/>that comforts you, who art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a Man that ſhall Die, and of the Son of Man, that ſhall be made as Graſs.</hi> Tho' our Enemy, may <hi>Breathe out</hi> nothing but Fire and Fury againſt us; God can ſoon ſtop his <hi>Breath;</hi> He will ſoon be <hi>out of Breath.</hi> Poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what can he do! — He is not worth my taking any further notice of him! —</p>
            <p>Thirdly. How much ought we to <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> the Glorious GOD! How much keep alive a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Reliance on Him, and Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Him, in the <hi>Continuance of our Lives!</hi> It is the Demand; Pſal.

Yea, we ſhould be as unable to <hi>Live without Praying,</hi> as to <hi>Live without Breathing.</hi> Surely, we ſhould beware of proſtituting our <hi>Breath</hi> to the wrong uſe of any <hi>Evil-Speaking</hi> with it! The wretches who articulate their <hi>Breath</hi> into the horrid Language of Fiends; How worthy do they render themſelves, that the GOD whom they Blaſpheme ſhould ſmite them with an Immediate <hi>Suffocation!</hi> And as with our <hi>Breath</hi> we ſhould <hi>Bleſs God, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Even ſo, we ſhould be careful that we do not <hi>Curſe Men, who are made after the Similitude of God:</hi> No, But Study, that our <hi>Breath</hi> may be the vehicle of Truth and of Good unto them, and of what may <hi>Feed</hi> them, and <hi>Miniſter Grace unto them.</hi> And ſince we <hi>Live</hi> no longer than GOD indulges our <hi>Breath</hi> unto us, Oh! Let us take heed of the <hi>Sins</hi> that may provoke Him to take away our <hi>Breath.</hi> Urged unto any wicked Thing, ſay, <hi>Never while I Breathe, will I do ſuch a Thing!</hi> Let us particularly Take heed

            </p>
            <p>In fine; It was a ſharp Rebuke, — Oh! take heed of deſerving to be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked; Dan. V. 23. <hi>The God, in whoſe hand thy Breath is, and whoſe are all thy wayes, thou haſt not Glorified.</hi> Sirs, <hi>Glorify</hi> GOD, as the Giver of your <hi>Breath.</hi> And, <hi>To Glorify God,</hi> Let this be the main End of your <hi>Breathing,</hi> and of all that you do, as long as you <hi>Breathe.

            </p>
            <p>I will take advantage, from the phraſe of, <hi>Breath in the Noſtrils,</hi> to preſs your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon you.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001621_0014_0FB3E4948437BE10"/>the <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of GOD, you will find, His dreadful <hi>Anger,</hi> putting an End unto this <hi>Time,</hi> and puniſhing you, where the <hi>Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brimſtone,</hi> does kindle a <hi>Fire,</hi> that burns unto Eternity.</p>

               <hi>II.</hi> When a Man <hi>Dies,</hi> then he <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his Earth. Dying,</hi> is a <hi>Returning to the Earth,</hi> yea, to a Mans <hi>Own Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phraſe of, <hi>Returning to the Earth,</hi> leads us back to the <hi>Original</hi> of Man. For <hi>The Lord God formed Man out of the Duſt of the Ground.</hi> This is the <hi>Humiliation</hi> which we have to take notice of; Gen.

            <p>We will Enquire; Firſt; <hi>What</hi> of the <hi>Dying Man</hi> is it, that <hi>Returns to the Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one Word; So much of <hi>Man,</hi> as <hi>came out of the Earth.</hi> And therefore, not the <hi>whole of Man;</hi> therefore no more than the <hi>Body of Man.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> of Man, is of an <hi>Earthly Conſtitution.</hi> It was firſt lodg'd in the <hi>Earth.</hi> And the <hi>Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, is fetch'd from the <hi>Earth.</hi> Tis this, that is to find a lodging in the <hi>Earth,</hi>

There is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in Man, which will not <hi>Return to the Earth,</hi> but go another way. We read, Eccl.

We ſee none <hi>Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Earth,</hi> but we may ſay, <hi>Behold, the Deſolations that Sin has brought upon the Earth! Here is a part of the Hurt which our Sin has done unto us. Ah! Sin, Thou cauſe of our Death; what cauſe have we to count this more Bitter than Death? How can we Entertain Light Thoughts of ſo great an Evil!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will enquire; Secondly: What we have hinted unto us, in this, that the Dying Man muſt Return to <hi>His Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things. Firſt. A Dying Man is left Owner of nothing in this World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one may ſay, that little Piece of <hi>Earth,</hi> which he <hi>Returns</hi> unto. Tis very Remarkable; The <hi>Princes of this World;</hi> the Men who would have the <hi>Earth given to them alone;</hi> Even the <hi>Mighty Men</hi> who <hi>have the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Honourable Men</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001621_0017_0FB3E498F76BAEE0"/>who <hi>dwell in it;</hi> Of ſuch as theſe, it is here ſaid, <hi>

We read, 1 Tim. VI. 7. <hi>We brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</hi> Well known is the Story of that Great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Saladine,</hi> who would have it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd at his Funeral; <hi>A Death Shrowd is all that the Great Emperor of the Eaſt, is now left Owner of!</hi> Man, Thy <hi>Death</hi> will diſpoſſeſs thee, of all that thou haſt in the World. It will only leave thee a few <hi>Clods of the Valley,</hi> or a little Turf upon the Hill of <hi>Golgotha,</hi> to be <hi>Sweet</hi> unto thee. He that was Poſſeſſor of many <hi>Acres,</hi> yea, of many <hi>Countries,</hi> muſt <hi>return</hi> to a Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Six Foot of Earth.</hi> He that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001621_0018_0FB3E49A8588EA78"/>be himſelf lock'd up in a <hi>Stable-Cheſt,</hi> without a penny of it. So we read; Pſal. XLIX 16.17. <hi>One is made Rich, and the Glory of his Houſe increaſed; when he Dies, he ſhall carry nothing away; his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> It has been a Remark made on our Father <hi>Abrahams</hi> purchaſing the Cave of <hi>Macpelah,</hi> That the firſt purchaſe of Land that ever we read of was of a <hi>Burying place.</hi> O you Eager purchaſers of <hi>Land,</hi> and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for it, and what it produces; The <hi>Burying-place</hi> is that, wherein all in a little while will terminate.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Tis too Common a thing, for the <hi>Earth,</hi> to be all that the Dying Man has cared for, before and until he <hi>Return</hi> into it. It is <hi>His Earth,</hi> inaſmuch as his care was to make it HIS. His <hi>whole care</hi> was to make ſure of <hi>Earth.</hi> We read, Phil.

            <p>Secondly. Tho' we <hi>Return to the Earth,</hi> yet let us Believe and Rejoyce in the Great Saviour, who will <hi>Redeem us from the Earth.</hi> Our Dear Saviour ſayes unto His Faithful Ones, (like what He ſaid unto our Father <hi>Jacob,) Be not afraid, my Child, of returning to thy Earth.

               </gap> true; The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is as great a Work, as <hi>Creation.</hi> Indeed, it is here intimated, That if Man be recovered after his <hi>Death,</hi> he muſt be fetched out of <hi>his Earth</hi> again. But then, he that <hi>made Man out of the Duſt,</hi> can <hi>Raiſe Man out of the Dust.</hi> My Brethren, will you attend unto <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation?</hi> The Day is at hand, when the words of the Holy <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; <hi>The many Sleepers in the Duſt of the Earth ſhall awake;</hi> And when the words of the Holy <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhall have their Accompliſhment; <hi>They who dwell in the Duſt, ſhall awake and Sing.</hi> But are there no Songs then, that we may <hi>go down to the Duſt,</hi> and fall <hi>Aſleep</hi> withall? Yea, there are <hi>Songs for that Night,</hi> where-with <hi>God our Maker</hi> has furniſhed us. That is one of the <hi>Songs;</hi> Pſal.

VII. 8. <hi>Rejoyce not against me; O mine Enemy; when I fall, I ſhall ariſe; when I ſit in Darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a Light unto me.</hi> Oh!

            <p>But my Diſcourſe is coming to an <hi>End:</hi> And the <hi>End</hi> of all, is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Article of it. There is but one <hi>Propoſition</hi> more belonging to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. In that very Day,</hi> when our <hi>Lives</hi> come to an <hi>End,</hi> our <hi>Thoughts</hi> alſo come to an <hi>End.</hi> Our <hi>Death</hi> ſtrikes at our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and lays an Arreſt upon them, in ſuch Terms as thoſe; Ezek.

            </p>
            <p>The Thing to be now Enquired is; What <hi>Thoughts,</hi> will <hi>Periſh,</hi> and <hi>come to an End,</hi> when we <hi>Return Breathleſs to the Earth,</hi> and our <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> comes to <hi>an End?</hi>

Not, <hi>All Thoughts.</hi> Our Minds won't Leave off all <hi>Thinking,</hi> when we Leave off <hi>Breathing</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> here. The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Soul-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The Departed <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Godly</hi> Man, will have his <hi>Thoughts.</hi> The Soul in the State of Separation fulfill that Word; Pſal. LXIII. 6. <hi>I will Meditate on thee in the Night Watches.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> will feed on the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> in <hi>Thoughts</hi> on the Good Fruits, which a Divine Principle in it, brought forth, before its <hi>Tranſplantation</hi> into the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God. The <hi>Soul</hi> will be raviſhed with the <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> in the <hi>Multitude of its Thoughts</hi> on what the Saviour has done for him, and will do for him; and in moſt comfortable <hi>Viſions</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Departed <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Wicked</hi> man, will have his <hi>Thoughts</hi> too. We find it Spoken as to a Separate <hi>Soul</hi> of ſuch an one; Luk. XVI 25. <hi>Son, Remember what
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001621_0026_0FB3E4A66FB33E20"/>was in thy Life-time.</hi> The <hi>Conſcience</hi> in a Criminal <hi>Soul,</hi> will with bitter, doleful, raging <hi>Thoughts,</hi> Look back on the vile Things he did in the Time of his Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here.

            </p>
            <p>But then; Firſt: A <hi>Dead</hi> man has done <hi>Thinking</hi> on ſuch things as here take up the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the moſt of men. All <hi>Projecting Thoughts</hi> for Things to be done in this World; theſe are all over; they <hi>Periſh</hi> in <hi>that very Day,</hi> when we <hi>Dy,</hi> and leave the World. Thus we read, Eccl. IX 5, 6. <hi>The Dead know not any thing: Alſo their Love, and their Hatred, and their Envy, is now Periſhed; neither have they any more a Portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</hi> Whatever <hi>Thoughts</hi> we have, of becoming <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> here, and of having our <hi>Houſes</hi> made conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; now no more of thoſe <hi>Thoughts;</hi> we have now for ever done with ſuch <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly: A <hi>Dead</hi> man, is gone, paſt all <hi>Hopes,</hi> to Execute any of his <hi>Thoughts.</hi> His <hi>Thoughts</hi> now <hi>Periſh;</hi> inaſmuch as his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001621_0027_0FB3E4A8ACC388A0"/>
               <hi>Deſigns</hi> do ſo. If he has <hi>Contrived</hi> any thing to be done, the <hi>Contrivances</hi> are all defeated, in <hi>that very Day,</hi> when his <hi>Eyes</hi> are cloſed and his <hi>Hands</hi> can ſtir no more. Thus we read, Eccl. IX. 10. <hi>There is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom, in the Grave whither thou art going.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Plan we had laid in our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> tis now knock'd all to pieces: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals in our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> are now laid all aſide: The <hi>Thoughts</hi> are all Abortive, they miſcarry, and they <hi>never ſee the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: The moſt of the <hi>Thoughts</hi> in the moſt of men, are found <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> when they come to <hi>Dy.</hi> It is a Thunder-bolt hurled at the Head of an Impious man; Pſal. L. 21, 22. <hi>Thou Thoughteſt, I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch an One as thy ſelf; But I will Correct thee. Conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> An Infinitely Holy God may ſay to the Sinner, <hi>Thou thoughteſt I would not puniſh thee for thy Sins.</hi> A Glorious <hi>Chriſt</hi> may ſay, <hi>Thou thoughteſt there was no need of looking after an Intereſt in me.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Sinful <hi>Sin</hi> may ſay, <hi>Thou thoughteſt me to have no great Evil in me.</hi> A <hi>ſorry World</hi> may ſay, <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I ſhould afford
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001621_0028_0FB3E4AA294527B0"/>a Satisfying Portion to thee.</hi> A Sinner in ill Terms with Heaven, has his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Thoughts,</hi> that he ſhall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he <hi>Dies,</hi> When <hi>Death</hi> comes, he is <hi>Torn to Pieces.</hi> Ay, and ſo are his <hi>Thoughts</hi> too. He <hi>Periſhes,</hi> and all his <hi>Vain Thoughts Periſh with him.</hi> His <hi>Thoughts</hi> are found woful Errors, and in <hi>that very Day,</hi> they <hi>Periſh,</hi> with an Eternal Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them.</p>
            <p>And now, in a few Admonitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Obſervation, Let us <hi>bear the Concluſion of the Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. What <hi>Thoughts</hi> you have, that you will Turn to God, and make ſure of being Happy after <hi>Death;</hi> Oh! Let theſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> be accompliſhed before you <hi>Die;</hi> and therefore, importunately and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proſecuted. The <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the Delaying Sinner, his <hi>Thoughts</hi> that he will One Day Turn, and Live unto God, by that <hi>Repentance</hi> which he now delays; <hi>In that very Day</hi> when he dies, theſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> all <hi>Periſh;</hi> and ſo does he for his Leaving them ſo unfiniſhed. A Sinner has his <hi>Thoughts</hi> of this Tendency, <hi>I will hereafter forſake my Sin, and accept my Saviour, and give my ſelf up unto God; and will take a

Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Sinners, Thy <hi>Thoughts</hi> are all <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</hi> There is no Room left for any more ſuch <hi>Thoughts.</hi> Thy Lamentable cry may now be that; Job XVII. 11. <hi>My Dayes are paſt, my purpoſes are broken off even the Thoughts of my Heart.</hi> As it hath been ſaid, <hi>They that go down to the Pit, cannot hope:</hi> So may it be ſaid; <hi>In that very Day, when Men go down to the Pit, they cannot have any more Thoughts how to eſcape the Pit.</hi> It is <hi>too late</hi> now, to <hi>Think</hi> on that Great Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do to be Saved?</hi> Wherefore, O <hi>Think</hi> preſently what you have to do; Even before it be <hi>too late;</hi> and let your <hi>Thoughts</hi> be preſently put in Execution.

            <p>Secondly; Be not miſled into <hi>Thoughts</hi> which will <hi>Periſh,</hi> as the <hi>Dreams</hi> of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided <hi>Life,</hi> when you come to <hi>Dic.</hi> while men are Living, in the Midſt, and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be better Spent, than in the diligent Service of God!</hi> Of this <hi>World,</hi> a Dying Man, who is taking his Leave of the <hi>World;</hi> ſuch an one thinks, <hi>A moſt Undone Man is he, who is put off with a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch a diſpicable-World!</hi> Of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or a Life Placed in Holy Eſſays to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Bleſſedneſs after Death; What are the <hi>Thoughts of a Dying Man?</hi> They are, <hi>'Tis Good for me to draw near unto God.</hi> My Hearets, Take up ſuch <hi>Thoughts</hi> Now.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001621_0031_0FB3E4AEADF4B988"/>A <hi>Dying-Hour</hi> will <hi>Confirm</hi> theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and not <hi>Confound</hi> them.

And while you cheriſh theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> you muſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour none but <hi>Right Thoughts</hi> about <hi>Your ſelves.</hi> It is a Warning from God; Gal.

            <p>He had an <hi>Academical Education,</hi> which brought him to the Laurels of our Two <hi>Degrees.</hi> His Friends deſigned him for the <hi>Evangelical Miniſtry;</hi> but his <hi>Genius</hi> led him rather to that Employment, which Educates other, to be <hi>Miniſters;</hi> and a Place in the Tribe of <hi>Sinteon,</hi> rather than of <hi>Levi.</hi> He had performed the part of a <hi>School-Maſter</hi> in diverſe Places, but was at length choſen, (and we thought, <hi>fixed,</hi>) the firſt Maſter of the <hi>Grammar School,</hi> Erected lately by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

And reading a Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Contemplations on Eternity,</hi> I ſaw with more awakened Thoughts, that I had but a Little Time to be here, &amp; that I had a Great Work to do, and that it would be infinitely worth my while to get an Intereſt in my Saviour here, and ſo have an Eternity of Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. I have been often times perplexed concerning my Eternal Welfare; and often full of Doubts &amp; Fears, whether I ſhould be Saved &amp; whether the Holy One would be willing to Save Such a Sinful Creature. I have ſometimes almoſt run
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001621_0041_0FB3E4BDCB6F4AB8"/>into Deſpair; But then, I have cried unto God, and begged of Him, that He would help me to Repent of my Sin, and Believe on my Saviour. And the Lord has heard me; and brought much Comfort into my Soul. Eſpecially in helping me, to call to Mind that Scripture; <hi>Come unto me, all ye that Labour &amp; are heavy-laden, &amp; I will give you Reſt.</hi> And from that Word, <hi>God ſent His Son into the World, not to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the World but that the World thro' Him might be Saved:</hi> God helped me to ſee how willing the Glorious Redeemer is, to Save Poor Sinners; and I was Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to come &amp; caſt my ſelf upon Him, and Rely, upon Him alone for Salvation.</p>
               <p>I ſaw, that I who now durſt not live in any known Sin &amp; who would not live in the Omiſſion of any known Duty, yet really did ſo while I neglected a due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inaſmuch as not only the Commands of God in His Word, have often called me to give my ſelf, Soul &amp; Body, up unto Him, but alſo the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> which I profeſs &amp; my <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in which I took the Lord to be my God, &amp; Renounced the Fleſh &amp; the World &amp; the Devil &amp; came under a Ded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ere he had been Two Years a Student at the Colledge, he had made a more ſenſible progreſs in that <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Then I find an Inſtrument written and ſigned by him, Sept. 21. 1706.

            <p>That he might improve in univerſal Knowledge, and Enrich his mind with the Labours of a Diligent Hand, he had his <hi>Quotidiana;</hi> or Blank Books, wherein he entered the more notable things that occur'd unto him in his Reading: and ſtill num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the <hi>Notata,</hi> he formed an Index of them, that he might readily turn unto them In ſuch imitable wayes, he held on, preparing for the <hi>Death;</hi> which has now bereaved us of him.</p>
