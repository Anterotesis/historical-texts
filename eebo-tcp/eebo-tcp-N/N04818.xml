            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Compliance with your Deſire, in which ſome others of my worthy Friends have joined with you, I now ſend you my Tho'ts on a Queſtion which you have propoſed to me. And this I do, not only that I may gratify you and them; but alſo becauſe I think the Queſtion propoſed to be of very conſiderable Importance; and am in Hopes that a juſt Anſwer to it may be of ſome Service.</p>
            <p>The QUESTION is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether</hi> COMMON <hi>and</hi> SAVING GRACE <hi>do</hi> SPECI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICALLY DIFFER <hi>one from the other, or</hi> GRADU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALLY <hi>only?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, This Queſtion needs not to have, much ſaid for the Explanation of it.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Grace</hi> here (waving all other Acceptations of the Word) I underſtand <hi>that which is</hi> QUALITATIVE, <hi>or ſuch</hi> QUALIFICATIONS <hi>freely given by God to Men, as they are made the better by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>common</hi> Grace, I underſtand ſuch as <hi>Perſons may be made the Subjects of, and yet never be ſaved:</hi> But by <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Grace, I underſtand ſuch <hi>Gifts or Qualifications only, as thoſe who ſhall be eternally ſaved, are made Partakers of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006008_0003_1027153D836B2EE0"/>By the differing of theſe two <hi>ſpecifically</hi> one from the other, I underſtand their <hi>differing as Things of differing Natures or Kinds</hi> do, as Silver and Gold &amp;c. But by their differing <hi>gradually</hi> only, I intend their differing only as Things of the ſame Nature or Kind may do in <hi>Quantity;</hi> and thus a great deal of Silver or Gold differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a little: Or in <hi>Degree;</hi> and thus one Man has a greater Degree of Strength or Wiſdom than another, tho' of the very ſame Kind.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I underſtand your Queſtion; and I think that a due Reſolution of it depends very much upon a right Anſwer to another, namely, <hi>Whether Mankind have by their firſt and great Tranſgreſſion in</hi> Adam, <hi>their common Head, wholly loſt all their Power to perform any Acts of Obedience unto God in a gracious or truly holy Manner, ſo as not to be able to worſhip or ſerve the bleſſed God, or purſue the great End of their Being, without God's giving them new Powers?</hi> For if this be Man's Caſe ſince the Fall, then I think ſuch Grace muſt be beſtowed on him, in order to his Recovery out of this Condition, as will in ſome Meaſure reſtore the Powers he has loſt, and as will put him in a Capacity to ſerve God acceptably, and of enjoying a happy Communion with him: But if, on the other Hand, Mankind have not loſt the Power above deſcribed, tho' it ſhould be granted that they are become diſinclined unto Good, and prone and diſpoſed to ſin againſt God, ſo as to ſtand in need of powerful Motives to excite them to their Duty, yet they need not ſuch a Kind of Grace, as on the other Suppoſition they do, but moral Grace (as ſome call it) or moral Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, being perſwaded that Mankind have by their Fall loſt all their Power to perform Actions that are ſpiritually good and holy, or of living unto God in ſuch a Manner as they ſhould do, they muſt, I think, in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006008_0004_1027153F1A95DCC8"/>
order hereunto have <hi>another Kind of Grace</hi> given to them, than on the contrary Suppoſition they can be juſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to need.</p>
            <p>My Anſwer therefore to your Queſtion is, That there is a <hi>ſpecifical Difference</hi> between <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace, and they differ not <hi>gradually,</hi> or in <hi>Degree</hi> only.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is generally acknowledged among us, that Man has by his Fall loſt all his Power to ſerve God in a gracious and holy Manner; and becauſe I hope that you, Sir, be not in Doubt of this, I ſhall in a <hi>Manner</hi> take the ſame for granted; yet I ſhall, for the Sake of <hi>others</hi> ſay <hi>ſomething</hi> for the confirming of it in a few ſhort Hints, which will caſt ſome Light on it.</p>
            <p>Let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Puniſhment threatned in the Covenant of Works, which God at firſt entred into with Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> Geneſis 2.16, 17. while in Innocency, did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly comprize <hi>ſpiritual Death</hi> in it, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> conſiſted in Man's <hi>Loſs of the Image of God,</hi> in which he was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. Man's Life, before the Fall, conſiſted in his Integrity, or Uprightneſs, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made Man upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Death threatned in the firſt Covenant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>ſeized</hi> on all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, (in the Way of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation) as appears in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. <hi>Job</hi> 25.4. and Chap. 14. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. with which Texts do well agree the Words of our Saviour in Joh. 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All Mankind are accordingly ſince their Fall, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi> as ſpiritually dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead:</hi> But that Chriſt died for all is in the next Words affirmed, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. One Thing intended by Mens being dead in Sin is their being <hi>without Strength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. <hi>For when we were yet without Strength, in due Time Chriſt died for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006008_0005_10271541CB05EE10"/>
the Ungodly.</hi> Now by this, Man's <hi>utter Inability</hi> to know and ſerve God in a ſpiritual Manner is intended, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Rom. 8.6, 7, 8. <hi>For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace: Becauſe the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God; for it not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> To the ſame Purpoſe is that, in 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> With thoſe Places the Words of our Saviour do well agree, in Luk. 6.43, 44. <hi>For a good Tree bringeth not forth corrupt Fruit; neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit; for every Tree is known by his own Fruit; for of Thorns Men do not gather Figs, nor of a bramble Buſh gather they Grapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It is evident that Man's Power to do well, which he loſt by his Fall is (in Part) <hi>reſtored</hi> to him in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Of this we are plainly informed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Alſo in Chap. 5. 4. <hi>For whatſoever is born of God overcometh the World.</hi> Compare with theſe Texts, Eph. 2.10. <hi>For we are his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> And Chap. 4.23, 24. <hi>And be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind. And put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> The ſame, in Effect, we have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that Sinners muſt have new Powers given them, before they can in a holy Manner live unto God as they ſhould do; and that moral Suaſion cannot ſupply what is wanting unto this End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006008_0006_1027154360C5E480"/>Theſe Things being premiſed, I ſhall proceed now, Sir, to offer, the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of my Opinion in the Point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration. And they are ſuch as here follow.</p>
            <div n="1" type="reason">
               <head>REASON I.</head>
               <p>My firſt Reaſon is from the great <hi>Improbability</hi> of the Suppoſition I oppoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe whom God <hi>eternally ſaves,</hi> have no <hi>Qualifications,</hi> by him beſtowed on them, which are in <hi>their Kind</hi> any <hi>better,</hi> than <hi>thoſe beſtowed</hi> by him on many that he <hi>ſuffers to die in their Sins and periſh for ever.</hi> He is ſuppoſed indeed to give unto thoſe whom he ſaves <hi>larger Meaſures of Grace of the ſame Kind</hi> than he gives to thoſe that die in their Sins, but <hi>not</hi> Things that are in <hi>their Nature at all better.</hi> How contrary is this to that ſpoken to ſuch as were ſuppoſed truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Heb. 6.9. <hi>But, Beloved, we are perſwaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, tho' we thus ſpeak.</hi> By <hi>better Things,</hi> we muſt here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch as are <hi>better than God beſtows on any whom he does not ſave,</hi> and better than thoſe <hi>juſt before mentioned</hi> in Verſes 4, 5, 6. How good ſoever they may ſeem to be.</p>
               <p>Here I would aſk (1) Is it at all credible that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows no better inherent Endowments upon thoſe he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifies by his Grace thro' the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, and reconciles to himſelf, than on thoſe who remain in a State of Condemnation, and have the Wrath of God abiding on them for ever? (2) Again, Is not that Grace which is beſtowed on thoſe that are ſaved, beſtowed unto this End, that they may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light?</hi> And if ſo, can we think that this is of no better a Kind than God often beſtows on thoſe who will be the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Wrath for ever? Can we, I ſay, think it likely that God beſtows no Gifts, in their Nature and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006008_0007_10271547648C5A90"/>
Kind, better on the former of theſe, than on the other? The very Suppoſition of this, carries ſo much Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in it, that it ſeems ſtrange to me that any will try to defend it. Indeed, I my ſelf think, that God does not qualify any with ſaving Holineſs before he juſtifies them: But that he never beſtows any <hi>better Kind of Grace</hi> on thoſe whom he ſaves, than he beſtows on ſome that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but only <hi>different Degrees of Grace</hi> of the <hi>ſame Kind,</hi> I at preſent think not. I believe that God beſtows a better Kind of Grace on thoſe whom he eternally ſaves, than that Sort which Sinners may, or may not, <hi>receive in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1.</p>
            </div>

               <head>REASON II.</head>
               <p>My ſecond Reaſon to prove a <hi>ſpecific Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace, I ſhall take from ſome <hi>plain Intimations which we have of ſuch a Difference</hi> in ſeveral Texts of Scripture. Such a Difference is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated or imported in 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpiritual judged all Things, yet he himſelf is judged of no Man.</hi> So again in Coloſ. 1.9. <hi>That ye might be filled with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Will in all Wiſdom and ſpiritual Underſtanding.</hi> Again, in Prov. 9.10. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wiſdom; and the Knowledge of the Holy is Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Thus ſaving Faith is called the <hi>Faith of God's Elect,</hi> Tit. 1.1. no Doubt to ſhew that this is a Faith of a different Kind from any which the Non-Elect may have.

               <head>REASON III.</head>
               <p>My third Reaſon is becauſe it appears by Scripture, that <hi>God works in a very different Manner</hi> in the Production of <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> from the Way of his Working in the Production of that which is <hi>common:</hi> As I ſuppoſe there is a great Difference in Reſpect of <hi>Nature or Kind</hi> between common and ſaving Grace, ſo the <hi>Way of God's working in the Production</hi> of theſe is very different.</p>
               <p>This may be cleared up by conſidering the Way of God's working in the Production of <hi>each</hi> of theſe ſeverally.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, I will begin with the Way of God's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſaving Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it appears by Scripture that this Kind of Grace is wrought by an <hi>immediate Act of God's Power,</hi> and ſo in a Way <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> This I think is plainly aſſerted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. Where we are told concerning true Believers, that they were <hi>born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, but of God.</hi> They are not begotten &amp; born by any
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006008_0009_1026E0C3222760B0"/>
                  <hi>natural Means,</hi> or <hi>human Power,</hi> but <hi>according to the Will of God,</hi> and by his <hi>Power only.</hi> And thus are all true Saints born of God, and <hi>none</hi> but ſuch, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. &amp; Ver. 5. And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. Now in being thus begotten and born they muſt needs be wholly <hi>paſſive:</hi> They do not <hi>make themſelves</hi> new Creatures, it is God makes them ſuch by his Spirit in the <hi>Day of his Power,</hi> by breathing ſpiritual Life into their Souls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.4. Or in other Words by <hi>putting his Spirit into them,</hi> and <hi>cauſing them to live,</hi> Ver. 14. Which well agrees with what God ſays, Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I will put my Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi> With which Words of God, thoſe alſo well agree, in Ver. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> God's thus changing Men's Hearts is ſpoken of as a <hi>Work of his mighty Power,</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. <hi>Even the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that believe, according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead, and ſet him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places.</hi> Thoſe thus by God wro't upon and changed, are ſaid to be <hi>created a new by him,</hi> and to be <hi>new Creatures,</hi> in Eph. 2.10. <hi>For we are his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which he hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Again, in Chap. 4.23, 24. <hi>And be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind; and put on the new Man which after God is created in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Such a Work of God on his Soul, <hi>David</hi> prayed for, Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> All that are in Chriſt have ſuch a Change in them 2 Cor.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006008_0010_1027154E53A94B70"/>
4.17. <hi>Therefore if any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; old Things are paſſed away, behold all Things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</hi> Or ſuch a Work as this, that is intended, 2 Theſ. 1.11. called a <hi>fulfilling in Men all the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God's Goodneſs, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus of the <hi>Way</hi> of God's working ſpecial ſaving Grace in Mens Souls, in which he in part reſtores thoſe Powers to them, which, by their Apoſtacy from him, they loſt.</p>
               <p>I will now proceed, ſecondly, to conſider the <hi>Way of God's working</hi> in the Production of <hi>common</hi> Grace, or of his Beſtowment of it on ſuch as are indued with it: And with Reſpect to this, it is no where ſaid in Scripture, that God does it by ſuch an Act of his Power, as that by which he gives <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace: We are indeed in the Scriptures informed, that he does greatly enlighten, convince and reform many, whom he never ſavingly converts, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. And that he does beſtow a <hi>temporary Faith</hi> on them, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.20, 21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. compared. We are alſo informed how much the Lives of ſuch as have no other than common Grace may be reformed, and yet that ſuch may fall away and periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.29, —22. And ſo alſo in <hi>Math.</hi> 12.43, —45. With which that alſo agreeth, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24,—26. And which contains the Sum of what is in theſe Texts ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man that is made righteous ſo far as <hi>common</hi> Grace can effect it, may again fall away or turn from his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and by that Means fail of ſaving Grace, and periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>Now altho' that common Grace, which I have thus deſcribed, be wro't by the Word and Spirit of God, as really as that which is ſaving, is, yet being a Work of a <hi>different Kind,</hi> and wro't by a <hi>different Kind of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> from the other, it is not ſaving Grace, nor ought to be ſo called, in the ſame Senſe with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:006008_0011_1027155075978F08"/>Now I ſuppoſe that the Way of God's working this common Grace is by <hi>moral Swaſion</hi> only: I know not how to prove the contrary to this. But by moral Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here, called by ſome, <hi>moral Grace,</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand external Means only, but thoſe <hi>ſtrivings of God's Spirit</hi> alſo, which unregenerate Sinners may enjoy, and reſiſt and quench, and be utterly deprived of, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.10. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</p>
               <p>To be ſure it does not appear there is any ſuch Work of God in the conferring of this Grace on Sinners, which may be loſt, as there is in the working of that which I call ſaving. And as the Operations of God differ by which thoſe two Sorts of Grace are produced, ſo the <hi>Kinds of Grace</hi> differ that are wro't by them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="reason">
               <head>REASON IV.</head>
               <p>That ſaving Grace differs <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from that which is <hi>common,</hi> appears, <hi>fourthly,</hi> from the <hi>Names</hi> by which it is called in the Scriptures, being ſuch as belong to the Thing ſo called, whether its Degrees are great or ſmall, even to the loweſt as well as the higheſt.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaving Grace is in Scripture called <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in an <hi>appropriate Senſe.</hi> So in Prov. 9.10. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wiſdom, and the Knowledge of the Holy is Underſtanding.</hi> And Prov. 2.5, 6. <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. For the Lord giveth Wiſdom, out of his Mouth coming Knowledge and Undeſtanding.</hi> And in Verſes 10.11. <hi>When Wiſdom entreth into thine Heart, &amp; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is pleaſant unto thy Soul, Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, Underſtanding ſhall keep thee.</hi> And again, in Chap. 4.7. and Jam. 3.17. <hi>But the Wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hypocriſy.</hi> This <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is <hi>true Grace,</hi> by which Men are <hi>made wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. Again,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006008_0012_1027155496689E38"/>
This Kind of Grace is called the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> This is alſo called <hi>God's Image,</hi> Eph. 2.10. and the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. So it is called <hi>Holineſs, that without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. It is alſo called the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.9. and the <hi>Spirit abſolutely,</hi> in Gal. 5.17. And a <hi>new Heart</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27. and a <hi>new Creature,</hi> Gal. 6.5. This I take alſo to be called the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. <hi>But whoſoever ſhall drink of the Water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt, but the Water I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> So alſo in Joh. 7.38. <hi>He that believeth in me as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Texts I underſtand <hi>neither Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> nor <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> but the <hi>inherent Graces of the holy Spirit.</hi> The ſame I take to be intended by the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> which true Believers are ſaid to have <hi>within them,</hi> Luk. 17.21. This tho' it be often <hi>ſmall</hi> at firſt like a <hi>Grain of Muſtard Seed,</hi> yet it always <hi>remains</hi> and <hi>grows,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.20.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Names</hi> by which ſaving Grace is called in Scripture, ſhew it to be of a different <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> from <hi>common</hi> Grace. The Graces given to thoſe that periſh are <hi>never called by ſuch Names,</hi> and <hi>in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> as they are given to ſaving Grace.</p>

               <p>My fifth Reaſon is becauſe the <hi>Promiſes of eternal Life and Bleſſedneſs</hi> in the Scriptures made unto ſuch as have ſaving Grace, are made unto them <hi>without Reſpect to any certain and preſcribed Degree of Strength ſo or ſo increaſed &amp;c.</hi> That ſuch as are endued with ſaving Grace are under Promiſes of everlaſting

Mercies, I here take for granted, as being what I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you, and others with whom I am now concerned, acknowledge. Nor can that well be called <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace, unto which a Promiſe of Salvation is not made. But it does not appear that God promiſing Salvation to ſuch as are endowed with ſaving Grace, does fix on any <hi>certain Degree</hi> of it, unto which he confines the Benefits he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. No: God in his Promiſes ſpeaks of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualifications <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as Things in their Nature, ſuch as that whoſoever have them, have a Right by his Promiſes unto his everlaſting Mercies, yea, and are in Part poſſeſſed of them. Thus we are told in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>He that heareth my Word and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation; but is paſſed from Death unto Life.</hi> So in 1 Joh. 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death unto Life, becauſe we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Death.</hi> God does not tell us, that he that has a true Faith in Chriſt, or Hope or Truſt, &amp;c. ſhall have eternal Life, provided theſe Graces are of a <hi>ſufficient Strength;</hi> but aſſures us that thoſe that <hi>have them,</hi> are bleſſed, and ſhall be eternally ſaved. So in Joh. 6.40. <hi>And this is the Will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everlaſting Life: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt Day.</hi> See alſo Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that put their Truſt in him.</hi> So in Jer. 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe Hope the Lord is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is our <hi>having</hi> true Grace, without Regard to the <hi>Degree</hi> of it, that is the <hi>Evidence of our Right</hi> to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State of Glory. If we have Faith &amp; Holineſs, with Reſpect to the <hi>Nature</hi> of them, <hi>true,</hi> we ſhall be ſaved, how <hi>low</hi> ſoever the <hi>Degree</hi> of them be. If the <hi>Seed of God</hi> be <hi>in</hi> us, it will <hi>remain</hi> in us for ever, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.9. Tho' it be but <hi>like a Grain of Muſtard Seed,</hi> it will grow

Tho' at preſent the good Work of God be but <hi>begun,</hi> yet it will certainly be <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on,</hi> by the <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> Hence that in Phil. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very Thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Such as have <hi>true Grace,</hi> are <hi>kept by the Power of God thro' Faith unto Salvation.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. So true is that ſpoken of our Saviour, Iſai. 42.3. <hi>A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break; and the ſmoaking Flax ſhall he not quench; he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto Truth.</hi>

               <p>I argue here alſo, ſixthly, from the <hi>virtue and efficacy</hi> aſcribed in Scripture to <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace, and <hi>no other,</hi> to prove that it differs in the Nature of it from <hi>common</hi> Grace. Thus we are told in 1 Joh. 3.9. that ſuch as <hi>are born of God and have his Seed in them, cannot commit Sin:</hi> that is, they cannot Sin as unregenerate Perſons do, <hi>viz.</hi> live in Sin as Perſons under the Dominion of it, and <hi>ſin unto Death.</hi> Of ſuch we are accordingly told in Chap. 5th of the ſame Epiſtle, Ver. 4. that they <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>overcome the World</hi> by that Faith of which they are the Subjects; which cannot be a <hi>common</hi> Faith, but a <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace of God's Spirit. The ſame <hi>Kind</hi> of Faith is ſaid to <hi>purify the Heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. and to <hi>work by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. Of the ſame Kind of Faith we are alſo told, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 12.13. that it <hi>worketh effectually in them that believe;</hi> i. e. it always does ſo. All that have Faith of this Kind may truly ſay, as in 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we all with open Face beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of ſuch Perſons as have this Kind of Grace, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways holds true, Prov. 4.18. <hi>But the Path of the Juſt is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and move unto the perfect Day.</hi> Such may indeed fall into Sin as it were

by Surprize, and be overcome by very powerful Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but if they fall, they will riſe again, and will <hi>grow in Grace,</hi> and get more ſpiritual Strength. Hence that in Job 17.9. <hi>The Righteous alſo ſhall hold on his Way, and he that hath clean Hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> But what is here ſaid, cannot be affirmed of Perſons that have the <hi>higheſt Degrees</hi> of <hi>common Grace.</hi> This is evident in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.</p>

               <p>My ſeventh Reaſon for what I here maintain is, that if the contrary be ſuppoſed to be true, ſeveral <hi>great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities will follow;</hi> (1) That a Perſon may have a real Work of Grace wrought in his Soul, in its <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Kind ſaving,</hi> and yet be ſtill in an <hi>unregenerate State,</hi> not <hi>born of God,</hi> becauſe he has not ſo <hi>great a Degree of Grace,</hi> as is ſuppoſed to be neceſſary to that End. Thus a Perſon that hath <hi>ſome</hi> Degree of true Faith &amp; Holineſs, muſt yet be denominated an <hi>Unbeliever,</hi> and an <hi>unholy</hi> Perſon; and a Perſon that has a <hi>Love to God and Chriſt really true</hi> as to the Kind of it, is ſtill to be accounted an <hi>Hater of God and Chriſt,</hi> becauſe his Love is <hi>no ſtronger:</hi> How abſurd is this!

Or might he go to Heaven, tho' <hi>not juſtified</hi> in his Life? (3) It will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either that a Perſon <hi>not juſtified</hi> may <hi>die well,</hi> and <hi>go to Heaven;</hi> or that a Perſon in Part <hi>ſanctified,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Degree of <hi>true Holineſs,</hi> may <hi>utterly</hi> loſe or fall from it, and ſo <hi>periſh for ever.</hi> But will either of theſe be allowed?

of God on his Soul, which is in the <hi>Nature of it ſaving;</hi> and ſuch as Perſons ſavingly united to Jeſus Chriſt, have wrought in them; becauſe he has not ſuch <hi>high Degrees</hi> of Holineſs as are ſuppoſed to be required to prove that Perſons are in a <hi>State of Grace.</hi> May a Doctrine on which ſuch Abſurdities will follow, be received as true.</p>

               <p>I argue here eighthly for what I hold, from the great Difficulty of Chriſtians obtaining <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of their good. Eſtate, if the Difference betwixt common and ſaving Grace were only gradual, and not ſpecifical. That a <hi>comfortable Aſſurance</hi> of our good Eſtate is both neceſſary and attainable, is I think generally believed among us: and the ſame ſeems alſo evident from Scripture; as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8.

But now, if Perſons cannot be aſſured of the Goodneſs and Safety of their Eſtate, from their being endowed with Grace of any Kind whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, tho' as good in the Nature of it as any ever have given to them; but ſtill the Goodneſs of their Eſtate depends on the Meaſure and Degree of the Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them; it ſeems to me exceeding difficult, on this Suppoſition, for a Perſon to obtain a well grounded Aſſurance that his State is good: For tho' ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finds, on Self-Examination, that he is <hi>really</hi> endowed with Faith in Chriſt, Love to God, Hope &amp; Confidence in his Mercy &amp;c. which are good as to the Kind of them, as <hi>any that are deſcribed in Scripture,</hi> and as the <hi>beſt Saints</hi> are the Subjects of, and does not at all call this in Queſtion; yet the ſame Man may ſtill remain in <hi>great Fears</hi> that he is not yet <hi>paſſed from Death unto Life,</hi> as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. becauſe he is yet under Doubts that his Graces are not yet ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> as they muſt be in order to the Change of his State. <q>I find, ſays ſuch a Saint, that I <hi>truly believe</hi> in the Son of God, and truſt in

his Name, and <hi>repent</hi> of my many Sins againſt him; but I know not whether theſe Graces which I have in my Heart, are ſufficient in their <hi>Degrees</hi> to evidence my State to be ſafe and happy; nor do I know how I ſhall be reſolved in this Point.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This now ſeems to be a difficult Caſe on the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition impleaded; and in order to a Soul's having Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with Reſpect to it, it ſeems neceſſary that he be certainly informed what that Degree of Grace is which is evidential of a Man's Right to the everlaſting Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, promiſed in the Covenant of Grace; and by <hi>what Rules</hi> he may come to know whether he have obtained ſuch Degrees, or not. But this ſeems to be a Thing attended with much Perplexity; becauſe the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo far as I can ſee, <hi>ſay nothing about it:</hi> They indeed ſhew that Men muſt have <hi>true Grace,</hi> as Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Fear of God &amp;c. in order to their knowing their State to be good; but they ſay not a Word of any <hi>certain Degrees</hi> of Strength their Graces muſt be of, before they may look upon themſelves as born again, and as having a ſaving Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; and as being pardon'd and juſtified, &amp;c. Thus, if the Goodneſs of Mens States depended on the Strength of their Graces, and not on the Truth or Rectitude of them, the Children of God would be involved in very <hi>great Difficulties.</hi>

               <head>REASON IX.</head>
               <p>My ninth Argument to prove a <hi>ſpecifical</hi> Difference betwixt <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace is, becauſe we can ſhew <hi>wherein</hi> that Difference does conſiſt. It might be true, that there is ſuch a Difference betwixt theſe, tho' we were <hi>not</hi> able to ſhew wherein that Difference lies: but if this may be diſcovered, it will be from hence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there <hi>is</hi> indeed ſuch a Difference, becauſe that which <hi>is not</hi> cannot be <hi>known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006008_0018_10271567A3870C08"/>Now becauſe it ſeems very natural to aſk him who aſſerts ſuch a Difference betwixt Things, <hi>wherein that Difference conſiſts?</hi> I think it will be proper for me to attempt an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this Inquiry, in order to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidencing of what I aſſert, tho' I acknowledge there is a conſiderable Difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>And to this End I ſhall (1) briefly declare <hi>wherein</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>common Grace</hi> conſiſteth. (2) <hi>Wherein</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> conſiſts. And then (3) Endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>wherein</hi> the <hi>critical Difference</hi> betwixt <hi>theſe two</hi> lieth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I conceive that common Grace conſiſteth in ſuch Qualifications and Actions as Sinners <hi>not yet born of God</hi> or of the Spirit, may be the Subjects of, being favoured with the outward Means of Salvation, and ſuch Aids and Influences of the Holy Spirit, as Perſons yet in an unregenerate State, may have granted to them.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that by theſe, without what in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I intend by the ſaving Influences of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there may be, a very <hi>conſiderable Change</hi> wrought in ſinful Men, in which they have Favour ſhewn them; as appears in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. and many other Places. Such Qualifications I call common Grace; and if Men were not made the <hi>better</hi> by them, I know not why they ſhould be called by ſo <hi>good a Name.</hi> Thus I comprehend in what I call common Grace, whatſoever may be any Ways <hi>good, uſeful,</hi> or <hi>commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> of which ſuch as may be in an unregenerate State may be the Subjects, by what Name ſoever the ſame may be called, as <hi>Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Love, Zeal,</hi> &amp;c. And I could eaſily ſhew, that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace</hi> is in <hi>Scripture frequently called</hi> by <hi>ſuch Names</hi> as theſe, if there were need of it; and alſo that many that are not ſavingly converted, are the Subjects of ſuch Things or Graces.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006008_0019_1027156B9AEE3DC8"/>2. By ſaving Grace I mean a <hi>ſpecial Kind</hi> of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Holineſs; ſuch as is intended when we are told, that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is that <hi>without which no Perſon ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Of ſuch Grace or Holineſs as this, I ſuppoſe no Man can be a Subject but what is <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> and become a <hi>new Creature,</hi> or has a <hi>new Heart</hi> given to him, and a <hi>new Spirit put within him,</hi> or, in other Words, is <hi>created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10.</p>
               <p>Now Grace, underſtanding by it what is <hi>peculiar</hi> to ſuch as theſe, is nothing elſe but <hi>Man's Conformity to God's Image and holy Law:</hi> And when we ſpeak of this, we may diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Holineſs of Men's Hearts,</hi> and the <hi>Holineſs of their Actions,</hi> as our Saviour diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes betwixt the Goodneſs of the <hi>Tree</hi> and its <hi>Fruit,</hi> Luk. 6.43.</p>
               <p>And here by the Holineſs of a Man's <hi>Heart,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>that Rectitude of Soul, by which he is able or diſpoſed and inclined, to act after a gracious or holy Manner, being again endowed with the Image of God, which he loſt by his Fall,</hi> according to that in Eph. 4.23, 24. And by the Holineſs of a Man's <hi>Life,</hi> I here intend <hi>all thoſe good and holy Actions which he performs, and which flow from that Principle of Grace, which in his Regeneration he is endowed with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two are plainly diſtinguiſhed in the Scriptures, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.26, 27. Nor are there any Actions in a <hi>ſtrict Senſe</hi> holy, but what flow from a <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> or Holineſs in the Heart. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What the critical Difference is betwixt the two Sorts of Grace,</hi> under Conſideration. And to this I ſay, That the Difference betwixt them does, in my Opinion, chiefly conſiſt is this, that ſaving Grace, even the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree of it, does receive and entertain Things of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006008_0020_1027156E47D77628"/>
a ſpiritual Nature, with Approbation, Pleaſure and Delight, on Account of the intrinſick Excellency of them; which common Grace cannot do. That by ſaving Grace, ſpiritual Objects are thus received, I think very evident; nor is the Reaſon of this leſs plain. When a Perſon is endued with what is called the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> and the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> he can immediately taſte and reliſh the Sweetneſs of ſpiritual Objects, and find an inward Pleaſure and Delight in them. Such a Soul can <hi>taſte that the Lord is good and gracious,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. The Hearts of the Regenerate are changed into the Likeneſs of ſuch Things as are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually Good, and ſo cannot but delight in them. Such are transformed into <hi>the Image of God and Chriſt;</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and ſo cannot but love them; as in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. Similitude in this Caſe muſt needs be the Cauſe of Affection. Such therefore, love God and his Law, and his People that bear his Image, and all the good and holy Things that appertain to his Houſe and Worſhip; and find great Satisfaction in them: As in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.4. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. and 84.10. Such do <hi>eat that which is Good, and their Soul delighteth itſelf in Fatneſs,</hi> Iſai. 55.3. They <hi>ſit under</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit is ſweet unto their Taſte.</hi> (Cant. 2.3.) <hi>The Law of God's Mouth is better to them than Thouſands of Gold and Silver,</hi> Pſalm 119.72. They <hi>delight in it after the inner Man.</hi> It is <hi>ſweeter to them than the Honey or the Honey Comb,</hi> Pſal. 19.10. &amp; 119.103. It is impoſſible but that Perſons in a State of Grace ſhould thus perceive the ſweetneſs of Heavenly Things, when their Hearts are become holy like the Things which they are here ſuppoſed to love and delight in. Of ſuch therefore <hi>God is the exceeding Joy,</hi> (Pſal. 43.4.) And unto ſuch, <hi>Chriſt is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. The Divine Nature which they have in them, cannot but acquieſe in Things that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006008_0021_1027156FDC683B68"/>
are Divine. And they may with <hi>Peter,</hi> truly ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all Things; thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Joh. 21.17.</p>
               <p>But it is far otherwiſe with Perſons in a <hi>State of Nature. The carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. It is wholly oppoſite to God and Goodneſs; and therefore until this is in Part taken away, it is impoſſible that a Sinner ſhould at all <hi>delight himſelf in the Almighty,</hi> or <hi>chuſe the Things that pleaſe him.</hi> Job 27.10. He can taſte no real inward Pleaſure in ſpiritual Things, <hi>as ſuch.</hi> A Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf Love may move and excite an unregenerate Perſon to do <hi>many Things</hi> that are <hi>materially</hi> Good; and he may have <hi>ſome</hi> Joy in Things that are ſpiritual on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome <hi>Benefit</hi> he thinks he may receive by them; (Mat. 13.20. Iſai. 58.2.) But he has no Delight in them <hi>as good in themſelves,</hi> or as Things that have the Image of God ſtamped on them. Yea, by <hi>ſelf-love</hi> a Perſon in a State of Nature may be excited to deſire, and pray for, true Grace and Holineſs, being convinced that he muſt be damned if he have them not. Deep Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Reality of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhment, may excite in carnal Hearts a Deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the one and eſcape the other: A Man's crying out— <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved!</hi> is therefore no evidence that he is a new Creature. His deſires of good Things are not really for the <hi>Sake of God and Goodneſs,</hi> but out of <hi>Love to himſelf only:</hi> Nor has ſuch a Concern, the leaſt Spark of true Holineſs in it; yet it may be beneficial to the Subject of it, as it excites him to ſeek to God for that which is indeed ſaving Grace or true Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any ſuch Thing as a Man's being <hi>in Part,</hi> and <hi>but in Part regenerate;</hi> becauſe he that has the loweſt Degree of true Holineſs, is, with no more than that, a <hi>true Saint, born of God,</hi> and one that has the <hi>Seed of God in him;</hi> and <hi>He that has began the good Work in him, will perfect it to the Day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006008_0022_10271572BA246E10"/>If a Man may have ſome Degree of true Holineſs in him, (which is ſpiritual Life, a divine Nature, and the Image of God) and yet remain in an unregenerate State, as not having <hi>Grace enough</hi> to denominate him a Child of God, or ſo much as a <hi>Babe in Chriſt;</hi> I deſire to know whether he is not as yet alſo <hi>wholly unjuſtified;</hi> being <hi>unregenerate?</hi> And whether he muſt be <hi>damned,</hi> if he <hi>die</hi> in <hi>ſuch a State;</hi> and ſo <hi>go to Hell</hi> with <hi>ſome Degree</hi> of <hi>true Grace in his Soul?</hi> If not, whether his <hi>Juſtification</hi> is not alſo <hi>gradual,</hi> as his true Grace is? And <hi>where</hi> ſuch an one goes when he dies, i. e. to Heaven or Hell? or to Purgatory, as Roman Catholicks teach; becauſe they hold our <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be <hi>gradual,</hi> as our <hi>Sanctification</hi> is; in which <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> a noted Quaker, agrees with them.</p>
               <p>But ſuch an Opinion ſeems to me very diſagreable to the Doctrine of Proteſtant and reformed Churches, who generally hold that tho' our <hi>Sanctification be gradual,</hi> yet our <hi>Juſtification is perfect at once.</hi> If any think there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things beſides that which I have mentioned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Difference betwixt common and ſaving Grace appeareth, I am content that ſuch as pleaſe ſhould enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate them; but I think that which I have named is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſhew their Difference: And I do not know but that ſuch other Things as may be named, may be compriſed in that which I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, having, according to the beſt of my Abilities, anſwered your Queſtion, I crave your Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my Endeavours to ſerve you. I hope I have ſufficiently proved that there is a real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt common and ſaving Grace, in Reſpect of their Nature, and not in their Degree only. And had I not thought that this was neceſſary to be underſtood and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, I ſhould not have been ſo willing to preſent you

with this Eſſay of mine. I cannot but think that the Doctrine of <hi>original Sin,</hi> and that of <hi>ſpecial Grace in the Converſion of</hi> Sinners, have much Countenance given to them by the Truth I here maintain. That great Truth maintained by our Lord, Joh. 3.6. namely — <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> is, I think, hereby explained and vindicated. I wiſh you and my other Friends, that ſee and read theſe Lines, may thro' the Grace of God, receive ſome Advantage by them; which will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Pains of,</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>IT is by ſome objected againſt that which I have in this Letter pleaded for; that ſince it cannot be true, that Mankind have by their Fail, ſuffered any Alteration in the <hi>Nature or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Powers of their Souls,</hi> it is not poſſible that they ſhould have loſt that Power to know, love and ſerve God, which all allow they were in their firſt Creation endowed with. But, as yet, I ſee no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon to oblige me to grant the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of what is here ſuppoſed to be true. For I know not why we may not conceive, as many have done, that Man's Power before his Fall, to know, love and ſerve God, in ſuch a Manner as has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, was not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of his Soul, tho' concreated with it. And ſince it appears plainly to have been loſt by the Fall, this ſeems to make it very evident, that it was not of it's Eſſence, but ſomething <hi>ſuperadded to it, as an Ornament</hi> and Priviledge of it. On this Suppoſition, the <hi>Image of God</hi> in which Man was created, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27.) did not conſiſt <hi>wholly in his Nature, or Eſſence,</hi> but <hi>partly</hi> in <hi>ſuperadded Powers</hi> to enable him to perform the Duties which God required of him, and which were neceſſary unto that End. Which Powers are, I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006008_0025_1026E11848D56210"/>
implied in that <hi>Integrity</hi> or <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> in which Man was made, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. Now if this may be granted, Man may well be ſuppoſed to have loſt and forfeited theſe Powers by his Apoſtacy from God, and Rebellion againſt him. It much favours this Hopotheſis, that the Image of God which Man is ſuppoſed to have loſt in his Fall, appears plainly to be <hi>reſtored in his Regeneration. Eph.</hi>

            <p>Thus alſo it ſeems evident that as Man, ſo alſo the <hi>Angels that ſinned,</hi> loſt by their Fall, their Power to live unto God, and ſerve him, in ſuch a Manner as by the Law of their Creation they were obliged to do: And yet I think they are not ſuppoſed to have loſt any Thing of their <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>properly eſſential</hi> to them; but their Holineſs, or the Rectitude of their Natures only, conſiſting in thoſe good Qualities with which they were, in their Creation endowed. As to Men, their <hi>carnal Minds are Death,</hi> Rom 8.7. even the <hi>ſame threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Caſe of Sin,</hi> Gen. 2.16, 17.
