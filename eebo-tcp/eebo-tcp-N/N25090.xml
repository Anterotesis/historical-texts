            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The following Hymn was compoſed by John Young, to be ſung at the place of Execution.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>To thee my God I daily ſigh, but not for golden ſtores</l>
               <l>Nor covet I the brighteſt Gems on the rich Eaſtern ſhore,</l>
               <l>Nor Pleaſures ſoft enticing charms, my fond deſires alure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>2. For greater things than earth can yield, my wiſhes would ſecure,</l>
               <l>Thoſe bliſsful, Theſe Tranſporting Smiles, that brighten heaven above,</l>
               <l>The boundleſs riches of thy grace, &amp; treaſures of thy love</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>3. O let our tongues be one to praiſe our God on High,</l>
               <l>Who from his boſom ſent his Son, to fetch us ſtrangers nigh</l>
               <l>O my Saviour's pierc'd ſide pour'd out a double Flood,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>4. By water we are Purified, and Pardoned by the blood</l>
               <l>It coſt him cries, and many tears, to bring us near to God</l>
               <l>Great was our Debt, and it appears to make our payment good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>5. What tho' the Hoſts of death and hell all armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me ſtood,</l>
               <l>Terrors no more ſhall ſhake my ſoul, my refuge is my God,</l>
               <l>Ariſe O Lord, fulfil thy Grace, while I thy Glory ſing,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>6. My God has broke the Serpents teeth, and Death has loſt his ſting,</l>
               <l>Salvation to the lord belongs, his arm alone can ſave,</l>
               <l>Bleſſing attend thy people here, and reach beyond the grave.</l>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE World uſually anticipate from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate man in a ſituation like mine, a dying confeſſion; not ſo much to comply with this cuſtom as to remove the odium that now does, and after my deceaſe may exiſt in the minds of many, if I paſs hence into eternity, "from whoſe bourne no traveller returns," without ſuch a narrative, has induced me to pen the following lines. To vouch for the truth of them I preſume nothing need be ſaid more, than that they are the laſt words of a dying man, who looks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the pleaſing hope of ſalvation and comfort in regions of bliſs far beyond what this tranſitory life can afford.</p>
            <p>I die, ſo do all mankind, but I die untimely, mine is an unhappy end It needs not then that I ſpeak of my parents and relations, who or what they are, is of little moment to the Public, thus ſilent, they will avoid the taunts of unfeeling men I ſhall therefore touch not on the tranſactions of my life at an early period, but confine myſelf to thoſe leading points, that have precipitated me in the vortex of ignominious diſſolution.</p>
            <p>In 1793 I was in a reſpected ſituation at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia as a publiſher of Muſic, carreſſed by men of Virtue and Influence, as I had no capital I was neceſſitated to attempt to extend the Sale of my Merchandize by Subſcription over the whole Continent, with this view I proceeded to Charleſton, from thence to New-York, took up
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033255_0003_0FF769B99D9987A8"/>
my Lodgings at Mrs. Weiſenfelt's, finding my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to proſecute my plan on an extenſive Scale, and being much preſſed for Money I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with Mr. Ricketts as a Muſician, about this time I became acquainted with a Mr. Daniel Thew, Notary Public of this City, from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent advantages that might ariſe by the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Muſic, he made me propoſals to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a capital provided he received his part of the Profit, we agreed, the Sum was to be 3 col. at his requeſt I went to Boſton to obtain Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he advanced for the expence of my Journey 95 Dollars. On my arrival, and afterwards I wrote him ſeveral Letters, but receiving no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I ſuſpected his intentions were to deceive me, in conſequence of which I returned to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York, on my arrival at my lodgings I found the the whole of my Apparel gone as well as upwards of 100 ſcratched Songs, I could gain no further information on the ſubject, more than that Mr. Thew as my partner had taken poſſeſſion my room and removed every thing in a few days after my departure for Boſton; in a ſhort time I was ſerved with a writ at the ſuit of this very Thew, for the monies advanced for my Journey from Boſton and about 30 dollars in addition, which he had paid on my account; deſtitute as I was, I must have gone to Gaol, had not that worthy man Mr. Abraham Skinner by his humanity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, a ſucceſſion of diſappointments invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me in difficulties, my Creditors became cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, I was again arreſted in the Bear Market by one who called himſelf a deputy Sheriff,<note n="*" place="bottom">Handay ſide.</note> and was dragged near a mile, when lo! I diſcovered he had no writ, but was privy to Mr. Canon's
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033255_0004_0FF769BB20661528"/>
having one againſt me, to whoſe cuſtody I was turned over, Thus it is Debtors are abuſed, thus it is, in a State who boaſt their protection of the ſubject and their deteſtation of deſpotic ſway, permit their adminiſtrators of Juſtice to twiſt an arbitary conſtruction of the Laws, to countenance theſe hirelings to diſtreſs the honeſt tho' unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Citizens it requires more than mortal forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to reſiſt puniſhing ſuch mortals, who regard more extortion, than the adminiſtration of Juſtice</p>
            <p>I was conducted to Goal previous to this, and after my connection with Thew, I entered into partnerſhip with one Iſaac Samo, to whoſe baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I attribute Berwick's and my death. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced me 50 dollars, and afterwards 60 more, in part of his contract with me of 150 dollars, the ſum agreed on. Soon after the commence-of the publication, I was arreſted as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Samo refuſed to bail me; he pretended the buſineſs would be at a ſtand, and he ſhould looſe his money. Though it appeared plain to me afterwards, his only intention was to get all the materials in his own hands, and gather from me as much information as poſſible, relative to the buſineſs, with the view of commencing by himſelf, and leaving me in my misfortunes.</p>
            <p>I continued in confinement near four months, when I was relieved by a new contract with Mr. Ricketts; ſome time after my diſcharge I received a note from a Mr. CONSTANT an Attorney, requeſting to ſee me. I called on him, he infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me he had an account againſt me at the ſuit of Mrs. Miller, with whom I formerly boarded, I was aſtoniſhed, as I did not conceive I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to her any thing; ſhe had at various
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033255_0005_0FF769BF4C9FCBD8"/>
times received money from me to the amount of Eighty-three dollars, and had departed for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam; I refuſing payment he ſerved a writ on me, for which I gave bail, my aſtoniſhment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ceaſed when I was informed by a Mr. Crawford, wholeſale Grocer at the Ship-Yards, that this VERY HONEST LAWYER CONSTANT, had purchaſed for Ten Dollars this imaginary debt of Mrs Miller; ſhame, ſhame on ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, practices that diſgrace the name of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, which every honeſt mind muſt revolt at, and which I am ſorry too ſay, is too much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by thoſe whoſe duty as well as inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould teach to puniſh more than encourage ſuch infamy.</p>
            <p>From this period I was continually harraſſed with writ after writ till my life became miſerable, at this time Samo called on me, propoſed as there was little proſpect of continuing the buſineſs, I ſhould give him my notes for the money advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and he would wholly relinquiſh what he had of mine, I complied; gave them at 60, 90, and 120 days. I repeatedly ſent for the articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to me but without effect, but ſeemed to intimate he ſhould hold them as ſecurity for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Notes, this was an act of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injuſtice which he beſt knows how to reconcile being compelled ſecrete myſelf fearful of arreſt, I neglected to give ſpeciel bail to Conſtants ſuit, he obtained executiion againſt me, I was taken to Goal and remained in confinement thirteen weeks, when I was diſcharged by pledging an Inſtrument and my Note for 85 dollars, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim Samo's notes became due, he preſſed me for the payment after my diſcharge though he ſtill
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033255_0006_0FF769A4544CF9C8"/>
held my property the only means I had of raiſing the money for his payment, we had frequent converſation on this ſubject but could not effect any ſettlement.</p>
            <p>At laſt on my return from Col. Burr's where I had been with muſic to Mrs. Temple, when ſcarcely in the houſe ten minutes Berwick called on me ſaid he had ſomething againſt me at the ſuit of Samo; I requeſted him to go with me to Samo's houſe about 30 yards diſtant, on my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val I ſolicited a ſettlement, Samo obſerved he had nothing to do in the buſineſs, my ſtay was not more than three minutes we then walked away, this was at the top of Cedar ſtreet, we never went into any place nor ſpoke to any one till I ſtop'd at the bottom of the Park. I never ſaw the writ, nor any thing he had againſt me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to go with me to ſome other place he poſitively ſaid no; diſtreſ'd in mind, harraſ'd with my cares, and the dread of again being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined operated at this moment to determine me not to go to Gaol, I put my hand in pocket drew out a Piſtol and at the ſame Time deſired him repeatly aloud to keep his diſtance, he raſhly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed my advice, ruſhed on the mouth of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, I fired without any direction other than a pointed arm, he fell—Let any man Judge what time it will take for two perſons to walk a ſmart pace from the top of Cedar ſtreet to the bottom of the Park, which was all the time he was with me except when at Samo's, they then can form an opinion what credit ought to be given to thoſe who ſwore Berwick and I were together three hours previous to his death; as for the writ, I call God to witneſs I never ſaw it till the morning of my trial before the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033255_0007_0FF769C682CCCC00"/>
I pity from my Soul thoſe three unfortunate perjured people who ſwore againſt me. I pray God to have mercy on them.</p>
            <p>The one that ſwore he heard Berwick ſay he was tired going about from place to place with me for three hours and that he would go no further.</p>
            <p>The poor wretch that ſwore we walked arm and arm together and that I declared he had taken many perſons but ſhould never take another when I ſhot him; they are both falſe. The day of puniſhment will come when their perjured conſciences will riſe up in judgment againſt them.</p>
            <p>And the Mulatto who ſwore ſhe was ſo near us, that the ſmoke went in her face, and yet did not hear a word that paſs'd between Berwick and myſelf; ſhe certainly muſt have been between us, otherwiſe it could not have gone in her face, as I ſaw it riſe direct between Berwick and me.</p>
            <p>I forgive them all, as well as my enemies who have delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe people, and pray God to forgive them, as I hope he will forgive me. God Almighty bleſs my friends and all good people.</p>
            <p>To authenticate the above writings, Mr. Abraham Skinner has the writings between Thew and me, Mr. Hunn, the agreement between Samo and myſelf, or on Mr. Watſon, now in Priſon, who is in poſſeſſion of the laſt writing between Iſaac Samo and me, executed at the time I gave my note, though he afterwards refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his own ſignature; he has likewiſe an account in Mrs. Millar's hand writing of what was due her, which CONSTANT gave me ſo much trouble about.</p>
