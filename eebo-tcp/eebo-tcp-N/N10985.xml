            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CRISIS. NUMBER II.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Bloody Court, A Bloody Miniſtry, AND A Bloody Parliament.</head>
            <p>THE ſudden and unexpected diſſolution of the laſt ruinous Parliament gave a juſt and general alarm to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we may ſearch in vain the voluminous pages of Grecian, Roman, or Engliſh hiſtory, to find ſuch another plan of premeditated villany for deſtroying, at one grand ſtroke of royal and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial policy, all the rights of a free people. Lord North, engendered in the womb of hell, raiſed by the foſtering hand of infernal ſpirits, and poſſeſſing principles that have eclipſed all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his ſatanic parents, had the effrontery to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in the face of the Houſe of Commons and the world, but a few days before the receſs of the late Parliament, that they ſhould meet again early in October for the deſpatch of buſineſs. When he uttered this falſehood, it was ſuſpected by many, and he well knew it had been determined, that they ſhould be diſſolved, although the preciſe time was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013908_0002_0F9257C6F95A05A8"/>not fixed. On the 16th day of September, 1774, a notice was publiſhed in the Gazette for the laſt Parliament to meet on the 15th of November; eleven days had not elapſed before a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared for its diſſolution, and the calling a new Parliament. Who can guard againſt decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, artifice and villany, when ſtamped with royal authority? The very thought of an honeſt Houſe of Commons ſtruck terror into the guilty ſoul of Lord North, the diabolical minion of royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and inſtrument of royal vengeance; nay, even the King (virtuous as he is) had his fears; and in order to ſecure their own creatures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, or, in other words, to have the old Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament new revived, and ſmuggle a majority of venal abandoned miſcreants (who would deny their God, or ſell their ſouls for money) into the preſent Houſe of Commons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ord North ſent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all his friends that they might be prepared, and it was known in the moſt diſtant parts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and even the time of the election fixed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral boroughs in Cornwall ſome days before the Parliament was diſſolved. This is a truth which Lord North, with all his conſummate impudence, cannot deny.</p>
            <p>The miniſterial hacks were immediately ſet to work to fabricate lies (and publiſh them in the news papers) to delude and deceive the electors; that little or no oppoſition might be made to the tools of government. One report ſaid the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliament was owing to ſome diſagreeable advices from America, and that our virtuous King, with his ſtill more virtuous miniſters, intended to adopt ſome conciliating meaſures with reſpect to the colonies, and that it would betray a weakneſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013908_0003_0F9257C8941A7048"/>in the King to let the ſame Parliament meet again, to repeal thoſe acts which they had but a few months before paſſed. Another report, equally true, aſſerted it was on account of intelligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the north of a very alarming nature; and a third, that it was occaſioned by a difference between the French and Engliſh miniſtry, which rendered ſuch a ſtep neceſſary, as there was great reaſon to believe we ſhould ſoon be involved in a war, and that it would be exceedingly improper to have the nation put in a ferment, by a general elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at ſo critical a time as that, and when the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Parliament would be particularly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A fourth report was, that Lord Chatham and his friends would be immediately taken into favour, and that there was to be an entire change in the miniſtry. By theſe low artifices and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial lies, the people of England were lulled into a ſtate of ſupineneſs, and even made to lend a helping hand to complete their own ruin.</p>
            <p>The ſubſequent part of this paper ſhall unravel the diabolical ſcheme. Lord North ſaw a powerful oppoſition forming in every part of England; he was fearful of aſſociations; he dreaded a ſolemn league and covenant, which he was certain the people would have entered into for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their rights and liberties before next May, the time when the Parliament would have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of courſe; he trembled for the event; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his own villany, and that his head had been long forfeited to the juſtice of his country, he determined to take the electors by ſurpriſe, to put them off their guard, and rob them of time; that no oppoſition might be made to his creatures, and the people be prevented from fixing upon men
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013908_0004_0F9257C906EC6A48"/>of honeſt independent principles, to whom they might with ſafety delegate the important, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred truſt of repreſentation.</p>
            <p>Lord North communicated his fears to the King, painted the daring rebellious ſpirit of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and told him, that the people here were as diſloyal and diſaffected, and that hints had been thrown out in the public prints, of plans forming in different parts of England, for keeping out of the new Parliament moſt of his friends; and unleſs prevented, by ſome well concerted ſcheme, there was but too much reaſon to believe, from the ſpirit of the people, that they would ſucceed; an event, ſays this traitor, much feared and greatly dreaded by every well wiſher to your perſon and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Should it ever take place, as there is a country party, or a majority of mock patriots in the Houſe of Commons, who are enemies to all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government, you muſt be reduced to a moſt degrading ſituation indeed; your preſent friends will then be unable to give you any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and inſtead of the power being in your hands, it will then be in the hands of the people; and you will be under the diſgraceful neceſſity of giving your aſſent to the repeal of every act which has been lately paſſed for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, and enforcing a due obedience to your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: In ſhort, you will be a King without power, and ſubject to the controul of a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues for liberty, the dregs of mankind, and a common rabble, who will always ſupport them; nay, it may even endanger the ſecurity of your throne, for what will not a hot headed Parliament do, with whom the voice of the people can have any weight? The plan for reducing the Americans,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013908_0005_0F9257C9C00130B0"/>and making them dependent on your will, muſt be cruſhed; they will triumph in the victory obtained over the juſt power of Parliament and your prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; your faithful ſervants will be compelled to leave you, and you will be without a real friend to adviſe with. If your Majeſty can get a majority of your friends rechoſen in the new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, you will be able to raiſe what money you pleaſe with their aſſiſtance; you will then be able to keep your preſent Miniſters, and preſerve them from the reſentment (which has been incurred by ſerving of you) of an enraged rabble, who are made to believe, through the licentiouſneſs of the preſs, that they labour under a load of accumulated grievances; you will then be able to trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, faction, ſedition, and rebellion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your dominions, and to carry every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, agreeable to your royal pleaſure; with the power of Parliament, and your Majeſty's firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſeverance, you may bring England and America into a proper ſtate of ſubjection to your will. To accompliſh this it will be neceſſary to prorogue the Parliament to ſome future day, then to meet, and immediately after call a council and diſſolve them; in the mean time your friends may be made acquainted with this determination, and be prepared for the election before any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition can poſſibly be made, or the people know any thing of the matter.</p>
            <p>The King, firmly reſolved on the people's ruin, careſſed his villanous minion, admired the plan formed for our deſtruction; and, drunk with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, ſucked in the baneful advice and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it.</p>
            <p>Thus the preſent Parliament was ſmuggled, and thus, in a moſt ſhameful, unprecedented, artful, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013908_0006_0F9257CA8D13E680"/>ſudden manner, was the laſt Houſe of Commons diſſolved by the King, to anſwer his own and his miniſter's wicked, tyrannical, and bloody deſigns againſt the people and conſtitution of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Such an inſtance, of an infamous exertion of the royal prerogative, and under the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is not to be found in the hiſtory of England; ſuch an injury and inſult was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered to a free people, and never ought to be forgiven. It was a piece of Hanoverian trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, baſeneſs, and ingratitude, which has far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all the artful villany and low cunning of the diſcarded Stuarts. His Majeſty (heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect ſo much goodneſs) out of a tenderneſs to the conſtitution, could not make ſo bad a uſe of his prerogative, five years back, as to diſſolve the ſame Parliament, when their iniquitous proceedings, and their violations of juſtice, had rouſed the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, and he was requeſted to do it by upwards of eighty thouſand freeholders (ſigned) and the general voice of the whole nation; but in 1774 he got the better of that tenderneſs, and, to anſwer his own purpoſes, could exert the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative (which he had abſolutely refuſed to his ſubjects, in the haughty terms of a deſpot) with no other view, but to overturn the conſtitution of the Britiſh empire in England and America, and deſtroy or enſlave the people.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, his minions, and inſtruments of ſlaughter, are now ſafe in robbing the people of their property, by ſhameful and iniquitous taxes in time of peace; ſafe in their ſubverſion of the Proteſtant religion; ſafe and ſucceſsful in their cruel plan for ſtarving the honeſt and induſtrious inhabitants, and deſtroying the trade of the town
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013908_0007_0F9257CB4B397190"/>of Boſton in America, and the commerce of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; ſafe ſo far in their attempt to deſtroy the lives, rights, liberties, and privileges of millions; I ſay they are ſafe, in all theſe violations of, and depredations on, our national ſecurity, and natural rights, becauſe we are tame.</p>
