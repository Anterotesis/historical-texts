            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS Chapter begins with a Prophecy of Times of Diſtreſs and Sorrow coming on <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> named here <hi>Ariel,</hi> which ſignify's <hi>the Lion of God.</hi> It might be ſo called, either becauſe it was a great and ſtrong City, thought to be impregnable; or becauſe it was the Royal City, where King <hi>David</hi> had his Throne, who was a ſignal Type and Anceſtor of the holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> or becauſe it was the City GOD had choſen for his own Habitation, and fortify'd by his Preſence; or becauſe there was the <hi>Altar of God</hi> for <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> (ſometimes called <hi>Ariel</hi>) which was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007665_0003_102DBA86DE79F0E0"/>
Symbol of the Divine Preſence, the chief Strength and Glory of the City, and which as a <hi>Lion</hi> devoured the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered thereon continually.—Yet, Iniquity being found in this Favourite-City of God, here's a WO denounced againſt it. The Inhabitants are aſſured by the Prophet, that notwithſtanding all their Temple-Privileges, on Account of which they ſeemed to have a <hi>Lion-like</hi> Fortitude and Confidence, they ſhould for their Sins be <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> and <hi>brought down</hi> wonderfully: and that all their Oblations and Devotions, whereby they thought to appeaſe an incenſed God, ſhould be vain, and not ſerve to ſecure them againſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which their abounding Iniquity deſerved. They might go on killing their Sacrifices, making many Prayers, and multiplying their publick Solemnities; yet none of theſe Things ſhould profit them at all, but a righteous and provoked God would ſtill purſue his Controverſy with them.</p>
            <p>Alas, we may flatter our ſelves, and deceive our Neighbours, with a Form of Godlineſs, and a fair Shew in the Fleſh; but the omniſcient Eye of Him with whom we have to do, can ſee thro' the thickeſt Maſk of Hypocriſy: and as He is not capable of being deluded, ſo neither will He bear to be mocked, with heartleſs Services, and meer external For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities in Religion. The moſt ſplendid and abundant Oblations, excluſive of a <hi>broken Heart</hi> and a <hi>contrite Spirit,</hi> which are the <hi>Sacrifices of God,</hi> will never pleaſe Him; much leſs avail to appeaſe his offended Juſtice, and atone for our Sins. But notwithſtanding all ſuch Attempts to ſtay the Current of Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God's Hand will be ſtretched out ſtill; nor will He turn away his Anger from us, while our Hearts remain unhumbled, and our Sins unrepented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:007665_0004_102DBA8B1D368FB8"/>
The Prophet here lets the People of <hi>Ariel</hi> know, that however they might <hi>add Year to Year,</hi> proceed to keep their annual Faſts, &amp; from time to time abound in their expiatory <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> ſtated and occaſional; yet, ſeeing they were a People impenitent and unreformed, a holy God would maintain his Controverſy with them, and teſtify his juſt Diſpleaſure in a Succeſſion of waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtreſſing Judgments; againſt which all their Helpers ſhould afford them no Protection: but in Caſe of final Obſtinacy, their Deſtruction ſhould be ſure and inevitable; and their Deſolation ſhould come <hi>in an Inſtant ſuddenly,</hi> when they were not aware, by Means unthought of, ſubject only to the Direction of Divine Providence, and uncontroulable by all the Power of Mortals.—<hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and great Noiſe, with Storm and Tempeſt, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some underſtand the Prophet as ſpeaking <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi> uſing this Variety &amp; Pomp of Words only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the very miſerable State the People of <hi>Ariel</hi> would be reduced to, by the numerous and great Calamities haſtning upon them.—But whether we are to take theſe Expreſſions in a <hi>figurative,</hi> or in a <hi>literal</hi> Senſe, I ſhall not now ſtand to diſpute. Doubtleſs both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions may be ſafely admitted. Yet I chuſe at preſent to follow the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Text, as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Expoſitors view it in that Light, and as the Deſign of this Diſcourſe principally is to lead you into ſome devout Reflections, ſuitable to the late tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Diſpenſations of Providence, which are the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Occaſion of the Appointment of this Day of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Humiliation and Prayer; I mean, thoſe great and terrible <hi>Earthquakes in divers Places,</hi> whereby ſome noted Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> have been deſtroyed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we in <hi>America</hi> have been alarmed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007665_0005_102DBA8C9F056FD0"/>
I might profitably employ ſome Meditations on the other Articles enumerated in the Divine Threatning before us; which are of Importance enough to claim our Attention. But for the ſake of Brevity, as well as Pertinence, I have ſingled out <hi>That,</hi> ſome Inſtances of which gave Riſe to this Day's Solemnity, for the particular Subject of the preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts,—with Earthquake and great Noiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to theſe Words, I propoſe to purſue the following Method. Firſt, I ſhall take Notice of the <hi>Character,</hi> by which the Divine Majeſty is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi>—Then ſpeak of his <hi>viſiting</hi> his People.—And of his doing this particularly by <hi>Earthquake and great Noiſe.</hi>—Finally, apply the Subject, in ſome ſeaſonable Reflections and Exhortations, as the Time will allow.</p>
            <p>I. I am to ſay ſomething upon the exalted <hi>Character,</hi> under which GOD is here ſpoken of; <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet now ſpeaking in the <hi>Name</hi> of God, and delivering a Divine Meſſage and Menace to his People, he fitly inſerts this Divine <hi>Character,</hi> to give the greater Weight and Importance to his Words, by pointing out the <hi>irreſiſtible Author</hi> of the Judgments denounced in that awful Threatning, which the Prophet was only the Meſſenger to bring unto them. He might have contented himſelf with barely ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited</hi> with this and the other Judgment: but it gives an additional Force and Emphaſis to his Words, there's a ſacred Energy, a peculiar Dignity, Majeſty and Solemnity in the Language, when he ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi> His naming the Divine Being, under this auguſt Character, tended to ſtrike an Awe upon the threatned People, to draw Attention to the Prophecy, and indeed to perſuade to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007665_0006_102DBA8E21CB0810"/>
the Belief of it. For the inſerting of GOD's Name in this terrible Commination, was an implicitly pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD's Veracity for the Truth of it: and the Mention of Him under ſo grand a Character, carry'd in it a further Motive of Credibility, reſpecting the Certainty of the Event; ſince there can be no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power, nor flying from the Preſence, of Him who is <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi>—It is obſervable, the Judgments, ſpecify'd in this Denunciation, are ſuch as carry with them very legible Signatures of <hi>the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD.</hi> Natural Reaſon apprehends an inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble almighty Agent very eminently &amp; more immediately operating in them. <hi>Thunder,</hi> &amp; <hi>Earthquake,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Flame of devouring Fire</hi> (eſpecially if this be underſtood of the Lightning from Heaven, or the ſcorching Beams of the Sun, or the Eruption of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Fire) theſe are ſuch Events as evidently claim the great GOD for their prime Efficient, and exclude all human Agency. When therefore the Prophet was denouncing a WO to <hi>Ariel,</hi> which it was GOD's ſole Prerogative to execute, there muſt be allowed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Fitneſs in the Thing, that he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly mention GOD's Name in the Denunciation, and that he ſhould mention Him under this ſublime and ſtriking Character, "the LORD of Hoſts."</p>
            <p>It is a Divine Appellation frequently occurring in Scripture, "The GOD of Hoſts." (In the Hebrew, ſometimes ELOHI, ſometimes ADONAI, <hi>Tſebaòth.</hi>) But here, and in ſome other Places; it is (JEHOVAH <hi>Tſebaòth</hi>) "the LORD of Hoſts."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the appropriate Style of the ſupreme Being; "the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,—"which <hi>Three</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> the only "living and true God. And it imports his neceſſary Exiſtence, and Self-exiſtence, his Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and All-ſufficiency, his Conſtancy and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007665_0007_102DBA911C885DF8"/>
It intends much the ſame with that Title or Name, under which he revealed himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> I AM<note n="*" place="bottom">Some judge, we have a Name of our Saviour equivalent to this in the Greek Teſtament. One obſerves, "That <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Ο'ΩΝ, &amp;c. may be rendered, <hi>The</hi> I AM, God over all,—by way of Appoſition.</note> (and, I AM THAT I AM) or that to <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation, "I am Alpha and Omega, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the Ending, (the Firſt and the Laſt,) which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." One who is Being it ſelf, and has all Fulneſs of Being in Himſelf; a Being inderivative, independent, infinite, eternal, unchangeable, in his Nature and Perfections.—"His Name alone is JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH." This Name, tho' common to the ſeveral Perſons in the ſacred Trinity, who all have the ſame common Eſſence, yet is not attributed to any other Being in the Univerſe. It is generally tranſlated by the Septuagint, ΚΥΡΙΟΣ, which, Criticks obſerve, comes from ,ΚΥΡΩ, that ſignify's, "I am."—The Word, JEHOVAH, is judged to be properly of abſolute Signification; not in its primary Senſe a Word of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, not a meer Title of Office, or Authority; but (as much as <hi>Man</hi> is) a Title of Nature, or Eſſence: and commonly ſo uſed.</p>
            <p>But here it ſeems to have a relative Application: JEHOVAH <hi>Tſebaòth,</hi> tranſlated "The LORD of Hoſts. The Name, uſed in this Conjunction, ſpeaks God's ſupreme Excellency and univerſal Dominion. He is "JEHOVAH of Hoſts," or (in the Language of the New-Teſtament) "LORD of all,—"GOD, over all, bleſſed for evermore." It teaches us his excellent Greatneſs. "His Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven."—And it teaches us his extenſive Power and Rule.

            <p>This Word, <hi>Tſebaòth,</hi> is retained in the Greek Teſtament, though according to the Idiom of that Tongue, it is read <hi>Sabaòth.</hi> Nor have the Authors of our Engliſh Verſion ſeen fit to tranſlate it; but give us the original Word in ſeveral Places. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 29. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 4.) In that Paſſage quoted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> from the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> what in the Hebrew is JEHOVAH <hi>Tſebaòth,</hi> is in the Greek <hi>Kurios Sabaòth;</hi> which, turned into Engliſh, is "The LORD of Hoſts." It may ſerve to correct a vulgar Miſtake, if I obſerve that ſome of the Unlearned very corruptly read it <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and miſs-underſtand the Places where they meet with it, as if "the Lord of <hi>Sabaòth,</hi>" and "the Lord of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>" were one and the ſame Title: whereas they are two Titles, of very different Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—Several of the Fathers miſtook <hi>Sabaòth</hi> for one of the Names of GOD: they ſeem to have conſtrued it as put in Appoſition with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>Lord.</hi> But were it a Name of God, we ſhould doubtleſs have found it ſometimes uſed alone by it ſelf, as his other Names frequently are: Whereas, this Word is never ſo apply'd to Him, but always in expreſs Conjunction with ſome one or other of his known Titles. And indeed Expoſitors, well underſtanding the Hebrew, in which Language the Word properly ſignifies "Hoſts," or Bands of Soldiers, have uſually tranſlated it, whether into Greek, or Latin, or other Tongue, by ſome Word of that Import. Tho' ſometimes, when mentioned in Relation to GOD, they have given it a lax Conſtruction, and render'd it by the Word "Omnipotent," or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The Septuagint-Verſion retains the Letter of the Original in our Text: but in ſeveral other Places it uſes a Liberty, and turns the ſame Phraſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007665_0009_102DBA96D0F500E0"/>
in this free Manner (ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΠΑΝΤΟΚΡΑΤΩΡ) the "LORD Omnipotent."—Not that the <hi>Seventy</hi> took the Hebrew Word, TSEBAÒTH, properly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Name or Attribute of God: but they choſe a free Tranſlation of it ſometimes; and that not unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiably, ſince He who is called "the LORD of Hoſts," indefinitely, and ſo "the LORD of All," muſt needs "be the Lord omnipotent," or "God almighty."—At other Times they render it, ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΤΩΝ ΔΥΝΑΜΕΩΝ, <hi>Dominus Virtutum,</hi> "the LORD of the Powers:" meaning either his being poſſeſſed of every Power (or Perfection) in himſelf, and ſo it ſpeaks the ſuperlative Excellency of his Nature; or his governing all created Powers, and ſo ſpeaks the Supremacy of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:—which, in the Reſult, come much to the ſame Thing. So that it is well expreſſed in our Engliſh Tranſlation, "The LORD of Hoſts." This is the Name by which He is known, in Oppoſition to falſe Gods, and to Gods metaphorically ſo called. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.27. "The LORD, whoſe Name is the GOD of Hoſts." "Even the LORD GOD of Hoſts, the LORD is his Memorial." <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.—5. By this "we know, that the Lord is great, and that our LORD is above all Gods."</p>
            <p>This deſcriptive Appellation ſpeaks the bleſſed GOD ſupreme Monarch of the Univerſe, infinitely ſuperiour to all ſecond Cauſes, tranſcendent in Dignity and Majeſty to all other Beings; having all Agents whatever, in univerſal Nature, under his reſiſtleſs Government, and at his abſolute Diſpoſal. It ſeems to carry in it an Alluſion to ſome powerful Captain-General, having vaſt Armies under his Command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubject to his Will, and diſpoſed, ordered, and managed as he pleaſeth. GOD is truly the ſovereign and univerſal Commander, having all Things in Subjection to Him, and all Events under his Conduct &amp; Controul, All Creatures, in all Worlds, "in the Heights above,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007665_0010_102DBA98824E4178"/>
and in the Depths below," belong to GOD's Hoſts; and are, in their various Degrees and Ways, ſubſervient to his Glory, as well as governed by his Providence.</p>
            <p>For inſtance,</p>
            <p>There is "the Hoſt of <hi>Heaven,</hi>" which we often read of in Scripture: and if by Heaven we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the World of Spirits, the upper and the inviſible eternal World, called "the holy Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens," then by the Hoſt of Heaven are meant eſpecially the <hi>Angels</hi> of God, "the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers in heavenly Places." We are told of "the Armies of Heaven," among whom the great GOD doeth whatſoever He pleaſeth: and of a "Multitude of the heavenly Hoſt, praiſing GOD," at the Birth of the holy Child JESUS: which means "an innumerable Company of Angels."—We read (1 Kin. 22. 19.) <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſaid to the King of Iſrael, "I ſaw the LORD ſitting on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of Heaven ſtanding by Him." Theſe mean "the Angels of Heaven," who are "miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits," ever waiting on the moſt High, attending his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and fulfilling his Will. Hence that of the royal Prophet (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 20, 21.) "Bleſs the LORD, ye his Angels, that excel in Strength, that do his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. Bleſs ye the LORD, all ye his Hoſts; ye Miniſters of his, that do his Pleaſure."—Theſe are they whom the LORD ſpake of, when he anſwered <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, ſaying, "The Morning-Stars ſang together; and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy," at his laying the Foundations of the Earth.—And of "the Angels of Light" eſpecially we are to underſtand that in the <hi>Levites</hi> Prayer (<hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 6.) "Thou, even thou art LORD alone; thou haſt made Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens, with all their Hoſt:—and the Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſhippeth Thee."—Though, it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007665_0011_102DBA9AEA8AD6B0"/>
excluſively of "the Spirits of juſt <hi>Men,</hi>" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into Glory. For theſe alſo belong to "the heavenly Hoſt, and are continually "worſhipping Him that liveth for ever and ever." Theſe are a Multitude, that no Man can number." And all are ſtill in Subjection to "the Father of Spirits," he Rector of human Souls, and Lord of Angels. Both Species may be comprehended in <hi>Enoch'</hi>s Prophecy: "Behold, the LORD cometh with ten Thouſands of his Saints, to execute Judgment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if by Heaven we underſtand the lower Heaven, the viſible Region of the Skie, "the Firmament of his Power," then by the Hoſt of Heaven are meant more immediately the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi> Theſe ſeem eſpecially intended where we read of Men's "worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Hoſt of Heaven," an Idolatry of ancient Date, and of univerſal Practice in the heathen World. Hence that Caution to the Iſraelites, who having the Example ſo near them, were in Danger of getting a Snare to their Soul, by learning the Way of the World: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15, &amp;c. <q>Take ye good Heed unto your ſelves, leſt ye corrupt your ſelves, and make you a graven Image,—and leſt thou lift up thine Eyes unto Heaven, and when thou ſeeſt the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Hoſt of Heaven, ſhouldſt be driven to worſhip them.</q>—The celeſtial Bodies are in the Number of JEHOVAH's Hoſts; not to be worſhipped, but to ſerve him, and to lead Men up to the Worſhip of Him, their Creator and Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <q>Praiſe ye the LORD. Praiſe ye the LORD from the Heavens: Praiſe Him in the Heights.—Praiſe ye him, all his Hoſts. Praiſe ye him, Sun and Moon: Praiſe him, all ye Stars of Light.—Let them praiſe the Name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.</q>—It was he, that "made great Lights, the Sun to rule
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007665_0012_102DBA9E77D44068"/>
by Day, and the Moon and Stars to rule by Night." He "by his Wiſdom ſtretched out the Heavens:" He "prepared the Light and the Sun; and the Moon and Stars hath He ordained."—He "appointeth the Moon for Seaſons:" and by his Conſtitution and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, "the Sun knoweth his going down. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth "the Day-ſpring to know his Place. "He telleth the Number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names.—"They continue this Day according to his Ordinances: for all are his Servants." He maintains them in their Being, Situation, Motion, Operation &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: and all, in their Place, do his Will. They mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Deſigns of Goodneſs, and of Juſtice, in his Government of the moral World, and contribute much to the Advancement of his Glory. They even "ſtand ſtill," at his bidding, and when it will ſerve his Ends. So, the "Sun ſtay'd in the midſt of Heaven, over <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,</hi> and the Moon over the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when the LORD fought for Iſrael, until the People had avenged themſelves on their Enemies." And we read in the Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> "They fought from Heaven, the Stars in their Courſes fought againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to deſcend now to the loweſt Territories of Heaven, the <hi>Meteors</hi> of the Air belong alſo to the Hoſt of GOD. "He createth the Wind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it out of his Treaſuries. "The Lord hath his Way in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Duſt of his Feet. "He cauſeth the Vapours to aſcend; He covereth the Heaven with Clouds, and they are turned about by his Counſel.—He prepareth the Dew &amp; Rain for the Earth, and "water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hills from his Chambers. He is the Father of the Rain, and ſendeth it where, and when, and in what Meaſure he pleaſeth. "He cauſeth it to come, whether for Correction, or in Mercy.—He alſo "thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007665_0013_102DBA9FF9C79C58"/>
with the Voice of his Excellency, and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Lightnings, like Arrows.—He produces and commands "the Treaſures of the Snow, and the Treaſures of the Hail; which he reſerveth againſt the Time of Trouble, againſt the Day of Battle and War.—"He ſcattereth the Hoar-froſt: He caſteth forth his Ice. Who can ſtand before his Cold?—The Cold is his; and ſo the Heat: they riſe to what Degree, and in what Place, he pleaſeth: According to his Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> they ceaſe not to this Day, and by them He ſmites whom He will, with their pinching or ſcorching Powers.—He "maketh Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer," and orders all the varying Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Events of both. "He ſendeth forth his Commandment," and they obey. He faith to one, Go; and it goeth: and to another, Come; and it cometh. "Fire, and Hail, Snow, and Vapour, and ſtormy Wind, all fulfil his Word.—And I may properly enough add here; The living Creatures in the Air, "the Fowls of the Heaven," theſe alſo are under his Rule, and execute his Will. They are to be reckoned among "the Armies of Heaven": and when "the Lord uttereth his Voice before this his Army, his Camp is very great," and he appears "ſtrong to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Word," whether by "Birds of Prey," or by "Swarms of Flies," ſuch as we read of among the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which God ſent "to the End they might know, that He is the LORD in the midſt of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe, GOD hath his <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Hoſt. The Earth hath its Hoſt, as well as the Heavens. Hence we read in <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Hiſtory of the Creation, "Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them." By the Earth here is to be underſtood the whole Terraqueous Globe, including both Sea and Land. Now, "the Sea is his; for he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007665_0014_102DBAA17B85DE88"/>
made it: and his Hands formed the dry Land.—"The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulneſs thereof; the World, and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the Floods.—"He created the Earth, and all Things that are therein; the Sea, and all that therein is: and he preſerveth them all." They are his Work, his Care, and apply'd to his Uſe, as he ſees fit, from Age to Age. "He doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in Heaven, and Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep Places.—"In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth; the Strength of the Hills is his alſo.—"He ruleth the raging of the Seas;" and raiſeth or ſtilleth the Waves thereof. "The Earth is full of his Riches, ſo is this great and wide Sea, wherein are Things creeping innumerable, both great and ſmall. There go the <hi>Ships:</hi> and there is that <hi>Leviathan,</hi> whom he hath made to play therein. Theſe all wait on him." The Ships that (richly laden) paſs thro' the Paths of the Ocean, and all the living Creatures, that inhabit the watry Element, are under his abſolute Government, Direction, and Controul. So are all the numberleſs Species of Animals, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Face of the Earth. The Beaſts of the Field, as well as Fiſhes of the Sea, and even the Worms of the Duſt, as well as Birds of the Air, ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of every Kind, which ſwarm in all Parts of the Univerſe, they univerſally belong to GOD's Armies, and he employs them to what Purpoſes he pleaſeth, in the Kingdom of Providence. Any of theſe appear to Men a formidable Hoſt, when God commiſſions and arms them to deſtroy. "The Adder in the Path, "the Boar out of the Wood, "the Bear by the Way, "the Lion in the Wilderneſs, &amp;c. are a Terror to Mankind; much more, Troops of them collected together. It is therefore remarked, as an aggravating Circumſtance of our Saviour's Temptation in the Wilderneſs, "He
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007665_0015_102DBAA301FAFD10"/>
was with the wild Beaſts."—But they are all in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the great LORD of the Univerſe. "The wild Beaſts of the Field (ſays he) are mine: every Beaſt of the Foreſt is mine, and the Cattle on a thouſand Hills.—"The Eyes of all wait upon him. "He giveth to the Beaſt his Food."—And therefore claims his Service. "Praiſe the LORD from the Earth, ye Dragons,—Beaſts, and all Cattle, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things, and flying Fowl.—"Let every Thing that hath Breath praiſe the LORD.—They are all among the Hoſts, of which GOD is the LORD. Having mentioned "Heaven and Earth," as the Sum of the Univerſe, he ſays (Iſai. 45. 12.) "ALL their Hoſt have I commanded.—Nor are we to overlook Things inanimate, the Trees of the Wood, the Herbs of the Field, the Minerals of the Ground, Treaſures hid in the Sand, &amp;c. theſe alſo are to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the LORD's Hoſts: and by them he executes his Pleaſure, whether in Judgment, or in Mercy.</p>
            <p>But among the numerous Hoſts in this inferiour Creation, <hi>Mankind</hi> bear a diſtinguiſhing Figure. And when God is ſtiled "the LORD of Hoſts," it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more immediately refers to the intellectual Part of the World, who are united in various Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Kingdoms, Provinces, Towns, Families, &amp;c. of all which GOD is the ſupream Head, Former, Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Ruler. "He created Man upon Earth.—"He hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the Face of the Earth. He deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth the Times fore-appointed, and the Bounds of their Habitation.—"He ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,—and is "the Governour among the Nations:"—preſiding over all Societies and Perſons; ruling the Spirits, as well as the Bodies of Men, and ordering all the Incidents of human Life.—If we ſpeak of publick Calamities, thoſe "three ſore Evils, Peſtilence, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007665_0016_102DBAA5CB504550"/>
and Sword," are the grand Artillery of Heaven, the Judgments of GOD's Hand, which he ſendeth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a ſinful People. In particular, the Sword is his: and he ſheaths or unſheaths it, as he pleaſes. He "muſtereth the Hoſt of the Battle," and ſucceeds, or defeats, at his Pleaſure. The Events of War are at his abſolute Diſpoſe. "The Victory is his," on whatever Side it turns. He is "the LORD of Hoſts,—"the GOD of Armies,—in the literal, military Senſe.—More eſpecially is he "the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,"</hi> LORD of the Church, the religious Aſſemblies of his People, which are ſometimes figuratively called his Hoſts. He only is the Object of Worſhip, and he has the ſole Right of Empire over his People in the Matters of Divine Worſhip. He is the ſole Lord of Conſcience; and he only has "Dominion over our Faith."—It is written, "Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.—"Worſhip him, all ye Gods.—Kings of the Earth, and all People; Princes, and all Judges of the Earth; both Young Men and Maidens, Old Men and Children: let them praiſe the Name of the LORD: for his Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</p>
            <p>But to add one Remark further,</p>
            <p>Even the <hi>infernal</hi> Hoſt is under a Divine Reſtriction and Providential Government. "The Angels that ſinned," were immediately "caſt into Hell, and clapt in Chains of Darkneſs," even "everlaſting Chains." Theſe, altho' in a Senſe ſometimes ſaid to be "looſed out of their Priſon," and the Devil compared to "a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour," yet are always under Check. "The Devil and his Angels, with all their confederate Forces, Sinners on Earth, and loſt Souls in Hell,—the whole "Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," have a Divine Reſtraint upon them: and the glorious GOD, by his infinitely ſuperiour Wiſdom and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007665_0017_102DBAA74E055B00"/>
Strength, over-ruling all their Plots and Efforts in Oppoſition to him, makes even theſe Rebel-Spirits ſubſervient to his Deſigns, "though they mean not ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, Heaven, Earth, and Hell have their ſeveral Hoſts; which are all, in one Senſe or another, the Hoſts of the LORD. So that he hath number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and moſt powerful Armies under his Command.</p>
            <p>"Great then is the LORD: and greatly to be praiſed."<note n="*" place="bottom">The Enlargement on this Reflection, and ſeveral Paragraphs in other Places of this Sermon, were omitted in the Preaching, for Brevity: and indeed the whole but <hi>ſummarily</hi> delivered, in Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Winter-day.</note> He indeed only is the proper Object of our devout Addreſſes and religious Regards. He deſerves and claims our higheſt Homage, the ſupreme Love of our Hearts, and intire Service of our Lives. GOD is worthy, and makes the Demand, that a Reſpect to him ſhould be our reigning Principle, his Will our governing Rule, and his Glory our predominant End. This is of moral Obligation upon us.—But alas, we are in a fallen State, and can never riſe up to the Perfection of moral Duty, becoming the Majeſty and Holineſs of him "with whom we have to do." Nor can we hope to do him acceptable Service, without previous Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the New Covenant, the Propitiation for our Sins, and our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father. With what Humility does it become Sinners to approach the Majeſty of Heaven? And what Care to make uſe of the Mediation of Chriſt? Always "coming to God by him; and whatſoever we do, in Word or Deed, doing all in his Name," with a believing Eye to the Merits and Interceſſion of the Lamb of God: And indeed "calling on the Name of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>" paying him all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007665_0018_102DBAA98C6723F0"/>
and giving him all the Glory, due to "the LORD of Hoſts." Thus, "honouring the SON, even as we honour the FATHER," both being ONE, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Union in "eternal Power and Godhead;" for which Reaſon, we are aſſured, "He that ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the SON, neither honoureth he the FATHER himſelf.—There is "one GOD, even the Father," and there is alſo "one LORD," even the Son. The Phraſes, One God and One Lord, are of the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in Scripture-Uſe; being meant in Contradiſtinction, not to one another, but to the "Gods many, and Lords many," falſely ſo called.—Not all the Wit of Man, I believe, can deviſe a Medium between the Creator and the Creature, or form an Idea of Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between God and an Angel. Were the Son of God a meer Creature, whatever Excellency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Dignity of Station, he might be diſtinguiſhed by; ſuppoſe him a Super-angelic Spirit, incarnate in human Nature; ſtill he muſt be only ranked with the <hi>Hoſts</hi> of the LORD; and not be diſtinguiſhed by the honourable Aſcription of this moſt elevated Divine Character, "the LORD of Hoſts." Without the Belief of which, as juſtly belonging to him, it would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to pay him Divine Honours, by making him "our Hope," by "calling on his Name" in Prayer, by dedicating our ſelves to him in Baptiſm, by religiouſly commemorating him in the Lord's Supper, and by "living to him," or "living by the Faith of the Son of God.<note n="†" place="bottom">By this we may ſafely form a Judgment of <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Devotion. The former denies Chriſt the Glory of his <hi>Deity;</hi> and the latter gives the Glory of his <hi>Mediatorſhip</hi> to Saints and Angels.—<hi>Query,</hi> How then can the one be true <hi>Goſpel;</hi> or the other, true <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi>—And what mighty Difference is there between <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Papal</hi> Worſhip?

But, to add another Reflection,</p>
            <p>This Divine Character, "the LORD of Hoſts," ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters abundant <hi>Conſolation</hi> &amp; <hi>Encouragement</hi> to all ſincere Believers &amp; true Worſhippers of God. Surely it is your Safety, Intereſt and Honour, and therefore your Wiſdom, my Friends, that you are engaged in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him who is "the LORD of Hoſts;" a Name "great in <hi>Zion,</hi>" and ſuch as ſpeaks him your moſt rightful Proprietor, King, and Judge, and all-ſufficient Saviour. It is your happy Privilege, that he "whoſe you are and whom you ſerve," is "able to do for you exceeding abundantly above all that you aſk or think." Verily, the LORD of Hoſts is on your Side: and ſince HE is <hi>for</hi> you, who or what ſhall be <hi>againſt</hi> you? Nay, being in Friendſhip with him, you are alſo in League with all his <hi>Hoſts</hi> in Heaven and Earth; nor ſhall the Hoſt of <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, however they may hate and diſtreſs you, be able finally to "prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you": much leſs need you "fear what <hi>Man</hi> can do unto you."—O follow "the Captain of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation"; and he will in the End bring you ſafe to Glory, by the Conduct of his almighty SPIRIT. Yea, he "maketh his <hi>Angels</hi> miniſtring Spirits;" and they "encamp round about them that fear GOD," and who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation.—Even all his mighty Hoſts, celeſtial and terreſtrial, ſhall ſide with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infernal Hoſt, and conſpire to promote your eternal Safety and Bleſſedneſs. The Hills may be level'd with the Valleys, and Mountains be removed, and ſink in the mighty Waters: yea, Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may paſs away: but you being "joined to the LORD in an everlaſting Covenant," the Promiſe is ſure, from his Power and Faithfulneſs, that "all Things ſhall work together for Good to you." You being CHRIST's behold, "All Things are yours, and ſhall turn to your Salvation." The moſt violent Guſts of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007665_0020_102DBAAE00F3E968"/>
adverſe Winds ſhall eventually do you no real Hurt; but rather "blow your Happineſs," and waft you apace Heaven-ward. All the loyal Hoſts of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH ſhall afford you their friendly Aids, in your Progreſs toward that everlaſting "Reſt, which remains for the People of God.—Amidſt your troubleſome and tedious Travels thro' this evil World, amidſt all the Perils of the preſent Time, realize it, you are "kept by the Power of GOD through Faith unto Salvation.—Having therefore the LORD of Hoſts for your Patron, "with whom is everlaſting Strength," and having "your Heart eſtabliſhed with Grace,—"your Heart fixed, truſting in GOD,—you need not be "afraid of evil Tidings"; you need not, you ought not, to be "afraid with Amazement", under the moſt frightful Aſpects of Providence; no, not under the Apprehenſions of Death it ſelf, or of eternal Judgment. Though "God cometh out of his Place to puniſh the Inhabitants of the Earth," though "he maketh of a City an Heap; of a defenced City, a Ruin;" though "all Joy is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Mirth of the Land is gone, and all the Merry-hearted do ſigh": yet "the LORD will ordain Peace for you", whether exempted from the common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or not. And conſcious of having ſecured an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt by Faith, you may glory in the LORD, and ſay in that Day, "Lo, this is our GOD; we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: this is the LORD, we have waited for him, and we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his Salvation." Though even univerſal Nature were all in a Combuſtion, though the Heavens were blazing over your Heads, the Earth burning under your Feet, and all the Hoſts of both ſeemingly arming for your Deſtruction; yet are you ſafe, perfectly ſafe, in the Hands of him who is "the LORD of Hoſts;" nor need be diſmayed, in the leaſt, even at the Terror of a diſſolving World.—<hi>You</hi> I mean, who are among

his peculiar People, reconciled to God, and righteous before him in your Generation.</p>
            <p>But "the <hi>Ungodly</hi> are not ſo." You that are of an impious Character, are in an unſafe Condition, both living and dying; nor ſhall be able to "ſtand in the Judgment.—So long as you remain impenitent and unbelieving, you are aſſured, "the Wrath of GOD abideth on you": and all the Hoſts of the LORD are againſt you, "ſkilful to deſtroy," and ready to "exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgment," whenever he gives out the fatal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Surely, "the LORD is great; and greatly to be feared." With the LORD of Hoſts is terrible Majeſty, and irreſiſtible Power. "Our GOD is a conſuming Fire.—"Who ſhall not fear him!" Shall not "<hi>Man,</hi> that is a Worm," conſider and be "afraid of him!" Much more <hi>ſinful</hi> Man, that is odious to his Holineſs, and obnoxious to his revenging Juſtice! Oh, "who can ſtand before this holy LORD GOD, when once he is angry! or, whither can you flee from his Preſence!—"His Eyes behold the Nations;" his Eyes, that are "as a Flame of Fire," penetrate the darkeſt, and reach the moſt diſtant Receſſes; "his Hand ſhall find out all his Enemies:" and he hath his powerful Hoſts every where, prepared to "fight the Battles of the LORD"; by the very leaſt of which he can bring you low, yea, deſtroy you in a Moment. Should the LORD commiſſion his Hoſts to make War againſt you, for your Deſtruction, how weak will be your Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and how certain your Ruine? Should a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous GOD bid "the Decree bring forth," and call to the Miniſters of his Vengeance to do their Office, you may look that "the Heaven ſhall reveal your Iniquity, and the Earth riſe up againſt you." And Hell gapes to receive your guilty Soul. The Hoſts of the LORD, every one of them, from an Angel to an Inſect, wait his Commands, and ever ſtand ready to

put them in Execution. Realiſe it, you are ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his numerous Hoſts, on every Side. They are above and beneath you, they are before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, on your right Hand and on your left, yea, even within, as well as without you. There is no reſiſting, nor eſcaping, if the LORD of <hi>Hoſts</hi> empower and arm and ſend them againſt you. Will you not then "trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Fear of him? And will you not inſtantly "ſeek Peace with him?—Know it, this is your only Security; and therefore your higheſt Wiſdom. "Acquaint your ſelves now with him, and be at Peace; thereby Good ſhall come unto you." Get reconciled to God in Chriſt, fear and love, and ſerve him: ſo you will be ſecured of his powerful Friendſhip, and the Friendſhip of all his Hoſts. But, continuing impenitent Rebels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what remains for you, but "a fiery Indignation, that ſhall devour the Adverſaries?—Certainly, "dying in your Sins," you will "fall into the Hands of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God," under the Revenges of his unappeaſable Juſtice: and then all the Hoſts of the Lord will join in pouring Indignation and Contempt upon you.—Even in the preſent World, awful Judgments await you. For "God is angry with the Wicked every Day." And if he ſhould ariſe, and whet his Sword, and come to deal with you in his hot Diſpleaſure, "could your Heart undure, or your Hands be ſtrong!" Oh, "whither will you flee for Help in that Day? And, where will you leave your Glory?"—How will you defend your ſelves againſt the Wrath of Almighty GOD? Or, how will you be "able to abide in the Day of his fierce Anger?" Before it be too late, "conſider this, ye that forget GOD, leſt he tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver!" O conſider "what you will do in the Time of Viſitation:" or rather inquire now, "what you muſt do to be ſaved," even with an everlaſting Salvation!—And haſten the Flight of Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who only can "ſave you from your Sins:" and "who delivereth from the Wrath to come." Do this, as ever you would obtain Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that "ſtrong, that "everlaſting Conſolation," which is the Privilege and Portion of them "who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold of the Hope ſet before them.</p>
            <p>But thus much for the firſt Thing in the Text; the Character, under which GOD is ſpoken of.—I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon it beyond my Intention; but much below the Merit of the important Subject.</p>
            <p>In the next Place,</p>
            <p>II. I am to ſay ſomething of GOD's <hi>viſiting</hi> his People.—Says the Prophet to <hi>Ariel,</hi> "Thou ſhalt be <hi>viſited</hi> of the LORD of Hoſts.—</p>
            <p>This is a figurative Expreſſion, frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Uſe. The Word, <hi>viſit,</hi> properly ſignifies, one's going to ſee another, or meeting him, in Token of Friendſhip towards him, Care of him, or Reſpect for him.—When uſed leſs properly, it ſignifies in general a remembring and performing of ſomething relative to others, whether Good promiſed, or Evil threatned. When God fulfils his Promiſes, or his Threatnings, in ſending Good, or Evil, he is ſaid to viſit us.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to premiſe here,</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſometimes ſpeak of Divine Viſitations for <hi>Good,</hi> and in <hi>Favour.</hi> To "viſit the Widow and Fatherleſs," is to care for them, to relieve and ſupply them in their Neceſſities, to benefit and comfort them, according to the Obligations of Charity. It means a loving and merciful Viſitation.—In the like Senſe, GOD is ſometimes ſaid to viſit his People. We read how "the Lord viſited <hi>Hannah,</hi>" and how he "viſited <hi>Sarah,</hi> as he had ſaid, even doing unto her as he had ſpoken." Theſe were favourable Viſitations, in Conſequence of gracious Promiſes, or in Anſwer to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007665_0024_102DBAB7D48CA2A8"/>
Prayers of Faith.—When <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> lay on his Death-bed, he aſſured his Brethren, by the Spirit of Prophecy, that "GOD would viſit them, and bring them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of that Land." Accordingly, when GOD raiſed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> for a Deliverer, and ſent him to the Iſraelites, he ſaluted them with a conſolatory Meſſage in thoſe Terms, "The GOD of your Fathers hath appeared unto me, ſaying, I have ſurely viſited you." And of the People, believing the glad Report, it is ſaid, "When they heard that the LORD had viſited the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he had looked upon their Affliction, they bowed their Heads and worſhipped." This was a Viſitation for Good, in Mercy and in Truth.—So with Reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> Reſtoration from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> GOD is ſaid to "viſit them, and perform his good Word towards them".—Theſe Providential Viſitations were <hi>Typical</hi> of that more abundantly gracious Viſitation, which GOD made to his People, in the Fulneſs of Time, by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the great Saviour, "worthy of more Glory than <hi>Moſes.</hi>" Even the fame which that godly Prieſt <hi>Zacharias</hi> celebrated in his Song of Praiſe. "Bleſſed be the LORD GOD of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for he hath viſited and redeemed his People; and hath raiſed up an Horn of Salvation for us." This is what the royal Pſalmiſt, if interpreted by the Apoſtle, ſeems to have had principally in his Eye, where he ſays, "What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of Man, that thou <hi>viſiteſt</hi> him?" Which is in the New Teſtament apply'd to the Incarnation of GOD the SON, "who loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.—The Scriptures alſo repreſent the Revealing and the Applying of purchaſed Redemption, under this Notion of a Divine Viſitation. "The Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs.—"A great Prophet is riſen up among
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007665_0025_102DBABAAC860A70"/>
us; and, GOD hath viſited his People.—"God did viſit the Gentiles, to take out of them a People for his Name.—Theſe are ſpiritual Viſitations, through Jeſus Chriſt; by his Word and Ordinances, and by his holy Spirit. Theſe are Viſitations of the Souls of Men: ſuper-eminent in their Nature, of the higheſt Importance, and eternal Conſequence to us.</p>
            <p>I thought it not unmeet to premiſe the Mention of theſe Viſitations for Good, and in Mercy, though not intended in the Text: And ſurely wherein we have been "viſited of the LORD of Hoſts," in this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Senſe, we ſhould take a thankful and admiring Notice of the gracious Condeſcenſion and Kindneſs of GOD to us.—We ſhould pray for ſuch Divine Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, whether of a temporal, or a ſpiritual Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. "Remember me, O LORD, with the Favour thou beareſt to thy People: O viſit me with thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that I may ſee the Good of thy Choſen."—And we ſhould be concerned, that we may "glorify GOD in the Day of Viſitation", in every ſuch Day, when viſited with <hi>Good,</hi> in any Inſtance, and of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Kind.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe there are other Viſitations, that are in a Way of <hi>Judgment:</hi> and theſe are directly pointed to in our Text.—The Scripture ſpeaks elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expreſly and abundantly of a being "viſited with <hi>Evil.</hi>" In this Senſe we are to underſtand thoſe general Expreſſions: "Shall not I viſit for theſe Things? ſaith the LORD.—"This is the City to to be viſited. Agreably we read, "I will bring Evil upon them, even the Year of their Viſitation.—And again, "What will ye do in the Day of Viſitation, and in the Deſolation that ſhall come from far?—We read of God's "viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſgreſſions with the Rod:—and viſiting in his Anger.—There are judicial and penal, diſciplinary and angry Viſitations, as well as gracious and beneficent.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007665_0026_102DBABD446E1438"/>
"Thou haſt viſited and deſtroyed them."—Theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations are the Matter of many Divine <hi>Threatnings.</hi> "Now will he remember their Iniquity, and viſit their Sins: they ſhall return to <hi>Egypt,</hi>" their ancient Houſe of Bondage.—"They ſhall fall, among them that fall: in the Time of their Viſitation they ſhall be caſt down, ſaith the LORD.—And again, "In the Time of their Viſitation they ſhall periſh.—Accordingly our engliſh Tranſlators ſometimes choſe to depart from a literal Verſion of the Word, and only give the Senſe. As where we read, "I will puniſh," in the Original it is, "I will viſit upon—the Fruit of the ſtout Heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>—"The LORD hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and will puniſh (<hi>Heb.</hi> viſit upon) <hi>Jacob</hi> according to his Ways.—"What wilt thou ſay, when he ſhall puniſh (viſit upon) thee?</p>
            <p>When God remembers and executes his Words of Threatning, he is ſaid thus to <hi>viſit,</hi> i. e. in Anger, and with Evil.—By an uſual Figure in Speech (a Synechdoche of the Genus for the Species) the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite or general Word, <hi>viſit,</hi> is often uſed, when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is particularly meant, and Puniſhment deſigned.—To <hi>viſit,</hi> in the punitive Senſe, connotes Forbearance for a Time; when a merciful God ſeemeth to "wink at Men's Sins, and ſuffer their Manners," to "keep Silence," and not animadvert upon them in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but "waiteth, that he may be gracious.—Yet, his Patience being abuſed, He at length ariſes, and comes to them in a Way of Judgment; and this, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at a Juncture "when they are not aware." He emphatically <hi>viſiteth,</hi> in Anger, when he ſends unexpected Calamities, after long Patience: As, when he "viſiteth the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children. And when Deſtruction cometh "in an Inſtant, ſuddenly": as is often the Caſe, when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits with the Evils ſpecify'd in our Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007665_0027_102DBABEC8BE8A68"/>
Theſe Viſitations, in a Way of Anger and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are fearful Viſitations, and to be deprecated by us: yet certainly to be looked for, as they are juſtly deſerved, if we "provoke the Lord to Jealouſy," by "going on ſtill in our Treſpaſſes," notwithſtanding Divine Warnings and Reproofs, and by "deſpiſing the Riches of his Goodneſs and Longſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
            <p>When angry Viſitations are <hi>begun,</hi> it highly imports us, to be concerned that their <hi>Progreſs</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and therefore, to "lay them to Heart, to humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of GOD, and turn to the Lord," in the Methods of Faith and Repentance, Confeſſion and Supplication, with Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Doings. This is called "our viſiting him, in the Time of Trouble.—He certainly expects this Return from us. And thus the End of his corrective Viſitations being anſwered, we may hope, that he will not proceed in a Way of Controverſy with us; or at leaſt, that he "will not make a full End of us, but correct us in Meaſure," and forbear to pour out all his Wrath.—If we do indeed "return to the moſt High," and "viſit him," in the Name of the bleſſed Mediator, with our penitential Confeſſions, and our believing Prayers, following the ſame with "Fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Repentance," and "ſhewing our Faith by our Works," we may humbly hope, that he will "ariſe for our Help, and ſhew us his Mercy;" that he will "viſit us with his Salvation," and "not rebuke us in his ſore Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>But it is Time I come to that particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Viſitation, which the Occaſions of this Day more eſpecially point our Views to. Yet, as you have been already entertained with a Variety of Diſcourſes on this Subject, I ſhall conſider it with the greater Brevity at this Time.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007665_0028_102DBAC1A7F2A388"/>
III. I am to ſpeak of God's viſiting us with the <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the various Articles enumerated in our Text, this is one. "Thou ſhalt be viſited of the LORD of Hoſts with <hi>Earthquake and great Noiſe.</hi>—What the <hi>Earthquake</hi> means, and what the <hi>great Noiſe</hi> attending it, none of you who have ſo lately felt the one, and heard the other, can want any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. All therefore I ſhall do here, is briefly to aſſert a <hi>Divine Agency</hi> in this Event; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it under the Idea of a Divine <hi>Viſitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Earthquake is undoubtedly one of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous <hi>Works</hi> of the LORD of Hoſts.—He that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally gave Being to the Earth, alſo gives Birth to the Events that happen therein. He is "the Creator of all the Ends of the Earth." He laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in the Beginning, and eſtabliſhed it by his Wiſdom and Might. He projected and executed the primitive Plan of its Form, its Compoſition, its Place in the Creation, its Powers, Motions, Productions, and Effects: and in all he ſupports, preſerves, and governs it to this Day. He hath given it ſuch a Proportion of Magnitude, ſo equally poiſed it on every Side, ſo adjuſted all its relative Circumſtances, ſo contempered all its various internal Contents, and made every Thing therein "in Number, Weight and Meaſure," in ſuch Harmony, Conſiſtency, and Regularity, with ſuch Aptitude and Inclination to the ſeveral Ends and Uſes they were deſigned for, and with ſuch powerful Tendencies to the Good of the Whole: that we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, the Earth would never have experienced ſuch Diſorders, nor ſuffered ſuch Convulſions, as it doth, had it not been for the Sin of Man; and were it not for the ſpecial Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of a DIVINE AGENT, whoſe over-ruling
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007665_0029_102DBAC476B86858"/>
Hand, and ſovereign (all-controuling, but uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) Dominion extends to the whole Syſtem of Nature.</p>
            <p>What ſaith the Scripture? "In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth;" ſubterraneous Caverns, and whatever paſſes in them, all at his abſolute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: "The Strength of the Hills is his alſo;" their Magnitude, Altitude, Conſiſtence, and Influence, given or taken away by him, at his Pleaſure. "The Sea is his," and "He treadeth on the Waves of the Sea." He hath "appointed the Sands for the Bound thereof." He governs it in all it's Motions, Fluxes and Refluxes, and the various Conſequences thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He retains it within it's deſtin'd Limits, or cauſes it to break over its Boundaries, in terrible Inundations, where and when he pleaſeth. "And his Hands form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dry Land;" which gives him therefore a Right of Propriety in it, and of Dominion over it; and over all Things either upon the Surface, or within the Bowels of it.—"The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulneſs thereof." And whatever Revolutions or Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes happen <hi>on</hi> it, or <hi>in</hi> it, he preſides, and governs all. The <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of the Earth is his: all its Produce, all its Incumbents, all it's Contents, at his abſolute Diſpoſal; and he adds, or diminiſhes, as he pleaſeth, and with a reſiſtleſs Power moderates in all terrene Affairs. The <hi>Earth</hi> itſelf is the LORD's. He "form'd it to be inhabited," by whom, and in what Parts he pleaſeth: and as he has an indiſputable Right, where he will, to "make it a Land deſolate and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited," ſo whenever this Event happens, and where-ever, or by whatever Means, a Divine Agency is to be ſeen and owned therein. "Lo; he that formeth the Mountains, and treadeth upon the high Places of the Earth; the LORD, the GOD of Hoſts is his Name:" and at his Pleaſure, he converts them into Valleys, or ſinks them in the Ocean; or only threatens
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007665_0030_102DBAC6439947A8"/>
their Overthrow, by a mighty Tremor and Convulſion. Be the Force and Effects of an Earthquake in one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or another, we are ever taught to aſcribe it to GOD. Sometimes "He removeth the Mountains," and is ſaid to "ſhake the Earth out of its Place:" but if only "the Pillars thereof tremble," if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Hills bow, tho' they be not ſcattered, it is ſtill the Operation of his almighty Hand. In every ſuch Caſe, we muſt make the Pſalmiſt's devout Confeſſion, "THOU haſt made the Earth to tremble;" even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we have no Occaſion to add his Complaint, "Thou haſt broken it; heal the Breaches thereof."—Though it be ſaid in the Story of God's Appearances to the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> that "the LORD was not in the <hi>Earthquake,</hi>" this is by no Means to be underſtood as if God were not the Author of it, but only that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made no ſpecial Diſcoveries of his Mind and Will to the Prophet.</p>
            <p>There may have been Earthquakes purely miraculous, and ſupernatural; not owing to any natural Cauſes, at leaſt in their natural Courſe of Operation. As, that in the Caſe of <hi>Elijah:</hi> And that at the Promulgation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when "GOD came down on <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and the whole Mount quaked exceedingly." So that in the Caſe of <hi>Corah:</hi> And thoſe which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied our LORD's Death and Reſurrection: So, that which "ſhook open the Priſon-Doors," in the Story of the Jaylor: And perhaps that miraculous Event on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> was the Earthquake and great Noiſe. "Suddenly (it is ſaid) there came a Sound from Heaven, as of a mighty ruſhing Wind, and it filled the Houſe;" filled it with Noiſe and Tremor, at leaſt: in which the Apoſtle notices the Fulfilment of ancient Prophecy: "I will ſhew Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Heaven above, and Signs in the Earth beneath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:007665_0031_102DBAC7CC66F510"/>
But, without Queſtion, uſually the Earthquake, though a rare and ſurpriſing Phaenomenon (and never yet fully accounted for, on any Hypotheſis) happens agreably to the Laws of Nature, and has its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Origin from Cauſes natural: very much the ſame perhaps with thoſe that give Riſe to Thunder.—But the Inveſtigation of theſe is the Buſineſs of Philoſophy, and the Controverſies on this Head may well enough be left to "the Diſputers of this World.</p>
            <p>Theology points us to GOD, as the firſt Cauſe. Whatever be the ſecondary Cauſes, and Reaſons in Nature, without Controverſy "the LORD of Hoſts" is the grand Operator, the prime Efficient. Being the Creator and Proprietor of the univerſal World, the Author and Preſerver of all natural Cauſes, and of all their Virtues, Inſtincts, and Principles of Operation; He has an indiſputable Claim to Government over them, and exerciſes his ſovereign Right (as before obſerved) in guiding, influencing, limiting, and over-ruling them, according to the Counſel of his own Will, in Subſerviency to the Deſigns of his Providence. Indeed ſuch are the ſtrange Appearances ſometimes in the natural World, that it looks as if Nature had then broke looſe from all Law and Order, and natural Agents were left to act at Random, with a wild Rage and unbounded Licenſe. But the Truth is, amidſt all their Impetuoſity, mutual Contrariety, and Confuſion, they are "not without Law to God," but ſtill are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and governed by his almighty Hand, and "ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his Word." Not an Earthquake happens, whether great or ſmall, and whatever its natural Cauſes or Effects, but GOD is the ſupreme Author. It is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily the Work of him who is the LORD of Hoſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a Divine <hi>Viſitation,</hi> wherever it comes. "Thou ſhalt be <hi>viſited</hi> of the LORD of Hoſts with Earthquake and great Noiſe." It is always a Viſitation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007665_0032_102DBACB8758DFE8"/>
from Heaven: but of various Intention and Influence not always on the ſame ſpecial Deſign, nor uniformly productive of the ſame Effects.</p>
            <p>Permit me to ſay here diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, this Viſitation from the LORD of Hoſts is an eminent Diſplay of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> &amp; <hi>Power,</hi> and carry's with it very ſignal Tokens of his awful <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Agency</hi> in this World of ours.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe thoſe Paſſages in <hi>Deborah'</hi>s Song: <q>LORD, when Thou wenteſt out of Seir, when Thou marchedſt out of the Field of Edom, the Earth trembled,—the Mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai, from before the GOD of Iſrael.</q>—And thoſe Paſſages in one of <hi>Aſaph'</hi>s Pſalms: <q>I will remember the Years of the Right-hand of the MOST HIGH.—Who is ſo great a God, as our GOD? Thou art the GOD that doeſt Wonders: Thou haſt declared thy Strength among the People.—The Waters ſaw Thee, O GOD, the Waters ſaw Thee: they were afraid; the Depths alſo were troubled; the Earth trembled and ſhook.</q>—Remarkable likewiſe are thoſe Words in the Prayer of <hi>Habakkuk:</hi> 
               <q>GOD came from Teman, and the HOLY ONE from Mount Paran. His Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Praiſe. He ſtood &amp; meaſured the Earth;—the everlaſting Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ſcattered, the perpetual Hills did bow,—the Curtains of the Land of Midian did tremble.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures ſpeak as if at ſuch a Seaſon the LORD of Hoſts "aroſe to ſhake terribly the Earth." He "riſeth up out of his Place, boweth the Heavens, and cometh down," and <q>at his Preſence the Earth trembleth.</q>—"The LORD GOD of Hoſts is he that toucheth the Land:—He looketh upon the Earth," and the Mountains ſhake, the Rocks quiver, univerſal Nature is ſtruck with ſolemn Dread.—"Earthquake
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007665_0033_102DBACDAE38E2C0"/>
and great Noiſe" (though it proceed no further) is a Terror even to the Brute-Creation.—Beſure ſcarce any Thing more ſenſibly ſtrikes the human Mind with Awe and Surpriſe. The Reaſons of this, whether natural or moral, are obviouſly ſuch as theſe. It is an uncommon Event, it comes ſuddenly, threatens Deſtruction in a Moment both to us and ours, throws all about us into Conſternation and Confuſion, is an Image and Preſage of the final Judgment, and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World at the laſt Day, when Sinners will find all Refuge fail them; in a Word, is a loud and awakening Lecture to Conſcience, upon the Being, Perfections, and Providence of GOD.—It peculiarly exhibits him in the Greatneſs of his Power, the Extent of his Dominion, and the Glory of his Majeſty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps beyond any other of his Works of the like Kind. It is ſingularly calculated to alarm and rouſe a ſecure World, to intimidate the bold Criminal, to ſhame and humble the haughty Worldling, to ſurpriſe the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; in ſhort, to make all Men "know there is a GOD who judgeth in the Earth," and "know themſelves to be but Men."—We read in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 
               <q>In that Day there ſhall be a great Shaking in the Land of Iſrael,—ſo that all Creatures ſhall ſhake at my Preſence.</q>—Thus will I magnify my ſelf, and I will <q>be known in the Eyes of many Nations, and they ſhall know that I am the LORD.</q>—The Earthquake is a Diſpenſation ſtrongly tending to keep up a Senſe of GOD in the World, a Reverence for Religion, and a Reſtraint upon the Wickedneſs of the Wicked: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Infidelity and Atheiſm would be rampant, were it not for ſuch convincing Witneſſes and awakning Monitors of a Divine Being and Providence.—Even good Men may <hi>ſometimes</hi> need theſe ſhaking Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to quicken them, and make them more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to "walk humbly with their GOD.—That Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,

            <p>But I haſten to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Earthquake has ſometimes been ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, as to be an evident Token of GOD's <hi>Favour</hi> to his People: and he has by Means thereof wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully viſited them with his <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of old, when GOD has been "ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen, that were at Eaſe," and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies to his choſen Nation, He has "ſhaken the Earth," and thereby "overthrown the Kingdoms of the Heathen," or greatly weakned their Power, by its being the Occaſion of routing their Armies. If the Earth has not opened, and by ſwallowing up their Adverſaries brought Salvation to God's People; yet this Effect has been accompliſhed by Means of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick ſiezing the Enemy on ſuch an Occaſion. This was inſtrumental towards <hi>Jonathan'</hi>s famous Triumph over the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Enemy. We read, <q>There was a Trembling in the Hoſt, &amp; in the Field, &amp; among all the People: the Gariſon, &amp; the Spoilers, they alſo trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the Earth quaked: ſo that it was a very great Trembling [a Trembling of GOD.] And the Watchmen of <hi>Saul</hi> in Gibeah looked; and behold, the Multitude melted away, and they went on beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down one another.</q>—An Earthquake, if it was not among the Means made Uſe of for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Eſcape from the purſuing <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet in the Time of <hi>Joſhua</hi> it was among the "Wonders GOD wrought," at Iſrael's paſſing through <hi>Jordan,</hi> in Token of his Favour to them, and for a Terror to their Enemies. To which notable Story
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007665_0035_102DBAD2FB868298"/>
the Pſalmiſt alludes: <q>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Sea ſaw and fled: <hi>Jordan</hi> was driven back. The Mountains ſkipped like Rams; and the little Hills, like Lambs. What ailed thee, thou Sea!—thou <hi>Jordan!</hi>—Ye Mountains!—[the Occaſion of it is hinted in the following Clauſe] Tremble, thou Earth, at the Preſence of the LORD, at the Preſence of the GOD of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </q>—In a previous Speech to the People <hi>Joſhua</hi> had told them the Meaning of this Wonder. <q>Hereby ye ſhall know, that the living GOD is among you, and that he will without Fail drive out from before you the <hi>Canaanites.</hi>—God aſſured <hi>Joſhua,</hi> it was deſigned in Favour and Honour to him, in ſpecial. This Day will I begin to magnify thee in the Sight of all Iſrael, that they may know I will be with thee, as I was with <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </q>—And the Divine Preſence with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had been teſtify'd by the Earthquake, not only at the Promulgation of the Law, but alſo in the Affair of <hi>Corah'</hi>s Mutiny againſt him.—In that Regard, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were eminent Types of CHRIST, who had a Teſtimony borne him from Heaven repeatedly by the Earthquake, at his Death, and at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.—In like Manner, his Apoſtles and primitive Diſciples were repeatedly honoured with this Token of God's ſpecial Preſence &amp; Approbation; as you read in the Book of the <hi>Acts.</hi>—That "great Earthquake" in the Story of the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> was not only honorary to thoſe impriſoned Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and the Means of their Deliverance out of the Hands of their cruel Perſecutors (who, probably being intimidated on that awful Occaſion, were the rather willing to diſcharge them) but it proved more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly beneficial to the abuſive Jaylor himſelf, who thereupon had his Conſcience awakened, and was brought ſolicitouſly to enquire after eternal Salvation.—

Truly, whenever this is a Conſequence of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, it is, however for Correction, yet in Mercy. Though a terrible Viſitation, yet is it a merciful one in the Event, when ſanctify'd of God for ſaving Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Souls; eſpecially when conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are the happy Subjects of good Impreſſions, at ſuch a Seaſon. A gracious Viſitation by the HOLY SPIRIT, attending this Viſitation in Providence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grievous and tremendous for the preſent, turns it into a beneficial one, and joyous, in the Reflection. Yea, though it prove the Deſtruction of many Lives, yet if "the Remnant are affrighted, and give Glory to the GOD of Heaven," by making a wiſe Uſe of ſuch a bereaving and deſolating Viſitation, to the Ends of Religion, and the ſaving of the Soul, it is to them eventually a Viſitation in Mercy, and for their beſt Good.</p>
            <p>It remains to obſerve, more directly to the Purpoſe of our Text,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Earthquake is moſt commonly a Viſitation in holy <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> at a People, for their <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earthquake uſually carry's the Face of an <hi>angry</hi> Viſitation, procured by <hi>Sin.</hi> The firſt Sin of Man, not only brought Wrath upon himſelf, and on his Offspring; but "ſubjected the Creature to Vanity," and entailed a "Curſe upon the Ground:" which the accumulative Guilt of new Rebellions, among the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Inhabitants of the Earth, provokes God to put in Execution from Age to Age. So outragious and obſtinate was the Wickedneſs of the Generality even of <hi>Adam'</hi>s more immediate Poſterity, that "God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented he had made Man upon the Earth;" and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, by a terrible Execution of Juſtice, the World that then was, being overflowed with Water, periſhed." An univerſal and moſt fatal <hi>Inundation!</hi> An Example of "Perdition of ungodly Men," not to be parallel'd,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007665_0037_102DBAD74CFFE180"/>
but by the final <hi>Conflagration,</hi> which "the Earth that now is," we are aſſured by Revelation, is "reſerved unto." Yet in the mean Time, particular Cities, or Countries, are not exempt from a ſimilar Overthrow and Deſolation: Inſtances of which there have been many, both ancient and modern, and ſome very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. As "GOD ſpared not the old World," ſo neither ſpared he <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and other heathen Cities in the new World, in like Manner giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves over to Filthineſs, but "condemned them with an Overthrow, making them an Enſample of Vengeance, to them that after ſhould live ungodly." Nor hath God ſpared even his own profeſſing People (whether Jews, or Chriſtians) when their Apoſtacy has ripen'd them for Deſtruction. Hence that of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> ſpeaking to Iſrael, in GOD's Name; "Some of you I have overthrown, as I overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>" An expreſs Scripture-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this we have in the Caſe of <hi>Corah</hi> and his wicked Accomplices, who were partly deſtroyed by Fire from Heaven, and partly ſwallowed up by an Earthquake, in the Days of <hi>Moſes.</hi>—The Words of <hi>Amos,</hi> dated expreſly "two Years before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake," when he propheſy'd, "that the Land ſhould tremble," and that GOD would "ſmite the Winter-Houſe, with the Summer-Houſe, and the great Houſes ſhould have an End; that he would "ſmite the great Houſe with Breaches, and the little Houſe with Clefts; that "the Songs of the Temple ſhould be Howlings in that Day, there being many dead Bodies in every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Place," &amp;c. this Prophecy, it is thought, was fulfil'd in that memorable Inſtance which the Prophet <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> refers to, where he takes Notice how the People "fled from before the Earthquake in the Days of <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi>". Which, by this Hint, ſeems to have been a great and terrible Earthquake, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007665_0038_102DBAD8D069C840"/>
like that which "all Iſrael fled" from before, in the Wilderneſs. Perhaps the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Uzziah,</hi> refers to this ſame Event, which he might be an Eye-witneſs to in thoſe Words of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <q>Becauſe they have deſpiſed the Word of the Holy One of Iſrael, therefore is the Anger of the LORD kindled againſt his People, and he hath ſmitten them; and the Hills did tremble, and their Carcaſes were torn in the midſt of the Streets.</q>—<hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jewiſh Antiquary ſeems to confirm this Thought, when he informs us, from Tradition, of ſuch Circumſtances attending this Earthquake; that "it rent the Roof of the Temple, and tore down a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which rolling along choak'd up the High-ways, and coverd the King's Gardens all over with Rubbiſh." It might then happen, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> that there were "many dead Bodies;" or according to <hi>Iſaiah'</hi>s Report, that "the Carcaſes of Men were torn in the Streets." While they "fled from before the Earthquake," the falling Mountain might catch and cruſh them; the Rocks, thrown down and rolling along, might overtake and deſtroy them; and many might periſh by the Fall of the Houſes, that were ſhook down. This was a judicial Viſitation: the Prophet expreſly aſcribes it to "the Anger of the LORD kindled againſt his People; and" viſiting their Tranſgreſſions upon them.—Theſe Scripture-Accounts teach us always to view it as an <hi>angry</hi> Viſitation, for Sin, when the Earthquake is the Means of awful Deaths and Devaſtations, in whatever Part or Age of the World this happens. Such undoubtedly was that which the Jewiſh Antiquities acquaint us, fell out in the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> (a little before Chriſt's Coming) when the whole Land was ſhaken in a moſt amazing Manner, a Multitude of Houſes thrown down, and ſome Thouſands of the Inhabitants bury'd in the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007665_0039_102DBADB31D33FC0"/>
Ruins.—And ſuch undoubtedly were the "Earthquakes in divers Places," that fell out according to our LORD's Prediction, not very long after his Aſcenſion, when (as Hiſtory informs us) ſome great and populous Cities, yea, Numbers of them at a Time, were overthrown and deſtroyed: in which Deſolations, not Pagans only, but Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſtians too, many of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.—And we have Reaſon to think, ſuch alſo were thoſe in following Ages, which befel many Cities where Chriſtianity had once flouriſhed, but Apoſtacy having taken Place and prevailed, this proved their utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>The Time would fail me, to tell of <hi>Antioch</hi> (the City firſt honoured with the Name <hi>Chriſtian</hi>) of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. (in the Number of the ſeven Churches in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> which have long ſince periſhed by Earthquakes, that left them ſcarce any Mark or Memorial where they ſtood) and of ſeveral Parts of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> (often viſited with Earthquakes, and ſometimes almoſt intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed by them) and of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (formerly a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> City, though now <hi>Mahometan;</hi> always ſubject to Earthquakes; a very terrible and deſtructive one befel it about two Years ſince) and of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with adjacent Places, (very lately, and moſt dreadfully overthrown) and of <hi>Cadiz</hi> (another recent Inſtance) with other Places, where Earthquakes and Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have deſtroyed much Subſtance, and many Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As alſo of Places in the <hi>American</hi> Parts of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Antigua, Nevis, Jamaica, Lima,</hi> &amp;c. which have ſometimes been almoſt deſtroyed by Earthquakes.—Nay, though we are not to judge the People of ſuch Places to have been "Sinners above all Men", yet if the <hi>like Sins</hi> were abounding among them, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tell us were the procuring Cauſes of <hi>like Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> in other Places of old, it is no Breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007665_0040_102DBADE0520E978"/>
to ſuppoſe the Places I have mentioned, were "viſited of the LORD of Hoſts," in this fearful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for their Tranſgreſſions; and have been "thrown down in his Anger.—"Righteouſneſs exalteth a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but Sin is the Reproach of any People." When "the Foundations of the Earth are moved exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when a Place "falls," and eſpecially if it "riſes not again," it is a Sign "the Tranſgreſſions thereof are heavy upon it," and a Token of "Wrath gone out from the LORD againſt it.—When "the Curſe devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Earth," in particular Spots of it, and ſpreads Deſolation among its Inhabitants, the Scripture teaches us to look on it as a Sign, that "the Earth is defiled under its Inhabitants, becauſe of their Tranſgreſſions," and that an angry Providence has "viſited for theſe Things.—As it is written, "Who hath harden'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt GOD, and hath proſpered? Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the Mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his Anger."—But is the Lord diſpleaſed at the Mountains? Or is his Indignation againſt the Earth? No, but againſt them that dwell upon it; who by their Iniquities provoke him to Wrath, which he ſees fit ſometimes to manifeſt in this terrible Way.—Such angry Viſitations are divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to the ſuffering People, againſt their Sins: and loud Warnings to the reſt of the World, to hear and fear. "Go ye now (ſaith the Lord) to my Place which was in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where I ſet my Name at the firſt; and ſee what I did to it, for the Wickedneſs of my People <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, ſuppoſing there be <hi>only</hi> Earthquake and great Noiſe, without any detrimental Effects, yet is it to be looked on a <hi>Viſit</hi> from the LORD of Hoſts, and uſually in <hi>Anger.</hi> Though Houſes ſtand, and no Life be loſt, no deſtructive Inundation breaking in, nor "Flame of devouring Fire" breaking out; yet may
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007665_0041_102DBAE042FCA9E8"/>
it be an <hi>angry</hi> Viſitation. There are various Signs of Reſentment, beſides ſtabbing with the Sword, or ſmiting with the Fiſt. Anger may be ſhewn by the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well as by the Hand; by a Frown, as well as by a Scourge: And by lighter Strokes, or meer Shakings of the Rod, as well as by heavy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Blows. If God "appoints over us <hi>Terror,</hi>" though without <hi>Conſumption;</hi> eſpecially if he "ſmites us with <hi>great Terror</hi> and <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi>" as in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, if it riſes to any high Degree; when "our Lips quiver, and our Fleſh trembleth," at the dreadful Sound in our Ears, and threatning Agitation we feel and ſee of all Things about us; and when withal a guilty Conſcience, at ſuch a diſtreſſing Seaſon, awakes, and ſmites, the Sinner with Remorſe and Horror, in the Remembrance of Sin. and under the Apprehenſion of an angry God viſiting his Iniquities. Though indeed this may eventually "turn to his Salvation," yet is it really a Diſpenſation of <hi>Wrath,</hi> a Diſplay of the "fiery Law" and incenſed Juſtice of Heaven; and appears ſuch, at preſent, to the alarmed Sinner.</p>
            <p>The Earthquake that fell out at our SAVIOUR's Crucifixion, proclaimed a Divine Indignation at the horrid Fact. The Pſalmiſt probably refers to that, where he prophetically ſays, "Then the Earth ſhook and trembled, becauſe GOD was wroth." And tho' in the Scripture-Story we do not read of Devaſtations by it, of Houſes falling, or of Lives loſt; yet we do of "the People's ſmiting their Breaſts," and returning from the Place of Execution in great Conſternation and Aſtoniſhment. The Earthquake with great Noiſe, tho' in the Event harmleſs, as to outward Effects, yet carry's in it a tremendous Appearance, has the Aſpect of an angry "Viſitation from the LORD of Hoſts;" and in all common Caſes is to be conſidered by us in that Light. As it is written, <q>The LORD is the true GOD, he is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007665_0042_102DBAE215E85278"/>
the living GOD, and an everlaſting King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it is Time I come to a CONCLUSION; which I ſhall do with applying this Subject in a few practical Reflections and Exhortations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, let us then ſee and own the <hi>Agency</hi> of GOD in the great and terrible Earthquakes, this and other Places have lately felt. Let us realiſe it, that herein they and we have been indeed "<hi>viſited</hi> of the LORD of Hoſts.—It would be <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> to aſcribe theſe Events to meer Caſualty, or Chance: and it would be <hi>vain Philoſophy,</hi> to terminate all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in meer natural Cauſes. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (ſo called) would be "worſe than an <hi>Infidel,</hi>" not to carry up his Views, to that ALMIGHTY AGENT, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all Events in univerſal Nature. May none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that name the Name of CHRIST, have that Complaint lying againſt them; "LORD, when thy Hand is lifted, they will not ſee."—O that there never were Occaſion to <q>declare this in the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and publiſh it in <hi>Judah,</hi> ſaying, Hear now this, O fooliſh People; and without Underſtanding, which have Eyes, &amp; ſee not, which have Ears, &amp; hear not! Fear ye not ME? ſaith the LORD: will ye not tremble at MY PRESENCE?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us admire the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> of GOD towards a <hi>World lying in Wickedneſs,</hi> that he no <hi>oftner</hi> repeats his angry Viſitations by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and terrible Earthquakes.</p>
            <p>This Diſpenſation may, for its <hi>Unuſualneſs,</hi> be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "his <hi>ſtrange</hi> Work. Men's periſhing by Means of an Earthquake was on<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> called "a <hi>new</hi> Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Num.</hi> 16. 30.) And it has been a <hi>rare</hi> Thing ever ſince, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with their dying by Sickneſs, called "the Viſitation of all Men." It is leſs infrequent indeed in ſome Parts of the Earth, than in others, and perhaps
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007665_0043_102DBAE45AC25F50"/>
will become more and more common in this laſt Age of the World. In a natural Senſe, "the Earth waxes <hi>old,</hi> as doth a Garment:" and an old Garment eaſily admits of Rents. But if we take it in a moral Senſe, as the World grows <hi>old in Sin,</hi> and the final Diſſolution approaches nearer, we may reaſonably expect a greater Frequency of this Divine Judgment.—In the mean Time, what admiring Thoughts ſhould we have of the Riches of God's ſparing Goodneſs and Forbearance towards "this preſent evil World," in general!</p>
            <p n="3">3. In particular, let us take a thankful Notice of his <hi>diſtinguiſhing Mercy to us;</hi> while we aſcribe <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> to him, in his <hi>terrible Doings towards others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſhould "our Souls magnify the LORD, and our Spirits rejoyce in GOD our Saviour," that We have never yet been "viſited of the LORD of Hoſts" in the like deſtructive Manner as many other Parts have been!—We have learnt by Experience, that we dwell in a Land liable to the Earthquake. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there are the like Proviſions in <hi>Nature</hi> for Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes of equal Force, to produce calamitous Effects, correſpondent to thoſe in other Places: Nor have we any Grounds to flatter our ſelves as if ſufficient <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Cauſes were not found among us, even among us.—<hi>Who then has made us to differ?</hi> And <hi>why</hi> are we diſtinguiſhed from others? Certainly we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it into the ſovereign Pleaſure of Him "who hath Compaſſion on whom he will have Compaſſion." To this it is intirely owing, that the <hi>Viſitations</hi> made us in this Way, though we have Reaſon to conclude them <hi>angry</hi> Viſitations, have hitherto been but <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary,</hi> and mingled with much Clemency and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>As vaſt as the Miſchiefs impending over us in the Time of our Viſitation, ſo great is the Deliverance we have received! Let us reflect, and realize, how
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007665_0044_102DBAE687B6D2B0"/>
the LORD of Hoſts appeared "marching through the Land in Indignation," threatning every Town with inſtant Ruin, every Family with immediate Deſolation, every Perſon with ſudden Deſtruction!—Let us think; Might not our <hi>Houſes,</hi> which tottered and reeled in ſo amazing a Manner, have fallen in Pieces, and become our Graves!—Or might not the <hi>Ground</hi> have cleaved under our Feet, and ſwallowed us up in its diſmal Hollows! Might not the Flame of devouring <hi>Fire</hi> have broken out, and conſumed us in a Moment! Or the <hi>Sea</hi> have rolled in it's angry Billows, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed us with a deſolating Flood!—Truly, we were viſited in a fearful Manner, and we trembled "becauſe of the Shaking of the Hand of the LORD of Hoſts, which he ſhook over us:" but be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hold, he hath ſaved us out of our Fears, and hath wrought for us "this great Deliverance."—Not a Houſe is fallen,—not a Life is loſt,—not even a Limb broken! "Praiſe ye the LORD."—"How great is his <hi>Goodneſs!</hi>" and how great his <hi>Power,</hi>—in our wonderful Preſervation! The ſame Divine Hand, that ſhook our Dwellings in ſo tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Manner, held their ſeveral Parts in Union, and reſcued their reſpective Inhabitants from being cruſhed by the Fall of them. The ſame Almighty Arm, that ſhook the Land and Ocean, kept the Foundations from breaking up, and prevented our being deluged by invading Waves, or conſumed by reſiſtleſs Flames. He who is "mighty to ſave," as well as able to deſtroy, has wrought marvellouſly for us. His Wrath was kindled, his Hand was ſtretched out, he terribly ſhook us, and threatned to ſmite with a killing Blow: but "Mercy rejoyced againſt Judgment." He liſtned to the Pleadings of his own Bowels: and "in the midſt of Wrath be remembred Mercy." The compaſſionate Keeper of the Vineyard interceeded for the barreſt
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007665_0045_102D742A6B14C730"/>
Figtree, "Spare it this Year alſo." And we are once more reprieved from impendent, merited Deſtruction. Though the great Terror has been repeated, yet ſo likewiſe has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been the great Deliverance. We muſt confeſs, "It is of the Mercies of the LORD, that we are not conſumed," and made the Monuments of his vindictive Juſtice, even as others.</p>
            <p>Very ſurpriſing and moſt melancholy Accounts we have had of late Deſolations, made by the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> in various Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> more eſpecially at LISBON, the Metropolis of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and one of the wealthieſt Cities upon Earth: but now lying in Ruins, ſuppoſed irreparable. "Alas, Alas, that great City! for in one Hour is ſhe made deſolate.—In one Hour ſo great Riches are come to Nought!" The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all demoliſhed, Thouſands of Lives (it is thought, not leſs than fifty Thouſand) loſt,—and Thouſands of the Survivors reduced to Beggary, or extreme Want.—Truly they are juſt Objects of our Sympathy: and all ought to pity and pray for them; wiſhing them all needful Help in this Time of Trouble; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, wiſhing that they may "glorify GOD in this Day of their Viſitation," by Repentance and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of their Ways, by deſerting <hi>"the Man of Sin,"</hi> and "turning to GOD from <hi>Idols,</hi> to ſerve the living and true GOD, and to wait for his SON from Heaven," the ſole Head of the Church, and the one only Mediator between God and Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—We ſhould be the more affected with that amazing <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> as its Influence will be ſo extenſive in the trading World, reaching doubtleſs to Numbers among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and as it happen'd within the <hi>ſame Month</hi> in which we were awfully threatned with the like Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but ſpared through the tender Mercies of our GOD. The Coincidence of ſuch different Events at the ſame Juncture, makes both the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

"Behold the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> &amp; the <hi>Severity</hi> of GOD!". His righteous Severity on them which fell; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us unmerited Goodneſs!—By the one, we ſee what might have befallen us, and how wonderfully we have eſcaped imminent Ruin.—By the other, we ſee what inexpreſſible Obligations we are under to GOD, our ſole Deliverer: who, when he might juſtly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, did but ſhake and terrify us; and now hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quieted the Earth, has alſo delivered us from the diſquieting Terror.—"Stand ſtill, and ſee the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD!—"Stay your ſelves, and wonder.—Wonder at the Diſtinction made by ſovereign Goodneſs: and "be ye thankful.—And ſuch ſurely have a ſuperadded Obligation to this, who have had the Viſitation in <hi>Providence</hi> accompany'd to them with a Viſitation of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> ſanctifying the ſame to them, either for their Awakning and Converſion, or for their Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Edification.

            <p>"GOD hath ſpoken in his Holineſs."—We have had a loud Lecture on the Exiſtence, Providence, and Perfections of GOD; on the Frailty of Man; the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Creature-Helps; our Need of a better Portion than one in the Earth, "this little Dwelling-place of Worms," unſtable too, and liable to ſuch ſhocking Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes; our Need, conſequently, of an Intereſt in GOD, who is "the Portion of <hi>Jacob,</hi>" through Faith in CHRIST; and ſo, the Wiſdom of the happy Few,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007665_0047_102DBAEE63B8AF10"/>
that have "choſen the good Part;" but the Folly of the wretched Multitude, that "forſake their own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies."—O let us "hear Inſtruction, and be wiſe, and refuſe it not.—We have had a loud Call, to "fear the Lord of Hoſts;—to "ſtand in Awe, and ſin not;—to "humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of God;—to "conſider our Ways, and turn our Feet unto his Teſtimonies;—to "ſeek Peace,—and "flee for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, to lay hold of the Hope ſet before us, in the Goſpel of Reconciliation.—Not only the deſtroying Judgments of God on others, but the threatning Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we our ſelves have been under, ſpeak this our Duty and our Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>In the Earthquake, we have had a practical Sermon, preached to us in very awful Accents, upon the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity of Repentance towards God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—It thundred out the Menaces of the Law againſt ſecure Sinners; ringing that doleful Peal in their Ears; "WO to them that are at Eaſe in <hi>Zion.</hi>—It cried aloud, in the Language of that Goſpel-Caveat, to awakened Sinners, "Quench not the SPIRIT.—It gave a ſolemn Admonition to the Children of God, to "awake out of Sleep, to "ariſe, and trim their Lamps; and to "look diligently, leſt any Man fail of the Grace of God;" to pray and labour for the Converſion of others; and in their reſpective Places to promote a general Reformation.—The Call indeed is of univerſal Extent, to all Societies, and all Perſons, of every Character, Colour, Condition, Rank, Sex, and Age: "Hear ye the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</p>
            <p>Have our <hi>Lives</hi> been awfully threatned, yet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully ſpared? Shall we not then devote them to the Honour of that God, in whoſe Hand our Breath is;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007665_0048_102DBAEFE4A95488"/>
and be led to Repentance, by his Goodneſs, which we are ſuch remarkable Monuments of!<note n="*" place="bottom">The more ſo, as on the very ſame Day of our Viſitation (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 18.) a ſeverer one, we are informed, was made in ſome Parts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> on the Continent of <hi>Africa:</hi> 
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> the City FEZ, Capital of the Kingdom of that Name; MEQUINEZ, another ſtrong City; and TETUAN, a conſiderable Town, all ſaid to be then deſtroyed by the Earthquake.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Have our <hi>Houſholds</hi> been ſaved alive in the Time of common Hazard? And ſhall not Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies be awakened to a greater religious Care of all under their Charge reſpectively? Each taking up <hi>Joſhua'</hi>s Reſolution; "As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD."—And will not our Children from this Time fear GOD? and pay a greater Regard to the fifth Commandment? "Which is the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment with Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Have our <hi>Dwellings</hi> not been cut off? Let it then be our humble Reſolve, with <hi>David,</hi> that we will "walk in our Houſes with a perfect Heart." God knows how many "Houſes full of Deceit," but empty of Godlineſs and Honeſty, have been awfully ſhaken; that it is a Wonder they were not thrown down upon the guilty Dwellers therein, bringing them into Deſolation in a Moment! And will not ſuch now "put away all Iniquity far from their Tabernacles?—Were there not many prayerleſs <hi>Cloſets</hi> terribly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?

but to learn Patience and Contentment?—Will not the <hi>Husbandman</hi> think of the Earthquake, when he goes into his Field; and the Trader, when he goes into his Store; the Artificer, when in his Shop: and learn to practiſe Honeſty, with Induſtry, and to do common Actions after a godly Sort?</p>
            <p>Do our <hi>Houſes of Worſhip</hi> yet ſtand; the Fall of which would have turned the Songs of the Temple into Lamentation, and perhaps had been the final Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſome of our religious Aſſemblies? And ſhall we not now have a higher Value for our Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary-Privileges, "ſet our Affections more to the Houſe of our God, and more diligently frequent it, "in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon?</p>
            <p>How ſhould the <hi>Churches,</hi> by a Senſe of the Goodneſs of God, in not diſſolving them, or not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their Numbers by a deſtroying Earthquake, be excited to a Care of reforming what is amiſs in them, of maintaining brotherly Love, and improving in Purity of Doctrine, Worſhip, and moral Practice?</p>
            <p>Will not the <hi>Miniſters of the Word,</hi> by ſolemn Reflection on the Uncertainty of their Opportunities, as their own and their Hearers Lives appear ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, be quickned to "redeem the Time," and double their Diligence in all the Duties of the Paſtoral Care?</p>
            <p>Do our <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colleges</hi> yet ſtand, through the Mercy of God? And ſhall not theſe publick Means of Education be more prized, be better attended, and their genuine Ends more carefully purſued?</p>
            <p>In a Word, Do our <hi>Court-Houſes</hi> yet ſtand, through the ſparing Goodneſs of God? And ſhall not our civil Affairs be carried on more in the "Fear of an <hi>Oath?</hi>—Will not our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> do wiſely, to apply the late Viſitation as a Motive to greater Care of Fidelity in the Diſcharge of their reſpective Truſts; eſpecially in the Execution of thoſe good and wholſome Laws
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007665_0050_102DBAF560FCB7A8"/>
made againſt Profanity and Vice?—And ſhould not all of us be "put in Mind to obey Magiſtrates," in every ſuch Caſe, "not for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake?<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a judicious and ſeaſonable Clauſe in the excellent Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by his Honour Lieut. Governour PHIPS, appointing the late Day of Humiliation and Prayer,—which deſerves to be remembred:—<q>I take this Occaſion, to require <hi>all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Civil Authority</hi> to uſe their utmoſt Endeavour, that the Laws for puniſhing <hi>Immorality</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> be ſtrictly obſerved, and to take effectual Care, that all Breaches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be duly puniſhed. And I earneſtly recommend to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>every Age,</hi> and <hi>every Order,</hi> Amendment of Life; a due Senſe of their entire Dependence upon the Favour of GOD for every Moment of their Lives, which being thus remarkably preſerved, they are more than ever bound to devote to his Service.</q>—May all that bear the Sword of Juſtice, and all ſubject to it, hear theſe united Calls from GOD and Man.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Sure I am, there is great Occaſion; from the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity of the Times, for all to join their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote a Reformation of Manners: and we have had a loud Call to this, in the late awful Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If we hear and obey, we may hope, that God will "repent him of the Evil he may have thought to bring upon us." But otherwiſe, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſtill angry Viſitations from his provoked Juſtice, and Deſtruction in the End. If we go on to abuſe his Patience, we may look, that he will do more terrible Things in Righteouſneſs; that he will not only ſhake our Earth, but tear up its Foundations; diſſolve both Church and State, &amp; bury an impenitent People in one common Grave of Deſolation and Ruin.—"Thou <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which art lifted up to Heaven, ſhalt be brought down to Hell.—"Be inſtructed, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> leſt my Soul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited.—"Ye that make mention of the LORD, for <hi>Zion'</hi>s ſake keep not Silence, and give him no Reſt, until he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Praiſe in the Earth, until the Righteouſneſs

thereof go forth as Brightneſs, and the Salvation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as a Lamp that burneth."—The Divine Author of an Earthquake is equal to this grand Effect. He is ſuperiour to all Difficulties. He can remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Guilt, and ſhake down the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan. He can demoliſh the Kingdom of Darkneſs, eſtabliſh and advance the Kingdom of his dear SON. He can effect the moſt glorious &amp; happy ſpiritual Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and that very ſuddenly. But "for this he will be enquired of, to do it for us.—O let all the Friends of our <hi>Zion</hi> unite their fervent Cries to the GOD of all Grace, that "the SPIRIT may be poured from on high.—This, and this only, will bring on a ſettled and proſperous State of Things; and thus ſhall "Glory dwell in our Land.</p>
            <p>To conclude,</p>
            <p>Thoſe Divine Viſitations with the Earthquake, we have been meditating on, ſhould remind us of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> haſtning upon us.—Though we ſhould never ſee another Viſitation in that Way; yet there is "the Viſitation of all Men" certainly awaiting us. "There is a Time to die;" and "the Grave is ready for us.—By Sickneſs, or Accidents, more common than the Earthquake, and equally irreſiſtible, Death may arreſt us. Then the Earth will be opened for us, and we muſt go down into the Pit of Corruption. Nor know we the Day of our Death. It may come as <hi>ſuddenly</hi> as an Earthquake. And Oh how deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Caſe, if ſurpriſed in our Sins, unprepared for ſo great a Change!—We look alſo for <hi>eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and we are told, <hi>"That Day</hi> will come as a Thief in the Night; will come upon Men <hi>unawares;</hi> even as the Flood of old did upon the World of the Ungodly, and as the Vengeance upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> in a Day when they looked not for it.—"Be ye therefore ready, leſt the LORD coming <hi>ſuddenly</hi> ſhould find you ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007665_0052_102DBAF91CF888D0"/>
—Oh the Conſternation and Horror, which in an Inſtant unprepared Sinners will be thrown into, at the unexpected coming of the Day of GOD! You may ſee a faint Reſemblance of it in the Deſcriptions given by the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. 19, &amp;c. and by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 15, &amp;c. which I leave you to read at your Leaſure.—Verily "the Day of the LORD JESUS," when he ſhall "be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire," though it will be a joyful Day to "his Saints, in whom he then will be admired and glorified," yet will it be a terrible Day to Chriſtleſs Sinners, whom he will then "take Vengeance on, and puniſh with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction;" which alſo will be "ſwift De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;" and attended with every aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
            <p>O let us all now be "perſuaded by the Terror of the Lord," to ſeek an Intereſt in Chriſt; and be concerned to ſecure Him for our Friend, who is to be our Judge. So ſhall we have Peace in Life, Hope in Death, and Boldneſs in the Day of Judgment; that great Day of GOD our SAVIOUR, when the Earth ſhall open, not to ſwallow up the Living, but to give up the Dead; when "all that are in their Graves ſhall come forth; they that have done Good, to the Reſurrection of Life, but they that have done Evil, to the Reſurrection of Damnation:" When "the Heavens ſhall be diſſolved and the Earth burnt up, with all the Works therein.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Nevertheleſs we, according to his Promiſe, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.—"Wherefore, Beloved, ſeeing ye look for ſuch Things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in Peace, without Spot and blameleſs. And account the Long-ſuffering of our LORD Salvation.—To HIM be Glory and Dominion for ever. AMEN.</p>
