            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE I had laſt the pleaſure of writing to you from this city, in which I gave you a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſcription of the lands in this ſtate, and in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, together with the mode of ſettlement, and the manner in which they are to be purchaſed, I have made a tour through the province of Upper Canada, and ſhall endeavor to give you a particular and impartial account of that country, ſo far as I have travelled through it, with its laws, government, and commercial advantages. In my letter from Albany, I mentioned that I went to that city by water, from thence I proceeded to Schenectady, fifteen miles by ſtage, Schenectady is a handſomely ſituated little town on the banks of the Mohawk river, inhabited moſtly by Low.

Dutch, but from the appearance of the place, one would imagine it a deſerted village, the houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally old, ſmall, and moſtly ſhut up, but ſurrounded by the fineſt flats of interva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l land you can poſſibly imagine, which continue to the ſource of that river. The deſolate appearance of this town was accounted for to me by the current of Indian trade turning down the River St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſince the revolution. It has, however, the proſpect of becoming a flouriſhing place, ere long, by the vaſt increaſe of the ſettlements to the weſt of it, the produce of which muſt centre there.—At this place I took an open boat, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigated by three men, in which I paſſed to Lake Ontario, without any other interruption than two ſhort portages, one at the little falls of half a mile, round which they are now cutting a canal; the other of one mile, at Fort Stanvix, about one hundred miles weſt of Schenectady; at which place we leave the Mohawk river, and deſcend the current to Oſwego, one hundred miles more to the weſt, where the Britiſh hold a poſt at the entrance of Lake Ontario, commanded by a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from whom I received every mark of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and attention. A Cuſtom-Houſe Officer is alſo ſtationed there to prevent an illicit trade being carried on between the United States and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Colonies. No merchandize i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, nor furs out,

are permitted to paſs this poſt, without a paſſport from the Governor of Upper Canada; but ſettlers moving into that province to reſide, are permitted indiſcriminately to paſs with all utenſils of huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, houſhold furniture, and ſtores for their own consumption. —The high prices which hatters' fur at preſent command in the United States is the only inducement I conceive for ſmuggling paſt that poſt, for except a few articles imported from the Eaſt Indies, I found the retail ſhops at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton and Niagara, ſelling as low, and many articles, particularly woolens, lower than in the City of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>From Oſwego, veſſels ſail to Niagara, Kingſton, and any other port on the lake; but ſettlers more frequently continue along the ſouth ſhore of the lake to Niagara, about one hundred and twenty miles in the ſame open boats which bring them hither, as they are generally manned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But finding a veſſel here ready to ſail for Kingſton, I diſmiſſed my boatmen, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in her for that place, about twelve hours fail.</p>
            <p>

Laurence, the banks of which are thick ſettled down to Lake St. Francois, where the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Upper and Lower Canada are divided. This river is navigable for veſſels of one hundred tons, and upwards, to Oſwegatche, ſeventy miles below Kingſton, but veſſels ſeldom go down the river, as the fort which is at Kingſton ſerves as a depoſit for all the public ſtores, proviſion, and merchandiſe for the upper poſts.</p>
            <p>The land immediately about Kingſton, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by valuable quarries of lime-ſtone, and through all the ſettlements round it are plenty of thin valuable ſtones, which are conſidered by the inhabitants rather as an acquiſition than detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their plantations. The moſt flouriſhing part of this ſettlement is round the bay of Kenty, the ſoil of which is rich, eaſy worked, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces from one to three crops, without any other cultivation than what is done by the iron tooth harrow, and yields from 20 to 30 buſhels of wheat to the acre; thoſe lands are ſomewhat heavy timbered, having vaſt quantities of the ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maple, hickory and baſs wood, and in ſome places white pines of a ſurpriſing height, but where the latter grows the land is more ſandy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is warm, ſweet land, it is not ſo ſtony as the maple or oak land. This bay is ſeventy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029236_0007_0FDFF661E649ECF8"/>
miles in length, beginning about twenty miles South Weſt from Kingſton, leaving a neck of land from two to twelve miles wide, between it and the lake, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which is ſettled, and round the whole bay ſo thick ſettled, that their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements already meet, and form the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a beautiful old ſettled country. This bay and the creeks emptying into it, abound in great quantities of wild fowl, and fiſh of various kinds.</p>
            <p>From Kingſton I proceeded to Niagara, in a ſchooner of upwards of one hundred tons burthen acroſs this little ſea of freſh water; a ſea it may juſtly be called, for we were a great part of the time for three days out of ſight of the land; though paſſages have been made in twenty hours; we enter the Niagara river between the fort and the town called Newark, with a beautiful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of both.</p>
            <p>The fort ſtands in a commanding ſituation, on a point formed by the junction of the river and lake, upon the Eaſt ſide of the river, and is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fortification, in good repair, and well gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned.</p>
            <p>The mouth of this river affords a ſafe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious harbour, ſufficiently large for half the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh navy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:029236_0008_0FDFF66384A2A928"/>
The town of Newark is ſituate in latitude 43 north, on the Weſt banks of the river, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the lake about a mile, enjoying in the ſummer the freſh breezes from this little ſea, in almoſt every direction, plentifully ſupplied with fiſh at all ſeaſons of the year. In the winter here are caught by ſeines, quantities of white fiſh, which ſeem to be peculiar to that river, they are generally from two to ſix pounds weight, and are considered the beſt fiſh in the lakes; beſides there ſturgeon, baſs, and many other excellent fiſh, are in great plenty; ſalmon are taken in all the creeks round the lake; theſe varieties of fiſh are not only eſteemed a luxury, but a great aſſiſtance to new beginners in ſupporting their families, many laying in a half dozen barrels or more for their winter's uſe.</p>
            <p>The land about the town of Newark for many miles, though not ſo good as the land further back is well inhabited each way upwards of fifty miles around. —What gave me a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge of this ſettlement was, being intimate with the Surveyor-General, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of liberal education, good information, and indefatigable in the duties of his office, by which means he has collected notes, from the different field-books of his Deputies, of the ſoil, timber,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029236_0009_0FDFF6669D234250"/>
and ſtreams, of all that country; and ſuch parts as I went over I found his notes very correct, and by no means exaggerated. In many places there is little more for the farmer to do, than cut a ſufficiency of timber to fence his fields, girdle or ring the remainder, and put in the harrow, for in few places only is it neceſſary to make uſe of the plough, till the ſecond or third crop, there being little or no under bruſh; yet in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there is beautiful white pine, oak and black walnut timber; ſugar wood which is alſo found here in plenty mixed with beach, hickory, and baſs wood.</p>
            <p>At Newark reſides the Governor whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is well known in England, and is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held here in high eſtimation. —Here are alſo moſt of the principle officers of government, beſides many other gentlemen of reſpectability who form a very intelligent and agreeable ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Beſides Newark there are ſeveral important ſituations in this part of the province, which bid fair to become places of conſequence, the moſt important of which are, the landing places at each end of the portage, Fort Erie, the head of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029236_0010_0FDFF66AB184F8B0"/>
Lake Ontario, and York, <hi>called</hi> by the natives Torento.</p>
            <p>The lower landing or Queenſton is about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles up the river from Newark, where the veſſels diſcharge their cargoes, and take in furrs collected from three to one thouſand five hundred miles back, there have I ſeen four veſſels of ſixty and one hundred tons burden unloading at the ſame time, and ſometimes not leſs than ſixty waggons loaded in a day, which loads they carry ten miles to the upper landing place or Chipawa Creek, three miles paſt the great falls. This port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is an encreaſing ſource of wealth to the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for many miles round, who carry from twenty to thirty hundred weight for which they get one ſhilling and eight pence N. Y. currency, per hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight, and generally load back with furrs &amp;c.—From Chipawa the merchandize is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in batteaux to Fort Erie a diſtance of eighteen miles and are ſhipped there on board of veſſels for Detroit and Michilamackinac. —Detroit I was told was a pleaſant country, though a low and marſhy ſoil, more noted for its furr trade, than its agriculture.</p>
            <p>At the head of Lake Ontario, about fifty miles weſt from Newark a ſmall town is laid out and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029236_0011_0FDFF66C59E739C0"/>
public ſtores are building, being a central place between Newark, York and Detroit, from thence a road of twenty two miles to the grand river is cut our and croſſes that river about fifty miles above its entrance into Lake Erie, and continues in a ſouthern direction to the river La Trenche, now called the <hi>Thames,</hi> which empties itſelf into Lake St. Clair, about twenty miles above Detroit. Settlements are making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> road, and along the river <hi>Thames</hi> partial ones are made for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of eighty or ninety miles in length. —On theſe two rivers are extenſive open flatts of land equal to thoſe of the Mohawk river, on which may be cut a ſufficiency of hay for many thouſand head of cattle yearly; the lands on this road are of an excellent quality and in many places light timbered, in others covered with thriſty oak, black walnut, ſugar maple, beach and lindar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>York</hi> formerly <hi>Torento</hi> is ſituate on the beſt harbour round the lake, oppoſite Niagara, and about forty miles diſtance acroſs the lake, but round by land near one hundred miles, along the ſhore of which great quantities of fiſh are caught; a town is here in great forwardneſs, and ſhould the ſeat of government be removed from Newark thence, as is contemplated, it will ſoon become a flouriſhing place. —From this a road is cut out

acroſs to Lake Simcoe, or the Rice Lakes thirty three miles, the outlet of which empties itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Lake Huron a diſtance of forty five miles from Lake Simcoe, thirty ſix miles in length; this rout affords an eaſy communication with Michilimac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinac. —From York to that lake, a tier of lotts of two hundred acres each, is laid out on each ſide of this road called <hi>Dundas-ſtreet,</hi> granted on the expreſs condition of building and improving on them, within one year from the time they are taken up; many of theſe are now built upon and occupied.</p>
            <p>On the eaſt ſide and joining the rear of theſe lotts is a ſettlement of near one hundred German families, on an excellent tract of land, much of which is open, white oak woods; theſe Germans came on this ſummer, furniſhed with every thing neceſſary to make their ſituation comfortable and enable them to improve their land to advantage, and no doubt in a ſhort time will make a fine ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; they are ſupported by a company who have liberally ſupplied them.

If this generous example was with equal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit followed by a few more companies, it would add to the population of the country, more than any other mode yet purſued. —There is ſtill plenty of vacant lands of the beſt kind, and ſuch as ſhew a diſpoſition to ſettle and improve them, meet from the Governor every encouragement they merit, who makes liberal grants to all ſuch as do actually bring on ſettlers, and prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſirous of promoting the intereſt of the country, the whole of which is well adapted for raiſing wheat, Indian corn, and other ſummer grain; flax (where the land has borne a few other crops) ſucceeds remarkably well, and the face of the whole country yields graſs in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; hops of a good quality grow here ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, alſo a variety of wild fruits ſuch as plumbs, mulberry, blackberry, ſtrawberry, raſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry and grapes. —Orchards are in great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, for the age of the ſettlement, ſome of which already bear fruit. —Peaches, cherries, and currants are plenty among all the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers. —The farmers raiſe great quantity of pork, without any other expence than a little indian corn, for a few weeks previous to killing, and often kill their hogs out of the woods, well fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on nuts; in many places ſalt ſprings have been diſcovered, and ſome of them already work.

ed to ſuch advantage that in all probability that article, which generally comes heavy in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of a country, may in a ſhort time be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded here, as low as in many of the old ſettled places in the United States.—Many valuable ſtreams for water works, run in every direction through this country; and upon ſome of them are mills built, which prove very lucrative to the owners, particularly ſaw-mills, from the quantity of good timber and great demand of boards, as more buildings are going on than carpenters and maſons can be found to finiſh: ſtones being ſcarce, bricks are generally uſed in maſon work.</p>

Some of whom have come in their waggons quite from North Carolina, but as there is a ſpace of countiy, for about ſeventy miles, between Niagara and the Geneſee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029236_0015_0FDFF675F88FB898"/>
where the roads are not ſufficiently open for waggons, they tranſport them from the mouth of that river to Niagara in boats. However this obſtruction will probably be ſoon removed, when it will be a pleaſant jaunt to get into a carriage at Niagara, and drive to this city, which may be effected without difficulty, in about two weeks, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by ſleighs in the winter.—The mode of ſettlement generally purſued here, and which ſeems beſt calculated to ſave expence, is by two, three or more men coming on in the ſummer, who throw up a log houſe each, put in a field of wheat, and return for their familier, which they bring on the following ſpring, by the rout be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed pad Oſwego, if by water; but ſuch as come by land, bring their families as far as the mouth of Geneſee river, there take boat, and ſend their cattle by land. This country from the reduction till the year 1790, was included in the province of Quebec, and from the year 1774, the civil adminiſtration was veſted in a Governor and Legiſlative Council, at that time beſt adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ideas of the people, who were moſt entirely French, and from prejudice, preferred that form of government, being moſt analogous to what they had been accuſtomed to prior to the conqueſt of Canada, but at the concluſion of the late diſſentions between Great Britain and Ame.

            <p>In the year 1790, the wiſdom of the Britiſh government, was eminently evinced in dividing that large country, into two ſeparate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and granting to each a conſtitution, on the moſt liberal and diſintereſted principles, a conſtitution for freedom and the juſt rights of man, perhaps unequalled in the hiſtoric page, with all the advantages, enjoyed by the Britiſh colonies in America previous to the revolution, and with many additional, the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having renounced for ever the right of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. —Here no man's property for any cauſe whatever, is taxed, directly or indirectly; the Britiſh government moſt generouſly paying for even the ſurveying of the lands, and the whole ſupport of the civil eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>You will naturally wonder, how with all theſe advantages this country has hitherto eſcaped the

notice and keen obſervations of Land Speculators, and the elogeums of Pamphleteers too frequently the hired and uſeful aſſiſtant of the former claſs of men, but this I have found is accounted for on the beſt of principles. The Indians being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the original proprietors of the ſoil, and it even has and continues to be the policy of the Britiſh government to extinguiſh their right, by fair and equitable purchaſes. Large purchaſes of this kind has been made from time to time by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as the population of the country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and as yet there is not a ſingle inſtance of diſſatisfaction on the part of the Indians; having thus liberally paid them for their lands, very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous terms are held out to actual ſettlers, (the only claſs which at firſt can enrich any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) who get a grant of two hundred acres each. However for the encouragement of men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the means of improving on a larger ſcale, by proper application they get a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome additional quantity. By this means the ſubſtantial farmer becomes the inhabitant, and large tracts to the detriment of any country, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lie waſte.</p>

In ſhort, ſir, it would ſwell a letter to too great a bulk to give a more minute account of the local laws that have been already made for the public good, ſuffice it to ſay, that, with reſpect to that government and its laws, its adminiſtration is conducted with every wiſh and attention to render the ſituation of thoſe who may ſettle under it comfortable and happy, being neither land tax, quit-rent, or any other tax whatever, excepting the county rates, to be paid by the freeholders, for the regulation of their internal police.</p>

Goods on impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being liable to no duty; which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly give this country a vaſt advantage over the new ſettlements that I deſcribed in my former letters; indeed nature points out this place as the emporium of trade for the people inhabiting both ſides of theſe lakes and rivers emptying into them as far as they extend to the weſt. From Montreal <hi>boats</hi> called by the Canadians batteaux, containing twenty five barrels bulk, are worked by four men to Kingſton, a diſtance of nigh two hundred miles up the river in the courſe of ſix or eight days, and again return in three, loaded with furs, pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh, and other produce of the country.—Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, generally ſchooners, receive the goods at Kingſton, and convey them in a ſhort time to the landing or Queenſton, below the great fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Michigan. The expences incurred during all this rout are comparatively triſling, as you will obſerve there is but one portage, and that only ten miles in the courſe of this communication. And when one reflects on the temperate climate, rich ſoil, And other natural advantages of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior country, you anticipate a great population in a ſhort time.—The ſtreights of Niagara, from its peculiar ſituation, being the channel through which all the produce of the vaſt country above muſt paſs, is looked forward to as a place of the firſt conſequence, and where a farmer will at all times find a market for his produce, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port being eaſy from thence to the Atlantic.— Here have I ſeen with amazement that famed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract, which exceeds every deſcription I have ever heard of it, but it would be idle in me to pretend to give you an idea of it—It ſtrikes the eye with more grandeur and ſublimity than the pen can convey.—Amongſt many other natural curioſities, a ſpring, about two miles above theſe falls, attracts the attention of the curious; emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a gas, or inflammable air, which, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a pipe, and a flame applied to it, will boil the water of a tea-kettle in fifteen minutes:— whether this may hereafter be applied by machine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to uſeful purpoſes, time will determine.</p>

It was lately diſcovered in clearing away and burning: the bruſh under the bank of the river, to erect a mill, and was obſerved after the bruſh was conſumed to burn for days together, to the great aſtoniſhment of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>About three hundred miles weſt of this is Fort Detroit, ſituate on the eaſt ſide of the ſtreights, between Lake Erie and Huron, around which, a French ſettlement was eſtabliſhed before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the province, but attending more to the Indian trade than agriculture, made but little progreſs as farmers. The Engliſh ſettlements lately begun on the oppoſite ſhore are already in a higher ſtate of cultivation, however the French have line orchards, from which Niagara is at preſent ſupplied with cyder and apples. About one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles weſt from Detroit lies a valuable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on the waters emptying into the Miſſiſippi, now unhappily conteſted by the United States and the natives of the ſoil.</p>
            <p>To the northward of Detroit about three hundred and fifty miles, lies Fort Michillmacki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac, on an iſland between Lake Huron and Michi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, is about five miles round, and an entire bed of gravel incapable of cultivation, but moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for being the general depot and grand rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

of all the Indian traders, who meet in the month of June from every quarter, deliver their furs and receive their outfits for the enſuing year. Spaniſh ſettlements many miles down the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi are ſupplied with Britiſh goods through this channel, to much greater advantage than from New Orleans, where the rapids of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſippi oppoſe almoſt unſurmountable difficulties in aſcending it.</p>
            <p>This fort, the forts of Detroit, Niagara, and Oſwego, fell within the United States, when the lines of ſeparation were drawn, at the treaty of peace, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty three; fort Miami, which was built by the Britiſh lately, is alſo within thoſe lines.— Previous to that peace, ſtores of depoſit had been occupied at the foot of the Miami rapids, where the fort now ſtands, and the annual preſents to the Indians, which they have long been in the habits of receiving from the Britiſh government, were there iſſued. This place was prudently cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for thar purpoſe, in order to prevent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians from coming through the ſettlement, croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about and mixing with the troops at Detroit, where the too frequent uſe of ſpiritous liquors would have occaſioned numerous quarrels and ac

cidents, which might have terminated fatal to that friendly intercourſe and good underſtanding which has ever prevailed between the Engliſh and the natives in America.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, have I ſaid little reſpecting the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigines of this country. —Various are the opinions entertained by different people, and different hiſtorians have riſked conjectures how this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent was originally peopled; their own ideas of it are not leſs curious than extraordinary. They do not believe, nor have rhey the ſmalleſt veſtige of traditional memorial to induce them to believe, but that they are a diſtinct race of men from the whites, ſome of the moſt intelligent amongſt them will at this day relate in detail the natural and original hiſtory of themſelves and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent they live upon. —They fully believe in a good and evil ſpirit, and in a future ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, and have certain times in the year for their particular modes of worſhip, when they more generally endeavor to appeaſe and avert the wrath of the bad, than invoke the good Spirit, to which, however, after favorable crops, a good hunt, or ſucceſs in war, they, in a ſervent manner, return thanks. —They ſay that the face of the globe was firſt covered with one great water, in which the turtle was the principal
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029236_0025_0FDFF690626C83E8"/>
inhabitant. That the Great Spirit cauſed this turtle to grow to ſuch a ſize that the waters could no longer float it, and in conſequence, it became ſtationary, continuing to grow until the moſs and rubbiſh collecting on his back, became a ſoil, and ſhot forth herbs, buſhes, and at length trees, and now forms this great iſland (as they term it) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were created a diſtinct race of men, and that the Great Spirit made, after them, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of beaſts and birds of the foreſt, for their food and uſe, (from the firſt twelve of which they took the names of their twelve tribes,) and that theſe are as different in their kind, from thoſe given by the Great Spirit to the white people, for their uſe, as they are themſelves from us.— That they encreaſed in ſtrength and numbers, till the white people came amongſt them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced their habits, with the uſe of ſtrong drink, <hi>to which they</hi> juſtly impute their degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
            <p>When the feeling mind reſlects on the former ſituation of theſe credulous people; the various deception practiſed on them under the maſk of friendſhip, the artleſs, and faithful attachment they bear to the white people where they are treated with, upon ſeeming principles of juſtice
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029236_0026_0FDFF694244AA258"/>
and candor, it muſt truly ſympathize with them in their preſent gloomy proſpects.</p>
            <p>This people who were two centuries ago poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the whole of this vaſt continent, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſpontaneouſly every comfort of life, without rivals in the enjoyment of it, now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back ſtep by ſtep, to the laſt ſpot of their fertile ſoil, and that conteſted. Conteſted by the very people whom they have been led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as their brothers, fathers and protectors. — Prejudice from education, habit, and particular ſituations in life may warp the minds of the beſt of men, but a virtuous and penetrating mind, will always eſtimate in a proper degree, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ties they have a claim to on us, if it is only from our ſuperior cultivation of mind and manners. Would it not therefore argue a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of virtue, and redound more to the honor of humanity, for Chriſtians, bordering on the remains of their country, to turn their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the civilization of theſe people, than to endeavor by art and arms to extirpate them from the face of a country, which they conceive to have been given by the Great Spirit to them alone. It is idle to ſay that people of their quick ideas, and lively imagination, are incapable of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilization, for where education, and a proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

to their morals has been beſtowed, there are proofs to the contrary.—Inſtance Joſeph Brant a full blooded Indian, who having received an early education, though reſiding ſtill with the Indians, is much the gentleman, eaſy in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, mild and friendly in his diſpoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and methodical in his whole deportment, and has by his good examples, brought many of his nation into a regular ſyſtem of huſbandry, and a decent way of living in their families.</p>
            <p>Thus have I now as generally made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this great country, as correctly as my ſhort ſtay in it would admit of; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude this without giving you a piece of information, equally new to every body here as to me.</p>
            <p>For many years paſt adventurers have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſucceſs to croſs to the Pacific Ocean. The honor of this arduous taſk was left to a Mr. Alexander Mac Kenzie, a partner in the North-weſt fur company, who lately returned by the way of the lakes, having fully accompliſhed the object of his undertaking in the courſe of two years, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the Continent of America to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of weſt, over vaſt mountains covered with ice, which obliged him to make new canoes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029236_0028_0FDFF698EA27EE60"/>
he had the waters in his favor. On his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival on this coaſt, ſeven weeks fail from Canton in China, and 2 degrees to the north of Nootka Sound, he ſound the Indians without fire-arms, but furniſhed with ſome cloathing and ornaments, principally Spaniſh manufacture. The Indians accompanying him were not underſtood by thoſe on that coaſt, and appeared to be perfect ſtrangers to one another. It was with difficulty he could reconcile them to him as a white man, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as he underſtood, of ſome injury given them by people of his color, a few days before that time. Theſe are ſuppoſed to have been the Americans from the port of New York, who had touched there in their trade with China.</p>
            <p>After remaining a few days and making the neceſſary observations, he returned and brought along with him ſome valuable ſkins of the ſea offer, and other natural curioſities, peculiar to that coaſt; but as the gentleman himſelf has it in idea to go ſoon to London, I have little doubt but he will meet with the reward due to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, and give to the world an account of the wild and uninhabited tract he traverſed.</p>
