            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> great Obstruction that Regular Singing has of late met with from a great Number of Perſons, who being Ignorant of the Uſe &amp; Excellency thereof, Vehemently decry it, and Violently Oppoſe it; (from whence has enſued great Contention &amp; Diſcord among us;) has Occaſioned the following Diſcourſe; which is only the fruit of or few ſpare Hours. Since the Writing hereof, I have ſeen ſeveral Tracts about Singing, viz <hi>The Accompilſhed Singer;</hi> the <hi>Sweat Pſalmiſt of Iſrael;</hi> and, <hi>A Diſcourſe about the Reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it may be of ſervice to inlighten thoſe that thro' Ignorance decry all Rule, and applaud Singing by Rote as the good Old Way; and if it may help to Reconcile Differing Minds; and for the future prevent Diſorder in the Worſhip of GOD; GOD will herein be glorifyed, and my end will be obtained: and I ſhall Rejoyce, who deſire to be for ever found a Friend to Peace and Truth, and a Mourner for the contrary.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Singing of Pſalms is a part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, to be performed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, in their Publick Aſſemblies,<note n="†" place="bottom">not Including singing in Private.</note> where they meet to Worſhip Him, is a truth Generally Received; and the Practiſe of the Reformed Churches makes it fully Evident. That this is not only a Modern Practice, but was in uſe among the People of GOD in Elder Ages, is as evident, the Worſhip of GOD both in the time of the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, and the New was not performed without it. In this Chapter we have an Account of a Grear Solemnity in the time of the Old Teſtament; It was that of <hi>David's</hi> bringing the Ark of GOD from the Houſe of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> to the Place he had Prepared for it And among other things there mentioned, we are told in the 16 <hi>verſe,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> ſpake to the Chief of the <hi>Levites,</hi> to appoint their Brethren to be the Singers, &amp;c. And in the Succeeding <hi>verſes,</hi> we have an Account of the Manner of that Performance. In the <hi>verſe</hi> wherein the Text is, 'tis ſaid, <hi>And Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Pſalmody is
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002614_0004_0FDB758017C29C70"/>a part of Divine Worſhip, which ought to be performed Regularly</hi> Inſtruction and Skill Imply Rule. <hi>2ly That it ought to be practiſed in Publick Conventions for the Worſhip of GOD.</hi> The Exerciſe the Text Relates to was in ſuch a one. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expreſſed, wherein obſerve <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Perſon Inſtructing about the Song, who had the overſight thereof, <hi>viz. Chenaniah. Secondly.</hi> The Reaſon why he had the overſight thereof, <hi>viz Becauſe he was Skillful.</hi> From Hence ariſes this Doctrinal Truth.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That to the Right or Regular Performance of the Duty of Singing Pſalms, in the Publick Worſhip of GOD, Good Skill is Neceſſary, and Required in (at leaſt ſome of) them that Perform it</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay <hi>[ſome of them]</hi> becauſe we find here an Inſtructor, whence it follows that ſome were Inſtructed; All are not capable to lead herein. It cannot be Expected that whole Congregations ſhould be Skillful; but it is Neceſſary that there be ſome and ſuch a Number (at leaſt) as may Govern the Pſalmody, and be a Sufficient Guide to the Unskillful that the Service may be Regular, and becoming ſo Sacred an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and a pleaſing Offering to the GOD of order, who requires as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.

Thoſe that by Natural Impediments are Rendred uncapable of Performing that Duty or Exerciſe with Skill, may yet do it with Grace, and be accepted of GOD therein: and are not faulty when they do their beſt as thoſe are, that have Power and Means to attain Skill, but Neglect to Improve them.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Secondly and Affirmatively,</hi> BY Skill here is intended.</p>
            <p>FIRST. KNOWLEDGE of, and Ability to Manage the Tunes, in which the Pſalms are to be Sung according to the Rules thereof; ſo as there may be <hi>Concord, Harmony</hi> and good <hi>Melody</hi> therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Play Skillfully,</hi> or do well in Playing, or rather Singing <hi>i. e.</hi> Make good Muſick or Melody, and in this the Skill of <hi>Chenaniah</hi> was Imployed. Singing Implies <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Melody.</hi> Every Pleaſant Noiſe or Voice is not Singing in this ſenſe; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19 <hi>Making Melody</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.3. Thanksgiving and the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Melody,</hi> by which is meant Harmony, and a Sweet Muſical utterence of the Holy Song. In this <hi>Knowledge</hi> is more Particularly Implyed or Included.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> AN Acquaintance with the Rules of Muſick, the different Keys and the various Tones, Notes or sounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the Chords and Diſcords, how to Riſe and Fall Gradually, or paſs from Chord to Chord in an agreeable manner, how to keep Time, and to make proper Cloſes, and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> A Muſical Ear, or an Ability to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different Sounds in Muſick: A Quick Perception of what is Diſagreeable, Jarring and Immuſical. This the Unskilful diſcern not, and therefore it is that they are ſo in Love with, what they Ignorantly call the <hi>Good Old Way,</hi> and even Idolize it, while they Reject and Decry the <hi>Real Good Old Way</hi> of Rule and Order. But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> A Tuneable Voice, which may be Managed in an Agreeable manner, by the Direction of the Notes, to the making good Muſick or Melody. This to ſome is in a manner Natural; while others acquire it with great Pains and Diligence in Practice, but is Neceſſary to that Skill we are ſpeaking of. As in any Craft, tho' a Man may have the Knowledge of all the parts and particulars thereof; yet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he can uſe his Hands Ingeniouſly to do the Work of it, he cannot be ſaid to be Skillful therein: So Knowledge of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002614_0007_0FDB7586B63409A0"/>the Rules and the Notes and Characters of Muſick will not render a Man Skilful, Except he can Govern his Voice to make agreeable Sounds. Good Knowledge of Rules with an agreeable Dexterity to Practice them makes an Artiſt, and ſuch as have attained theſe may be ſaid to be Skilful indeed.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. BY Skill here may be intended, an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency therein, and a Superiour Degree of Knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. In the Sacred Muſick there were <hi>Levites</hi> appointed for ſeveral Duties, and ſome to <hi>Ply</hi> and <hi>ſet them forward</hi> and to <hi>be over</hi> the Reſt. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.21. and theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e ſuch as Excelled in the Art of Singing, to whom Sundry Pſalms were Directed and Intituled, that by their care and direction they might be Sung Excellently unto the End. There were in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſome <hi>Levites Singers</hi> that attended thereunto, and had no other charge; (ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.33.) as <hi>Aynſworth</hi> on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. has noted. Tho' Skill be neceeſſary in all, in ſome Degree yet not alike in all; thoſe that appoint the Tunes, and lead therein ſhould be capable to ſuit them to the matter of the Pſalms Sung, whither of Prayer, Confeſſion. Lamentation or Praiſe; ſome of the Tunes are more <hi>Chearful,</hi> and ſuited to Pſalms of Praiſe; others more <hi>Melancholly,</hi> and ſuited to Pſalms of Prayer, Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhould be Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is manifeſt by the Titles<note n="†" place="bottom">See Aynſworth on the Titles of theſe Pſalms.</note> of the Pſalms (many of 'em) in ſome of which the <hi>Tunes</hi> were Directed, or at leaſt the Particular <hi>Keys</hi> on which they were Compoſed, as in Pſalm 46. <hi>Title; a Song upon Alamoth</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Virgins,</hi> and this Pſalm ſeems to be ſung by the <hi>Virgins</hi> at <hi>Solomons</hi> Wedding, and on the <hi>Treble</hi> alſo, becauſe ſhrill like a <hi>Virgins</hi> Voice, And Pſal. 9. Title, <hi>To the Chief Muſician upon Muth-Labben;</hi> this as Referred to the Muſick ſeems to be a Tune on the Middle Key, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Medius,</hi> or <hi>Tenor,</hi> or <hi>Counter. Tenor,</hi> and Pſalm 12. Title — <hi>upon Sheminith,</hi> or upon the Eight, or as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Expoundeth it, the <hi>Eight Stringed Harp,</hi> or after the <hi>Eight,</hi> this is Referred to the Baſs, being <hi>Grave, Solid</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> when he fetch'd home GOD's Ark, appointed ſome <hi>Levites</hi> with <hi>Harps</hi> upon the Eight, for the Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of GOD, as in the <hi>verſe</hi> before the Text. Theſe things point out to us, that Rules were obſerved, Skill uſed, and a great Degree thereof Neceſſary to an agreeable Singing of the Praiſes of GOD. And here by the way 'tis worthy our
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002614_0008_0FDB758C597A1840"/>Notice, That the <hi>Levites</hi> were Leaders in this Holy Exerciſe, and theſe (many of 'em) Excell'd in Skill and Inſtructed others; which ſhows that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to be Skillful herein, and ſhould Inſtruct and lead their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which might be preventive of the Contentions and Differences that ariſe thereabout. I come now to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Enquiry which is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly. WHY is ſuch Skill Neceſſary in Pſalmody? or why ought it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Regular, and Performed with Skill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> RULE and Skill are Neceſſary, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Regard to <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency. This</hi> of its own Nature brings ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Dignity and Comlineſs to Divine Actions, as a Table and Cloath at the Communion, a Pulpit and Cloath or Cuſhion to a Sermon a clean and bright Baſon for the Water at Baptiſm, and the like. This is Required in all the parts of GOD's Worſhiip. As there are particular Rules given in the Scriptures in Caſes that Require them, ſo there are Rules that are more General: ſome things in the Worſhip of GOD are Directed, (as to the Subſtance thereof) by particular Rules, but the Circumſtances attending 'em are Directed only by General Rules; ſuch as the Rules of obſerving of Order, Decency and the like and theſe are left to Diſcretion, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order.</hi> Now without Rule and Skill, it is Impoſſible there ſhould be either Decency or Order, as will appear under the next Particular, which has a near Relation with this <hi>viz.</hi> That Rule and Skill are Neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly. TO Prevent Diſcord and Confuſion, in the Exerciſe of Singing.</hi> Theſe are contrary to GOD and to all Religion, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 33. <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion,</hi> &amp;c. It is for Order's ſake that the Pſalms are put into Metre. The <hi>Hebrew Poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> was doubtleſs accommodated to their way of Singing, and agreeable to Rule and Art: and our Pſalms are therefore Metrically Tranſlated, that they might be adapted to the Rules of Pſalmody. The Lines are meaſured by Syllables, which Requires ſo many particular Sounds, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Notes both as to their Length, and their Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Riſing and Falling. Now when Men are void of Skill herein, and unacquainted with the Rules thereof, it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhold agree to make <hi>one Sound,</hi> or an <hi>even Sound;</hi> ſuch an one as is diſcribed and was practiſed in 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 5 13. which is made by Riſing and Falling of the Voice coincidently
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002614_0009_0FDB758DC43A4A68"/>and in Union altogether, and duly keeping time, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>olation of Voice by which means a whole Congregation may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d to make but one Sound. Where there is no Rule, Mens Fancies (by which they are govern'd) are various; ſome affect a Quavering Flouriſh on one Note, and others upon another which (becauſe they are Ignorant of true Muſick or Melody) they account a Grace to the Tune; and while ſome affect a quicker Motion, others affect a ſlower, and draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out their Notes beyond all Reaſon, hence in Congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gations enſue Jarrs &amp; Diſcords, which make the Singing (rather) reſemble Howling: And their drawing our the Notes to ſuch a length is the occaſion of their Tittering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and down, as if the Tunes were all compoſed of Quavers, and make 'em reſemble Tunes to Dance to. <hi>Further,</hi> The want of Rule &amp; Skill is the reaſon why every Congregation almoſt has a different way of Singing. So that when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are occaſionally abroad, and joy with a Neighbouring Congregation in the Worſhip of GOD, they are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Singing with 'em. Thus 'tis often at Lectures, and eſpecially at Ordinations, where People of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations Meet together, their ways of Singing are ſo different, that 'tis not eaſy to know what Tune is Sung, and in Reality there is none: 'Tis rather Jumble &amp; Confuſion, Altho' they all, doubtleſs, intend ſome Tune or other, and it may be, the ſame yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> every one Sang a different Tune. This I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all which is owing to the want of Knowledge of the Rules of Singing and of Skill to improve and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ge 'em. Some indeed may imagine that Singing by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

"Muſick is an Art Divine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, by which a true Concordance of Sounds or Harmony is produced. There is a vaſt Myſtery therein.

There are likewiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">As to the Parts of Muſick; but as to the Nature thereof, there are but Two, Flat &amp; Sharp.</note> Three diſtinct Keys, or Septenaries, in which all the Parts of Muſick, be they never ſo many are contained; ſo that if more be added, it is but the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one of theſe; Theſe are mainly founded in, or chiefly compoſed from the Trial of the greater Concords of Notes, in the Three Septenaries, agreeing in one Harmony; ſo that one and the ſame Tune placed in theſe three, (or more) Keys may vary <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by falling in one Key, and at the ſame time Standing, or Riſing in the other, yet there will be an exact Concord &amp; Harmony, perfectly void of all Jars &amp; Diſcord, if agreeably placed according to the Rules of Deſcant or Counterpoint in Muſick: and being Sung thus, in Conſort, there will be extraordinary good Muſick, and a charming Melody, delightful to the Ear, and to the Heart very Raviſhing. As there are but Seven Sounds in Nature conſtituted, ſo I doubt not, but the Art of Modulation, or Managing of the Voice, ſo as to produce

            <p n="1">1. 'TIS Eaſier by practice to Order &amp; Govern an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Notes, than 'tis for the moſt of Man to Modulate their Voices; which makes Skill in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

2. IN the Church of Iſrael, Vocal Muſick was in uſe, as well as Inſtrumental, elſe to what End, were the Pſalme Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically compoſed, which are Divine Songs: The Title of one being, <hi>To the chieſ Muſician, a Pſalm or Song.</hi> And others of the like Import: And they were Sung by <hi>David,</hi> and others of the People of GOD. And Inſtruments could not Articulate the Sounds of the words of the Pſalmiſt; in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They praiſed God, in the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and Aſaph.</hi> Hence that Objection appears invalid.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>IF the Tunes (as the Pſalms are) were of Divine Inſpiration, or had we the Hebrew Tunes; then it were Reaſonable to conform to them and endeavour after Skill; but ſince we have not thoſe, we have no Rule at all: nor do we ſee Rule neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> THO' we have not the Notes of the Hebrew Pſalm Tunes, (which might for ought I know be divinely Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) (as ſome of the Titles of the Pſalms ſeem to Intimate) Or, the Prophets and Sacred Muſicians that directed them, were at leaſt aſſiſted, with the Divine Concourſe and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.2, 3. Yet this is no juſt Bar to our way of Regular Singing, or juſt Objection againſt our Tunes, or the Skill of our Compoſers, or Maſters of Muſick. If the Hebrew Tunes had been Neceſſary for us, they would, no doubt have been preſerved, with the Pſalms for our uſe; but the Hebrew Metres differ from the Metres of other Languages, which makes it inconvenient for us to uſe their Tunes, if we had them; which thoſe who are Skill'd in the Languages, do well know. And when the Pſalms were firſt Tranſlated into Engliſh Metre, fit to be Sung, Perſons of Skill in Muſick, Compoſed Tunes to fit the Verſion; ſome of which Tunes are affixed to our Pſalm books, and the Singing of them according to the Notes in our Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books, is by ſome commonly called, The New Way of Singing. And tho' the Hebrew Tunes have not been Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as we know of; yet the Skill, and general Rules of Singing, have doubtleſs been Retained (as well as of other Arts &amp; Sciences, <hi>Logick. Philoſophy,</hi> and the like) from Age to Age, 'till now: ſeveral of which are plainly diſcerned in the Scriptures, (as in the Book of <hi>Jeb,</hi> and ſome of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and more in the New. Teſtament:) And this is a ſufficient Warrant for us to improve our Skill in compoſing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002614_0014_0FDB759985FAF5C8"/>and uſing Tunes for Pſalms, which comes under the general Rule, and Command of Singing them with <hi>Decency &amp; Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>THIS way of Singing, ſeems to be derived from the</hi> French, <hi>and looks like Popery; and it ſeems to be Introductory there unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. SUPPOSE the Popiſh party to uſe it that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us, nor it is a juſt bar to our uſe of it; if we muſt forbear the uſe of any thing in the Worſhip of GOD, on this ſcore, we muſt forbear preaching or Believing the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Hypoſtatical Union, with many other Important Doctrines, of Chriſtianity, which they Believe, Preach, and pretend to Practice agreeable to, but do not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE thing is not true in Fact: for there is no Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, or other Popiſh Church, that Sing Maſs, as we by our Notes Sing Pſalms. And it may as well be Objected, that all Singing, is Popery becauſe they Sing Maſs, and the like, tho' in a Vaſtly different way of Singing: Singing of Pſalms Regularly, in Grave, Solemn Tunes, was from GOD, before Popery appear'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHILE theſe People, that thus object, pretend a mighty fear of Popery, they Really imbrace it, in one of its Main Tenets. 'Tis a Popiſh Tenet, that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the Mother of Devotion; and <hi>this</hi> they greatly Affect, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continue in; decrying all Rule &amp; Learning, and due Means of Knowledge; affecting only a blind Ruleleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Devotion. I mean, as to the Vocal part of it, in which yet, Exactneſs, and Rule &amp; Skill are Required, as has been proved.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>THE fourth Objection I take Notice of in ſome, is againſt the Tone uſed in Singing by Rule; and the particular Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables</hi> Mi Fa Sol La, <hi>uſed in Learning; ſome calling it a Negro Tone, others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>c squeaking Tone, unbeeoming the Worſhip of GOD, and the Syllables,</hi> Fa Sol La Mi, <hi>are the great obſtacles to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> THIS is a moſt Fooliſh Objection, not worthy the Anſwering; but ſince 'tis made I ſhall brieſly Anſwer it thus: Whether it be a Negro Tone or no, I am ſure it is an Engliſh Tone, and a Solemn Muſical Tone; a Clear, Smooth, Even Preaſant Tone; and by their pretending <hi>[Mi, Sol, Fa, La,]</hi> to be unbecoming the Worſhip of GOD, they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002614_0015_0FDB759B2433F990"/>muſt mean either that thoſe Syllables are <hi>in that form</hi> Sung in the Worſhip of GOD, or elſe that the Singing of Tunes only, is a part of GOD's Worſhip. If they mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e firſt, 'tis what is not intended or uſed in the Worſhip of GOD. If they mean the ſecond, it ſhews their great Ignorance, that Imagine a Tune only, a part which is only an Adjunct of Divine Worſhip. But that thoſe Syllables as pronounced, are not unbecoming the Worſhippers of GOD, appears in that among other Syllables the Pſalms in Engliſh do abound with them<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>Obj. 5. and laſt, <hi>I ſhall take notice of is this, The Apoſtle directs us, as in</hi> Eph. 5.19. <hi>and</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>To make Melody in our Hearts to the Lord, and to Sing with Grace in our Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and this is Sufficient whether we Regard Rule or no, as to the External Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> THE Apoſtles Intention here is not to Abrogate that Skill or Rule, which Skill is ſuppoſed or Implied in the words <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Melody;</hi> but to ſhew that there withall it was Neceſſary to Exerciſe Grace in order to Divine accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And I may ſay here about Singing with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Theſe ought ye to have done, and not leave the other undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Now Proceed to the APPLICATION.</p>
            <p>AND the Firſt uſe is of Information. <hi>Hence we learn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt, That it's the Duty of all Chriſtians to Labour after the Attainment of Good Skill, in Pſalmody, or Regular Singing.</hi> If Singing of Pſalms be a Duty Incumbent on all Perſons Capable thereof, and Skill be Required in the Performance of it, as has been ſhewed; then it Neceſſarily follows, 'tis the Duty of all to Labour after the obtainment of it, and to Pray to GOD for it. Where a Duty is Impoſed and Injoyned and Rules given therefor, the Perſons on whom the Duty is Incumbent, ought to acquaint themſelves with the Rules thereof, or elſe they cannot perform the Duty in an Agreeable manner, and to Acceptance. We are Required to Sing the Praiſes of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002614_0016_0FDB759C975DB468"/>GOD, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.1, 2. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and to do it with Skill or by Rule as the Text Implies, and as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.3 <hi>Play (or Sing) Skillfully,</hi> that is agreeable to Rule, which Skill Implies; hence it appears to be the Duty of all to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after Skill and to Pray for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. <hi>HENCE it appears that ſuch as</hi> oppoſe <hi>Regular Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are greatly to blame; theſe diſcover great Ignorance and Folly, and are the Authours of Great Diſorder and Confuſion in the Worſhip of GOD; which is greatly diſpleaſing to Him.</hi> To do <hi>thus</hi> is to Debaſe the Rational Nature, and to Act below the Powers and Faculties with which GOD has Endowed us. If Skill and Rule be decryed in one thing, they may as well be ſo in another, 'till all Learning and Religion be Juſtled out, and all Rules and Precepts about the Worſhip of GOD (as much as in us lies) made void; and ſo a People favoured with the Word and Laws of GOD, and Rules how to Serve and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify Him, ſhall become like the Blindeſt and moſt brutiſh of the Heathen and thoſe that know not GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. <hi>HENCE we ſee that when a People have deviated from, or have loſt the Rules of Pſalmody, it is their Duty to become ſenſible of their Error, and to Reform.</hi> Reformation is always, and in all caſes a Duty, where there has been an Apoſtacy or Deviation from the Rules by Scripture required to be obſerved, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.6, to 22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55, 7. In matters of great weight and moment a more earneſt endeavour is required, and proportionably ſome tho' a leſs, in thoſe that are leſs. ſee 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 29, 30, 31. Chapters, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26, to 34 But in as much as Reformation uſually meets with great Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either from the Ignorance, or Willfulneſs and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibleneſs of Men, in an Evil way, there ought to be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Courage, Prudence and Caution in them that attempt it. But here a Queſtion naturally ariſes, which is;</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>WHO ſhould be Leaders in ſuch a Reformation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Anſwer to which I would ſay, That as in all other things that need Reformation, ſo in the preſent caſe the Heads or Rulers of a People ſhould lead and go before others. In the Chapter wherein the Text is, the Pſalmody was appointed by the King, (and there is the like Reaſon in Reformation) and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002614_0017_0FDB759E07618AA8"/>as I conceive 'twas appointed by <hi>David</hi> not only as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Inſpired; but alſo as their Chief Ruler. The Perſons to have the overſight thereof were the Levites. It is eaſie here to make the Application: but as to the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part, the Younger ſort of Men under ſuch a Superiour conduct, ſeem to be moſt fit to lead next. Their Voices are moſt agreable, and Inclinations ſtronger then Old Men's. And by the Scriptures it ſeems as if they were moſt Improved. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The Elders have ceaſed from the gate, the Young Men from their Muſick.</hi> Which could not be meant of Wanton Songs, but Sacred Muſick, otherwiſe it was not matter of Lamentation that they ceaſed. And as Old Men, in whom the Daughters of Muſick are brought low, as in <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12 4. ſeem leſs capable, ſo they ſeem to be more Indiſpoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as good Old <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſaid to King <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>

And whether it be not a ſad Sign that GOD is withdrawing His Preſence and Glory from us, may alſo be conſidered. And whether, while we thus contend about the Vocal part of the Duty, there be not a Total Neglect of the Spiritual and Gracious parts and ſo inſtead of Glorifying GOD by offering Praiſe, as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. <hi>ult.</hi> we do not by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and only formal Praiſing of HIM greatly provoke Him to Anger?</p>
            <p>USE 3. IS of Caution to thoſe who are Improving fit Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and means to Learn the Rules and Skill of Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody, that they, while they delight in the Voice of Singing, do not forget that which ſhould be their main end, as in all other things, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. ſo eſpecially in this, <hi>viz. The Glory of GOD:</hi> while you pleaſe your Selves with the Voice of Melody, Charming Concord, Harmony and Sweetneſs of Muſick, you be not like the <hi>Organs</hi> in whoſe Pipes, thro' the help of Artificial Lungs, the Wind makes a Pleaſant Sound; and being well Managed by a Skillful Hand, there is a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Delightful Harmony, which yet is a Lifeleſs Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it's Pipes are made of the Baſeſt of Mettals. There is certainly ſomething which you propound as your end in Learning to Sing, if it be not to make you the more capable in an agreable manner, to Sing the Praiſes of GOD, 'tis a wrong end. A Pleaſant and Strong Voice with Ability to Modulate the ſame, is the Gift of GOD, and a Tallent that ſhould be Improved to the Glory of his Name. And tho' the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002614_0019_0FDB75A4CB4573C8"/>Singing of Tunes is no part of Divine Worſhip, yet the Singing of Pſalms in good Tunes will if Rightly Performed. Promote true Devotion, and the Perſons thus Imployed, are Advantaged to a Devout Meditation on the Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD, and the Glorious Harmony that there is in his Work of Creation and Providence; the Concordance of Sounds is a Repreſentation of the reſt of his Glorious Works, while the parts of Muſick contained in or chiefly founded on a <hi>Trias</hi> of Notes of the greater Concords in Muſick of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Key, agreeing as one, are Significant Emblems of the Glorious and Incomprehenſible Trinity.
