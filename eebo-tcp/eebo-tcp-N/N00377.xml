            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A RELATION OF Captain Bull, Concerning the MOHAVVKS At <hi>FORT-ALBANY.</hi>
               <date>May, 1689.</date>
            </head>
            <p>COnnecticot <hi>Colony upon many Rumours of Hazzard, sent Captain</hi> Jonathan Bull <hi>to</hi> Albany <hi>to inform the</hi> Albanians <hi>of the News from</hi> England <hi>we had Received; and what Change was made in the</hi> Bay, <hi>who seemed much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced; Declaring they'd allow the Fort to Remain not twelve Hours longer in Papists Hands: That being noised about, Major</hi> Baxter <hi>Declared he d Remove in four or five Days, which accordingly he did, leaving the Fort to the Inhabitants, who have placed twenty</hi> five <hi>Men in it for the best.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> there are very sure of the Friendliness of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and the five other Nations above them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 24. The <hi>Mohawk Sachems,</hi> appeared in the Court-House of <hi>Albany,</hi> with a Present of Beaver of about twenty pound value, who chose their Speaker, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two or three Skins, the rest sitting silent, Rose up and said:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Brethren, we are now come as our Grandfathers used to do, to Renew our Unity, Friendship and Covenant made by us and you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We desire the House, being the Covenant and Proposition House may be kept clean, that we may keep a clean, single, and not a double heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We do now Renew the Former Covenant or Claim that hath been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and you; <hi>(viz.) New-England, Virginia, Mary-land,</hi> and those parts of <hi>America,</hi> that it may be kept bright on every side, and not suffered to rust, or be forgotten.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are heartily sorry to hear of the Bloodshed by those ill minded <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Eastward</hi>; and we now Present this Guift as our <hi>Indian</hi> manner is, to wipe the Tears from the Eyes, and the Blood from off the Relations of those who have lost Friends by those ill-minded men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the Tree of Love, Unity and Commerce grow and flourish, and let the Roots spread and branch forth through all our several Dominions, to stand fast that none may move it; so that we may live under the shade of the Tree, so that the Sun of Discord and Quarrelling may not scorch and wound us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We have heard there hath been several Embassyes the last year from you to <hi>Canady,</hi> that we could not be acquainted with, we do all publickly Above-board, and we desire you do so also.</p>
            <p>We heard that the <hi>Eastern Indians</hi> came where some of our men were Hunting, desirous to speak with us, but we refused to have any discourse with them, but warned them to be gone, so that they came not near our Forts, but went as they came.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We intend a Meeting of the Chief of our five Nations in a little time, at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madado,</hi> there further to consider of publick Affairs, and desire that you would send some persons from you to hear what we shall Confer of, and also some of the <hi>River Indians</hi> if they see cause, the Meeting was chiefly intended to consider what Answer to give the <hi>French,</hi> who had often sent to have Speech with them.</p>
            <p>VVhen the <hi>Sachems</hi> had heard how Matters were circumstanced, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and what News was come to hand, seemed to be glad, and much Rejoiced, &amp; wholly laid aside their intended Meeting, promising neither to speak with them, nor to allow the <hi>French</hi> to speak to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Albany</hi> say, the <hi>Mohawks</hi> shew themselves very willing to go against the <hi>Eastern Indians,</hi> if Desired.</p>
