            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. We are now to take ſome View of that perplexing DARKNESS about a FUTURE STATE, which involves the Minds of Men by Nature.</p>
                  <p>This is plainly hinted in the Words before us: And by looking a little into this gloomy Scene, we may more ſenſibly find the Need of that diſcovering Light our Saviour brings us, the more highly prize it, and the more rejoice in its Illuminations.</p>
                  <p>And here it cannot be proper to conſider what <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> of a FUTURE STATE the <hi>meer Reaſon</hi> of Men is <hi>able</hi> to make. For we who are born, bro't up and live in the midſt of Revelation, have

                  <p>Our Buſineſs then is to conſider the univerſal Darkneſs about this Matter, which <hi>in Fact</hi> involved the World before CHRIST ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and which even <hi>yet</hi> involves the ungoſpelized Nations.</p>
                  <p>Nor need we look among the <hi>common Herd</hi> of Men, where the Ignorance even of the moſt ingenious and penetrating Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, appears amazing: as any may find by conſulting with their Slaves from <hi>Africa,</hi> or our more ſagacious <hi>American Indians</hi> who have not yet receiv'd the Goſpel. Their Minds with all their Powers have neither certainly diſcovered a <hi>Future State,</hi> nor even ſcarcely that Univerſal Being, who made, pervades and rules the World. Some of them indeed have ſome Notion of a <hi>Future Exiſtence:</hi> Yet if you enquire, you'l find they have no Certainty, nor any Reaſons, but rather meerly ſome Suſpicion; or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to think ſo, becauſe ſome others as ignorant as they have told them: But as for the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> it never entered their Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. And ſuch extremely dark and uncertain Notions we may well ſuppoſe, that other <hi>common Heathens</hi> had, who liv'd before the Time of CHRIST'S Appearing; as alſo thoſe who yet remain without the Influence of his Revelation.</p>
                  <p>But we may rather ſee this Darkneſs, by enquiring of the <hi>moſt improved</hi> Men among the old <hi>Egyptians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> For Learning among the Gentiles ſeems to have flouriſh'd 1ſt in <hi>Egypt;</hi> thence to paſs to <hi>Greece,</hi> and thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> And according to

                     <hi>Plato</hi> likewiſe, who was Born about 40 <hi>Years</hi> after <hi>Socrates,</hi> was his belov'd Diſciple, and liv'd 8 <hi>Years</hi> with Him, even grew in this

                  <p>Such a Vail of Darkneſs hung between the Preſent and the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture World; that among the moſt learned Heathen, all ſeems little more than meer Conjecture: the beſt and wiſeſt of them rather wiſh'd and pleaded for the <hi>Soul's Immortality,</hi> than attain'd the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.

And having made this lower World for us and produc'd us into Being, He became the <hi>active Medium</hi> of Intercourſe between the DEITY and our <hi>Firſt Parents;</hi> familiarly converſing with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the Uſe and Dominion of the inſerior Creatures on them diſcovering to them the Will of GOD and Laws of Nature, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of Danger, and inſtructing them for their Advantage But inſtantly, upon our <hi>Sin and Fall,</hi> He <hi>Began to execute</hi> his <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004067_0021_1003C2AA339F5118"/>Office,</hi> by Interceeding for and obtaining the Divine Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, receiving as Mediator the Rule of the World, and Revealing the gracious Councils and Deſigns of GOD for our Salvation, in that moſt reviving Propheſy, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head;</hi> i. e. that from Her ſhou'd deſcend a MIGHTY SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, who wou'd happily cruſh and ruin the Policy, Power and Dominion of <hi>Satan</hi> in this wretched World.</p>
                  <p>In all the <hi>preceeding Ages</hi> to his <hi>Incarnation</hi> He ſtill continually acted as our MEDIATOR: By preſerving this lower World from the abſolute Power of the Fallen Angels, from the utmoſt Reign of Sin, from perfect Miſery and intire Deſtruction; reſtraining the violent Luſts of Men, raiſing and governing Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as particular Perſons, for various excellent Ends; beſtowing innumerable Benefits both of a Temporal and Spiritual Kind on Multitudes; communicating Inſpirations, Virtues, and Graces to them; and continuing the Lines of Deſent to number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs others whom He had in his Gracious Eye in the ſucceſſive Ages.</p>
                  <p>To ſome few of the Ancients both before <hi>the Flood</hi> and after He ſenſibly appeared; and gave progreſſive Notices of his Deſign to aſſume our Nature, and therein appear and act as our Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Diverſe Predictions of Him were entered on faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; as that He was to ſpring from <hi>Abrabam,</hi> then from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> then from <hi>Jacob,</hi> then from <hi>Judab,</hi> then from <hi>David:</hi> and a mighty Nation was raiſed up from the Loins of <hi>Jacob</hi> to preſerve thoſe Records, to look for his Appearance, proclaim their Expectations to the World, and bare witneſs of it. And when about <hi>Four whou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years</hi> were paſt from the <hi>Creation,</hi> the PRINCE OF LIFE is Born of a Pious Virgin derived from <hi>David.</hi> When the <hi>Fullneſs of Time was come,</hi> as the Apoſtle obſerves, GOD <hi>ſent forth</hi> HIS SON, <hi>made of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004067_0022_1003C2ABC155EB40"/>a Woman, made under the Law, to Rediem them that were under the Law,</hi> [i. e. the Condemnation and Puniſhment denounc'd therein] <hi>and receive the Adoptions of Sons.</hi> Gal. iv. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>For, our Firſt Tranſgreſſion being juſtly Threatned and Puniſhed with <hi>Death;</hi> the Threatning muſt be executed, the Puniſhment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; the Divine Juſtice, Holineſs, Authority, Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt not looſe their due Regard or Honour, but be magnified in every Eye, and the Divine Truth preſerv'd inviolate. For theſe great Ends He therefore takes our Nature, but in perfect Purity, yet cloath'd with our Infirmities; that having no Sin of his own, He might be intirely ſuitable to repreſent <hi>us,</hi> to bare the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to <hi>us,</hi> and in our Nature yield that full Obedience and Regard to God which is due therefrom, and which we have loſt our Power to yield; that by the moſt perfect and meritorious Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Obedience even unto Death of ſuch a Perſon infinite in Excellence and Dignity, He might Purchaſe for us compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and eternal Happineſs, with the rightful Power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing them on us; and that the Glory of every divine Perfection might appear and harmonize throughout all the Progreſs of this ſtupendeous Work.</p>
                  <p>Obſcure and faint indeed He was at his firſt Appearance; that He might unobſerv'd and unprevented, endure thoſe Sufferings needful for our Redemption: For He muſt be <hi>numbered among Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,</hi> i. e. Publickly condemned as a Ma eſactor, and offer'd up a Sacrifice to Death even the moſt curſed painful and ignominious Death, which was that of <hi>the Croſs:</hi> and it the People among whom He ſojourn'd had but known Him to be <hi>the Lord of Glory,</hi> they had never crucified Him. 1 Cor. II. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004067_0023_1003C2AF04E1B9B0"/>
Till He arriv'd to about 30 <hi>Years of Age,</hi> He livid a low, retir'd and ſervile, tho' ſpotleſs Life; and then engag'd in his Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: At his Entrance, He overcame the Tempter in his moſt ſubtil, ſtrong and aſſiduous Efforts; and then He went about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually doing Good: Preaching the glad Tidings of Redemption teaching heavenly &amp; ſaving Doctrines, confirming them with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, adorning them with a moſt divine &amp; perfect Life; healing all manner of Diſeaſes, forgiving Sins, ruling the Winds and Seas, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling the Power of Devils, making them to worſhip Him, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of the Poſſeſſed, and ſending them away.</p>
                  <p>By ſuch things as theſe He gave the growing Specimens of his ſuperior Power to thoſe our mighty and deſtroying Enemies. But He advances in his Triumphs. For a little before He left the World, He <hi>began to aboliſh Death it ſelf,</hi> by raiſing the Son of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Nain,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Jairus,</hi> as alſo <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Life. To the Two former, He only ſays, <hi>I ſay unto Thee ariſe,</hi> and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aroſe. To the laſt, at the Mouth of the Tomb wherein he had lain for 4 Days among the Dead, He cries — <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> and out he comes with the Grave-Cloaths bound about him.</p>
                  <p>But to compleat the Conqueſt, and become more Glorious, He muſt condeſcend to Die; that for us He might intirely fulfill the Law, brake the Power of Satan, Sin and Death among the Sons of Men, purchaſe our compleat Redemption, and riſe a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror and Deliverer. For if He cou'd raiſe Himſelf to Life; He wou'd obtain a perfect Victory, both for HIMSELF and <hi>us,</hi> and all things elſe wou'd be eaſy to Him. For as the Apoſtle argues; Heb II. 10, 14, 15. <hi>It became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the</hi> CAPTAIN OF THEIR SALVATION <hi>perfect through Sufferings.</hi> — And, <hi>Foraſmuch as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004067_0024_1003A1796AD22880"/>the Children are Partakers of Fleſh and Blood;</hi> HE <hi>alſo Himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame: that through Death, He might deſtroy Him who had the Power of Death, i. e. the Devil; and Deliver them who through Fear of Death, were all their Life Time ſubject to Bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, endured every kind of ſinleſs Suffering both in Soul and Body, and Finiſhed the Work for which He was ſent among us; He ſubmitted to be <hi>Crucified, Kill'd</hi> and <hi>Buried.</hi> But on the <hi>ſame Day,</hi> his ſeparate <hi>Soul</hi> enter'd into the Joys of Paradice; and on the <hi>Third Day</hi> after, He aboliſh'd Death in his ſlain <hi>Body,</hi> by awaking unto Life and riſing from the Grave. At the ſame time, He ſhook the Earth, opened the Graves of many others round about Him, enlivened and rais'd them with Himſelf: And in 40 <hi>Days,</hi> He in the Sight of his Diſciples, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on high, and led Captivity Captive: Having ſpoiled the Principalities and Powers of Darkneſs; He made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them. Being raiſed to Heaven, He is there placed at the Right Hand of GOD, far above all Principality and Power and Might and Dominion, and every Name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not only in this World, but alſo in that which is to come; having all things put under his Feet, and being the <hi>Head</hi> over them for the Good of his People. He is exalted to be a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins: And is become the <hi>Author</hi> of Eternal Salvation to all that obey Him.</p>
                  <p>For all this He did, as a <hi>Publick Perſon,</hi> in behalf of all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and as a viſible and certain Demonſtration, that He had <hi>purchaſed,</hi> and is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>reſolved</hi> to <hi>accompliſh</hi> their abſolute Deliverance from all their Enemies, has begun to brake their Powers, will intirely take away his People's Sin which is the Sting of Death, at the Moment of their Diſſolution, receive their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                  <p>This therefore brings us in the</p>

                  <p>Now by <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> the Apoſtle doubtleſs means the ſame thing, with this only Difference; that LIFE implies the <hi>Kind</hi> of our Exiſtence in the Future World, as being a State of active Powers, Perceptions and Enjoyments; IMMORTALITY the <hi>never failing Duration</hi> of it; and <hi>both together</hi> repreſent a State of perfect and endleſs Happineſs.</p>

                  <p>And that the Apoſtle had this nearer Proſpect, appears from theſe 4 Reaſons —
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe by many Paſſages in his Writings, it appears He had been both a <hi>Platoniſt</hi> in Philoſophy and a <hi>Phariſee</hi> in Divinity, and retain'd ſo much of their beſt Principles as was conſiſtent with the <hi>Chriſtian Revelation.</hi> And as he knew that by <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> they to be ſure included the Life of the <hi>Soul</hi> in its <hi>ſeparate State,</hi> and He had been accuſtom'd to uſe the Words in the ſame View; He muſt ſtill have the ſame View in his preſent uſing them.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe He knew that the <hi>Deſire</hi> of Life and Happineſs in every State is equally co-natural to the foreſeeing Mind of Man; the Deſire of a happy Living in the preſent World, the Deſire of the Continuance of ſuch a happy Living, and the Deſire alſo of Life and Happineſs in the State of Separation; that the beſt of Men both among the <hi>Heathen, Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> could not but earneſtly Deſire it; and that the Syſtem of the GOSPEL muſt needs excell the Doctrines of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> both as to the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004067_0027_1003C2C21E2842B8"/>of our natural and rational Deſires, and the Certainty of their Diſcovery.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe he knew that our BLESSED SAVIOUR at his late Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing had <hi>brought to Light</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of the humane <hi>Soul</hi> in its <hi>State of Separation.</hi>
                           <p>For in <hi>Mat.</hi> X. 28 He had plainly ſaid, that thoſe who cou'd kill the <hi>Body,</hi> were not able to kill the <hi>Soul.</hi> In the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> He repreſents the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> as Dead and Buried, but his <hi>Soul</hi> in Hell, and deſiring that his ſurviving Brethren on Earth might be warn'd of coming into his Place of Torment: And at the ſame time, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried by Angels to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Embraces, and There was comforted, while the deceaſed Spirit of the Rich Man was tormented. <hi>Luke</hi> XVI.</p>
                           <p>In his <hi>Argument</hi> againſt the <hi>Sadducees;</hi> who neither believ'd the Reſurrection, Angels, Spirits, nor the Soul's Immortality — He obſerves that GOD cannot be ſo properly the GOD of the <hi>Dead</hi> as of the <hi>Living:</hi> and that continuing to call Himſelf the GOD of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacch</hi> after their Deceaſe; He plainly intimates, that in their vital Parts their <hi>Souls,</hi> they were ſtill <hi>alive</hi> and happy in Him, tho' waiting in full Aſſurance of the Reſurrection of their Bodies. <hi>Luke</hi> XX. 27, 40.</p>

It is the Life and Immortality of the <hi>Sanctified only</hi> that theſe Evangelical Paſlages look to: And no doubt it is only the ſame which our Text intends. But a View of the Nature, Powers, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Actions and Enjoyments thereof, both in the <hi>ſeparate Soul</hi> and in the raiſed <hi>Body,</hi> wou'd open a Scene too vaſt for us now to ſurvey. I may only offer the following Hints,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. For this Life of theirs in the <hi>ſeparate State.</hi> — By the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples above, their uncloathed Spirits may both <hi>See</hi> viſible Objects and <hi>Hear</hi> Things unutterable by the Tongues of Men; and this in a vaſtly higher Degree than now in their Bodies. For to keep to the Apoſtle's Alluſion; their Souls are now confined to an <hi>Earthy Houſe,</hi> can perceive no Light or Sound but in the Eyes or Ears, and as theſe are dull and embarras'd ſo are their Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But when their <hi>Spirits</hi> are out of their Bodies, they will be in perfect Liberty. Yea they will be then <hi>made Perfect,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle deſcribes them: and this includes not only a <hi>ſpotleſs Purity</hi> which renders them fit for the Viſion and Society of <hi>Paradice;</hi> but alſo the <hi>Perfecting of all their Powers,</hi> and among the reſt their Powers of <hi>ſeeing</hi> the glorious Objects and <hi>hearing</hi> the raviſhing Language There.</p>
                  <p>Yea, by the Inſtances of the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> and of the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts VII. 55, 56. Acts IX. 3, —7. Acts XXII. 6, —II. Acts XXVI. 13, —18. Rev.</note> It ſeems as if the <hi>Heavenly World</hi> were open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and the Light, if not the Language There, may now reach our Earth, tho' our Organs are not fine enough to tranſmit their Impulſe for the Soul to perceive. So the Light from Multitudes of Stars, is by Glaſles found to reach us, tho' our preſent Degrees
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004067_0032_1003A18C1ABE7F20"/>of Powers are not enough to perceive it by the naked Eye. And ſo both Light &amp; Sounds which are unperceived by ſome, are clear to others.</p>
                  <p>The ſeparate Spirit may therefore open at once to the <hi>Glory</hi> if not the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Realms above. For what is <hi>Seeing,</hi> but the Soul's perceiving the Motions of Light? and what is <hi>Hearing,</hi> but the Soul's perceiving the Motions of the Air or Ether? <hi>Now</hi> the Motions are greatly dull'd and hinder'd; but <hi>then</hi> they may come with their full Power upon us, and be perfectly perceived. So the Soul of the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> cou'd doubtleſs ſee the Rays of Light from Heaven, as ſoon as out of the Body as well as before. Or the Power of GOD or his <hi>beneficent Angels</hi> may contract the Rays, or enlarge our Power to ſee them, or waft the Motions of Light and Sound from the World above; or produce the ſame Impulſes for the ſeparate Spirit Here to perceive as if it were up in thoſe bliſsfull Regions, and all the while it is aſcending Thither: which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few <hi>Hours;</hi> as CHRIST expiring at the <hi>midſt</hi> of the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> implies, in his Speech to the believing Criminal — THIS DAY <hi>Thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice.</hi>

                  <p>In the midſt of all the Sprightlineſs of <hi>Youth,</hi> ſhe was not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> but ſoon after her entring the married State, ſhe made an <hi>open Profeſſion</hi> of her Faith in CHRIST and Subjection to Him, and join'd to our Communion. She always ſet a fair Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gravity and Attention in the <hi>Publick Worſhip.</hi> And I am aſſured by her neareſt Relative, that ſhe daily read the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> and with great Reverence and Fear, even to a faulty Degree of Trembling, was ever wont to receive the Elements of the <hi>Holy Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I always obſerved in Her a great Reſpect not only to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of CHRIST, but even to <hi>all Good People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In her <hi>raiſed Station,</hi> ſhe was never above her <hi>Houſhold Buſineſs:</hi> but till her growing Infirmities hinder'd, ſhe carefully look'd to her Family, and govern'd it with Decency and Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004067_0040_1003C25E9A3E1038"/>
Nor did ſhe think Herſelf too rich or high to ſpeak to the <hi>low</hi> and <hi>poor;</hi> but treated them, as well as others, with eaſy Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Courteouſneſs and Gentleneſs.</p>
                  <p>Her Heart was very ſoft and tender to the afflicted and needy. It firſt yearn'd with Sympathy, and then widely opened to relieve and comfort them. Even ſome whole Families were in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſupported by her liberal Hand. And of all Sorts of People ſhe cou'd not tell how to bear that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST ſhou'd ſuffer either Diſreſpect or Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>In her gradual <hi>Languiſhment,</hi> the Thoughts of <hi>Death</hi> were for a long while frightful to Her. In my diſcourſing with Her ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd a very humble Senſe of her great Unworthineſs; much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd the Incumbrance and Hurry of her late more Publick State of Life, that her Heart had given too much way to the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, and that ſhe had not duly glorified HIM therein who rais'd Her. But ſhe hoped thro' CHRIST, there was Mercy and Pardon for Her: And when I was going to ſet before her his allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Pity and Grace; her Heart and Eyes grew full, and ſhe ſoon prevented me, by breaking out into affectionate Acclamations of THAT LOVELY SAVIOUR, as ſhe expreſly call'd Him: and told me, ſhe had been many times overcome with the Conſideration of his wonderful Pity and Love to wretched, mean and unworthy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that ſhe had nothing of her own to recommend her to Him; but at his merciful Feet ſhe was reſolved to lie for ever.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a Frame as this ſhe continued: and I am inform'd by thoſe about Her, that for ſome Days before Her Death, when ſhe grew too faint for her Friends to viſit Her, that ſhe not only came to a <hi>Willingneſs,</hi> but even to a <hi>Deſire to Die;</hi> and in the ſenſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the gloomy Shadow, ſhe caſt Herſelf on the Mercy of that lovely SAVIOUR, and ſerenely reſign'd Herſelf to his Arms.</p>

Let us be Thankful then for the Hopes we have that She has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd the Life of the heavenly World: And with ſuch Views as theſe, let every mourning <hi>Relative</hi> be refreſh'd and comforted.</p>
                  <p>Let her Honourable and Surveying CONSORT, remember His ſpending Life and Opportunities; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Let the bereaved <hi>Children</hi> turn off their Eyes from beholding the vain Pomp and Vanities of this paſſing State, which will afford no Comfort in their dying Hours. Let them learn to look to the inviſible World, and be wiſe for Eternity.</p>
                  <p>May the Honourable and aged <hi>Mother,</hi> with the mournful <hi>Siſter,</hi> and <hi>other Relatives,</hi> ſee their growing Frailty, and Prepare to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>ſprightly</hi> remember, their Beauty muſt fade, their Spirits decay, and their Fleſh conſume; that they will ſoon be laid up in the joyleſs Grave, and ſee this Life no more: but that the Grace of GOD is infinitely more deſireable, and will endure for ever; that if they are poſſeſſed of this, it will be a perpetual Source of Happineſs; and if they believe in CHRIST, He'l receive their expiring Souls to the Joys of Paradice, and will one Day come and new form their Bodies with ten thouſand times greater Beauty, inſpire them with the freſheſt Bloom that ſhall never fade, and with a joyful Life that will never decay.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Let <hi>us all</hi> remember, that the preſent Scenes of Life will ſoon be over; ETERNITY will open upon us, and our Souls muſt enter; that then all the ſecular Delights and Affairs of this lower World will appear as Vanity, like the Toys of Children now to thoſe who are taken up wholly with Crowns and Empires; and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004067_0042_1003C265394BFFD0"/>nothing then but the Alſufficient and Eternal GOD can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy or fill our Deſires. He alone can be an eternal and ever riſing Fountain of Life and Joy within us, and make us taſte and feel a Meaſure of his own Felicity.</p>
                  <p>O let us therefore now and for ever, moſt earneſtly labour to know HIM, to diſcover his Glories, and to riſe into the higheſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Him, eſpecially as He appears in CHRISY; that we may Delight in Him, Love Him &amp; Deſire Him above all compare, and ſay as the Pſalmiſt — <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth, that I deſire beſides Thee: My Fleſh and my Heart faileth, but</hi> GOD <hi>is the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever: Thou wilt guide me by thy Council, and afterward receive me to Glory.

                  <p>ON Tueſday laſt in the Afternoon, the Corpſe of the Honourable Madam <hi>MARY BELCHER,</hi> Conſort of His Excellency. <hi>JONATHAN BELCHER,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> our Governour, was entemb'd here with great Reſpect and Honour: The Rev. Dr. <hi>Sewall,</hi> on this ſolemn Occaſion, made a very ſuitable Prayer at his Excellency's Houſe, juſt before the Funeral: The Coffin was cover'd with black Velvet and richly adorn'd: The Pall was ſupported by the Honourable, <hi>Spencer Fhipps,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> our Lieutenant Governour, <hi>William Dummer,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> formerly Lieutenant Governour and Commander in Chief of this Province, <hi>Benjamin Lynde,</hi>

                     <hi>Edmund Quincey,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Adam Winthrop,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> His Excellency with his Children and Family follow'd the Corpſe, all in deep Mourning; next went the ſeveral Relatives according to their reſpective Degrees, who were followed by a great many of
<pb facs="unknown:004067_0043_1003C267A94FB6D0"/>the principal Gentlewomen in Town; after whom went the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of His Majeſty's Council; the Rev Miniſters of this and the neighbouring Towns; the Rev. Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Harvard-College;</hi> a great Number of Officers, both of the civil and military Order, with a multitude of other Gentlemen. His Excellency's Coach, drawn by four Horſes, was cover'd with black Cloth and adorn'd with Eſcutcheons of the Coat of Arms, both of His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and His deceaſed Lady. All the Bells in Town were tolled on this mournful Occaſion; and during the Time of the Funeral Proceſſion to the Tomb, the Half-Minute Guns began firſt at His Majeſty's Caſtle <hi>William,</hi> which were follow'd by thoſe on board His Majeſty's Ship <hi>Squirrel</hi> and many other Ships in the Harbour, their Colours being all Day rais'd to the heighth as uſual on ſuch Occaſions: The Streets thro' which the Funeral paſs'd, the Tops of the Houſes and Windows on both ſides, were crouded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Spectators.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>Laſt Lord's Day a Funeral Sermon was preach'd by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Prince,</hi> on Account of the Deceaſe of the Lady of his Excellency our Governour, from 2 Tim. 1. 10. — <hi>Who hath aboliſhed Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Goſpel.</hi> His Excellency's Pew, and the Pulpit, were upon this Occaſion, put into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and richly adorn'd with Eſcutcheons.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>DELCHER</hi> was Daughter to the late Hon. <hi>William Partridge,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was ſeveral Years Lieut Governour &amp; Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chief, in and over the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Commiſſion from the late King WILLIAM the Third.

                  <p>As Providence had placed her at the Head of her Sex in her own Countrey, ſhe graced her Station with all the Elegance of Good Manners and Affable Condeſcention. She was of a ſprightly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: But always grave &amp; ſolemn in Affairs of Religion. Her Bible was her principal Study, which ſhe us'd to read through in Courſe ſeveral Times a Year. Tho' ſhe ever lived in the Splendour of a Gentlewoman; in her Oeconomy, it was her conſtant Maxim, <hi>Let nothing be loſt.</hi> The Poor can Witneſs to the Compaſſions of her Heart, &amp; the Largeneſs of her Munificence. The Terrors of Death long kept her in Bondage; but at laſt ſeem'd entirely vaniſhed, and ſhe expir'd in much Serenity, on the 6th inſtant.</p>
