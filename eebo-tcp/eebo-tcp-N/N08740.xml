            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Pariſhioner.</hi> SIR,</speaker>
               <p>ENCOURAGED by the kind reception I met with in my firſt viſit, I am come to make you a ſecond. For I ſtill have a ſtrong deſire that my child ſhould be baptized, and I have ſomething new to offer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miniſter.</speaker>
               <p>I am ready to baptize your child with all my heart, as ſoon as you will put me in a way to do it on principles conſiſtent with the bible, and with themſelves. <hi>Have you yet found any text of ſcripture that will warrant the half-way-practice?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have been round the country ſince I ſaw you, and my ears have been open to all the talk: Particularly, I have had a long converſation with my former miniſter, the ſubſtance of which has been printed at <hi>Hartford,</hi> under the title of <hi>a ſecond dialogue between a miniſter and his pariſhioner, concerning the half way-covenant;</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, you have ſeen. And now according to the words he has put into my mouth, and according to all I have heard about the country among my friends, I am come to ſpeak at this time. Therefore I ſay,—as to a text of ſcripture—"allow there is none," not one text of ſcripture to juſtify the half-way-practice, "it don't in the leaſt prove the point."—Pray, where is there one to condemn it? p. 3.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>In this controverſy gentlemen on your ſide of the queſtion are wont to argue abundantly from the old teſtament diſpenſation. Did you never obſerve, that according to the expreſs letter of the Jewiſh law, if any man was found guilty of the half way-practice, he was to be excommunicated?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, I never did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Be pleaſed to take the bible, and turn to <hi>Num.</hi> 9.13. The text I referred you to when here before, and read it in this view.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>The words are—<hi>But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the paſſover; even the ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, becauſe he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed ſeaſon: that man ſhall bear his ſin.</hi>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Read the foregoing, 10, 11, verſes, and you will ſee, that thoſe who were hindred by uncleanneſs, or a journey, from attending the paſſover in its ſeaſon, were obliged to keep it the very next month; whereas it is the cuſtom in ſome of our churches, to allow perſons to own the covenant, and have their children baptized, and live and die, and never come to the Lord's table. Among the Jews ſuch men would have been excommunicated.— And beſides, are not the miniſters of Chriſt obliged by their commiſſion, Mar. 28. to teach the diſciples of Chriſt to obſerve <hi>all things</hi> which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? And has he not expreſly commanded all his diſciples, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This do in remembrance of me?</hi> Luk. 22. And are we not all agreed that the <hi>ſecond command requires us to keep pure and entire all ſuch religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances as God hath appointed in his word?</hi> And have miniſters or churches a diſpenſing power? Are they authorized by Chriſt to grant indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to any of his diſciples to live in the allowed breach of any one of his laws? Mat. 5.19. The pope claims this power; but all proteſtants are agreed in diſclaiming it.</p>

               <p>"I cannot believe the command of Chriſt obligeth any of his followers to do that which they in their conſciences dare not attempt."—"To oblige perſons to that, which they are not convinced they may ſafely do, is hard." —"I freely allow it is the duty of all to come."—"I believe it is my duty to come, but I believe I muſt firſt get my ſcruples removed." p. 4 5.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>What are your ſcruples? my dear ſir. Let me know them, and will do my beſt to remove them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>It is not becauſe I think I ought to be converted before I come to the Lord's table. This was my only ſcruple once. But I give it up. My for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miniſter has convinced me, that the ſcheme I was in cannot be vindicated He tells me, I have as good a right to come to the Lord's Table, knowing myſelf to be unconverted, as to attend the common means of grace, p. 8 and I am now convinced; but yet I dare not in conſcience come. p. 5.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That is, you believe you have an undoubted right to come, and yet you doubt whether you may come. You believe it is your duty to come, but yet you dare not in conſcience come. Your conſcience ſays, yes, and no, at the ſame time. A ſtrange conſcience this! I thought you honeſt in your firſt viſit, but what ſhall I think now? to believe a thing to be, and not to be, at the ſame time, is to believe a contradiction —Pray be not offended, my dear ſir, at my pointing out the inconſiſtence of your preſent ſcheme; rather re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>view it with that candor that becomes an honeſt man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>My former miniſter tells me, that the half-way practice has been ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proved of and practiſed upon by many great and good men, p. 4, 14, 15.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps he did not mean to be underſtood, that they approved of <hi>his</hi> half-way-practice; for he knew, that <hi>this ſcheme of his,</hi> to which you are become a proſelyte, was not the ſcheme upon which they profeſſed to act This ſcheme is eſſentially different from the half-way-ſcheme of the ſynod in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011173_0004_0F857FD42479EBD0"/>
Boſton, 1662; for they—<q>did acknowledge, that there ought to be true ſaving faith in the parent, according to the judgment of rational charity, or elſe the child ought not to be baptized.</q>—This I told you before; and did your former miniſter deny this to be the ſynod's ſcheme?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>He did not. But he however really thinks in his conſcience their ſcheme is wrong; (yea, that it amounts to the ſame thing with Sandemeaniſm, p. 5.) for he believes, that a man may enter into covenant with God; and have his child baptized, and come to the Lord's table too, who knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be unconverted, p. 8—12.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Your former miniſter then knows, that the famous men, whom he mentions, are not in his ſcheme. Why then did he mention them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which tended to lead you to think they were? I ſuppoſe he alſo knew, that there is no evidence that the half-way-practice was ſet up in New-England, till after the ſynod, 1662, 40 years after the firſt ſettling of the country. Mr. Prudden in his letter dated, 1651, to which he refers, ſays, "it is a thing I do not yet hear practiſed." And not one of the letters in my collection, ſay, that it was practiſed. But be this as it may, it is nothing to your purpoſe, for you reject their ſcheme, and advance one of another nature, on different and contrary principles; even on principles on which the half-way-practice never was juſtified before by any ſynod, council, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or any one ſingle writer, perhaps, ſince the world began. A ſcheme which no pariſhioner can be in, and act upon, without being guilty of the moſt glaring ſelf-contradiction. A ſcheme, therefore, I am of opinion, no pariſhioner ever was in, and acted upon, that underſtood himſelf. For, if men believe they have equal right to both ordinances, there is no room left for ſcruples. There is no room for the half-way-practice, upon their own principles, according to their own conſcience. The ſynod in 1662, knew better than to advance ſuch a ſcheme as this.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the matter is this, when you owned your covenant, you did not mean to own the covenant of grace, which you thought none but the godly might do; but the half-way-covenant, which you thought the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted might do; your former miniſter, in the time of it, thought the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples you acted upon were wrong; but, for peace ſake, ſuffered you to take your courſe, and this confirmed you in your error.—Now he tells you plainly, "there is no half-way-covenant;" and he that is qualified to have his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized is equally qualified for the Lord's table.—You are convinced —you give up the half-way-covenant; and to be conſiſtent, you muſt now give up the half-way-practice too. For, according to your own conſcience, you are now as fit for one ordinance as for the other; and to ſay you dare not come, is expreſly to contradict yourſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But what if I had been conſcience bound? And what if no one could have convinced me? In ſuch a caſe as this, ſurely it would be the duty of a miniſter to bear with one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And what if you was about to ſign a bond of £. 1000 to a merchant for a pearl of great price? And what if you thought it to be £. 1000 old tenor? A good bargain, think you. And what if in this view you was greatly engaged to ſtrike the bargain? Conſcience bound! and was ſo bad a reader, as not to obſerve it was plainly written £. 1000 ſterling.—Now, nothing can open your eyes, and hinder your ſigning the bond, and binding yourſelf to ten times as much as you are worth in the world, or would be willing to give; but the plain truth—the merchant fees your miſtake—ſhall he tell you the truth, wake you up from the pleaſing dream, or let you go on in your error?—the anſwer is eaſy.—Oh, how many poor ſouls are there, who know not what they are about, when they own the covenant!—Pray, my dear ſir, how do you underſtand the covenant of grace, and covenanting tranſactions?</p>

               <p>I am told, that the covenant of grace requires real holineſs, even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And yet that men, who know they have no grace, may enter into this covenant with a good conſcience, without being guilty of lying. p. 8, 9.</p>

               <p>How can you with a good conſcience profeſs that to be true, which you know, in the time of it, is not true?</p>
               <p>This is thought to be lying in our dealing between man and man; and why not in our tranſactions with the heart-ſearching God?</p>

               <p>But do you not remember the high charge which God afterwards exhibited againſt them by the divinely inſpired pſalmiſt. <hi>They did flatter him with their lips, and they lied unto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſteadfaſt in his covenant.</hi> Pſ. 78, 36, 37. And do you not remember that the carcaſes of this wicked hypocritical gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fell in the wilderneſs? And do you not know, that theſe things were written for our warning that we might not ſin and periſh, as they did; and not for our imitation? And if they are thus charged by God with lying, for profeſſing that to be true which was not ſo, altho' in the time of it, for aught appears, they thought it was; how will God look upon you, if you profeſs that, which, in the time of it, you know to be falſe? Can wilful lying be called an inſtituting means of grace, which is ſo plainly contrary to the light of nature? Can this be preached up as a means of converſion, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends to harden men in ſin? Aſk the wiſeſt man that ever lived under that diſpenſation, and he will tell you, <hi>Better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi> Eccl. 5.5.—And if that people acted hypocritically in the time of <hi>Aſa,</hi> as is intimated p. 9. whether juſtly or not, we need not ſtand to enquire, for if they did, they muſt fall under the ſame condemnation with their forefathers: And their wicked example is not to be your pattern, but the law of God is your only rule.</p>

               <p>No, ſir, by no means. I do not believe a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace is neceſſary in order to ſealing ordinances. This was not required of the Iſraelites by Moſes, nor of the Jews by John baptiſt, or by Chriſt, or his apoſtles. p. 8—12.</p>

               <p>What then! We are to profeſs a compliance with no covenant at all, it ſeems! Not with the half-way-covenant; for there is none.—Not with the covenant of grace; for this never was required.—And there is no other covenant.—It therefore follows, according to you, that we are to enter into covenant with God viſibly, without profeſſing to comply with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at all, what ſay you to this?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard that it hath been ſaid, that a man who knows he has no grace, may profeſs to comply with the covenant of grace, with moral ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And why might not Annanias and Sapphira be ſuppoſed to exerciſe moral ſincerity in their profeſſion, as well, when they brought their money, and laid it at the apoſtle's feet, and ſaid, <hi>this is all;</hi> altho' they knew what they ſaid was not true? For, if we profeſs ſupreme love to God and Chriſt, &amp;c. when we know there is none in our hearts, we do ſay that which we know is not true, as really as they did. And if we do not profeſs ſupreme love to God and Chriſt, &amp;c. we do not profeſs a compliance with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and ſo do not viſibly enter into covenant with God, and ſo are not viſible diſciples of Chriſt, nor can we claim the peculiar privileges of ſuch. When therefore your miniſter, ſpeaking of that covenant with God, which profeſſors publickly enter into, in our churches, previous to their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpecial ordinances, ſaid, "there is no half-way-covenant"—"no one diſputes it being the covenant of grace"—"no one dare deny it." He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly yielded up every point for which we contend. Nor do I doubt, if this controverſy ſhould go on, it will ſoon publickly appear, that there is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011173_0007_0F857FD65E408D78"/>

               <p>Sir, I feel myſelf pinched. I cannot get out. I muſt therefore deny that it is the covenant of grace, that is to be owned, and by conſequence I muſt ſay, that a profeſſion of a compliance with no covenant at all, is neceſſary in order to ſealing ordinances. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">To own the covenant, i. e. to own that we are in duty bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the covenant of grace, and at the ſame time knowingly not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, notwithſtanding all obligations, is not really to enter into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, as in duty we are bound, but really to reject the covenant of God, to reject God and the Redeemer. And to profeſs to own the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this ſenſe, is not a viſible entering into covenant with God. Such a profeſſion is not a covenanting tranſaction.</note> For there is no other covenant, but the covenant of grace. But this would condemn the practice of all our churches in a lump. For they all have their covenants. What ſhall I do?</p>

and ſome, another.—Some mean the covenant of grace, externally exhibited by God in his word, and externally complied with in a profeſſion of godlineſs. Others mean a covenant requiring only external obedience, in diſtinction from heart-holineſs.—Thus ſome ſuppoſe the Sinai covenant required merely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience—and was eſſentially a diſtinct and different thing from the covenant of grace—and ſome ſuppoſe the baptiſmal covenant not to be the covenant of grace, but a covenant requiring external obedience only.—I am of opinion theſe ungracious covenants are creatures of the imagination, a mere human device, for reaſons I have already hinted at.—But the practice of allowing ſealing ordinances, to thoſe who know themſelves to be graceleſs, can be vindicated only on the ſuppoſition of ſuch an ungracious covenant: and indeed, this is the only point that need be ſettled, to ſettle the whole controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; for if a compliance with the covenant of grace muſt be profeſſed, thoſe who know they have no grace cannot make a profeſſion.</p>

The Jews univerſally circumciſed their children, attended the ſacrifice of the paſſover, and all their other ſacrifices and ordinances, let them be ever ſo openly and ſcandalouſly wicked, even altho' they lived in idolatry; and why ſhould we not do ſo too, in the chriſtian world? Why ſhould not we as univerſally attend ſacraments, as we do public worſhip on the ſabbath?</p>

               <p>God has never told us that <hi>the example of that wicked hypocritical people ſhould be the rule of our conduct.</hi> This point, you ſeem to take for granted; but it is not allowed.

               <p>Not in the manner in which they did. For if our Saviour underſtood the law of Moſes, all the duties required in it, the Jews were obliged by their law to perform, in a gracious manner. i. e. from love; from love to God and man. For <hi>on theſe two hang all the law and the prophets.</hi> Mat. 22.37 — 40.</p>

               <p>Thoſe ſinners are more likely to be converted, who attend the common means of grace, than thoſe who do not: for, <hi>how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi> Rom. 10.14 Nevertheleſs, as to covenanting tranſactions, the words of the wiſe man are the truth. Eccl. 5 5. <hi>Better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi> It is better to do nothing than to lie. Lying is not a means of grace—It is not an appointed means of converſion. Pſa. 50.16. <hi>But unto the wicked God ſaith, what haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my covenant in thy mouth?</hi> But graceleſs men may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend common means without lying.</p>

the common way? Some of the good kings of Judah reformed things as far as they could: <hi>Nevertheleſs the high places were not taken away.</hi> If the half way practice cannot be vindicated from the word of God; yet is it not beſt to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it?

            <p>In popiſh countries they are inſtructed to believe, that the laity may take Chriſt's body and eat it, but may not drink his blood. And no doubt thouſands of the common people think it a very wicked thing to drink one drop of the ſacramental wine. They dare come to the altar, as they call it; they dare take and eat Chriſt's body; but their conſciences are ſo tender they dare not taſte the wine. But, pray, whence ariſe their ſcruples? not from the bible. There is not a tittle in the bible that looks that way. They are as expreſsly commanded to take the cup and drink it, as to take the bread and eat it So the command to all Chriſt's diſciples is equally plain in the preſent caſe, as is granted. Every parent who has a right to baptiſm, for his children is expreſsly enjoined to attend the Lord's Supper, as is allowed; but if with light and in love we vindicate this, and practice accordingly, "you tremble for the awful conſequences."—The clergy among the papiſts, if they would unite, as one man, might ſoon rectify the judgments of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and remove all their ſcruples, and bring on a general reformation without any "awful conſequences," in that caſe. So the clergy might in our churches, in this caſe. Both caſes as they ſtand in the bible are equally plain. And are not the popiſh clergy to blame for not teaching their people the truth plainly, all as one man?—'Tis true, if a few popiſh clergy men ſhould come out boldly, and declare plainly, that the laity have as good a right to one element as to the other, and practice accordingly; they would ſoon be ſilenced, if not ſomething worſe. But is it therefore lawful and right for them to go on in their half-way-practice, contrary to the divine inſtitution, to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>void this "awful conſequence"? are they not bound to abide by and act agreeable to Chriſt's inſtitution at the riſque of their lives? Luke 14.25—33.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, what ſhall we do to avoid "the awful conſequences? Shall we give up the covenent of grace, and ſubſtitute in its room a covenant requiring no holineſs, nothing but external duties, to ſuit the taſte of wicked men? Or, if we keep the covenant of grace, ſhall we tolerate wilful lying in the worſhip of God, by leading thoſe, who know themſelves to be graceleſs, to make a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in order to keep peace? Is ſuch wickedneſs as this neceſſary to a quiet life? Can it be?
