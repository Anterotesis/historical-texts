            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>By the Reverend, Old Mr. <hi>JOHN COTTON,</hi> At <hi>Salem, June,</hi> 1636.</head>
            <p>HAving been moved by your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Elders, and ſome Others, to Speak a Word of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Exhortation;</hi> I thought it meet to begin with ſome word of <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the firſt coming over of ſome of our Honoured Magiſtrates, it ſo fell out, That they did Arrive at this Congregation, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament being near to be Adminiſtred, and a Child being Born to one of them; they themſelves could neither be admitted to the Lord's Table, nor their Child to Baptiſm: When I my ſelf heard of this, I Wrote unto the Paſtor of this Congregation (now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed) doubting of the Lawfulneſs of that practiſe; Thinking then, That the Faithful and Godly Men coming where the Seals
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001603_0003_0FB3E6A0DDA8D1B8"/>
were to be diſpenſed, and having right unto the Covenant, had right alſo unto the Seals thereof, and ſo that their Children had right unto the former Seal of Baptiſm Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I wrote to that purpoſe, as I conceived, then requiſite. It pleaſed God that he ſent me a large and loving Anſwer; but through the extremity of Sickneſs then upon me, I could not Read it; and after-wards being ſhuffled among other Papers, I could never find it to this very day: But what might have been for Inſtruction to me from his Letters, the Lord hath ſince ſhewed unto me by diligent ſearch of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>So that however I apprehended the Matter at that time, there was juſt Reaſon for what was done: And now leſt I ſhould ſeem to alter my judgment herein without ſome weighty Cauſe, Let me tell you what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me, to cauſe me to Aſſent to the judgment and practiſe of the Churches here.</p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>The Reaſons are Two.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt is taken from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto whom it doth belong. I formerly conceived, That unto all the Faithful the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001603_0004_0FB3E6A247BAF548"/>
did belong, and unto their Seed alſo, not conſidering, that which ſince I have learned &amp; found, That the Covenant which is made to Me, and to my Seed, <hi>Is not made to the Righteouſneſs of Faith at large, But to them that are Righteous by the Faith of the Seed of Abraham; that is, to ſuch Believers as are Confederate with Abraham.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, That though Circumciſion the old Seal of the Covenant (anſwerable to our Baptiſm) was Adminiſtred to all the Seed of Abraham, <hi>Yet not unto thoſe godly Men that Believed in his Age:</hi> For Abraham and his Family were then the only viſible Church of God upon the Face of the Earth. And though Melchizedeck lived at that time, who was an heir of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, yet not of the Covenant of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, unleſs he will joyn himſelf to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Nor <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, though he was a Man none like him upon the Face of the Earth; nor his Friends; <hi>Men fearing God,</hi> in their Generation, were yet uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Circumciſion, unleſs they had joyned themſelves to the Family of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And therefore you ſhall never read that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belongeth to Me, and to my Seed,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001603_0005_0FB3E6A3C1DA4DE0"/>
unleſs I be of the Seed of Abraham, or joyned to the Family of Abraham. So we ſhall find it in the Sanction of the Second Commandment, <hi>That the Lord ſheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thouſands of the Generations of ſuch as Love and Fear Him:</hi> That Commandment hath reſpect to God's Inſtituted Ordinances. Let <hi>Jonah</hi> go to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and by the bleſſing of God prevail with Thouſands, then the Covenant of Grace belongs to them; but What? to their Seed alſo? No, verily not, unleſs their Parents were Confederate to the Seed of Abraham. So that if you deſire Mercy to you, and to your Seed, <hi>Keep then to the Ordinances, and to the God of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and ſo you ſhall keep a conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the Covenant to you, and to your Seed; for unleſs Men injoy the Covenant this way, it aoth not belong unto their Seed.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not conſidered, I fear, hath brought great Miſchief to all the Churches that have not attended unto this Principle, and hath been an occaſion of much Miſtake to many godly Parents, who plead their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for their Seed, and many times ſo find little bleſſing; for though God hath made a Covenant with them, yet it is but
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001603_0006_0FB3E6A53A2ABB58"/>
as a Scattered Stone, not laid orderly in any building; ſo that truly they may plead; but when God cometh to Anſwer, He will make it appear, That He did never open His Mouth for a Covenant with their Seed until they be Confederate with Abraham.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing my Letter, as I underſtand, is in many of your hands, I had rather make a Plaiſter bigger than the Sore, than that it ſhould be pleaded againſt my practiſe after my Departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Second Reaſon is this, Unto them that are not in Covenant, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may not diſpence an act of Power and intrude himſelf, neither hath he any Power until he be Called; and then only over ſuch as Call him: And therefore if you ſhould come to crave Baptiſm for your Children, or the Lord's Supper for your ſelves, of a Miniſter whom you have not Called over you, he hath no Power, and therefore unto you he cannot diſpence an act of Power: So that although the hearts of God's People might be inlarged many times, to do ſuch things, <hi>Yet the Law of the Lords Goſpel
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001603_0007_0FB3E6A6BB7DC838"/>
doth Reſtrain them, until Men have entred into Covenant, and not their own ſtrait laced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that keeps them back from diſpencing ſuch things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Third <hi>Reaſon</hi> which is Coincident with the Second, and ſerveth to amplify the Point, That they have no Power over you, it will plainly appear from this ground; They that have no Power to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate you, they have no Power to Admit you to Communion with them; But till you joyn your ſelves in Covenant with the Church, they have no Power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; Therefore till then, they have no Power to Admit you to Communion with them, for there is the like reaſon of both.</p>
               <p>Now having expreſſed this Word of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> together with my acknowledgment of my dependance upon the Lord for grief and ſorrow; I this deſire, That if my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remain Written in any of your hands, you would not now look at it as my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though ſometime it was, yet now you have heard it retracted again by me, Profeſſing alſo, that if any thing which I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001603_0008_0FB3E6A841EC7A38"/>
have ſince Written or Spoken, God give me to ſee it, appear different from the Truth, I will retract it alſo; in the mean time blame me not, if I do not retract it.</p>

But in this latter Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, He will remember their Sins no more, and therefore He doth ſpeak of the Old Teſtament, as of that which doth vaniſh away, but for the New Teſtament, He will eſtabliſh that; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is written, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with them, to do them good; but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> The like we alſo read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 60. <hi>Tho' they have deſpiſed the Oath in breaking the Covenant; nevertheleſs, I will remember my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee in the days of thy Youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> And
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001603_0011_0FB3E6AD8D916B50"/>
wherein doth it differ from the Old Covenant? I know not better how to explain it than by laying both of them together, both the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and this New Covenant, which he doth more renew in the dayes of the New Teſtament. In the Old Covenant you may obſerve a four-fold act of God, and a double act of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Lord doth prepare his People, and calleth them to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and there reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himſelf in Thundrings and Lightnings, and flames of Fire, ſo that the ſtouteſt Spirits amongſt them quaked; and <hi>Moſes</hi> tho' a Man full of faith, yet he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I exceedingly tremble and fear;</hi> and ſo did all the People; and when they heard the voice of the Thunders, and ſaw the Lightnings: <hi>Exod</hi> 20.18. <hi>to</hi> 21. They ſaid to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God Speak with us leſt we die.</hi> Thus did the Lord prepare them by breaking, for if the Lord do intend ſome real and ſerious work, He will then ſhake the foundation of the ſtubborneſs of their hearts, and bring them to ſee their own ſtubborneſs and baſeneſs, for elſe they would deſpiſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Second act of God is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which He doth put forth, wherein He doth require an exact Obedience unto all the Commandments of the Law, and to his Statutes &amp; Judgments: Exod. 19.5. <hi>If you will obey my voice indeed, ſaith the Lord, and keep my Covenant; then you ſhall be my peculiar treaſure above all People.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001603_0012_0FB3E6AF1C65A358"/>
Now this Covenant of God conſiſteth of Moral Laws, and Statutes and Judgments, unto all which He doth require Obedience, even to all that is written in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Lord doth profeſs unto them all that ſhould keep Covenant, That they ſhould Live by keeping Covenant. And this is the Grand and Principle Promiſe wraping up all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. And the Apoſtle doth Interpret the meaning of that Promiſe: Gal. 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of faith, but the man that doth theſe things ſhall Live in them:</hi> and this is the Promiſe of Life which God giveth to thoſe that keep Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> The fourth act of God in making this Covenant is, a heavy threatning of a curſe to any that ſhall break theſe Commandments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.22. Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are two acts of the People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They do profeſs univerſal Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Commandments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19 8. Twice they repeat it, <hi>All that the Lord ſhall ſay unto us, we will bear it, and do it.</hi> Only conſider this, They Promiſe it in ſome kind of opinion of their own Strength, without any ſenſe or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Inſufficiency; like men under pangs of Conſcience, they do believe that they ſhall be able to keep and do all that the Lord ſhall ſay unto them. <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them!</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. Or as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001603_0013_0FB3E6B08C65DFB8"/>
the word is in the Original; <hi>Who ſhall give them ſuch a heart?</hi> But this they Promiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They yield themſelves to be accurſed of God, if they ſhall not keep that Covenant; and therefore when it was pronounced, <hi>Curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that continueth not in all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law to do them, all the People did ſay, Amen;</hi> and ſo their faith lay upon a curſe: This is the Old Covenant that God made with his People, and is called a Covenant of Works; the Lord requireth Righteouſneſs and Works, He Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Life to their Works, and they ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to enter into a curſe. Now this was a temporal Covenant; this my Covenant they brake, ſaith the Lord; and they did quickly turn aſide from the wayes of the Lord, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> when he cometh and ſeeth the Calf which they had made, he brake the Tables of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now for the Covenant that is Everlaſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may obſerve therein alſo four acts of God towards his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> Look as He prepareth the other by a Spirit of Bondage, ſo he doth prepare theſe for His Everlaſting Covenant, by a Spirit of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they are Poor and Afflicted in Spirit, in ſenſe of their own Unworthineſs &amp; Inſufficiency, that which the Lord doth wiſh to the other, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. He worketh in theſe: Zeph. 3.12. <hi>There ſhall be brought home to Zion a Poor and an Afflicted People:</hi> He meaneth not in reſpect of their civil Eſtates, for there was not a feeble People amongſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001603_0014_0FB3E6B202086E78"/>
them; but as they ſtood in their Spirits, they were empty, and as they thought deſtitute of God, and therefore ſhould ſeek the Lord and his Face, and his Strength, like thoſe that had loſt both Church and Covenant; unto thoſe the Lord will have an Eye, and He will dwell with men of a contrite Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15, 16. And therefore with a bleſſing unto theſe, the Lord Chriſt doth begin His Sermon in the Mount: Matt. 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit.</hi> He doth not only afflict them with a Spirit of Bondage; but when he cometh to make a Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> the People are inſufficient to do all which the Lord requireth; and this is a Spirit of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> When the Lord hath brought His People to be Poor in Spirit, He doth then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He giveth Him for a Covenant: Iſai 42 6. <hi>I have called thee in Righteouſneſs: I will give thee for a Covenant unto the Gentiles.</hi> When the Lord maketh a Covenant of Grace, this is the gift of God; this is the Principal bleſſing of the Covenant, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49 8. And the Lord will not give Life in them to keep, and by them to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but Jeſus Chriſt for both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Jeſus Chriſt He doth give Everlaſting Communion with Him. Through Chriſt He will take away the Stony heart, and give a heart of fleſh; and He will bring with Him Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. That is to ſay,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001603_0015_0FB3E6B387192B50"/>
Such Pardon of Sin as He will never revoke more, that Juſtification which He will work in Chriſt, He will never repent of; and therefore he ſaith, Jer 31.34. <hi>He will remember their Sins no more:</hi> and for their Sanctification He Promiſeth, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And ſo in all the bleſſings of the Covenant, the Lord will give an Everlaſting Union and Communion with Him, in the injoyment of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Theſe three things the Lord doth require.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith:</hi> That is to ſay a yielding of the Soul to the Lord, as unable for this work, and yet to wait upon Him for Righteouſneſs: Ezek. 36.37. <hi>I will be enquired for this of the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> Not only to be ſought unto for the Mercy, but I will be ſought, that is, They ſhall ſeek me, they ſhall ſeek his face and his ſtrength to do it all for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth require the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Faith: and this is expreſsly called for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. That is, for ſuch Righteouſneſs, as none can work by any Graces of their own; but which being wrought in them doth put life and ſtrength into all their duties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth require of his People that they ſhould be of a Melting frame of Spirit, in regard of all their Whoriſhneſs, whereby they have prophaned His Name; they ſhall wail and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone this: and therefore it is ſaid of them in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001603_0016_0FB3E6B4F0108120"/>
the verſe before the Text, That Weeping they ſhould go, for all the Evils that they have wrought in God's ſight: And this is that which we read: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that eſcape of you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me among the Nations whither they ſhall be carried Captives, becauſe I am broken with their who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which go a whoring after their Idols: and they ſhall loath themſelves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</hi> This doth the Lord require of his People: but obſerve this withal, that He doth not require it in a way of a Legal command, but with an alſufficient Vertue, whereby He will work in them what He doth require; ſo that doth He require, that they ſhould walk holily before Him, He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth alſo work this, for in this Everlaſting Covenant, the Commandments of God are Promiſes; for this will I be inquired, even to do all that he doth require: Zeph. 3.12. <hi>They ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord.</hi> And ſo for the Obedience of Faith: Ezek. 36.27. <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and you ſhall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi> He will make us able to do it, and willing to do it, and <hi>ſo</hi> to do it. And this is the true meaning of all that the Lord doth require in the Everlaſting Covenant; when He doth Command He doth Promiſe. Doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſeeking of Him? He will put his Spirit within us: Doth he require weeping &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? He will pour down a Spirit of Grace and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001603_0017_0FB3E6B68E66C098"/>
Supplication, and they ſhall ſeek him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn for him, <hi>Zeck.</hi> 12.10. So that this is the Everlaſting Covenant. The Lord prepareth the heart: certain duties indeed he doth lay upon them; as to believe in his Name, to yield the obedience of Faith, and to mourn for him; and he doth convey an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power to work them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> The fourth act is an act of Curſing belonging to this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To them that do not receive it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To thoſe that do Apoſtate from it: To them that do not receive it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3. If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, received a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if neglect ſo great Salvation? The neglecting of it brings deſperate Miſery.</p>
               <p>To thoſe that do Apoſtate from it: Heb. 10.29. <hi>Of how much ſorer Puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy of who have trodden under foot the Son of God, and have counted the blood of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were ſanctified, an unholy thing, &amp; have done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> This Covenant is that which is ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1. beſide the Covenant made in Mount <hi>Horeb:</hi> and to this Covenant belongeth a heavy curſe: Deut. 30.17, 18. <hi>If thy heart turn away that thou wilt not bear, but ſhalt be drawn away, and worſhip other gods, and ſerve them, I denounce unto you this day, that ye ſhall ſurely periſh, and that ye ſhall not prolong your dayes upon the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001603_0018_0FB3E6B80D219A50"/>
Land whither thou paſſeſt over Jordan to poſſeſs it.</hi> And that it is the Covenant of Grace, we may perceive by comparing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 11. to the 14. with, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.6. So that we may ſee the Lord doth threaten a heavy curſe to fall upon them that tranſgreſs this Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now for the Peoples part: Their acts are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They fall down before the Lord confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Unworthineſs of any Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Confeſſing their own Inability and want of Strength; and this is that which Joſhua la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to poſſeſs the People with, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.19. There he telleth them, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve the Lord your God;</hi> that they might not truſt in their own Strength: and therefore when the Lord doth make this Covenat with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he fell on his face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3. in ſenſe of his own Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</p>
               <p>Why this Covenant is ſuch an Everlaſting Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Is from the Root &amp; Fountain of it: Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an Everlaſting love, therefore with Mercy have I drawn thee.</hi> What moveth the Lord to be thus earneſt and zealous in drawing men to Chriſt? <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>except the Father which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. How cometh this to paſs? <hi>I have loved thee with an Everlaſting love, therefore have I drawn thee.</hi> Now He will carry his work an end in His with a mighty Power, thro' all the backwardneſs of their own Spirits:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001603_0019_0FB3E6B9B4CAA600"/>
And this is the ground mentioned: Pſal 111. 4, 5, 9. <hi>The Lord as Merciful and full of Compaſſion, He will be mindful of his Covenant for ever: He hath ſent Redemption to his People, and commandeth his Covenant for ever.</hi> And how cometh this to paſs? His Redeeming love is the cauſe of it; as the Covenant of works ſpringeth from his Juſtice; and hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The Commandment is holy and juſt and good;</hi> if the Creature keep Covenant, the Lord will reward; but if not He will puniſh; but to whom his Covenant is from love and mercy, them he will draw with Everlaſting Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another principal Reaſon is taken from the Surety; though the Iſraelites had <hi>Moſes</hi> for a Mediator, yet they had him not for a Surety. Now Jeſus Chriſt is made the Surety of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.6. A Surety is not for a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for a Covenant; no need is of a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on God's part, He never brake Covenant with any: but if a Surety be needful, doubtleſs it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on our part; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant,</hi> even Chriſt Himſelf: Iſai. 55.2, 3. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with thee, even the ſure Mercies of David: Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the People.</hi> And hence it is that all the Promiſes of this Covenant are made directly to Jeſus Chriſt; the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made to the People, but this is made to Chriſt. To <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed were Promiſes made, he ſpeaketh not of his Seeds, as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001603_0020_0FB3E6BAF4D1BA80"/>
of many, but as of One even Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. And in Him the Promiſes are yea and Amen to us; yea, that is affirmed, <hi>Amen;</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: ſo long therefore as this Church keepeth her to Chriſt, and holdeth Chriſt for her Head and Husband, the Lord doth keep Covenant; and he hath Promiſed to the Elect Seed, That they ſhall keep Covenant, for he hath ſaid, They ſhall not depart from Chriſt, and then they can never depart from the Covenant, and tho' they break Covenant, yet if they keep cloſe unto Chriſt, they have the Covenant, although they break it. And tho' you read of a Temporary faith, that doth endure for a ſeaſon, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.20, 21. And ſo in the parallel place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3 13. You ſhall read. That they are of the Stony Soyl, that receive the word with joy, and for a time believe; and ſo for a time receive ſundry Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, and that with joy; and ſome with fear and trembling alſo, as the thorny Soyl, for they want not depth of Earth, but are deeply humbled, and yet bring forth no fruit unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe they are not brought to that faith in Jeſus Chriſt by which they are Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now therefore ſo long as this Covenant is kept, and ſo long as the Members of the Church keep cloſe to Chriſt, ſo long this Covenant is not broken. And hence it is that when the Jews had committed the greateſt Sin that ever was committed upon the face of the Earth, yet the Apoſtles did not break Communion with them,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001603_0021_0FB3E6BC73A7F7F0"/>
notwithſtanding that fearful injury of putting to death the Lord of Life; becauſe they might have done it of Ignorance, and therefore, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.1. they went and joyned with him in Prayer; why did not they know that they had Crucified a juſt Man? and is not this a horrible Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant? No, no, Brethren, this will not break an Everlaſting Covenant. <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do;</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Prayeth for them, the Apoſtles keep Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them; here is the Spirit of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of his bleſſed Apoſtles: but when they do put away known Chriſt <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45, 46. when they contradicted and blaſphemed, then what ſayes the Apoſtles? <hi>It was neceſſary the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken unto you, but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> And ſo alſo it was a dreadful proceeding which they uſe in this caſe: Act. 19.7, 8, 9. <hi>He went into the Synagogue, &amp; ſpake boldly for the ſpace of three months, diſputing &amp; perſwading the things concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. But when divers were hardened, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, but ſpake evil of that way before the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he departed from them, and ſeparated the Diſciples,</hi>— So mark you what it is that doth diſſolve this Everlaſting Covenant; not this that they Kill the Meſſias; it was a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Murder; but yet they may not ſeparate for Murder: What! if it be the Eternal Son of God!

And afterwards when the Lord would caſt off his People: Zech. 11.10, 14. <hi>He brake the ſtaff of Beauty, and the ſtaff of Bands:</hi> This now followeth, that ſo many of us, as have come to the Ordinances of God, and have partaken of the Seals of the Covenant, and have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Covenant, have violated the Seals of the Covenant which have not been given to the Elect of God in general, but to the Church of God; and therefore look at the Covenant by which you have entred here, as the ability of your State, which by no changes you are for ever to be removed from, but may for ever keep it by fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. II.</hi> In the Second Place, Let me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke my Self, and all my Brethren, and all the Churches to Conſider, What kind of Covenant you have entred, or will enter into: if you ſhall come hither into this Country, and ſhall here confeſs your Sins, that you have prophaned the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001603_0024_0FB3E6C1AF5051E8"/>
Name of God withal, if you take Chriſt for your King, and Prieſt &amp; Prophet, and if you ſhall profeſs to walk in all his ways, this may all be but a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>The Elders of the Church propound it, Will you renounce all your Sinful Pollutions? Will you keep Covenant? And enter into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Church, and take Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to walk after all God's Ordinances? You Anſwer, All this we will do; all this is no more than the Old Covenant: For you are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived if you think there was no ſpeech of Chriſt in the Covenant of works. What were the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies but ſhadows of Chriſt? What was the laying the hand on the head of the Sacrifice, but the laying hold upon Chriſt Jeſus? What was the blood of the Sacrifice? Was it not the blood of Chriſt? And what was the Atonement by that blood? Was it not the Atonement which is by Chriſt? All the underſtanding Iſraelites did ſee that theſe things did point at Chriſt. Now, if we do enter into a Covenant to keep the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Law, of the Goſpel, and of the Civil State, (for that was the tripartive Covenant) all this may be but a Covenant of Works. What then muſt we do? We muſt fall down before the Lord in our Spirits, and profeſs our ſelves inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep any Covenant, and profeſs our ſelves unworthy that the Lord ſhould keep any Covenant with us; as to ſay, <hi>Lord! who am I? Or what is my Fathers houſe, that the Lord ſhould ever
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001603_0025_0FB3E6C336317960"/>
look upon ſuch a poor Soul as I am?</hi> What doth the Church lay hold upon duties, and there's an end? No, no, There are no true Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, but they muſt be drawn out of themſelves by a Spirit of Bondage, and unto Chriſt by a Spirit of Poverty; and then a Soul ſeeth there is much in Chriſt, but he cannot hope there is any thing for him: Now the Lord doth draw a man on to Chriſt Jeſus, and calleth him to believe in Chriſt, but yet he is not able to reach Him. Now then, if the Lord draw the Soul to depend upon Chriſt, and ſhall go forth, and not undertake any thing in his own Strength; ſo you will keep it by the Strength of the Lord alſo; now the Lord will have Peace with you, and the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt you. Build a Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other foundation but Faith, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, and it will break into manifold diſtempers. But if the Church be built upon this Rock; Storms and Winds will not ſo much as ſhake it, it being built upon Faith, and Faith upon Chriſt Jeſus: by this means the Covenant will keep us conſtantly, ſweetly, and fruitfully, in an everlaſting kind of Serviceable-uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. III.</hi> The Uſe in the third Place, is of Direction, Upon what terms you may Separate. Suppoſe the Church Promiſe never to defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more with any Pollutions of the Sons of men, but they do defile themſelves, then Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is broken; they did Covenant they would

not come into falſe Aſſemblies, &amp; that they would have no fellowſhip with them, that did allow of falſe Aſſemblies; but this Covenant cometh to be broken: If this be your Covenant, it is but a Covenant of Works, and then no marvel tho' it do break &amp; fail, ſeeing it ſtands upon duties, and keeping of duties; for being built upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of duties, and ſtanding upon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties, &amp; being broken upon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duties, this is but a Covenant of Works; and yet you may be Married to Chriſt in this. You come and reſolve to walk in all Ordinances, and undertake to reform both Church &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth; in ſuch a Covenant the Lord is content to take you by the hand and become a Husband to you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.32. And what will a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band do, he will rejoyce with you, and you will find comfort in duties; your heart hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed that you may ſee you have Jeſus Chriſt in your boſome, He will alſo reveal Secrets unto you, he will caſt in Seeds of ſundry good things among you, ſo that you ſhall Prophecy in his Name, and have a Seed of Prayer, and many good things, and yet may want Everlaſting love; you may find much comfort, and yet you will find ſome or other to give offence, or ſome or other to take offence, and you will break with breaking upon breaking, until you be like Sheep without a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd. This is not the Covenant, therefore Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon which thou &amp; I muſt live in Church-fellowſhip everlaſtingly, tho' herein thou haſt had
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001603_0027_0FB3E6C62AF36450"/>
comfort, &amp; that unſpeakable; ſuch thou mayeſt have &amp; yet run upon a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond branch of this uſe may be to teach us where-upon a Man may build Separation Not upon breach of duty tho' they tranſgreſs, &amp; proſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Sabbaths, defiling themſelves with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean devices of men. Is the Covenant of Grace broken? It is not broken until you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced this People of their Sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.17. Becauſe, if the Covenant be a Covenant of Grace, Jeſus Chriſt doth ſtep in, &amp; all the breaches are faſtned upon him. When then is the Church of Chriſt broken from him? Not when ſhe doth Crucifie Him, nor when ſhe doth pluck the Crown of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty from His Head; theſe things ſhe may do of Ignorance: but when they are convinced that they have broken his Will, and tranſgreſſed the rule of His Goſpel: Now, if out of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, they will not ſee an error, but will have their own ways ſtill; now it is no Sin of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, no Sin of Infirmity. Now when men Sin not in Infirmity, not in Pang of a Paſſion, as <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, nor in Pang of a Luſt, as <hi>David</hi> when he committed Adultery, but when in cool blood, Men do reject the word of Life: Now, ſince they have put the word of God from them, you may break off from them, and the bleſſing of Him that dwelt in the buſh will be on your heads. When it cometh to this that the Church doth ſeparate from Chriſt, not from Chriſt, but from known Chriſt, &amp; not from known Chriſt

in weakneſs of Paſſion, or Luſt, but in cool blood; now the Lord in Heaven will ſpeak a bleſſing to your Separation; but if you will ſeparate upon any other ground, you go upon a Covenant of Works: And if there have been any tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Nature, Return, and Return again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. And this let me further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you, Let the Church look to her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and let no Member come in but he that <hi>Knoweth Chriſt,</hi> and that knoweth he is a <hi>Child of Wrath;</hi> and let him go on, not in his own Strength, but in a depending frame upon Jeſus Chriſt, and then all the World will know that you have made an Everlaſting Covenant: hold Chriſt, and hold the Covenant &amp; Promiſes, and Bleſſings of the Covenant.</p>

of Bondage, partly by a Spirit of Adoption: If you never found your ſelf a fire-brand of Hell, if your Conſcience were never afflicted with your dangerous Eſtate by Nature, you were never yet in Jeſus Chriſt. You will ſay, <hi>I truſt in Chriſt, and look to be ſaved by his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Were you ever afflicted with ſenſe of your own unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? If you ſay, No, I Pray you read, Joh. 8. 30, <hi>As he ſpake theſe things, many believed on him.</hi> They truſted on Him for Salvation. Did you then take the Covenant? ſee what followeth; <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, If you continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed. And you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free. They anſwered him, We be Abrahams ſeed, &amp; were never in bondage to any man:</hi> They were never acquainted with bondage; they hoped bondage belonged to any rather than to them, and was more fit for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles than for Jews. But what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth Sin, the ſame is the Servant of Sin. If the Son ſhall make you free, then ſhall you be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> And afterwards he telleth them, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil.</hi> For if a Soul were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet bruiſed with Sin, and with the ſenſe of Sin, he never yet laid hold upon Chriſt, with a true Juſtifying Faith; ſuch an one will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Gods houſe for ever.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>You will ſay, Thoſe that are brought up under Chriſtian Parents, they are not affected with ſuch Terrors as others are, that have lived in roaring diſtempers, of them, it is great reaſon that God ſhould

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the State of ſuch Perſons be good, I profeſs, I do not know how to Intrepret the Speech of Chriſt. Theſe men are the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet if they do not ſee their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they are not free by the Son; there is difference in the meaſure of the Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; as there is difference betwixt the Launc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; Pricking of a Boil, and yet both let out the Corruption, the one with a leſſer, the other with a greater iſſue: therefore if the Lord doth not cut thee off from all thy good Education, believe it, thou art not yet in Chriſt, this faith of thine will fail thee, if thou ſo liveſt, and ſo dyeſt.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But thou wilt ſay, I know the Pangs of Conſcience, and the terrors of it, and I have ſeen the error of my way, and have caſt off my leud Company; and ſince I know that the Lord requireth that I ſhould ſeek him in Church Eſtate; I have come ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Miles for that end, and I could not endure to ſee ſuch things as are done by the devices of men: will not this hold?</hi>

I go to Chriſt, and deſire him to ſprinkle me with the blood of his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001603_0031_0FB3E6CC2BF426C8"/>
Covenant. Is not this a ſafe Eſtate? Truly this is no more than the very Covenant of Works, which the People of Iſrael entred into at <hi>Horeb,</hi> the Lord ſhook the foundations of their hearts; upon it they entred into a Covenant; <hi>All that God commandeth us, we will hear it and do it;</hi> and if they did offend, they then go to the appointed Sacrifice; and what, ſaith the Soul in ſuch a caſe? <hi>I thank God, I find ſome Peace to my Conſcience.</hi> All this you may do, you may reform your Selves and Families, and Churches; and when you fail at any time, you may return to Chriſt, and He may give you ſome remorſe, as he did to the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36. All this may be by a Spirit of Bondage: <hi>He in Mercy forgave their Iniquities, and deſtroyed them not.</hi> So they may come to have their Sins Pardoned, but this kind of Pardon, is but a reprievement; it is not in everlaſting Righteouſneſs &amp; Mercy: they Pray for Chriſt, and Mercy, and He doth ſprinkle them, and then they ſee &amp; find, that the Lord hath been Merciful unto them: but this will not do, the Lord will ſoon call back ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as may plainly appear: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.28. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man owed his Lord ten thouſand talents, but when he had nothing to pay, he fell down at his Maſters feet, and ſaid, <hi>Have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all;</hi> his Maſter had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him, and looſed him, and let him go; was this in everlaſting Mercy? See what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, This fellow would pay all; and thus it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001603_0032_0FB3E6CDAE040398"/>
is with theſe men, that have been under a Spirit of Bondage, they will cry hard for Mercy, and Promiſe to pay all in time; and now in their dealings with their Brethren, they are full of Senſoriouſneſs, and will not bate an inch of any Covenant; and they will take a man by the throat, tho' it be but for an hundred Pence: and then what ſaith the Lord of ſuch a Servant? Oh! thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee that great debt, ſhouldeſt not thou have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of thy fellow Servant? he is then wroth, and delivers him up to the tormentors, until he hath paid the utmoſt farthing; even ſo ſhall my heavenly Father do unto you. When men have received eaſe from God, and then are ſtreight laced towards their Brethren, then doth the Lord revoke his Pardon, So that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no aſſurance that God hath made an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with us. And mind you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, All the Graces that you have laid hold upon, have ſprung from your own Righteouſneſs. Thou haſt taken a Promiſe, Did it belong to thee? if not it will fail you; you ſay you have been humbled, and come to Chriſt, and He hath refreſhed you, mark where upon it is built; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your humiliation? No, but I come to Chriſt, Do you ſo? Who brought you to Chriſt? He ſaith, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him.</hi> Now, come to ſuch an one, and ſay, Go to Prayer; ſaith the poor Soul, I cannot Pray; Be humbled, I cannot be humbled; apply Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001603_0033_0FB3E6CF34AB5A48"/>
they belong to any rather than to me: Such a frame of Spirit there is in every one whom the Father draweth: If you come to Chriſt by vertue of any thing which is in you, it is but a legal work. And I pray conſider, what it will amount unto, you will find, that theſe men will breed diſtraction in your Churches, ſuch Members will make no choice how they hear, or how they deal with their Brethren; look to it therefore carefully, when they come into the Church, for otherwiſe you will find everlaſting confuſion, rather than an everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now then, doth the Lord draw you to Chriſt, when you are broken in the ſenſe of your own Sins, and of your own Righteouſneſs? When you look at duties you are not able to do them, not able to hear or pray aright. If the Lord do thus draw you by his Everlaſting Arm, He will put a Spirit into you, that will cauſe you to wait for Chriſt, and to wait for Him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til He doth ſhew Mercy upon you; and if you may but find Mercy at the laſt, you will be quiet and contented with it. And whilſt you do with Patience &amp; Conſtancy wait, you are drawn with Everlaſting Love; now you have Chriſt in you, though you do not feel him: for as the Earth is hanged upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 26 7. So now there is a Place for Chriſt in the heart, when it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of every thing beſides; and ſuch a man hath Chriſt, and is bleſſed, and the Covenant of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001603_0034_0FB3E6D19ADE43F0"/>
Grace is his, you may ſafely receive him into your Church fellowſhip; and tho' he do neither know Chriſt nor his Covenant to be his, yet he will wait for him, knowing there is none in Heaven but Him, or in Earth in compariſon of Him. And you ſhall find ſuch Meek in Spirit &amp; Merciful, and Mourning for Sin: Theſe kind of Chriſtians will ſpring &amp; grow, and will not prophane the Covenant of God, nor the Covenant of the Church by any unmerciful Separation. Such neither ſtray on the right hand nor on the left; but when you do convince them, that they have Sinned againſt Chriſt and his Church, they will go &amp; complain bitterly of all the wrong they have done to Chriſt, &amp; his Church or Covenant, and Mourn for all the Prophanation of his Name: and for the grief that they have put upon the Spirits of his Brethren; and theſe are true Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites indeed, in whom there is no guile. Now cometh the Son with his Perſonal work, (as he ſaith, Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man knows the Father but the Son, &amp; be to whom the Son reveals him:</hi>) in which he doth ſhow the Soul, that all this former work was the mighty Hand of God, whereby he hath drawn the Soul unto Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; afterwards doth aſſure and clear it unto the Soul in ſome meaſure, that this way is the way wherein God leadeth all his Elect Ones. Now where the Son leadeth, the Holy Ghoſt beginneth to work his proper work in the Soul, and Sealeth all this to the Soul; for the Soul will not reſt in a weak
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001603_0035_0FB3E6D304C48908"/>
hope that Jeſus Chriſt is his, but doth ſeek for more &amp; better ſecurity of Jeſus Chriſt. If he have a Promiſe never ſo clear, yet it doth not quiet his Spirit fully, it doth ſtay him from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not from ſearching. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou ſhalt not dye;</hi> as plain a Promiſe as any could be, and <hi>David</hi> knew that he ſpake it from the word of the Lord. And what doth he now? Doth that ſatisfy? No verily. But many men who had run upon a Covenant of works, would have took it to themſelves: If they had been humbled, and after received; but a Child of God, tho' a Miniſter ſhould ſo convince him, that he could not deny but the Promiſe belongs to him, yet he ſearches further. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. Doth ſtill beg for Mercy, <hi>Have Mercy upon me, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Why, had not <hi>David</hi> been told that the Lord had put away his Sins, (for this Pſalm was Penned when <hi>Nathan</hi> had ſpoken to him, as appears by the title:) What would he have? Surely he ſaw need of further Mercy; <hi>Make me to hear the voice of joy &amp; gladneſs, &amp; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me with thy free Spirit:</hi> And thus he wreſtles with God and prays for it; according to what the Apoſtle ſpeaks: Eph. 1.13. <hi>In whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> And when the Soul hath received this, then doth he Sleep in quietneſs, and hath full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtill he doth yet depend on Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, fearing left he ſhould grieve &amp; quench the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001603_0036_0FB3E6D47555AFC0"/>
Spirit; and ſuch a Soul it is unto whom the Lord hath made an Everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p>If this man have broken any Law of God, you ſhall ſoon bring him about to ſee his Errors; and all this doth ſhew a man, he is a poor empty Creature; and this Soul is brought lower and lower, and nearer and nearer to Jeſus Chriſt. So if we do wiſely conſider this, it may ſerve to give us a taſte of diſcerning whether we be in an Everlaſting Covenant, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. V.</hi> The Uſe in the fifth Place, is of <hi>Conſolation</hi> unto all the faithful Servants of God, whom God hath made this Everlaſting Covenant withal: You will find that this will never be forgotten. You have entred into ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein Chriſt is yours, and the Covenant yours, and and all the Promiſes yours, and all the Bleſſings yours, and the whole World yours; and that which is the ſtrength of the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are yours Everlaſtingly, if the Lord bring you out of your ſelves, by a Spirit of Bondage, and unto Chriſt by a Spirit of Poverty; ſo that you wait upon him and cannot reſt, until Chriſt hath revealed Himſelf to you by his Spirit here is your Comfort, the Lord hath made with you an Everlaſting Covenant which ſhall never be forgotten. This was <hi>Davids</hi> comforts 2 Sam 2.3.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> Though my houſe do not flouriſh with Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, not in Ruling juſtly, as the Lord requires; tho' my Houſe be out of order, and Common Wealth out of order, yet he hath made an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant. God hath laid hold upon Chriſt, and Chriſt hath laid hold upon me, and this is his ſtay, &amp; comfort, altho' God make it not to grow. And I beſeech you conſider it, all thoſe that have temptations to Separation, and ſome that have conceits of too much liberty: It is not hearing that makes a man clean, as we may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.32, 33, 34. When they heard the Apoſtles ſpeak of the Reſurrection from the Dead, ſome mocked, and ſome ſaid, we will hear thee again of this matter, and ſome clave to him and believed; all that heard him did not cleave to him, but only ſome of them. And if you have heard in <hi>England,</hi> you do thereby neither cleave unto your Covenant, nor Order, unleſs you partake of the Seals of the Covenant, then indeed you joyn unto them. Now, this is the nature of the comfort of an Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, tho' we fail in Families, and in Churches, yet if Chriſt be ours, the Everlaſting Covenant is ours. Indeed when <hi>Moſes</hi> came and ſaw the Iſraelites worſhipping the golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. becauſe he ſaw they had broken Covenant with God, therefore he brake the Tables of the Covenant; to ſhew the Lord would have no fellowſhip with them; and if the Covenant had

not been renewed, they had periſhed. But come you to <hi>Davids</hi> Covenant: Pſal. 89.28. to the 34. <hi>verſe. My Covenant,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhall ſtand faſt for ever: if his Children forſake my Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will viſit their tranſgreſſions with a Rod; but my loving kindneſs will I not take from them.</hi> This Covenant doth not ſtand on keeping Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but this is all our delight, That the Lord will not break Covenant with us, nor alter the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that is gone out of his Lips. Conſider therefore, for here is a great deal of difference, your Covenant is not a point of order only, but the foundation of all your comfort; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look not at it as a complement, for it is the well-ordered Covenant of God, even the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of your Souls.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But ſome will ſay, This would indeed much comfort me, that hath been delivered, but if a man touch any Unclean things be is defiled, and if I touch him that hath touched any Unclean thing, I am defiled alſo,</hi> Numb, 19.13, 14. <hi>Therefore ſadneſs is upon me night and day for the Sins of the Church, and this doth eat up all my Comfort?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Pray you conſider it. I will but Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret what it is to touch a dead man, and to touch dead Ordinances. I cannot give you a better Interpretation, than by that expreſſion, which the Apoſtle uſeth: 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>It is good for a Man not to touch a Woman.</hi> If ſo be a Man touch

a ſtrange Woman, ſo as to be familiar to plead for her, and to connive with her, this Man is defiled; and if I now touch this Man ſo as to be familiar with him, and to keep fellowſhip with him, I am alſo defiled. So in caſe the Church do tolerate theſe, that do defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with any Sinful Pollution, do not I make my ſelf Unclean now by touching this Church? God forbid, unleſs it be by touching them with familiar connivance. But if I do now touch them, with a ſharp reproof, this doth indeed touch the Church, but it is ſo far from defiling, as that it doth hold forth the Purity of his heart that toucheth them; and if you do forbear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church when you know the Church hath defiled her ſelf, if you ſhall not come home to the Church, and bewail your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, your not touching the Church hath defiled you, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. You ſee the Church lye in Sin, you will not touch her, then you Sin againſt her, and have broken your Covenant, Will you ſuffer your Brother's Ox to lye in the Mire? and will not pluck it out? And are not Brethren more than Oxen And I beſeech you conſider another Place of Scripture, (and the Lord be Merciful to thoſe that have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the ſenſe of it;) in <hi>Hag.</hi>

neglected, expreſsly againſt the Commandment of God; for they did not only leave it off when the King reſtrained them with a ſtrong hand, but in the dayes of <hi>Darius</hi> alſo (the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) they did forbear and ceaſe from Temple work; and therefore now they are neither accepted of God, nor proſpered in the outward man, they were all Unclean, as by the touch of a dead man: but do <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> now ſeparate from them? No, no, Brethren, they touch them to the quick, and ſo recover their Brethren, and deliver their Souls, tho' they be dead and defiled; yet it is not for the People of God to ſay, we will touch them; you ſhall be Unclean if you touch them not: Touch them, how? With dallyance, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity and cloſeth with them: Not ſo, for that was the Sin of old <hi>Eli,</hi> that he did bear with his Children too much, and touched them no more ſharply. But herein ſtood the faithfulneſs of theſe two holy Prophets, that they did touch their Brethren, and that throughly, ſo that the Lord did ſtir them up to ſet about Temple Work; and then He doth Promiſe all that they went about ſhould be clean and pure. I Pray you therefore conſider it: I am marvellouſly afraid of Separation from Churches upon any breach of duty; they who do Separate for ſuch cauſes, think they are ſprinkled with the water of Separation: but believe it, they are Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

from Chriſt Jeſus for ever, if they ſo live and ſo dye. Therefore if you belong to Chriſt, He will ſhew you it is not the water of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will ſerve your turn, but getting Chriſt Jeſus, and ſitting cloſer to Him, and to your Brethren, by Admoniſhing and Reproving them, if you ſee them defiled. This will keep you clean, and your hearts clean, and your Souls comfortable: That the Lord hath made an Everlaſting Covenant with you that ſhall never be <hi>Forgotten.</hi>
