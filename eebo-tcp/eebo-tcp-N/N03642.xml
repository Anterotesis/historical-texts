            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>JOHN vii. 37, 38, 39.</bibl>
                  <p>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying. If any Man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water.— But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</p>

            <p>NOTHING has render'd the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> of leſs Effect, nothing has been a greater ſtumbling Block and Rock of Offence to weak Minds, than a Suppoſition, now currant among us, that moſt of what is contained in the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was deſign'd only for our <hi>

the ſame Manner as learned Men read <hi>Caeſar's Commentaries,</hi> or <hi>the Conqueſt of Alexander.</hi> As Things rather intended to afford Matter for Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</p>
            <p>As this is true of the Doctrines of the Goſpel in general, ſo it is in particular of the Operations of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit upon the Hearts of Believers, for we no ſooner mention the Neceſſity of our receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in theſe laſt Days, as well as formerly; but we are look'd upon by ſome, as Euthuſiaſts and Madmen; and, by others, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as wilfully deceiving the People, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the eſtabliſhed Conſtitution of the Church.</p>
            <p>JUDGE ye then, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> whether it is not high Time for the true Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who have been themſelves made Partakers of this heavenly Gift, to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet; and if they would not have thoſe Souls periſh for which the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> has ſhed his precious Blood, to declare with all Boldneſs, that the holy Spirit is the common Privilege &amp; Portion of all Believers in all Ages; and that we alſo, as well as the firſt Chriſtians, muſt receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> e'er we can be truly called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, (and alſo that I might Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the Deſign of our Church in appointing the preſent Feſtival) I have choſen the Words of the Text.</p>
            <p>THEY were ſpoken by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when as the Evangeliſt tells us, he was at the Feaſt of Tabernacles. Our Lord (herein leading all an
<pb facs="unknown:004451_0004_100D9E2E4947D2F0"/>
Example) attended on the Temple-Service in general, and the Feſtivals of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in particular. The Feſtival at which he was now preſent, was that of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> obſerved according to <hi>God</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in Commemoration of their living in Tents. At the laſt Day of this Feaſt, it was cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for many pious People to fetch Water from a certain Place, and bring it on their Heads, ſinging this Anthem out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 
               <q>And with Joy ſhall they draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</q> — Our dear Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> obſerving this, and it being his conſtant Practice to ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize every Thing that he met with, cries out, <hi>If any Man thirſteth, let him come unto me, rather than unto that Well and drink. — He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſpoken,</hi> (where it is ſaid, God will make Water ſpring of a dry Rock, and ſuch like) <hi>out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water.</hi>— And that we might know what our Saviour meant by this living Water, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt immediately adds, <hi>But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE laſt Words I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on in the enſuing Diſcourſe, and ſhall treat on them in the following Manner,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall briefly ſhew what is meant by the Word <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew that this <hi>Spirit</hi> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the Reaſon on which this Doctrine is founded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:004451_0005_100D9E2FE0112310"/>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall conclude with a general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to believe on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wherby alone we can be qualified to receive this Spirit.</p>
            <p>AND, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am briefly to ſhew what is meant by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the third Perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity, conſubſtantial and co eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both. For to uſe the Words of our Church in this Day's Office, that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of the Glory of the <hi>Father,</hi> the ſame we believe of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without any Difference or Inequality.</p>
            <p>THUS ſays St <hi>John,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. v. Ver. 7. <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the</hi> Father, <hi>the</hi> Word, <hi>and the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and theſe Three are one.</hi> And our Lord when he gave his Apoſtles Commiſſion to go and teach all Nations, commands them to Baptize in the Name of the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Ver. 4 he ſays, <hi>Thou haſt not lied unto Men, but unto God.</hi> From all which Paſſages, it is plain, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is truly and properly <hi>God,</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> This is an unſpeakble Myſtery, but a Myſtery of <hi>God's</hi> revealing, and therefore to be aſſented to with our whole Hearts.

St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, we have many great and precious Promiſes, that we may be made Partakers of the Divine Nature. — Our Lord prays, that we may be One, as the Father and He are One; and our own Church, in Conformity to theſe Texts of Scripture, in her excellent Communion Office, tells us, that thoſe who receive the Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
