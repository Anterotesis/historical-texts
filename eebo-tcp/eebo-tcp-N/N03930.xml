            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FROM my Child-hood the LORD hath inclined my Heart to ſeek after the beſt Things, and my Father's chiefeſt Care was to bring me up in the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ure and Admonition of the Lord: My Nature being ſome-what more Mild than the reſt of my Siſters, I was ready to think my ſelf ſome Body, and with the proud Phariſee, to thank God that I was not as others, not conſidering that I was but like a Wolf chained up, which keeps its Nature ſtill, as I by the Goodneſs of God have ſeen, ſince the Lord was pleaſed to lay his Eye Salve upon me. I was a great lover of Hiſtories, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fooliſh Books, and did often ſpar'd my ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time in reading of them, and ſometimes I ſhould think I did not do well in ſo doing, but I was ſo bewitched by them, that I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; and hearing of a Friend of mine, which was eſteemed a very holy Woman, that did delight in Hiſtories, I then concluded it was no Sin, and gave my ſelf wholly then to this kind of Folly, when
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004841_0004_100DFFF8F48F71C0"/>
I had any ſpare Time, for two or three Years. I had ſometimes ſlight Thoughts of Repentance, but was loath to ſet about it, and ſo I ſhould put the Lord off from Time to Time with delays, thinking ſtill I ſhould find a fitter Time than the preſent. I remember about a Month before I was married, my Father would have me receive the Sacrament of the LORD's Supper, and I was very willing to it; until I conſidered what was requiſite to be in thoſe which did partake thereof, and then I began to doubt that I had not thoſe Things which were requiſite wrought in me, as Knowledge, Faith, Love, Repentance, &amp;c. And then this Scripture came into my Mind, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, for whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> When I had conſidered thoſe Things I was filled with Sorrow, and could not tell what to do, I was loath to diſobey my Father, and more loath to eat and drink my own Damnation; in this Perplexity I ſet my ſelf to ſeek the Lord for his Grace, being at that Time ſomewhat ſenſible of the want of it; when I had thus done, I began to be comforted, verily thinking, now I had repented, and could believe in Chriſt Jeſus: And having ſome notional Knowledge of Things, I was indifferently well ſatisfied, thinking that when I was married, I ſhould have more leiſure to ſerve God; and then going to the Miniſter of the Pariſh, to be Examined before I was admitted, and finding my ſelf able to Anſwer him, I thought all was well with me then, and ſo unworthy! went to the Lord's Table, not queſtioning but that I was in as good a Condition as any of the reſt which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

me my ſad Condition I was in by Nature and Practice more clearly than ever before; and this was about a Quarter of a Year after I was married, in the Year, 1657. The Miniſter being upon this Subject, Prov. 1. 23. <hi>Turn ye at my Reproof, &amp;c.</hi> Being upon the Uſe of Trial, whether indeed we had turned to God or no? He bid us examine our ſelves by ſome Marks which he then gave, and it was at this Time that God did begin to manifeſt his Love to me, as I truſt, in my effectual Vocation; here the Lord was pleaſed to open my Heart, as he did the Heart of <hi>Lydia;</hi> ſo that I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Things that were ſpoken, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Heart was not right in the Sight of God, and that my Hope was but like that of the Hypocrite which periſheth; when I came home I beſought the Lord to turn me, if I were not yet turned to him, but yet I had not that thorow Senſe of Sin, as I had afterwards: About three Weeks after, the Miniſter coming to our Houſe, my Husband and I was ſpeaking that we would deſire him to pray with us in our Chamber, but that Time he could not ſtay, the next Day he came and asked for me, telling me that my Huſband told him that I would ſpeak with him. O how was I ſurprized! I could not tell what to ſay upon the ſudden, I was ſo hurried in my Thoughts. O how loath was I to acquaint him with my ſad State! I was aſhamed to tell him that I was yet a Stranger to God and all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till it was forced from me, which when he heard he did not go about to Comfort me, but he asked me, if ever I was convinced before? And I told him, Yes; &amp; he repeated the firſt Verſe of the 29th Chapter of the Proverbs. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be

deſtroyed, and that without Remedy:</hi> When I heard this I was wonderfully troubled; then there came many Sins to my Remembrance, which I had taken no notice of before, counting them ſmall Sins; now the Time which was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en in reading Hiſtories, I remembred with bitter Grief, and I thought that there was no Mercy for me, but he preſwaded me there was Hope of Mercy for ſuch as I, and that the Lord waited to be gracious to poor Sinners, and then I was a little ſatisfied for the preſent; but then I was troubled with Blaſphemous Thoughts, which were very grievous to me: I thought I had a Heart worſe than the Devil, and wondered that I was not conſumed in ſome ſtrange Manner. When I have ſeen a Spider, which of all Things is moſt loathſome to me, I have been ready to wiſh my ſelf ſuch a one, eſteeming of it to be in a far happie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Condition than I was; I was afraid to be in the Dark, leſt I ſhould meet the Devil; I doubted whether I was Elected, I had read, that it was not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that ſheweth Mercy: Then I thought if I were not Elected, is was to no Purpoſe to ſtrive, for what GOD hath decreed muſt be, but yet I was unwilling to periſh, I could not be ſo ſatisfied, although I had but little Hope to obtain Mercy, yet I could not but ask it: I was alſo very fervent in hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and read, not daring to let ſlip an Opportunity, but not without many Tears, leſt it ſhould increaſe my Condemnation; In this Condition I remained a great while, but not without ſome ſecret Supports from the LORD, ſometimes by a Word caſt in upon my Spirit, ſometimes I was refreſhed I could not tell how, but I ſhould be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004841_0007_100DFFFED39EFAD0"/>
ready to think this was a Deluſion: I remember the Scriptures were theſe, Iſa. 51. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeys the Voice of his Servant, that walks in Darkneſs, and hath no Light? Let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> John 15 16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that ye ſhould go and bring forth much Fruit, and that your Fruit ſhould remain,</hi> &amp;c. Lamen. 3. 25. <hi>The Lord is good unto the Soul that waits for him, and to them that ſeek him: It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Words did ſupport me very much, therefore, I writ them out and laid them in my Cloſet, that they might ſtill be in my Eye, that I might when I looked upon them be incouraged to hope in, and wait upon the Lord; but theſe Comforts were but tranſient, but yet while they laſted they were very ſweet Supports, but when gone I ſell to doubting, thinking all was Deluſions, and thus I diſhonoured God by my Unbelief; I doubted much of my Sincerity, often ſaying, I was an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procrite, but if at any Time I was asked in what I was one, I could not tell; but had this Scripture very often in my Mind, <hi>There is a Way which ſeemeth right unto a Man, but the End thereof is Death:</hi> And ſo I thought I was but ſeemingly right, and therefore muſt needs periſh: And in this Condition I continued a long Time, till I heard that a Hypocrite ſeldom or never doubted his Condition, and that is was a Sign of Sincerity, to deſire a ſincere Heart; and this I durſt not deny, knowing that I did deſire it rather than the whole World.</p>
            <p>Thus being better ſatisfied, I reſolved to ſet about my Duty, but all this while I did not ſet
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004841_0008_100E000110C63850"/>
ſuch a high Price upon the LORD JESUS as I ſhould, but ſtill I thought that I muſt do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to merit Salvation, not daring to venture my Soul with all its Concernments upon Chriſt, therefore I ſhould tie my ſelf to pray ſix times a Day, and then I ſhould be ſatisfied, and think all was well with me then. But if I at any Time failed of my Number, then I was diſſatisfied, and ſo in other Duties; ſo that my Comforts did not flow from the Blood and Righteouſneſs of JESUS, but from my own Duties; but bleſſed be the LORD, who likewiſe ſhook this Foundation, even becauſe he had a Favour to me: For being in Diſcourſe with a Friend, he deſired me to read <hi>Sheperd's ſincere Convert;</hi> which I did; and here did I ſee as in a Glaſs my folly, for there were Signs given whereby I might try my ſelf, whether I did reſt in Duties. One I remember was this, if I never ſaw I reſted in Duties, then it was a ſure Sign that I did; another was this, if I prized the bare performance of Duties ſo, as to think when I prayed with ſome Life, that I had done very well; and again if I ſaw but little of my vile Heart by Duties, then it was a Sign I reſted in them, and that I was yet in the Way to Hell, though in the cleanlieſt Way, and ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh if I reſted here. Now this I plainly ſaw was my Condition, but how to get out of it I knew not, for now I was in a worſe Condition that at the beginning, finding it abundantly more hard to deny righteous Self than ſinful Self. I thought it wonderful Strange, that I muſt be ſaved by the Righteouſneſs of another, if ever I were ſaved; O this my proud Heart was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to yield to, and yet I was very deſirous of Salvation: But when the Lord had led me
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004841_0009_100E00029AA818C0"/>
into my own Heart, and ſhewed me the Vileneſs of that more, and that if the Lord ſhould leave me to myſelf, I ſhould commit all kind of Sin, and that with greedineſs, ſuch was the Vileneſs of my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that if it were poſſible I ſhould now live holily, yet I could not ſatisfy the Juſtice of God for what was paſt, therefore I reſolved to caſt my ſelf upon Chriſt Jeſus that ſure Foundation, which GOD had laid and not Man, and if I periſhed, to periſh here; but much Oppoſition did I meet with from Satan and my own Heart, before I could really do it. I could ſeal to the Truth of that Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. That GOD did put forth his mighty Power, when a Soul was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but yet I was not at quiet, but had many Fears and Doubts that all was falſe, becauſe I had been ſo often deceived, and now I began to ſee mine own Vileneſs more then ever, and found mine Heart ran out to the LORD JESUS in Love, but doubted very much of his Love to me, yet ſometimes I ſhould have ſome Perſwaſions of my Intereſt in CHRIST, and that his Love was towards me; and whilſt this Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion laſted I ſhould be very comfortable, and be ready to think, I ſhould never be moved, as <hi>David</hi> did: But when GOD hid his Face, I was troubled and fell to doubting all again, nor having learned that Heavenly Skill of living by Faith, but yet I did not wholly caſt off my Confidence, but had ſome Pin-hole of Hope in the worſt Condition. I remember the Conſideration of this Scripture, John 3. 8. <hi>He that is born of GOD doth not commit Sin,</hi> filled me with many Fears, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how apt I was to commit Sin, notwithſtanding my ſtriving againſt it: But a little while after I was ſatisfied, underſtanding the Place better, that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004841_0010_100DEED906CDBEB8"/>
it was not meant of Sins of Infirmity, but of making Sin one's Trade, &amp;c. And this I was confident I did not, but rather trembled at the Thoughts of it; but when this was over, Satan and my own unbelieving Heart would ſtill be preſenting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby to occaſion Doubts, ſo that for the ſpace of one Year and a Half, I had ſcarcely any ſettled Peace, now and then a good Word thrown in which would revive me for the preſent, but the Comfort would be ſoon gone; as Ezek. 30. 26.<hi>A new Heart will I give, and a new Spirit will I put in you, and I will take away the ſtony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you a Heart of Fleſh, and will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes,</hi> &amp;c This Promiſe I did often plead with God very ſenſibly, and with much Confidence. Another was, John 11 25. <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life, he that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live: And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die.</hi> This I remember was very ſweet to me; once when I was in great Fear leaſt my Heart ſhould grow dead, and when I was with Child, I was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, having a Senſe of my approaching Danger, and wanting an Aſſurance of my everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but whilſt I was conſidering of theſe Things, I had this Scripture ſet home with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Sweetneſs, Pſal. 53. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me:</hi> And in the Time of Extremity this Word was ſet home upon my Heart again, and my good GOD made me to Experience the Truth of it in a wonderful Manner, for I had ſpeedy Deliverance beyond my Expectation, which filled my Heart and Mouth with Praiſes to the LORD; about three Days after a Friend coming

to viſit me, I related to her how good the LORD had been unto me, and how ſweetly my Heart was eſtabliſhed, but no ſooner was my Friend gone, but I was tempted to think my Faith was falſe, but I laboured what I could to encourage my ſelf in the LORD my GOD.</p>
            <p>But as I lay in my Bed, I thought I ſaw three Men before me, and it was preſently ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to me that theſe were the three Perſons in the Trinity; O then I was very much troubled, but I knew I was under a Temptation, and therefore cryed to the LORD for Help, but was not preſently delivered from it; but I had this Scripture brought to my Mind, <hi>No Man ſhall ſee my Face and live,</hi> Exod. 33. 20. But not being yet freed, I began to conſider what I had heard and read as Means to help againſt ſuch Temptations, at laſt I remembred, that Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> in his Book of Inſtructions for right comforting of afflicted Conſciences, gave this Direction, after the Party had prayed for Help againſt the Tempter, and done what they could in repelling him by the Word of GOD, that if they were yet followed by Satan, that then they ſhould ſet about ſome honeſt Imployment; but now I was in Bed, and knew not what to ſet about for the preſent, at laſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try to Suckle my Child, which I did, and then lay down again, and found that I was pretty well freed from that Temptation, and finding my ſelf much diſtempered in my Head, I deſired the Lord to give me Reſt, and went about to compoſe my ſelf to Sleep; but as I lay, I thought Satan ſtood before me, asking where I could find a Promiſe for Sleep, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I could not think of any, but after ſome ſtudy this was brought into my Mind, <hi>The Lord will

give his Beloved Sleep:</hi> This Word comforted me, but yet I could not all that Night get any Sleep, but ſtill thought I ſaw Satan laughing at me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had no Sleep, and yet truſted in his Word; thus all the Night I continued weak in Body, and comfortleſs in Mind, ſo that in the Morning I expected nothing but Death, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to think more ſeriouſly of my Change, Satan as I then thought, asked me where was my Aſſurance of my everlaſting Happineſs? At this I was very much troubled, knowing I had not full Aſſurance, but yet ſome good Hope through the Goodneſs of GOD I had, therefore my Heart made Anſwer, it is true, I have no Aſſurance, but I have caſt my ſelf wholly upon the Lord Chriſt, and in him only is my Hope, and here will I Reſt, and if I periſh, I periſh, but ſure I am ſuch ſhall not periſh, for Chriſt hath promiſed them eternal Lief. Thus being aſſiſted by the Lord, I vanquiſhed Satan for that Time: And being thus at Peace, I quickly fell aſleep, and dreamed there was a Ladder ſet upon the Earth, whoſe top reached to Heaven, and I thought I was to go up, I was pulled do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I ſhould die in Child-bed,<note n="*" place="bottom">Which accordingly came to paſs about twelve Years after her Marriage.</note> and that the Night before I died, I ſhould have full Aſſurance; this very much rejoyced me, (and I was very deſirous to know of what Child I ſhould die) but that was denied me upon this Account, becauſe I ſhould be always prepared, but when I did awake I was filled with inexpreſſible joy, earneſtly longing to be Diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which was beſt of all, and yet willing, if the Lord pleaſed to ſuffer any Thing which might be inflicted on me. Then I remembred how Satan when I was about to turn to GOD, would preſent the Sufferings of GOD's People to me, thinking by that Means to turn me back again, and how I ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by them, but being filled with the Joys of God's Spirit, I thought I could ſuffer any Thing, not wondering, as I had done, how the Saints of old could bear up ſo bravely under their Sufferings. But after I began to amend, my Joys were not ſo full, as they had been, but I had a more ſettled Peace than formerly I had, bleſſed be the Lord; I had many various Changes in my ſpiritual State, but once having a great Senſe of a hard Heart, and being deſirous to have it modified, I was tempted to do ſome great Evil, as the only Means to break it; and that it might be the readier entertain'd, Satan put it into my Heart, to conſider the Condition of <hi>Nathaniel Butler,</hi> whoſe Heart was unbroken till the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that horrid Sin of Murder, and then this great Evil brought him to a Sight and Senſe of all Sin. This Temptation was very ſtrong

upon me, but yet ſtronger was he that was with me, than he that was againſt me: for at that very Inſtant did the Lord caſt into my Heart that happy Word, Rom. 8.3 <hi>Let us do Evil, that Good may come, whoſe Damnation is juſt</hi> This Word proved a happy Means to repel the Temptation; but yet this Mercy I had forgot, till the Lord revived it upon my Heart, almoſt two Years after as I was reading the Chapter.</p>
            <p>And ſince my Child was weaned, I was in ſuch a State of Deadneſs and Darkneſs, that I thought if I was ever raiſed out of it, I ſhould never queſtion my Condition again; I was tempted to think that the Scripture was not the Word of GOD? I had let out my Affection in a wonderful Meaſure to my Child, and yet my Lord forſook me not, but diſpelled my Darkneſs, and filled me with Rejoycing; O what ſhall I render to Him? After this I grew into another Damp and was raiſed again, and I truſt the Lord will keep me, notwithstanding all the miſt which ſhall be raiſed in my Heart by Sin and Satan, even by his Power through Faith unto Salvation. Theſe Scriptures revived me at ſeveral Times, when I was in Heavineſs for want of the Preſence of God at the Ordinance of the LORD's Supper, Prov 8.34 <hi>Bleſſed are they that watch daily at my Gates, waiting at the Poſts of my Doors</hi> Math. 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own</hi> This checked me and made me wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And as a further
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004841_0015_100E000F2635B148"/>
Teſtimony of my Intereſt in Chriſt, by the Effects of my Faith, I have theſe Evidences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> My Love to GOD, which is greater then to any Thing in the World beſides, and my GOD hath left it upon Record, <hi>that he Loves them that Love him,</hi> Prov. 8.17. I know my Love is not ſo great as it ſhould be; but I am ſure my greateſt Grief is that I can Love him no better, and in this Caſe GOD will accept the Will for the Deed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I know my Love is ſincere by this, becauſe I love the Children of GOD, for as it is, 1 John 5. 1 <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him;</hi> And by this I know that I love the Children of GOD, becauſe I love GOD; ſo that this is another Evidence, that I am paſſed from Death to Life, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I love the Brethren. 1 <hi> John 3. 14;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,,</hi> I can appeal to the LORD, who is the ſearcher of Hearts, that the Breathings of my Soul are chiefly after Holineſs, that I might be more like unto the LORD JESUS; my Deſire is to ſerve GOD in all Things, and to have a real and hearty reſpect unto all GOD'S Commandments, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (if it were poſſible.) that I might never Sin more, but rather that I might behave my ſelf in all Holy Converſation, as one that hath indeed and in Truth experienced how good and gracious the LORD is: I bleſs GOD I can truly ſay, that my hotteſt Conflicts are againſt thoſe Sins which are obvious only to the Eye of GOD, even my ſinful Thoughts, tho' they come not into Action; O many a ſad Heart have I had when I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Vileneſs of my Thoughts, and yet have been unblameable in my Converſation and this is ſtill my daily Sorrow, and therefore I truſt they ſhall never be my Ruin, but that the

LORD will ſhortly rejoyce the Heart of his poor Servant, in giving me the Victory over theſe and all my other inbred Corruptions, which have ſo often made a ſeparation between my dear Lord and my poor Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I find a great Change in my Heart as touching the Word of GOD, for whereas heretofore like a Wretch as I was, I eſteemed a Play-Book before it, now, bleſſed be the LORD, I prize it before all other, and good Reaſon have I for it, for by it hath the LORD quickned me, and therefore as long as I live I will give up my ſelf to walk according to the Rule of it, begging the Spirit of GOD to open the Myſtery of it to me, that ſo I might not only have the Letter, but the very Mind of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I ſee nothing in my ſelf that makes me more worthy of Salvation than another. I know that I have deſerved to lie in Flames, as well as any that are now in the Place of Torments, and that nothing but Mercy hath ſtept between my Soul and everlaſting Burnings, and therefore I heartily wiſh that I might always be admiring of this free Grace of GOD in chuſing me before the Foundation of the World was laid, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Creature as I am, to ſet his Love upon me and let go ſo many Thouſands, that were more capable to bring Glory to his Name than I am: O the height and depth, and breadth, and length of this Love of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, which hath abounded to me a poor and unworth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Creature! It is indeed ſuch a Love as paſſeth Knowledge, and therefore I can never ſufficiently admire it, while I am here in the Body, which makes me long to be diſſolved, that ſo I might know it more clearly, and be ſwallowed up in the eternal Admiration of it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>I Believe that the Scriptures contained in the Old and New-Teſtament, are the Word of God, written by the Prophets and Holy Men, as they were inſpired by God, to be the Rule of Faith and Life to his People; I believe all that God in his Word wills me to believe, being perſwaded by the Spirit of God concerning the Truth of it: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is one only eternal God, who hath his Being from himſelf, and given a Being to all his Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, and from Eternity to Eternity doth whatſoever he will: I believe that this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God-head, is diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, the Father begetting, the Son begotten, and the Holy, Ghoſt proceeding from them both: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God created Man in his own Image, in Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, giving him Dominion over all the Creatures, and likewiſe gave him Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to continue in this happy Condition if he would, but he having Liberty to ſtand or to fall in his own Hand, quickly loſt that Happineſs which God had inſtated him in, by yeilding to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of Satan, ſo that breaking the Commands of God, he brought a Curſe upon himſelf, and all his Poſterity, ſo that all Mankind by Nature are now in a miſerable Condition, Children of Wrath, Heirs of Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I do believe, that God from Eternity knew what Man would do when he had created him, ſo that <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall did but uſher in, as it were, as greater Bleſſedneſs: For I do believe there hath been an eternal Covenant between the Father and the Son, in the electing ſome to Life even before the Foundation of the Earth was laid; So that no

            <p>Theſe are my Principles, and I truſt the LORD will ſo fix me in them, that I may never be toſſed too and fro with contrary Winds of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as too many in theſe latter Days are; nay I am even at this Time perſwaded by the LORD that I ſhall not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. My deſire to treaſure up the Experiences which I have had of God's Goodneſs to me, was another Reaſon why I write them, knowing how apt I am to let ſlip out of my Remembrance that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
