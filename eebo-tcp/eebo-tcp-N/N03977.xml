            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>ents the miſerable State of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And in this Chapter, after bewailing their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities He ſuggeſts to them ſeveral power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arguments to perſwade them, to humble themſelves under the mighty Hand of God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encourage themſelves in his Goodneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Faithfulneſs, and quietly to Hope and Wait for his Salvation. So that there can be no Doubt but that by the <hi>Yoke</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> He means the <hi>Yoke of Afflictions,</hi> which God had laid on them for their Iniquities, and which in the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> He calls the binding on them <hi>the Yoke of their Tranſgreſſions.</hi>—</p>
            <p>That their <hi>Young Men</hi> particularly, ſhould not too eagerly fret againſt God, nor abandon themſelves to Diſpair, He ſuggeſts to them, that there are <hi>peculiar Advantages</hi> in <hi>bearing Afflictions in Youth,</hi> which might ſilence their Complaints againſt the Conduct of Divine Providence, and teach them Patience and Submiſſion to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004911_0004_100E190020D02D50"/>the Will of God. For as Afflictions are often neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and very uſeful to awaken careleſs Sinners out of their Security, and to ſhew them their Miſery and Danger, and even to quicken humble and inſtruct the Children of God; ſo they are often peculiarly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous in Youth, to teach us effectually true Wiſdom and Obedience to God betimes, and ſo to prevent ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> going aſtray from God, and all the miſerable Effects of a ſinful Life: And particularly to prevent ſeverer Chaſtiſements, which might otherwiſe be neceſſary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards, to wean us from ſinful Courſes and reduce us to the right Ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Religion</hi> in general is called in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and as <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>good</hi> only to prevent or take away Sin, and make us partakers of true Holineſs, and to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oduce the peacable Fruits of Righteouſneſs. — as they ſerve to open the Ear to Diſcipline, and diſpoſe us to bear <hi>the Yoke of Inſtruction,</hi> I propoſe to conſider the Words only in this Light, as aſſerting <hi>there are peculiar Advantages of early Religion</hi> — A Subject which has been ſo often handled, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new can be ſaid upon it; and which ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelſs to be frequently inculcated on Youth. And that both, becauſe it is in it ſelf, of ſuch vaſt Importance to their temporal and eternal Welfare; and becauſe they have in general ſuch a native Averſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance; becauſe they are ſurrounded with ſo many and ſo dangerous Temptations; and are ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclin'd to walk in the Sight of their own Eyes, and in the Ways of their own Hearts; not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obſerving, and regarding the <hi>natural Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of gratifying the corrupt Deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind, nor remembring, that for all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I. In the firſt Place, I am to ſhew that <hi>Religion in general may be compared to a Yoke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis ſo called, Partly, as 'tis the Law, and Rule which God has given to guide and govern us; and as 'tis a Reſtraint on the Paſſions and Appetites and a Burden on corrupt Nature. Accordingly, both the Apoſtles St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> call the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> a <hi>Yoke.</hi> It was, it ſeems, a cuſtomary <hi>Jewiſh Phraſe.</hi> And hence our bleſſed Saviour uſes that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſtion, <hi>Take my Yoke upon you;</hi> by which he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means his <hi>Religion,</hi> The Submiſſion to his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Belief of his Doctrine, the Imitation of his Example, and the Obedience to his Commandments. And,</p>
            <p>This ſhews us, what it is to <hi>take on us</hi> or <hi>bear the Yoke of Christ;</hi> It is <hi>to</hi> become his Diſciples, to learn of him and to conform our ſelves to the Rules of his Religion —</p>
            <p>Theſe are admirably ſummed up by St. <hi>Paul</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation. hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To take Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Yoke on us,</hi> don't intend, a bare putting on a <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> that we yield ſome external Homage and Reverence to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſubmit to his Inſtitutions, and call him <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Lord;</hi> but that we obey from the Heart the Form of Doctrine we have received from him; that we deny our ſelves, take up the Croſs, and follow Chriſt in the Regeneration, and ſincerely practice his pure and undefiled Religion. That we truly copy after his moſt perfect Example, and heartily obey his moſt holy wiſe and juſt Commands of Piety, and Purity, of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milty, of Integrity and Charity; and that we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, and to perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God. In fine it implies, that our Hearts being purified by Faith in Chriſt, and being made free from the Law of Sin and Death, we become the Servants of God, and have our Fruit to Holineſs, that the End may be Life everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004911_0006_100E1901A1C245E0"/>
So that tho' real Chriſtianity, or true Religion is, and is called a <hi>Yoke,</hi> yet there is nothing in the Term when rightly underſtood, any more than in the Thing it ſelf that may juſtly prejudice us againſt it. It is a Yoke indeed, but ſuch an one as is neceſſary and uſeful in all Reſpects. For,</p>
            <p n="2">II <hi>It is good for a Man to bear the Yoke of Religion. Jeſus Christ</hi> himſelf has told us, <hi>His Yoke is eaſie, and his Burden is light.</hi> And that it is the Way to <hi>find Reſt to our Souls</hi> It is evidently <hi>reaſonable</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that we ſhould ſubmit to the Laws of God, and how our W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls to the Obedience of Chriſt. It is plainly <hi>neceſſary</hi> that we do ſooner or later, renounce and forſake the Service of diverſe Luſts and Pleaſures, and that we believe and obey the Goſpel, if we would obtain the Forgiveneſs of our Sins, and an Inheritance among them who are ſanctified through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Obligations of Religion,</hi> ariſe out of the abſolute Right and Authority of God in and over us, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature, the Excellency Juſtice and Goodneſs of his Laws, and the glorious Reward he has promiſed to them that obey him. We are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly obliged to yield a ſincere, and univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the righteous and holy Will of God, our Creator, Preſerver, and Redeemer, our ſovereign Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and Judge. We are his, for he made us, and therefore we ought to ſerve him; we are bought with a Price, even the precious Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore we ought to glorify God in our Body, and in our Spirit, which are his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Advantages of true Religion are Infinite and Eternal.</hi> For the Lord will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly. His Favour is Life, and his Loving-Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than Life. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Author of eternal Salvation, to all them that obey him. Godlineſs is profitable to all Things, having the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. So that it is good to bear this Yoke. <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right, and in the Keeping of them there is a great Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004911_0007_100E18D440AB8A10"/>
The real Advantage of Religion, appears from the <hi>Conſtitution of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Courſe of Things</hi> which <hi>God has eſtabliſhed</hi> in <hi>this preſent World.</hi> For 'tis evident, that <hi>Righteouſneſs really and naturally tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Life,</hi> and that he that purſueth Evil, purſueth it to his own Hurt. So has the Lord ordained, that the moral or Chriſtian Vertues, have a neceſſary and ſtrong Tendency to the Peace and Chearfulneſs of the Mind, to the Health and Vigour of the Body, to the Good-Will and Eſteem of others, and the Comfort and Tranquility of our whole Lives. While on the other Hand, there is a natural Tendency in the Ways of Sin, to all manner of Evil. So that it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Will of God, that we ſhould live ſoberly, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſly and godly in this preſent World, from the very Conſtitution and Courſe of Nature; for the Laws of Nature are manifeſtly ſanctioned by the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And beſides we may reaſonably believe the Lord will bleſs the Righteous, and encompaſs them with Favour as with a Shield. The Righteous Lord loveth the Righteous, his Eyes are upon them, and his Ears are open to their Cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſhews us it is of the laſt Neceſſity and Importance to receive Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and heartily ſubmit to his Authority; for how can we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation? It is neceſſary we renounce and forſake the Service of diverſe Luſts and Pleaſures, thoſe Lords that have had Dominion over us, and take on us Chriſt's Yoke, and Parn of him; that we not only call him Lord, but that we do the Things which he ſaith, that we may be made Partakers of the Redemption purchaſed by him.

            <p>In fine as we are the Creatures and Subjects of God, it muſt be good for us to love and fear him, and keep all his Commandments always, and that in Regard both to our temporal and eternal Wellare.

1. Firſt I am to ſhew you <hi>there are peculiar Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in Youth towards taking this Yoke of Religion upon us.</hi> As it is of the laſt Neceſſity and Importance for us to apply our Hearts in good earneſt to Wiſdom or true Religion, ſo it is acknowledged to be a very difficult Undertaking; for it is nothing leſs than to mortiſy our Members, to crucify the Fleſh, and the World, to deny our ſelves, to ſet our Affections on Things above, and to walk by Faith and not by Sight. Tho' Chriſt's Yoke is truly light and eaſie, in it ſelf, to right Reaſon, or to a renewed Nature; and tho' in Keeping God's Commandments there is a great preſent and future Recompence of Reward; yet there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance in our corrupt Nature, the Carnal Mind is not ſubject to God's Laws, but is Enmity againſt them and would not have Chriſt to reign over us. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rand Reaſon and Obligation on Youth, to take this Yoke on them betimes before all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Way are unhappily encreaſed and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Before their own evil Propenſities are ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and their Abilities to controul and reſiſt them are weakened; and above all, while God is working in them to Will and to Do of his good Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Ignorance and Vanity, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and Paeſumption of Youth, and the Strength and Impetuſity of Youthful Luſts which often preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them into ſudden Ruin and remedileſs Deſtruction, yet we don't find the Matter is mended by Age, or that Men are of their own Accord more inclined to Religion in any af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that Youth has the vaſt Advantage to take up Chriſt's Yoke before corrupt Nature is ſtrengthened by Indulgence, before we have had Time to contract ſtrong Habits of Negligence and Diſobedience, before the Cares of the World perplex us, and the Pleaſures of Life have enſlaved us, before we have provoked God to take from us his holy Spirit, and while we have for our Encouragement in the arduous Conflict the expreſs Aſſurance of Divine Aſſiſtance, and that the firſt Fruits of our Lives will be a Sacrifice pleaſing and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour.</p>

               </gap>, when the Cares and Baſineſs of Life engage our Time and Thoughts. The love of this preſent evil World to a great Degree excludes and prevents the Love &amp; Service of God. The anxious Deſire and eager Purſuit of earthly Things, The Hurry and Multiplicity of Affairs, ſo engroſs the Man as to leave little Room and leſs Inclination for our Spiritual and eternal Concerns, if Religion has been unhappily neglected and poſtponed in Youth. Proſperity takes away the Hearts of many
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004911_0012_100E1907194B72D8"/>from God and Religion; and the Difficulties and Diſtreſſes of humane life frequently confound and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirit many others, and entangle them in fatal Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>the Mind in Youth is more ſuſceptible of good Inſtruction, and more apt to fear the Wrath of God</hi> and the Dangers of eternal Miſery, which is the moſt powerful, and uſually the moſt effectual Motive to Repentance and amendment of Life, than when we are habituated to the Danger, and grown obſtinate and hardned to the Terrors of the Lord. For tho' nothing is more plain than that Sinners go continually in Jeopardy of their Lives; and in the dreadful Danger of falling into the Hands of the living God; and that every Moment brings them nearer to the eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their Preſervation out of eternal Burnings grows more precarious; yet their Fears decreaſe. And having eſcaped long, they preſume on the Mercy and Patience of God. And being familiariſed to Danger, the Impreſſions wear off, and grow fainter by Degrees, At leaſt till the evil Days draw near and they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the very Borders of the Grave, juſt ready to ſink into Death with all their Guilt about them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſcience likewiſe is more tender and more faithful</hi> to reprove and warn Sinners in the begining of life, than when by a long Cuſtom of reſiſting neglecting and oppoſing its Dictates, it becomes hardned, and as it were ſeared with an hot Iron. Moreover in Youth we experience the Strivings of Gods Spirit with us; and have more Reaſon to expect and depend upon his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and powerful Aſſiſtance, than after we have long quenched his Operations and grieved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to depart from us and leave us to our ſelves, and the Power of our Spiritual Enemies. But this brings me to mention,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The peculiar Encouragement and Aſſiſtance which God has given and offers to Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is be reaſonable to hope our compaſſionate Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will never caſt out any that come to him tho' at the eleventh Hour, yet we muſt needs think it more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, for us to devote our ſelves early to his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004911_0013_100E18DB9AEBBD28"/>Service, and to go on to live all the reſt of our Time in the Fleſh to the Will and Praiſe of God, than to offer our firſt Fruits to the God of this World, and conſume the beſt of our Time in the Service of Sir, and offer God only the Dregs of Life; &amp; in the laſt Agony call upon him for that Mercy, and Grace, which we have ſlighted and abuſed all our Days.</p>
            <p>Accordingly God has <hi>expreſly promiſed,</hi> that <hi>they who ſeek him early ſhall find him,</hi> and has given the plaineſt Aſſurance of their Succeſs and Acceptance. Now this naturally tends to animate and invigorate. the Mind, and raiſe it above Fear and Deſpondency. There is not ſuch Room for a melancholy Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor ſuch Danger of ſinful Diſpair as if we had long refuſed the Offers of Mercy.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Divine Aſſiſtance</hi> which is promiſed to ſuch as ſeek God early is the <hi>moſt ſolid and effectual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> towards the taking Chriſt's Yoke upon us, his Grace is ſufficient for us, and with his Help we may eaſily overcome the greateſt Difficulties. The Weapons of our Warfare will be mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong Holds, caſting down Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and every Thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In fine <hi>Youth is the important Seaſon</hi> in which we generally <hi>Form our Character both for Time and Eternity;</hi> It is a State of Diſcipline for mature Age, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ages, and if unhappily we let ſlip this firſt, this beſt, this the proper Oportunity of aplying our Hearts to Wiſdom, we do unavoidably render the Work in it ſelf more difficult, and weaken, diſincline and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate our ſelves, and drive away the Influences of the Divine Grace that are neceſſary to the Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nature, and the Salvation of our Souls. And we can never again expect ſuch another conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Seaſon, but have Reaſon to fear, God will caſt us off for ever, and at laſt laugh at our Calamity, and mock when our Fear comes, when Fear cometh as Deſolation and Deſtruction as a Whirlwind, becauſe we would none of his Councels and deſpiſed all his Reproof.</p>

At leaſt we ſhall run our ſelves into unavoidable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Diſſiculties, and miſs of thoſe Beneſits which in <hi>the Courſe of Things, and by the Will of God, are the bleſſed Effects of early Religion.</hi> Theſe we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider under the next Head.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there are peculiar Advantages that follow on the bearing the Yoke of Religion in Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profit and Benefit of Religion <hi>in general</hi> I have already ſhewn, is much every Way, infinitly great and endleſs. And <hi>the happy Influence early Religion will have on our future Exiſtence in this World and that which is to come,</hi> Is ſo great as to comprehend all the Things we can deſire; the good Effects are ſo many I know not how to range them in their proper Order: However we may form ſome Idea of them in this Manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By hearing the Yoke in our Youth, <hi>we prevent a great deal of Sin and Sorrow: For Luſt when it has conceived, bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi> If we conld be ſure to ſecure <hi>the Salvation of our Souls</hi> by a <hi>late Repentence,</hi> yet both <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> would encline and determine us to bear the <hi>Yoke in Youth,</hi> to prevent thoſe <hi>innumerable Tranſgreſſions</hi> wherewith God muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d ſhonoured and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, Mankind injured perhapsin their eternal Intereſt, &amp; our own Souls wronged and pollured, in a long Series of Rebellion and Diſobedience. Beſides we ſhall thereby prevent all the <hi>Woldly Sorrow</hi> which may be the natural or judicial Effect of making Proviſion to gratify corrupt Nature, and wilfully flinging off the Reſtraints of Religion; And <hi>that Godly Sorrow</hi> we muſt neceſſarily feel for our Folly, and Wickedneſs, if ever God give us Repentance unto Life.</p>
            <p>We can never caſt off the Fear of God and ſin againſt him, without wounding our own Sould; ſo that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion preſerves us from thoſe Evils that would be the Conſequences of our Sins; and what an <hi>Advantage</hi> there is in early Religion on this Account appears from conſidering the <hi>Violence of Youthful Paſſions,</hi> the dangerous <hi>Temptations we are then expoſed to,</hi> the <hi>Nature and neceſſary Conſequences</hi> of thoſe Sins to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004911_0015_100E18DE0E456970"/>which we are tempted; and that Errors and falſe Conduct in Youth, neceſſarily reach to, and greatly affect the Comfort and Happineſs of our whole Lives. The Conſequences of unbridled Paſſions and Appetites in Youth are fatal. We cannot afterwards avoid, or remedy the ill Effects of indulging corrupt Nature, in many Inſtances. <hi>Even tho' we ſhould come to ſincere Repentance,</hi> and find Forgiveneſs with God, and obtain everlaſting Life; <hi>yet we muſt in this World groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome of the miſerable Effects of our Folly.</hi> So that there is a great Benefit in bearing the Yoke of Religion in Youth, in that <hi>it happily prevents thoſe many Evils,</hi> that would naturally follow, from ſpending our Youth in Sin, and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To bear the Yoke of Religion in Youth, is the Way to arrive at the greateſt Degrees of Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>to excel in the Knowledge, and Practice of true Religion.</hi>

            <p>It is the Way to become more perfect in Holineſs, to become more like God, to become more expert in the Practice of all the Duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No Man can be happy while theſe are unſubdued, and riot in his Boſom.</p>
            <p>We muſt mortify our Members, deny our ſelves, and take up the Croſs, the Yoke of Chriſt, if we would find Reſt and Eaſe to our Souls. There is no other way to obtain it. And the due Subordination and Government of our Affections, the Right Exerciſe of our Faculties, the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, a Senſe of the divine Favour and the joyful Hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, will afford a <hi>continual Feaſt</hi> of fat Things, full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees, well refined.

            <p>However fair and promiſing the Morning of Life may be, and however apt we are to promiſe our ſelves continual Eaſe and Proſperity; yet Man is born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upwards.

            <p>How happy is it for old Age, to be found in the Way of Righteouſneſs, to be able to look back on a Life ſpent in the Service, and to the Praiſe of God. Such Perſons are not made to poſſes the Iniquities of their Youth. But they derive a florid old Age from their Piety, Purity, and Temperance; at leaſt that flouriſhing Health and Vigour of Soul, which enables them to bring forth much of the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, to the Praiſe and Glory of God. They enjoy that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Knowledge, and Experience, that quiet Hope, and humble Aſſurance of the divine Favour, that is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004911_0020_100E19101A256BA0"/>worth the Labour of our whole Lives to attain. <hi>God is faithful,</hi> to <hi>ſtabliſh them,</hi> and <hi>keep them from Evil,</hi> and <hi>to direct their Hearts into the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>the patient Waiting for Chriſt.</hi> But by neglecting Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and refuſing the Yoke of Chriſt in Youth, we provoke God to our us off by Premature Death, and not ſuffer us to live out half our Days; or if he ſhould ſpare us in the World, yet we do what in us lies to make Old Age miſerable in every Reſpect; and if we continue to neglect the great Salvation, we treaſure up to our ſelves Wrath, againſt the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>

            <p>Death unavoidably will overtake us ſooner or later. And whenever it comes, it is of infinit Importance to us to be ready. And as we know not the Day of of our Death, nor how ſuddenly it may come upon us, it is our higheſt Duty and Intereſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Beſides the Wiſdom and Neceſſity of being prepared for the Judgment of the great Day, every Man would have Peace in his later End, and <hi>Deſires to die with Compoſure</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction of Mind;</hi> but this can hardly be expected, if we have deſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If we would die the Death of the Righteous, we muſt live their Life. <hi>Mark the perfect Man,</hi> and <hi>behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace.</hi> But there can be no real Ground of true Peace, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at Death, but the Evidences that we are reconciled to God through Jeſus Chriſt, and are Heirs with him, to the Inheritance of eternal Life. An Intereſt in the Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt, affords infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at the Approach of Death; it diſarms the King of Terrors, and enables us on the Borders of the Grave, to look into Eternity, with Joy unſpeakable and full
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004911_0021_100E18E4DD78D878"/>of Glory. And in the mean Time, it delivers us, from being all our Life-Time, ſubject to Bondage through the Fear of Death.</p>
            <p>They who are early prepared for Death, have this great Advantage, to wait all the Days of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time, in Patience and Security. And at laſt to quit the World in Faith, and Hope, knowing him in whom they have believed, and to whom they have committed the Keeping of their Souls in Well-doing. If their Days are lengthned out on the Earth, they are <hi>looking for the bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> Or if God is pleaſed, early to take them away from the Evil to come, <hi>the Day of their Death is better than the Day of their Birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, by Early Religion we are made ſoon ready for the awful and important Hour of Dying. And this Readineſs, makes a dying Bed eaſy, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can do.

            <p>Let this then be conſidered as a great Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Early Religion, that it reconciles us to the Thoughts of Death, by preparing us for it; and makes our Departure out of the World, when ever it comes, ſafe and joyful. The <hi>Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law,</hi> but <hi>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi>

Now our own Reaſon, the Experience of all Ages, and the Wiſdom of God, teach us, <hi>to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> As we are Members of Society, as well as we are accountable Creatures, the Principles of true Religion, are the beſt and only right Principles of humane Conduct.

            <p>Tho', the Reward of the Righteous, is not Riches, or Honour, or any earthly Good; yet Godlineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto all Things, and has the Promiſe of all Things pertaining to Life, as well as to Godlineſs, that, our heavenly Father ſees we have Need of; and can uſe and employ for his Glory, and our own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs. God's Providence governs the World, and <hi>both Riches and Honour, come of him, in his Hand is Power and Might,</hi> and <hi>in his Hand it is to make great;</hi> and <hi>to give Strength to all.</hi> It is therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently our Wiſdom, and Prudence to acknowledge God in all our Ways, that ſo he may direct and ſuccede our Affairs. And there is alſo a real and natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Obedience to the Laws of God, and humane Happineſs; for as Sin originally brought in Death and Sorrow, ſo great Part of our Miſeries on Earth, are the proper Effects of our own Folly and Wickedneſs. By Diligence and Induſtry, Frugality and Temperance, Fidelity, Truth and Charity, by Humility
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004911_0023_100E18E6A6AE8AC8"/>and the Fear of the Lord, <hi>are Riches and Honour &amp; Life.</hi> And hence the Holy Spirit has repeated it: <hi>What Man is He that deſireth Life and loveth Days,</hi> that <hi>he may ſee Good,</hi> let <hi>him refrain his Tongue from Evil, his Lips from ſpeaking Guile,</hi> let <hi>him depart from Evil, and do good,</hi> let <hi>him ſeek Peace and purſue it. For the Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, his Ears are open to their Prayers, but the Face of the Lord is ſet againſt them that do Evil.</hi>

            <p>It is the Duty and uſually the Ambition of Youth to gain the Eſteem of their Parents and Benefactors, and recommend themſelves to the Good-Will of all Men. Now this is done in the beſt Manner, and moſt effectually, by a ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt. For Religion really approves it ſelf to every Man's Conſcience, to be true Wiſdom and Excellence. And genuine Religion in Youth, is ſo beautiful and amiable a Character, that all Men admire it. The greateſt natural Abilities and the moſt promiſing Genius, cannot give ſo much Pleaſure and Satisfaction to our Friends, as a true Sence of Religion.

There is no Proportion between Time and Eternity. Induſtry and Diligence about Temporal Concerns, makes Spiritual Slothfulneſs, and Negligence about our eternal Intereſt, to appear the more dangerous and inexcuſable.

But if Parents are themſelves the Children of God, then it is a double Joy, to ſee Chriſt formed in their Ofspring. This is what they have above all Things deſired for them, and even travailed again for them, that they might be born from above, and of the Spirit of God. It is an unſpeakable Anguiſh to a religious Parent, to ſee one of his Children become a Child of the Devil, and an Enemy to God, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the Chambers of Death. And it is equal Pleaſure to ſee their Children adopted into the the Number of God's Children, regenerated and creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anew in Chriſt Jeſus, and become Heirs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory.</p>
            <p>And as this is the moſt moving Argument, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Parents, to bring up their Children, in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, that they may at laſt be able to ſay, <hi>Here are we and the Children whom thou haft given us.</hi> So it is no ſmall Motive to Children that have any Gratitude, and Ingenuity in them, to remember their Creator in their Youth, that they may pleaſe, and gladden the Hearts of their Parents, to whom they are ſo much indebted, and on whom they have ſuch a Dependance. <hi>Hear then ye Children, the Inſtruction of your Father, and forſake not the Law of your Mother.</hi> For the Law is Light, and the Reproofs of Inſtruction are the Way of Life. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father,</hi> but <hi>a fooliſh Son is the Heavineſs of his Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>It is the Way to glorify God, and to ſerve our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the greateſt Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By a religious Life we <hi>do good</hi> and render our ſelves uſeful to Mankind in the higheſt Degree. A <hi>good Example</hi> of every Thing that is vertuous and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, is of great Influence, to oppoſe the Evil-Doers, and to perſwade Men to glorify God by a profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt. The fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Righteous avail much to turn away Wrath, and ſuſpend the Judgments of God and draw down
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004911_0025_100E18EA02DFA438"/>his Bleſſing on all around us. So that by working out our own Salvation, we make our ſelves <hi>Publick Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereby we glorify God, as we anſwer the End of our Creation, and the Deſigns of Providence and Grace, and give Occaſion of many Thanksgivings to God.</p>
            <p>But few comparatively are called to publick Offices, but all Men may be truly Benefactors to Society, in a private Station. By leading quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, we may effectually ſerve our Generation, according to the Will of God. And particularly by <hi>Early Religion,</hi> we are likely to awaken, inſtruct and encourage the <hi>Riſing Generation,</hi> to know and to ſerve the God of their Fathers, with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind. And if we are inſtrumental to prevent the Corruption of Youth, and promote a Reformation of Manners, we do in the beſt Manner contribute to the Proſperity of the People among whom we live; for <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation,</hi> but <hi>Sin is the Reproach and Ruin of every People.</hi> And beſides this, we ſhall prevent a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sins, and ſave many Souls from Death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and they who turn many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. Which brings me to add,</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the laſt Place, <hi>That bearing the Yoke in Youth is the Way to arrive at greater Degrees of Glory in the World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho' there be no Deficience of Happineſs among the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, nor any Envy in the Preſence of God, yet <hi>one Star differeth from another Star in Glory.</hi> We may juſtly expect that ſuch as have been here diſtinguiſhed with the Graces of the Divine Spirit, and have excell'd in the Vertues of the Chriſtian Life, in Uſefulneſs to Mankind, and in their Serviceableneſs to the Church of God, will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhine with a diſtinguiſhed Splendour in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Father. So that from an early devoting our ſelves to the Service of God and a patient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Well-doing, we may reaſonably expect from the good Pleaſure of God to be more highly exealted
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004911_0026_100E1917E36DCB30"/>in the Day of Chriſt's Appearing, and when God ſhall be All in all.</p>
            <p>Thus there are the greateſt Benefits relating both to Time and to Eternity, following on an early Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Yoke of Chriſt. It has a happy Influence on us during the whole Extent of our Duration: He that ſows to the Spirit in his Youth, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I proceed to ſhew, That all theſe Advantages of bearing the Yoke in Youth, will be very greatly heightned, from the Conſideration of <hi>the Dangers and the Diſadvantages of wilfully</hi> or <hi>careleſly neglecting Religion in Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we refuſe, or neglect Religion in our Youth, <hi>we run ſuch dreadful and amazing Dangers, and Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> as ſhew the Benefit of Early Religion, in a moſt affecting Light.</p>
            <p>Let us but only obſerve what <hi>Infinite Hazard there is,</hi> that if we don't bear the Yoke in Youth, <hi>we never ſhall at all.</hi> But either we ſhall die in Youth and periſh in our Sins; or if our Days are lengthened out, yet his own Iniquities ſhall take the Wicked, and he ſhall be holden in the Cords of his Sins, in the Greatneſs of his Folly he ſhall go aſtray, and die without Inſtruction, and have this of God's Hand at laſt, to lie down in everlaſting Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt Place, <hi>There is nothing ſo uncertain as Humane Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know not what a Day will bring forth; much leſs can we promiſe our ſelves many Years, and ſafely depend on long Life. It is the Portion but of a very few of Mankind. And very many are taken away without any particular Warning, at every Age. It is therefore extravagant Folly to neglect Religion on the vain Preſumption of a long Life, which we can have no good Reaſons to expect and depend upon: But a great many Reaſons to think we ſhall never attain. <hi>For what is our Life? It is even as a Vapour that appeareth for a little Time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> If it be then abſolutely neceſſary for us to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004911_0027_100E18EB8989A298"/>bear the Yoke of Religion, <hi>before we go hence,</hi> and are here no more for ever, it is evidently our higheſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to improve with the utmoſt Care, the firſt Oportunity we have, leſt Death prevent us of any Oportunity hereafter.</p>
            <p>But if we conſider that we are <hi>by Nature Children of Wrath,</hi> that <hi>they who believe not</hi> are <hi>condemned already.</hi> That until we are juſtified by Faith, and have Peace with God, we are in a State of Enmity and Rebellion, and under a Sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion— What Folly, and Madneſs muſt it appear, to continue willingly in ſuch a Condition one Moment? To delay in a Matter of ſuch Neceſſity and Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? To run ſuch a dreadful Hazard, as to venture Eternity, on the ſlender Thread of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umane Life? And continually expoſe our ſelves to the amazing Danger of the eternal Judgment, and of eternal Vengeance? But to do all this <hi>purpoſely and on Deſign,</hi> and all <hi>for the Sake of Things that profit not,</hi> but <hi>periſh in the Uſing,</hi> which <hi>we ſhall ſcon be aſhamed of,</hi> and <hi>whoſe End is Death;</hi> is Folly beyond Expreſſion. And yet this Folly is aggravated by its very Excuſe. For, to run ſuch Hazards, on the <hi>vain Dependance on long Life,</hi> and <hi>a future convenient Seaſon for Religion,</hi> not only without any Aſſurance of our Life; but againſt ſo many Probabilities from the conſtant Courſe of the World, and the Danger that God will judicially out ſhort our Time; this is altogether beneath that Prudence and Underſtanding with which God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed rational Creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>So that the Uncertainty of Life, puts our eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to infinite Hazard; and it muſt be egregious Folly to depend on many Years in the World, when we know not, but that God may this Night, require our Souls of us; and then what will our Condition be, if we have refuſed to bear the Yoke, but remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is <hi>another dreadful Hazard,</hi> that, <hi>if Life be indeed prolonged,</hi> yet, <hi>the Sinner will never come to Repentance; but be hardened through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin, and given up of God,</hi> to <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, and a Reprobate Mind.</hi>

               <hi>If Youth wilfully defer Religion,</hi> in order to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Paſſions, and Appetites, there is a great deal of Danger, that <hi>God will withdraw his holy Spirit,</hi> and lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>One Sin makes way for another, and they who wilfully refuſe the Yoke of Religion, and caſt God's Law behind them, are in great Danger to be holden in the Cords of their Sins, and to be inſenſibly lead on to other Sins, that they may at firſt think of with Horror and Averſion. <hi>There is a Way that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth right to a Man,</hi> in <hi>his own Eyes, but the End thereof are the Ways of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Youth ſet out on the Principles of Good Huſbandry,</hi> and Worldly Prudence, without Regard to the Fear of God and the Salvation of their Souls, there is great Danger, they will periſh by ſome of their Spiritual Enemies.

His Servants we are to whom we obey. And if any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him. It will ſeduce him from the Truth, and pierce him thro' with many Sorrows.</p>
            <p>If Perſons put off Religion in Youth (whatever are their Motives) there is the greateſt Danger. <hi>They will grow ſecure and preſumptuous.</hi> And ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That they will go on deferring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying 'till the Summer is ended and the Harveſt is over, and they are not ſaved. For ſuch is the very Nature of Sin, ſuch are the Deſigns and Stratagems of the Devil, ſuch is the Weakneſs and Corruption of our own Hearts, that we can't reaſonably expect, but that they who willfully chooſe the Paths of Sin for the preſent, will continue to chooſe them.

            <p>In fine there is great Danger that if they ever ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect on their Conduct and Circumſtances, they will be diſcouraged from any Endeavours to break off from their Sins, and turn unto the Lord; and ſink into a Diſpair of Mercy, and pine away in their Sins.</p>

               <hi>Are you ſure of a long Life on Earth?</hi> Or rather, Are you not convinced of the utter uncertainty of your Lives? And do you not know that if Death ſeizes you, while in the Bonds of Iniquity, you are undone for ever?

            <p>In fine, Do <hi>you ſatisfy and encourage your ſelves in Wickedneſs, with the Deſign to repent hereafter?</hi> And is there not the greateſt Abſurdity and Folly in ſuch a Deſign?

If God in Mercy has awaken'd you to ſee the Wiſdom, and Neceſſity of Religion, do not ſuffer the good Impreſſions to wear oft, but cultivate and improve them, 'till you are renewed in the Spirit of your Mind.
