            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTORY PREFACE To CHRISTIAN READERS.</head>
            <p>IT is a real fact, evident beyond contradiction, that every individual ſhould acquire a thorough knowledge of the Life and Death of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, who was crucified for our ſins, roſe again for our juſtification, and now ſitteth at the right hand of GOD, making interceſſion for us. If Chriſtians ſeek a noble example of conduct to copy after we would recommend to them the glorious and benevolent tranſactions OF THE GREAT CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION;
One, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet made himſelf of no reputation, ſuffering his divine eſſence to be clothed with mortality, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs; that mankind by the merits of his redemption, through faith, might enjoy everlaſting happineſs throughout eternity in the realms above. The Life and Death of our Holy <hi>REDEEMER,</hi> with other matters herein contained, is a Work, if properly executed, of the utmoſt conſequence to this Chriſtian land, and is the moſt valuable of all hiſtories; but it is a circumſtance which will be readily allowed, by the impartial and diſintereſted, and which has been long much lamented by many, that no complete and perfectly authentic Work of this kind has yet been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, whereby perſons of every capacity may gain a thorough knowledge of the important ſubject. Hitherto, works of this ſort have been publiſhed in too ſmall a compaſs, and likewiſe in too ſmall ſizes, which are by no means ſo elegant, ſo convenient, or ſo well adapted to the importance of ſo valuable a work, which ſhould not be cut ſhort and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to ſuit any private purpoſe whatever. Some of theſe publications have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by perſons whoſe names, characters, and private ſentiments, would have done no honor to a work of the kind, and were therefore uſhered into the world under the names of fictitious perſons who never exiſted; and others of them have been ſo wretchedly executed, that Chriſtian people have only parted with their money, without having their expectations at all anſwered. To remedy all theſe defects, by which the PUBLIC have been long materially injured, I was applied to by my numerous friends to publiſh this NEW AND COMPLETE LIFE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, the diligent labour of many years, and which, by the bleſſings of God, I have now committed to the preſs, in order that it may be of real benefit and uſe to pious and ſincere Chriſtians of
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:029927_0004_0FE335419B9BA850"/>
every denomination.

                  <p>Concerning the State of Religion, &amp;c. in the World in General, and in the Roman Empire and the Jewiſh Nation in particular, at the Time of our REDEEMER's Birth. Including an Account of the various Sects amongst the Jews, and other particulars, by way of Introduction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is generally acknowledged, by the moſt learned and judicious chronologers, that the GREAT REDEEMER was born in the four thouſandth year after the creation of the world, and four years before the vulgar aera. This miſtake is ſuppoſed to have ariſen from the low ſtate of learning, when the birth of CHRIST was firſt fixed as the epocha from which the whole Chriſtian world reckoned their time. This being upwards of five hundred years after the birth of CHRIST, and there being no authentic records, to fix the the time with exactneſs and preciſion, a miſtake of four years was at firſt made, and hath been ever ſince continued. The year in which the SAVIOUR of the world was born, was the thirty-third of Herod, king of the Jews, after his taking Jeruſalem; and the twenty-ſixth of the emperor Auguſtus, after the victory of Actium; which, concluding the conteſt between him and Mark Anthony, put him in poſſeſſion of the whole Roman empire. It was now about ſeven hundred and fifty years ſince the building of Rome. The Romans had carried their victorious arms through the ſurrounding nations, and by their juſtice, clemency, and moderation, riſen to the higheſt pitch of glory and renown: but by the pride, luxury, and frequent quarrels of their great men, the empire was ſinking from its ancient greatneſs; the commonwealth was at an end; and the ſenate had been forced to ſubmit to a maſter. Though the ſtate had made a violent ſtruggle for liberty, in the murder of Julius Caeſar, great quarrel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029927_0006_0FE33546AFD456C8"/>
authority of Auguſtus. This was a prince of a very amiable diſpoſition: he, by his wiſe management, put an end to all contention, and governed the empire with ſuch juſtice, prudence, and moderation, as made him highly eſteemed by his ſubjects. He not only ſettled the affairs of the ſtate ſo as to preſerve all things quiet at home, but had the like ſucceſs throughout the remoter parts of the vaſt empire: for a general peace prevailed through all the world, when our Great Redeemer, the heavenly Prince of peace, was born.</p>
               <p>THE Jewiſh nation was, at this time, groaning under the tyranny of Herod the Great; who, though an old man, declining in his health, and juſt bordering on the grave, had ſo little thought of his latter end, that he reigned with ſuch cruelty and tyranny, as juſtly rendered him the abhorrence of his ſubjects. A late writer has aſſerted, that the Jews were, at this time, grievouſly oppreſſed by the Roman power, but as Herod was, for the moſt part, in favour with the emperor Auguſtus, and had liberty from him to rule as he pleaſed, and even, on ſlight grounds of complaint, to put his own ſons, Alexander and Chriſtobolus to death; it muſt certainly be the oppreſſion of Herod, and not of Auguſtus (who was a prince of a contrary character) whom the Jews groaned under. Herod was a prince of Idumean decent, whoſe anceſtors had been proſelytes to the Jewiſh religion. He had no right to the regal authority, but was impoſed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Herod was a prince of a martial diſpoſition, but as he knew he had no legal right to the crown, he was guilty of the higheſt injuſtice and cruelty to keep poſſeſſion of that dignity which he had by unlawful means obtained; and never was at reſt till he had procured the death of every prince who was related to it. Having thus erected his throne on murder, treachery, and all kinds of wickedneſs, his reign was ſuch as might be expected from ſuch a beginning. For though he roſe to great opulence and power; though he was poſſeſſed of all that his ambition aſpired to; yet he was conſtantly diſturbed by domeſtic diviſions, and troubles of various kinds, which rendered him moſt deplorably unhappy in the midſt of proſperity. Though he was ſucceſsful in his wars, and conſtantly augmenting his dominions; though in the ſumptuous buildings he erected, and in his grandeur and magnificence, in all reſpects, he exceeded his predeceſſors, Solomon only excepted; yet his reign was one ſeries of plots, jealouſies, cruelties, murder, and every thing that is ſhocking to human nature.</p>
               <p>THE ſtate of religion in the world, at the time of our Redeemer's birth, was ſuch as ſtood in the greateſt need of a teacher ſent from God. The various nations around the globe were immerſed in the darkneſs of idolatry and ſuperſtition. And though the unity of God, and the immortality of the ſoul had been taught by Socrates and Plato, yet their ſentiments were dark and confuſed, very little known amongſt the vulgar, and very little depended on amongſt the more learned. The Jews only retained the worſhip of the true God. Their temple-worſhip was the ſame as eſtabliſhed by Solomon; and the law and the prophets were weekly read in their ſynagogues; but they had, in a great meaſure, made the moral law void by their traditions, and their temple-worſhip was much declined from the primitive glory of its inſtitution. The ſecond temple had now ſtood upwards of four hundred years. It was vaſtly inferior, in magnificence and grandeur, to that which was built by Solomon. It wanted the ark of the covenant, the Divine Preſence, the Urim and Thummim, the holy fire upon the altar, and the ſpirit of prophecy. It was firſt profaned and plundered by Antiochus Epiphanus. It had lately been diſhonoured by the impious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029927_0007_0FE3354833687238"/>
boldneſs of Pompey; and ſoon after by Craſſus, another Roman general, who rapaciouſly ſeized thoſe vaſt treaſures which Pompey's piety and modeſty had ſpared. In a few years after came Herod, who having obtained the grant of the kingdom at Rome, beſieged and took the city and temple. And though, in order to inſinuate himſelf into the affections of the people, he did all in his power to preſerve the temple from being plundered, and a few years after expended vaſt ſums in repairing and beautifying it, yet, as he obtained the regal dignity by the favour of the Romans, he was always careful to pleaſe and oblige them; and accordingly profaned the temple with a golden eagle, which was fixed upon the great porch at the entrance of that fabric, in order to court the favour of the emperor Auguſtus. This gave great offence to the Jews, who were ſcrupulouſly exact in the obſervance of the minuteſt rituals, but ſcandalouſly careleſs in the weightier matters of the law: and while, on every trifling occaſion, they were ready to cry out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord!</hi> they had ſo little regard to the divinity which dwelt within, that they made this holy place a market for trade and merchandize; and filled the ſacred apartments with dealers, merchants, money-changers, and uſurers. And ſuch were the injuſtice and extortion they practiſed in the holy place, it was juſtly obſerved, that the houſe which God had appointed for an houſe of prayer, they had converted into a den of thieves.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER little religion there was amongſt the Jews, they were very forward and open in their profeſſion, and there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al parties amongſt them who violently oppoſed each other. Thoſe who are mentioned in the goſpels are the Phariſees, the Sadducees, the Herodians and the Samaritans; of each of theſe it may be proper to give ſome account. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were the greateſt of all the Jewiſh ſects; and by their pretences to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary purity, and the ſhew they made in things external, they drew the bulk of the common people after them. They maintained a kind of prieſtly pride, and ſolemn ſtiffneſs in their deportment, doing every thing in their power to attract the notice, and gain the veneration of the multitude. A trumpet was founded before them when they gave alms to the poor; they made long prayers at the corners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty and devotion.</p>
               <p>BUT the diſtinguiſhing character of the Phariſees, was their zeal for the traditions of the elders, which they conſtantly maintained, were of equal authority with the written law, as they were received from God himſelf by Moſes when he was forty days on the mount. Theſe traditions were multiplied to ſuch an enormous number, that they were ſufficient to fill twelve folio volumes: and theſe men pretending to an exact and rigorous obſervance of the law according to theſe traditions, would fain have themſelves looked upon more holy than others, and therefore ſeparated themſelves from thoſe whom they eſteemed great ſinners and profane perſons, and refuſed to eat or drink with them. They looked with contempt on the common people, and the conſtant language of their looks and behaviour was, Stand by! Come not near me! I am holier than thou! They were ſcrupulouſly exact in the performance of the minuteſt rituals, and prided themſelves in their punctuality in paying tithes of herbs, while they neglected the weightier matters of the law. They preſumed ſo far as proudly to mention their good deeds in their prayers, and propoſed them as the grounds of the divine acceptance; though, at the ſame time, while they maintained the fair outward ſhew of piety and goodneſs, they were privately guilty of great and ſcandalous vices. This ſect of the Phariſees, in proceſs of time, ſwallowed up all the other ſects amongſt the Jews; and, at preſent, it is by the traditions of the Phariſees, and not by the law and the prophets, that the Jewiſh religion is formed.</p>
               <p>JOINED with the Phariſees in the goſpels, are the Scribes and the Lawyers, who were not diſtinct ſects or parties amongſt the Jews, but men profeſſing learning, and chiefly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029927_0008_0FE335541C3F81A0"/>
followers of the Phariſees in their religion; for the learning of the Jews principally conſiſting in the knowledge of the Phariſaical traditions, and the interpretation of the ſcriptures by them, it is no wonder that the twelve folio volumes, above mentioned, found employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for great numbers of theſe men.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER noted ſect amongſt the Jews, at the time of our great Redeemer's birth, was the <hi>Sadduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es:</hi> Theſe, at their firſt ſeparation, differed only from the Phariſees in their refuſing to receive the tradition of the elders, and abiding by the written law; but in proceſs of time, they degenerated into an univerſal ſcepticiſm; and like our modern Deiſts, they neither believed there exiſted good or evil ſpirits, or that there would be a reſurrection, or a future ſtate. As to the <hi>Herodians,</hi> it is not ſo preciſely known what their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing tenets were; but as their doctrine is called in the goſpel, <hi>The leaven of Herod,</hi> and as their party takes its name from that prince, it is to be ſuppoſed their particular opinions were derived from him: now as, from his general character and conduct, we may conclude that the doctrine of the Sadducees would be very agreeable to him, as it delivered him from the fears of an hereafter, and as it is well known that as ſoon as he was ſecurely ſettled on his throne (having cut off all the heirs of the Aſmonian family) he began to introduce Pagan cuſtoms amongſt the Jews; It is very likely that the Herodians held nearly the ſame ſentiments as the Sadducees, and that they approved the conduct of Herod, in the introduction of the Heathen ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>IT is neceſſary, laſtly, to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> account of the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> Theſe people were not of Jewiſh extraction, but were the offspring of thoſe Heathen nations whom the king of Aſſyria ſent to dwell in the land of Iſrael, in the room of the ten tribes who were carried away captive. Thoſe people when firſt planted in the land, were grievouſly annoyed by lions; and ſuppoſing that this misfortune aroſe from their being ignorant of the worſhip of the god of the land (for the Heathens ſuppoſed that every land had its peculiar deity) they applied to Eſarhaddon, the grandſon of the king who carried them captive, and he ſent them an Iſraelitiſh prieſt, who taught them the worſhip of God according to the law of Moſes. They now took the God of Iſrael into the number of their deities, and worſhipped him in conjunction with the gods of the nations from whence they came. Hence, when the Jews returned from the Babyloniſh captivity, and, by the permiſſion and aſſiſtance of Cyrus king of Perſia, were building their temple, the Samaritans, as they in part profeſſed the ſame religion, propoſed an alliance with them, and offered their aſſiſtance in carrying on the work. This the Jews abruptly refuſed, which gave ſuch offence to the Samaritans, that they took all poſſible pains to obſtruct them in the undertaking; and, by corrupting the officers of Cyrus, prevailed ſo far, that the work was interrupted for a conſiderable time. After ſome years, the Jews obtained a freſh decree from Darius, the third Perſian king from Cyrus, and the temple was finiſhed and dedicated. But the city of Jeruſalem lay in a ruinous condition, and the Jews remained under great contempt and various diſcouragements, for about ſixty years. At the end of this time, Divine Providence appeared for them, and raiſed them up a friend in the perſon of Artaxerxes Longimanus, the Ahaſuerus of the Scriptures. This prince, having exalted a Jewiſh young lady, named Eſther, to be his queen, was a conſtant favourer of the Jews; and ſent Ezra, a prieſt of great learning and piety, from the Perſian court, to reform the abuſes, and ſettle the diſorders that had ariſen amongſt them. And, in a few years afterwards, by the intereſt of the queen, he ſent his cup-bearer, Nehemiah, to rebuild the walls of Jeruſalem, and continue and perfect the reformation which Ezra had begun. In the carrying on of this work, the Jews met with great oppoſition from the Samaritans; and hence there aroſe a mortal hatred between the two people. The Samaritans, in the conteſt, were chiefly ſupported by Sanba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at, the governor of Samaria;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029927_0009_0FE33555A0BADC48"/>
who having married his daughter to Manaſſeh, the ſon of the Jewiſh high-prieſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far on Darius Nothus, the ſucceſſor of Artaxerxes that he obtained from him a grant to build a temple on mount Gerizim, near Samaria; and to make his ſon-in-law high-prieſt thereof. This was accordingly effected, and introduced a change in the Samaritan religion: for whereas they had, till now, only worſhipped the God of Iſrael, in conjunction with their deities, they now conformed themſelves to the worſhip of the true God only, according to the law of Moſes, which was daily read in their new temple: from this time, the cities of Samaria became places of refuge for thoſe Jews who had been guilty of ſuch crimes as expoſed them to puniſhment, and thither they fled to eſcape the arm of juſtice. Hence, in proceſs of time, aroſe a mongrel people, betwixt the Jews and Samaritans. The quarrel between them and the regular Jews continued, and their hatred to each other remained at its higheſt pitch. And though John Hyrcanus, the ſon of Simon Maccabeus, deſtroyed their temple, yet they continued a ſeparate worſhip from the Jews. They acknowledged the authority of no other Scripture than the five books of Moſes, which they kept in a character peculiar to themſelves, ſaid to be the old Hebrew character, which was in uſe amongſt the Jews before the Babyloniſh captivity. Though they were remarkable for their ſtrictneſs in the obſervance of the rules of the law, yet they were more deteſtable to the Jews than were the Heathen nations. When Jeruſalem was deſtroyed by the Romans, about ſeventy years after the birth of CHRIST, when the temple was burnt, and the whole nation diſperſed, the Samaritans remained in poſſeſſion of their country, and there they continue to this day.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the ſtate of religion amongſt the Jews at the time of the birth of CHRIST; nor were their morals in any reſpect ſuperior. Their religion chiefly conſiſted in externals, and by their traditions, they explained away moſt of the excellent precepts of the moral law. Their great men were privately guilty of the moſt ſcandalous vices; nor can it be ſuppoſed that the common people were more regular in their conduct, or that they ſhould eſcape the general corruption which univerſally prevailed in the land.</p>

What further diſcoveries of the divine will, in the redemption of ſinners by the Son of God, were made to the antediluvian patriarchs, are not clearly revealed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029927_0010_0FE335574A474D48"/>
in the word of God; but from the prophecy of Enoch, recorded by the apoſtle Jude, it may be concluded, that the world was not ignorant of this great event; for the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, who could ſo clearly declare, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his ſaints to execute judgment on all</hi> mankind, cannot be ſuppoſed to be totally ignorant of the great perſon who was to ſit in judgment: and the hard ſpeeches which he charges ungodly ſinners with ſpeaking againſt God, may have no indirect reference to the ſcorn, contempt, and reproach, which our great redeemer ſuffered from the ungodly and unbelieving Jews.

That this patriarch had full expectation of ſome exalted perſon, who was to riſe out of his family, and that the notion of this prevailed amongſt his deſcendants, are evident from the bleſſing which Jacob, at his death, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces on his ſon Judah, Gen. xlix.10. <hi>The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, till Shiloh come, and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</hi> The ſceptre not departing from Judah, is here a prediction; but the coming of <hi>Shiloh</hi> at an appointed time, is mentioned as a thing already known. There is no mention directly made of our exalted Saviour, amongſt the moral precepts of the law; but it is univerſally allowed, that the various rituals of the Jewiſh religion were typical of his exalted perſon, his offices, and the great atonement he made to divine juſtice, when he made his ſoul an offering for ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Moſes could declare to Iſrael in plain terms, <hi>A prophet ſhall the Lord thy God raiſe unto thee from amongſt thy brethren like unto me, and it ſhall come to paſs that whomſoever ſhall not hear that prophet, he ſhall be cut off from amongſt his people.</hi> During the conqueſt of Canaan, the anarchy and confuſion which ſucceeded in the time of the Judges, and the reign of Saul, we hear nothing of the Meſſiah. But the royal prophet David, in his pſalms, gives a very lively and ſpirited account of a full belief in this great deſcendant of his; and in a language peculiar to himſelf, deſcribes the glories of his reign, his death, and triumphant reſurrection: for having a clear and full view of the Meſſiah's kingdom and reign, he, in poetic rapture, could cry out, <hi>Thou will not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine Holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> But clearer, and ſtronger ſtill, our great Redeemer blazes forth in the prophecies of Iſaiah, who writes more like an hiſtorian than a prophet, and minutely particularizes the great events which attended the birth, life, and death of the Saviour of ſinners. Full of prophetic fire, the great Iſaiah could cry out, <hi>A virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and call his name Immanuel.</hi> And having a clear view of his ſufferings and death, he could add, <hi>He was led like a ſheep to the ſlaughter; and as a lamb before her ſhearers is dumb; ſo he opened not his mouth. He was taken from priſon and judgment; who ſhall declare his generation? For the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſmitten. He made his grave with the wicked, and the rich, in his death. But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> The ſucceeding prophets were very clear and expreſs in their deſcriptions of the kingdom of the Meſſiah. The prophet Jeremiah particularly mentions the thirty pieces of ſilver, for which he was ſold; and the prophet Daniel pointed out the particular time when he ſhould make his appearance in the world. <hi>Seventy weeks,</hi> ſays the angel, <hi>are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city; to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, to make an end of ſin, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs; to ſeal up the viſion and prophecy, and to anoint the Moſt Holy.</hi> From theſe plain and frequent declarations of their prophets, the Jews had a full and clear expectation of the coming of the Meſſiah; and they had an old tradition amongſt them, which was generally received, and ſuppoſed to come from Elias, that the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029927_0011_0FE33558D00B25B0"/>
Meſſiah ſhould appear in the four thouſandth year of the world, which accordingly came to paſs. Nor was the expectation of our Redeemer's birth confined only to the Jews; a tradition prevailed amongſt the Eaſtern nations, that a great king was to be born to the Jews, who would be worthy to be worſhipped: which is manifeſt from the wiſe men coming to Jeruſalem, to enquire after this glorious perſon, having ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt, and being deſirous not only to ſee the young king, but to preſent their offerings before him. Nor muſt it be omitted, that amongſt the oracles of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> at the time of our Saviour's birth, in ſuch high repute at Rome, are various predictions of the times of the Meſſiah; and the poet Virgil, who wrote in the beginning of Auguſtus, compoſed his <hi>Pollio,</hi> which contains the predictions of a heavenly child ſoon to be born, whom he calls the Son of God, and deſcribes his kingdom in a manner which is parallel to ſeveral ſublime paſſages in the prophet Iſaiah, deſcriptive of the glorious Redeemer of mankind.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE happy time being near at hand, fixed by the Triune God, for our great Redeemer to make his appearance in the world, called in Scripture, <hi>The fullneſs of time,</hi> it pleaſed the Eternal King of heaven and earth, to give notice to mankind, that this exalted perſon would ſoon be manifeſted, and the benefits ariſing from his miſſion obtained. God had declared by his prophets, that before his Son appeared in the world, <hi>A meſſenger ſhould go before his face, to prepare his way.</hi> This meſſenger was further deſcribed under the character of the prophet Elijah; and in another place he was called <hi>The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make ſtraight, in the deſert, a high way for our God.</hi> In the accompliſhment of thoſe prophecies, it was neceſſary that John the Baptiſt, the forerunner of our great Redeemer, ſhould firſt be born; and, accordingly, the Angel Gabriel was ſent from heaven to give notice of the birth of this great herald of the Lord of life. The perſons deſtined to be parents to this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary man, were Zacharias, a pious prieſt, and his wife Elizabeth; who were both of the family of Aaron, and blameleſs in the obſervance of the law. But, though they had lived from their youth in the married ſtate, they were not bleſſed with any offspring, and were both ſo far advanced in years, that according to the courſe of nature, no iſſue could be expected from them. The prieſts that officiated in the temple of Solomon, were divided into twenty-four courſes; every courſe began its ſervice on the Sabbath-day, and continued all the week. Only four of theſe courſes returned from the Babyloniſh captivity; the reſt were either extinct, or tarried behind. But, that the number of twenty-four might ſtill ſubſiſt, each courſe divided itſelf into ſix; the new ones taking upon themſelves the names of thoſe who were wanting. Zacharias was of the courſe of Abia, one of the new ones in this ſub-diviſion, and the eighth in the order of the twenty-four. It was the lot of this aged prieſt to burn incenſe in the holy place, and while the ſmoke of the incenſe aſcended, the people, according to cuſtom, were praying in the outward court. As the good prieſt ſtood by the altar of incenſe, the angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in view, all bright and glorious, as a native of the ſky. Zacharias, at the ſight of the heavenly meſſenger, was filled with terror and diſmay; but the angel, with conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029927_0012_0FE33560276407B8"/>
goodneſs, thus addreſſed him: <hi>Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth ſhall bear the a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name John. And thou ſhalt have joy and gladneſs, and many ſhall rejoice at his birth: for he ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, and ſhall neither drink wine nor ſtrong drink; and he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of Iſrael ſhall he turn unto the Lord their God. And he ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</hi> As Zacharias was one of the pious Jews who waited for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſrael, doubtleſs he had often prayed that he might live to ſee the Meſſiah come, which was the prayer that the angel aſſured him was heard; but that his wife Elizabeth ſhould bear a ſon, who ſhould be the forerunner of the Redeemer of Iſrael, ſeemed a thing ſo extraordinary, and out of the courſe of nature, that the prieſt could not believe it, though aſſerted by an angel; and therefore replied to the heavenly meſſenger: <hi>Whereby ſhall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well ſtricken in years.</hi> The bright commander of the angelic ſquadrons, ſeemed diſpleaſed that Zacharias ſhould queſtion the truth of his prediction; and therefore proceeded to let him know his dignity, and the high place he occupied in the heavenly world; and the conſequential impoſſibility that he ſhould deceive him. Know, ſaid he, that <hi>I am Gabriel that ſtand in the preſence of God, and am ſent</hi> from heaven, <hi>to ſpeak unto thee, and to ſhew thee theſe glad tidings.</hi> But, as thou haſt preſumed to call in queſtion the truth of the heavenly meſſage, <hi>thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak, until th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe things ſhall be performed:</hi> for though thou haſt not believed my words, they nevertheleſs are true, <hi>and ſhall be performed in their ſeaſon.</hi> The prieſt, aſtoniſhed at the viſion, ſtayed longer in the holy place than uſual; at which the people, who waited without for his benediction, were much ſurpriſed: at laſt he came to them, but found the prediction of the angel awfully fulfilled; for when, according to the courſe of his office, he was to bleſs the people, he could not ſpeak; but ſignified to them by ſigns, that he had ſeen a viſion, which was the cauſe of his dumbneſs; and, the week of his adminiſtration being accompliſhed, he returned to his houſe. Soon after this, his wife Elizabeth found herſelf with child, but made a ſecret of her conception for the firſt five months, contenting herſelf with giving God thanks in private, for his great goodneſs in taking away the reproach of her barrenneſs; and revolving in her mind, with wonder and praiſe, the unſearchable counſels of God, and his great goodneſs to the children of men.</p>
               <p>SIX months after this, the angel Gabriel, the ſame who had appeared to the prophet Daniel, and foretold the very time of our Redeemer's birth, and had lately predicted to Zacharias the birth of his forerunner, was ſent from the heavenly regions, to the city of Nazareth, to an amiable and virtuous virgin, named Mary, ſuppoſed to be about fifteen years of age. She was of the houſe and lineage of David, and was eſpouſed to a good man, ſuppoſed to be a widower, and pretty far advanced in years, named Joſeph, who was alſo of the royal line of David. The huſband had not taken home his wife, but ſhe remained a virgin at her father's houſe; and while, as ſuppoſed, at her private devotions, the angel appeared to her arrayed in heavenly brightneſs; and, with a condeſcending ſmile, ſaluted her in terms of the higheſt reſpect: <hi>Hail Mary,</hi> he cried, <hi>thou art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: bleſſed art thou amongſt women.</hi> The pious maid was not more ſurpriſed at the blaze of heavenly glory which ſhone around her, than at the ſalutation of the coeleſtial meſſenger, to whom ſhe knew not how to reply. When the angel rejoined, with looks and accents of ſuch kindneſs, and heavenly goodneſs, as diſſipated every fearful apprehenſion. <hi>Fear not, Mary; for thou haſt found favour with God. And behold thou ſhalt conceive and bring forth a Son, and ſhall call his name JESUS; he ſhall be great and ſhall be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029927_0013_0FE335634A6FCC78"/>
called the Son of the Higheſt: and the Lord God ſhall give him the throne of his father David, and he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> The holy maid, not immediately recollecting that the prophet Iſaiah had, in his predictions of the Meſſiah ſaid, <hi>Behold a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon:</hi> and being conſcious of her purity, did not, like Zacharias, require a ſign; but modeſtly inquired how her pregnancy could be effected in her virgin ſtate. <hi>How,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>can this be, ſeeing I know not a man?</hi> To which the angel, with condeſcending goodneſs, replied, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo, that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the ſon of God.</hi> And though the holy maid had not required a ſign, whereby ſhe might be aſſured of the certainty of an event ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and contrary to the eſtabliſhed order of nature, the heavenly gueſt was pleaſed to give her this ſatisfaction: <hi>And behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thy couſin Elizabeth, ſhe hath alſo conceived a ſon in her old age, and this is the ſixth month with her who was called barren: for with God nothing ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> This reply was accompanied with ſuch a manifeſtation of the Divine Preſence, that it removed every fear, and filled the wondering maid with heavenly gladneſs, which ſhe had not known before. The expectation of the MESSIAH was general at this time throughout the Jewiſh nation, and ſtrong were the deſires of Judah's daughters for the honour and happineſs of being the mother of the Redeemer of Iſrael; and the holy maid, it may be expected, had ardently wiſhed for this great bleſſing; ſo that, with growing joy and exultation, ſhe immediately replied to the bright arch-angel, <hi>Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after the departure of the angel, the holy virgin, regarding with joy of heart what the heavenly meſſenger had related concerning her relation and friend, went to the hill country of Judea, to pay a viſit to her couſin Elizabeth. It is ſuppoſed that Zacharias lived at Hebron, the city of David, before he went to Jeruſalem, formerly inhabited by giants, but taken by Joſhua; and, when the land was divided, given to the tribe of Judah; which city was about ſeventy miles from Nazareth. The joy that inſpired the bleſſed virgin, gave her ſuch a flow of ſpirits, that ſhe lightly tripped over the mountains; and as ſoon as ſhe arrived at the houſe of her dear relative, the pious matron was filled with divine illuminations, and ſo affected at the ſound of the maiden's voice, that the evangeliſt informs us, <hi>the babe leaped in her womb.</hi> And, being filled with heavenly rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe addreſſed the wondering maid in the ſame language which ſhe had lately heard from the angel, <hi>Bleſſed art thou amongst women;</hi> to which ſhe added, <hi>and bleſſed is the fruit of thy womb:</hi> and ſtill continuing full of heavenly ardour, ſhe exclaimed, <hi>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me!</hi> ſhe then proceeded immediately to inform her of her happy pregnancy, <hi>For to,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>as ſoon as the voice of thy ſalutation ſounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</hi> And then, in full aſſurance of the fulfilment of the divine predictions reſpecting them both, ſhe added, <hi>And bleſſed is ſhe that believeth, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</hi> The divine flame of holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>love and joy, which glowed in the heart of the pious matron, ſoon catched in the boſom of the holy virgin; who, confirmed beyond all poſſibility of a doubt, in the truth of the angel's prediction, by what ſhe had now heard from her dear relation, proceeded with a heart full of gratitude and holy joy, to bleſs, and praiſe, and magnify the name of the Lord, for his great goodneſs to her, in appointing her to be the mother of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>AFTER three months ſtay with her dear relative, the virgin Mary returned to her own city Nazareth; and being now the fourth month, her pregnancy plainly appeared; which gave great concern to Joſeph, her eſpouſed huſband. But though he apprehended ſhe had
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029927_0014_0FE33564D11AE418"/>
been ſeduced, yet having a ſincere affection for her, and being of a kind and compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate diſpoſition, he was not willing to proceed to the ſeverity of the law; which in this caſe, was no leſs than her being ſtoned to death at the door of her father's houſe. But as he had juſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that her honour could not be vindicated, and being a ſtrict obſerver of the law, he was not willing to take her to his bed; but ſtood determined to break the marriage contract as privately as poſſible. While with great vexation and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he was ruminating on theſe things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and informed him of the nature of his wife's pregnancy; giving him, at the ſame time, full ſatisfaction concerning her innocency. <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaid the heavenly viſion, <hi>Joſeph thou ſon of David, to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghoſt. And ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name JESUS, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> It was with unſpeakable joy, that the good man received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and, not heſitating a moment reſpecting the truth of the heavenly meſſage, he took the lovely maid home to his houſe. But the evangeliſt informs us, that <hi>he knew her not, till ſhe had brought forth her firſt born Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE theſe things were in agitation at Nazareth, Elizabeth the wife of Zacharias the prieſt, and relative of the favoured virgin, having completed the full time of her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, was delivered of a ſon. The reproach of her barrenneſs being thus removed, her neighbours and friends rejoiced with her; the whole family ſmiled at the event, and every heart was glad. On the eighth day, when they attended on the ſacred rite of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the relations propoſed that he ſhould be named Zacharias, after his father; but the mother informed them that his name muſt be John. All the gueſts wondered at this, becauſe it was a name never known in the family, and for the deciſion of the affair, they applied to the father. The good man being dumb ſince the appearance of the angel who predicted the birth of the child, could not inform them, but made ſigns for a writing table, and wrote, <hi>His name is John.</hi> The relations wondered at this, but more at obſerving the old man's dumbneſs to ceaſe from that moment, whoſe voice, riſing clearer and ſtronger for having been ſo long ſuppreſſed, raiſed loud ſtrains of joy and gladneſs, and lofty praiſes to the God of Iſrael, for his great goodneſs, in remembering and viſiting his people; and, full of prophetic rapture, turning to his infant ſon, <hi>And thou child,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhalt be called the prophet of the Higheſt: for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of ſalvation unto his people; by the remiſſion of their ſins, through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> Such were the circumſtances which attended the birth of the forerunner of our great Redeemer; the report of which ſoon ſpread through the hill country of Judea, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious were the conceptions of the people concerning the future greatneſs of the child. The infant ſoon grew ſtrong and robuſt, he was remarkably ſimple and abſtemious in his diet, plain and careleſs in his dreſs, and addicted to ſolitude and contemplation. Sacred hiſtory gives us no information what afterwards became of his parents; but there is a tradition that the mother fled into the deſerts with her infant ſon, to preſerve him from the rage of Herod; and that the father was ſlain in the outer court of the temple, by the orders of that tyrant; and is that Zacharias which Chriſt mentions, whoſe blood was ſhed between the temple and the altar.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE great King of the creation and righteous Governor of the univerſe, having fixed in his eternal counſels, both the time and the place where his only ſon was to be born; ſo ordered the affairs of the world, as to bring his great predictions and gracious deſigns to paſs. And as he over-rules the counſels of princes, and determines the actions of men, ſo as to anſwer the wiſe ends of his government, and accompliſh the deſigns of his grace; ſo in this preſent inſtance, there is a remarkable manifeſtation of divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power co-operating to bring about this great event. The holy Virgin and her huſband dwelt at Nazareth; and, according to the prophet's prediction, the Meſſiah was to be born at Bethlehem, which was at a conſiderable diſtance; but to bring the great prediction to paſs, Divine Providence ſo ordered it, that about three years before the time of our Redeemer's birth, a decree paſſed at Rome, by the order of the emperor Auguſtus, that a ſurvey ſhould be taken, and a regiſter made, of the perſons eſtates and wealth, contained in his vaſt empire. This ſurvey ſeems not to have been taken with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate deſign of taxation, but rather from views of ambition, or that the emperor might know the number and riches of his ſubjects; for there were no taxes gathered by the Romans till eleven or twelve years after this, when Archelius the ſon of Herod, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for his tyranny and oppreſſion, and Judea reduced into the form of a Roman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; for Herod, and the reſt of the tributary kings, received the taxes of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and paid ſuch tribute to Rome as was ſtipulated between them and the emperor. This ſurvey, having been carried through various provinces and kingdoms which were ſubject to Rome, in the two years paſt, was now making in Judea; and every family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders from Herod to repair to their own city, to give an account of their real or perſonal eſtates, and there to be regiſtered. Joſeph and Mary his wife, being both of the family of David, were obliged, on this occaſion, to take a journey to the ancient city of Bethlehem. The evangeliſts Matthew and Luke have inſerted in their Goſpels, the genealogy of JESUS CHRIST, in which there is ſo great a variation, that it is with reaſon concluded, that Matthew gives us the genealogy of Joſeph, and Luke of the Virgin Mary; that it may appear they were both of the houſe and lineage of David; one riſing through Solomon, and the other through Nathan, another ſon of that prince. Though the holy Virgin was great with child, and near the time of her delivery, ſhe could not be excuſed from this long journey. The town of Bethlehem was crouded on this occaſion; every inn, and every houſe of hoſpitable entertainment was full; the extraordinary perſons who are the ſubjects of our preſent attention, made no great appearance in the world, and could not command the beſt accommodations: and while thoſe, whoſe ſuperior affluence commanded reſpect, took up the beſt apartments of the inns, the mother of the great Meſſiah was content to lodge in a ſtable; and there, having accompliſhed the full time of her pregnancy, ſhe was delivered of her heavenly ſon. Some have ſuppoſed, that, as ſhe had conceived by the mighty power of God, ſhe brought forth her ſon without pain, or common aſſiſtance. The ſtable in which our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was born, is ſaid to be a cave cut out of a rock; and it is not unlikely that he was born in the night. In this ſituation the holy virgin, having brought forth her ſon, wrapped the infant in ſwaddling clothes, and, having no better accommodations, laid him in a manger. What an amazing inſtance of condeſcenſion was this! The Son of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029927_0016_0FE33570E00DB040"/>
Eternal God! The Heir of all things! The Darling of the ſkies! Who was worſhipped by angels, and held in veneration equal with heaven's Great Supreme; to become man; to take human nature upon him in its moſt helpleſs and feeble ſtate; to lay aſide his ſtarry crown, and all the glories of his heavenly dignity, and become a ſuckling child! One would have thought, that when the great King of the univerſe condeſcended to become man, and appear in this world, that he would have been received by the inhabitants of the earth with tokens of the higheſt regard; and that every thing great and good, every thing grand and noble, would have been prepared to honour and accommodate the mighty prince. It might have been particularly expected, that the nation which he choſe for his reſidence, that people whom he condeſcended to make his countrymen, would have received him with the higheſt acclamations, and warmeſt tokens of honour and reſpect. But how contrary to this were the councils of heaven! how oppoſite to this, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our great Redeemer! When great princes are born, the city of their birth rings with acclamations, and the illuminated night ſhines like the day. But when our exalted Redeemer was born, all was ſilent, all was ſtill. Not the poor peaſant, who firſt draws breath in the homely cottage, ſteals into the world leſs unobſerved, than did the Son of God. He, in all probability was born in the night, perhaps without light, or by the glimmering of a winking taper. When great princes are born, they are wrapped in fine linen, and adorned with mantles of purples fringed with gold: the floors of their apartments are decorated with ſplendid carpets, the windows are adorned with noble hangings, and they lie on a bed of ſtate, which ſhines with crimſon and with gold. But our great Redeemer, and Saviour of mankind, the greateſt Prince that ever was born into the world, received no honour, no tokens of reſpect; was received with no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of joy; had no ſplendid apartment, no rich decorations: but was brought forth in a ſtable, without any perſon to put on the poor habit prepared for him, but his virgin mother, who herſelf wrapped him in ſwaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger: but though our glorious Redeemer was received, by the inhabitants of the earth, with no tokens of reſpect, or demonſtrations of joy; though he was brought forth in the incommodious limits of a ſtable, and his companions were the beaſts of the field; he was not neglected or diſregarded by the bright natives of the heavenly world. A ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of ſhining cherubs was diſpatched from the eternal throne, to proclaim the great event, to congratulate the wondering world on their great Deliverer's birth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the approach of the exalted Prince of peace. But this report was to be made; not to the great Sanhedrim; not to the learned doctors of the law; not to the chief prieſts and elders: but to a company of poor ſhepherds, who were watching their flocks by night, in the fields of Bethlehem. The rays of heavenly glory which attended this ſhining train, breaking through the darkneſs of night, alarmed and terrified the artleſs ſwains. But one of the angels called to them from on high: <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be unto all people: for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord. And this ſhall be a ſign unto you, ye ſhall find the babe wrapped in ſwaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</hi> No ſooner had the angel uttered theſe words, than the reſt of the ſquadron, who attended him down the ſkies, appeared; a flood of light illumined the whole concave of heaven, and angels ſongs were heard on earthly ground. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on earth peace, and good will towards men,</hi> was the ſtrain they ſung. And, having ended the coeleſtial concert, they vaniſhed out of ſight. Soon as the angelic hoſt was departed, the wondering ſhepherds repaired to Bethlehem, to ſeek the heavenly infant, whoſe birth had in this glorious manner been related. And, as the angels had declared, they found the holy child, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only by his virgin mother, and his ſuppoſed father Joſeph; the babe was wrapped in the meaneſt clothes, and laid in a manger. Theſe circumſtances anſwering ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029927_0017_0FE3357265CAFCE0"/>
to the heavenly declaration, confirmed the affected ſhepherds, who, with the moſt ardent joy, adored the holy infant, and related to his wondering parents, what a glorious appearance they had ſeen, and what great things the angels had related concerning the child. The Shepherds then, with exultation and joy, returned to their flocks, declaring to all men, the great things which they had ſeen, and praiſing God for his condeſcending goodneſs, in this unexpected manifeſtation of his great deſigns, to perſons ſo low and inconſiderable in the world. When the ſhepherds were departed, the virgin mother of the Lord of life recollected, with adoration and praiſe, the various concurring teſtimonies of the divinity of her ſon; and treaſured them up in her heart, with full expectation of being accompliſhed in him, which had been predicted by the prophets concerning the Redeemer of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>WHEN the eighth day was arrived, ſince the birth of the holy child, he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in conformity to the command of the law of Moſes; and received the name of JESUS, according to the direction of the angel, who predicted his conception and birth.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE holy Virgin and her pious huſband Joſeph, having performed all that the law required in the ſacred rite of circumciſion, and it being neceſſary, that the heavenly infant ſhould, at the end of forty days, be preſented in the temple; it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they remained at Bethlehem till thoſe days were accompliſhed; for Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was but about ſix miles from Bethlehem, but a much greater diſtance from Nazareth, the place of their reſidence. The days of her purification being fulfilled, the virgin mother, according to the rules preſcribed by the law, accompanied by her huſband, brought her young ſon to the temple: ſhe waited in the outer court, while the two turtle-doves, which, conformable to her mean condition, ſhe had brought for her offering, were preſented by the prieſt as an oblation to the Lord; ſhe was then admitted into the inner court, where the prieſt received the bleſſed infant from his mother's arms, and preſented him to the Lord, at the altar of burnt offering; and received the five ſhekels, which the law exacted of every family, without regard to their circumſtances, for the redemption of a firſt-born ſon. The God, whom Iſrael expected, then <hi>ſuddenly came to his temple: and the glory of the latter houſe was greater than the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE theſe ſacred rites were performing, a pious and venerable old man came into the temple, whoſe name was Simeon: he had long waited, and earneſtly prayed for the redemption of Iſrael; and it had been revealed to him, by the ſpirit of God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he ſhould ſee the exalted Meſſiah. Accordingly the ſpirit which now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his ſteps to the temple, impreſſed on his mind a clear and ſtrong conviction, that the infant, now preſenting at the altar, was this glorious perſon. Full of heavenly tranſport, he took the holy bleſſed infant in his arms and addreſſed the throne of that God, who had thus highly favoured him, in ſuch language as this: <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people: a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael.</hi> It may be ſuppoſed, that theſe words were heard with wonder and joy,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029927_0018_0FE33573EC49B520"/>
by the parents of the holy child: for it muſt certainly ſeem ſtrange to them, that the good old man ſhould be acquainted with the great things which concerned the heavenly infant; and they doubtleſs had reaſon to wonder how he came by the information: but turning to the virgin mother, he added, <hi>Behold, this child is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael.</hi> In theſe remarkable words, the venerable old man propheſied the oppoſition which the Goſpel of CHRIST ſhould meet with in the world; and ſhewed that the deſtruction of many would be the conſequence of their final unbelief and diſobedience; yet, at the ſame time, many would riſe out of that dreadful condition, into which they were fallen by their ſins, by being enabled to believe in the Son of God, and apply to their ſouls the benefits of his great ſalvation. The holy prophet proceeded further to inform the mother of our Lord, that her ſon ſhould be ſet up as a mark, at which the unbelieving and diſobedient ſhould level all the darts of their infernal fury; and that the ſorrows that ſhe would feel on that account, would be exceedingly cutting, and painful: <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a ſword ſhall pierce through thy own ſoul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</hi> The prophecy was remarkably fulfilled, when the holy Virgin, about thirty-three years after this, ſtood by the croſs, and, in all the bitterneſs of grief, beheld the ſufferings of her expiring ſon. Various have been the conjectures concerning this good old man Simeon; but who he was, is not decided with any degree of certainty. Some have ſuppoſed him to be a prieſt; others have imagined he was Simeon the Juſt, a great perſon who bore an excellent character amongſt the Jews; others have concluded him to be the ſon of Hillel, a famous doctor in the Sanhedrim. But, as the evangeliſts are ſilent in theſe particulars, they muſt be left without any further enquiry.</p>
               <p>THE teſtimony of this great perſon was confirmed by that of an aged matron, named Anna, whom the evangeliſt calls a propheteſs; and declares, that <hi>ſhe departed not from the temple, but ſerved God, with faſtings and prayers, night and day.</hi> The meaning of which is, that ſhe had dedicated herſelf to the ſervice of God, and conſtantly attended on his worſhip in the temple. She had been married in her youth, and lived ſeven years with her huſband: after his death, ſhe continued in a ſtate of widowhood, and was now far advanced in years. She came into the temple, while the aged Simeon held our great Redeemer in his arms; and, filled with heavenly rapture, bleſſed and praiſed the Lord for his infinite mercy, in remembering his people; and ſpake of the heavenly child <hi>to all them that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem.</hi> Every thing which the law required concerning the redemption and preſenting the holy child, being performed, Joſeph and his family returned to Galilee, and dwelt in their own city Nazareth. But, it is ſuppoſed that they did not long remain there, but ſettling their affairs, they ſoon returned to Bethlehem, and, with the heavenly infant, dwelt there.</p>
               <p>WHILE the holy family dwelt at Bethlehem, there came to Jeruſalem, a company of eaſtern philoſophers, or wiſe men. There had been a tradition ſpread all over the eaſtern nations, that a great king was to be born to the Jews, who would gain the empire of the world. This tradition is ſuppoſed to have ariſen from the Jews, who were ſcattered throughout the various nations of the Eaſt; and Zoroaſter, the reformer of the Perſian religion, ſaid to be a ſervant to the prophet Daniel, copied into his book ſeveral paſſages out of the Old Teſtament, and cannot be ſuppoſed to have omitted the famous prophecies concerning the kingdom of the Meſſiah. At the time of our Redeemer's birth, a remarkable ſtar, or luminous appearance, was ſeen in thoſe countries, which induced the learned men of thoſe times to conclude, that this ſplendid luminary denoted the birth of that extraordinary perſon: and ſo fully were they ſatisfied that their concluſion was true, that a company of learned men actually came to Jeruſalem on this errand. Whether they were princes, prieſts, or philoſophers; how many there were in number; from
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029927_0019_0FE3357571126890"/>
what country they came, or how many days they arrived at Jeruſalem after the birth of CHRIST, are queſtions which have puzzled the learned in all ages, but have never yet obtained a ſatisfactory anſwer. However, it is a certain matter of fact, that, <hi>when Jeſus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the days of Herod the king, there came wiſe men from the Eaſt to Jeruſalem, ſaying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip him.</hi> The appearance of theſe perſons, the report, and the inquiry they made, alarmed and terrified the jealous old tyrant: for though by reaſon of his years, and ill ſtate of health, he could not expect long to hold the crown; he could not bear the thought of a prince being born that was deſtined to that high dignity. And, as it had been his conſtant practice to murder every one who had a greater right to the crown than himſelf, he ſoon concluded, that the young child, when found, ſhould add to the number of thoſe murders he had been guilty of, to rear his throne, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it: but he craftily concealed his wicked deſign, ſpake to the ſtrangers fair, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Sanhedrim to anſwer their enquiry, where the Meſſiah was to be born. He ſoon received their anſwer, and was informed, that Bethlehem in Judea, was the place where CHRIST was to be born: <hi>for thus it was written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the leaſt amongst the princes of Judah: for out of thee ſhall come a Governor, that ſhall rule my people Iſrael.</hi> The gloomy tyrant, ſatisfied with this reply, ſent for the noble ſtrangers; and ſeeming well pleaſed with the event, diligently inquired after every circumſtance which might throw light on the affair; and ſent them to Bethlehem, deſiring them, when they had found the child, to return to Jeruſalem, and direct him to the place of his abode; and he pretended, that he would wait on him himſelf, and appoint him ſuch honours as his high dignity required. The wiſe men received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with great ſatisfaction, and gladly ſet out for Bethlehem; when, to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy, they ſaw, going before them, the ſame luminous appearance which they had ſeen in their own country: this glorious ſtar ſtopped at Bethlehem, and ſtood directly over the houſe where the heavenly infant was. Thus directed by divine wiſdom and power, they approached the ſacred babe with adoration and joy, and having fallen down and worſhipped him, they preſented their offerings of gold, frankincenſe, and myrrh. But when they departed, they returned not to Jeruſalem, but went to their own country another way; for the Lord had warned them in a dream, not to return to Herod with the information he deſired.</p>
               <p>HERE may be obſerved the particular care of Divine Providence, in the preſervation of the holy child; for Herod, who was one of the moſt crafty tyrants that ever exiſted, did not act in this caſe with his uſual circumſpection. He had no other notion of the Meſſiah, but that of his ſitting up a temporal kingdom, and ſuppoſed that this child would drive both himſelf and his family from the throne; and on this account he had reſolved to put the infant to death. But is it not ſtrange that he ſhould not have went himſelf, or ſent ſome of his officers, or ſpies along with the wiſe men, and prevented the eſcape of his deſtined prey? The character and conduct of Herod in almoſt every caſe, is contrary to this: but the great Governor of the univerſe, when he pleaſes can caſt confuſion on the councils of princes, and preſerve the innocent from their wicked deſigns.</p>
               <p>WE are not to ſuppoſe, that the ſatisfying the curioſity of theſe noble ſtrangers, was the only end which Providence had in view, when it directed them, in this extraordinary manner, to the place of our Redeemer's birth, and inſpired them with ſuch ſentiments concerning him. Several great and important ends were anſwered by this viſit; it ſhewed to ſucceeding generations, beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, that there was an expectation, amongſt the heathen nations, that a great king would at this time appear amongſt the Jews; and it is manifeſt from hence, that there were prophecies amongſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029927_0020_0FE3357DC43A4A68"/>
the Gentiles, which inſpired them with a conſtant hope, that ſome great things would be done for mankind, by this exalted perſon. And it is to be ſuppoſed, that theſe great men, when they returned to their own country, publiſhed abroad through various nations, the tidings of what they had ſeen: and filling the world with the expectations of the kingdom of the Meſſiah, prepared the various nations for the reception of his glorious goſpel. Thus, while the Jews continued in the blindneſs of obſtinacy and unbelief, vaſt multitudes of the Heathens received the goſpel, rejoiced in the truth, and dwelt under the benign influence of the great Sun of Righteouſneſs. It may further be noted, that the coming of theſe philoſophers to Jeruſalem at this time, on ſuch an errand, produced the determination of the Jewiſh council, that it was the language of the prophets, that Bethlehem was deſtined by heaven to be the place of our Redeemer's birth. And it may further be obſerved, that the ſeaſonable preſents made to the holy family, by theſe beneficent and learned ſtrangers, enabled the good man to ſupport his family in Egypt, where they ſoon after this were ſent by divine direction, to eſcape the murdering fury of that execrable tyrant Herod.</p>
               <p>THE wiſe men being departed to their own country, <hi>the angel of the Lord appeared to Joſeph in a dream, ſaying, Ariſe, and take the young child and his mother; and flee into Egypt, and be there until I bring thee word: for Herod will ſeek the young child to deſtroy him.</hi> Joſeph immediately obeyed the divine command, and, for the greater ſecurity ſet out from Bethlehem in the night: and taking a journey of near two hundred miles, he ſettled with his family in Egypt, and there he remained till the tyrant was dead. Herod, in the mean time, having waited for the return of the wiſe men in vain, and knowing he was hated by the Jews, was ſo jealous, diſcontented, and wicked, that he miſtruſted every body of plotting againſt him; and, perhaps, concluding, that the Jews might conceal this child till a proper opportunity ſhould offer for them to bring him forth, was full of rage, and actuated by the moſt infernal cruelty, ſent his ſoldiers to Bethlehem, and the adjacent country, with orders to kill all the young children that were under two years old. The troops too punctually executed the orders of the deteſted tyrant; and it is aſſerted by hiſtorians, that fourteen thouſand young children fell in this bloody maſſacre, and Judah's ſtreams ran infant blood. The horrid cruelty of this tranſaction is ſuch, that it is almoſt ſufficient to ſtagger our belief. But if we conſider the conduct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the man, that he was grown old in murder and cruelty; that he reared his throne in blood; that he was guilty of the moſt horrid murders to ſupport it; and at this very time, was moſt deplorably miſerable by quarrels in his family, and was conſtantly apprehenſive of plots againſt his life: if we conſider that he had no friend he could truſt, but was jealous of all about him, and thought his own ſons conſpired to poiſon him; but we ſhall not wonder at any degrees of wickedneſs, which ſuch a man, in ſuch a ſituation, might be capable of committing. But this horrid ſcene, as it might be expected, was ſoon followed by peculiar and diſtinguiſhed vengeance, which burſt on the impious tyrant, and laid him low in death. In the utmoſt agonies of mind, and the acuteſt torments of body, he ſoon after this expired. He ordered the execution of his own ſon but five days before his death, and he commande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS affecting and terrible ſlaughter of the innocents, is pathetically deſcribed by the evangeliſt, in referring to a paſſage in the prophet Jeremiah. <hi>Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the prophet, ſaying, in Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi>

The good man, without heſitation, obeyed the heavenly viſion, and returning to his native country, deſigned to have ſettled in Judea, probably at Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem. But when he heard that Archelaus, the ſon of Herod, ſucceeded his father in Judea, and he being a prince of a cruel diſpoſition, Joſeph judged it imprudent to ſettle in his dominions; and hearing that Antipas, another of Herod's ſons, but more mild and peaceable in his temper, was governor of Galilee, he, by divine direction, went thither, and took up his abode at Nazareth, the former place of his reſidence, <hi>that it might be fulfilled,</hi> the evangeliſts inform us, <hi>which was ſpoken by the prophet, He ſhall be called a Nazarene.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THE account of our Lord's childhood and youth is very ſlightly touched on in the ſacred writings. How he was employed from his infancy, till he arrived at thirty years of age, is not to be found in any authentic hiſtory. This period includes the greateſt part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f his life, which is abſolutely unknown to the Chriſtian world. St. Luke, who is the moſt particular in his account of our Lord's younger years, only tells us, that <hi>the child grew, and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdom; and the grace of God was upon him.</hi> And, ſpeaking of his life at his father's houſe at Nazareth, he informs us, <hi>that he was ſubject to his parents, and that he increaſed in wiſdom and ſtature, and in favour with God and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT, notwithſtanding the ſilence of the ſacred writings, we are not to ſuppoſe that the heavenly youth was ſubject to the common frailties of humanity, the follies of childhood and youth. It may naturally be concluded, from what is above declared, that the holy child was remarkable for a native grandeur and majeſtic modeſty in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that his temper was the moſt amiable, not peeviſh and pettiſh, but all meekneſs, kindneſs, condeſcenſion, and goodneſs; and that his mind was peculiarly turned to ſeriouſneſs and contemplation. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he was poſſeſſed of the moſt amazing faculties and powers of mind; a ſtrong retentive memory; a lively imagination; a prodigious underſtanding; a penetrating judgment; and a remarkable ſolidity and ſedateneſs, which led him to the moſt ſincere and regular piety, and ſpiritual exerciſes of every kind. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he ſpent much time in private retirement, and in divine meditations, and ſpiritual converſe with his heavenly Father; and that he behaved, in every reſpect, in ſuch a manner to his friends and relations, as
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029927_0024_0FE3358CB52408D0"/>
made him the moſt amiable child, in the age in which he lived. It cannot be learned from the evangeliſts that he had a liberal education; every account we have of the condition of his parents in the world, conſpires to prove that they were in low cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Joſeph was by trade a carpenter. JESUS abode with his parents till his public miniſtry commenced, and, no doubt, worked with his ſuppoſed father at his trade. He is called in one place in the goſpels, the carpenter; and in another the carpenter's ſon: ſo that it may be concluded that he had no other learning than what his parents themſelves taught him, and what he might gather at the ſynagogue by attending to the reading of the law and the prophets. But it may be learned from the words of the evangeliſt above quoted, that the favour of God towards him was very apparent, and that the holy Spirit with which he was filled, appeared in his early youth. The wonderful advances he made in wiſdom, the viſible ſtrength and ſteadineſs of his mind, and the ſeriouſneſs of his countenance, beyond what ever was ſeen before in one ſo young, were plain vindications of his divinity, and were every day improving and increaſing.</p>
               <p>IT was the general cuſtom of the Jews to take a journey to Jeruſalem, and annually attend the feaſt of the paſſover. The parents of our Great Redeemer, with their numerous relations and friends, when the holy child was twelve years old, went to the capital of the kingdom on this occaſion. Whether the child JESUS had been at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem before, is not certainly known: it is generally concluded that he had not. Having remained ſeven days with them, during their attendance at the temple, he ſeperated himſelf from the company, and, when they ſet out on their return to their own country, ſtayed behind. They proceeded on their firſt day's journey, and did not miſs him till night, ſuppoſing he might be in company with ſome of their relations, who had been at the holy city on the ſame occaſion with themſelves, and were now returning. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring amongſt all their kindred and friends, they learnt that he was not in the company. Full of anxiety and diſtreſs, they returned to Jeruſalem; and ſearched every place in the city where he was likely to be found. Two days they ſought him in vain. On the third day, they found him in the outer court of the temple, amongſt the learned doctors of the law, both hearing them, and aſking them queſtions.</p>
               <p>IN the outer court of the temple, called the court of the people, were ſeveral chambers belonging to the prieſts; and here the doctors of the law aſſembled at the feaſt of the paſſover, and at other times, to teach the people; and not only expounded the Moſaical inſtitutions, but debated with one another, concerning the difficulties that occurred. Such youths as applied themſelves to learning, were permitted to converſe with the aſſembly; and received ſuch inſtructions as were neceſſary to enable them to purſue their reſpective ſtudies. At this aſſembly of the doctors, Jeſus preſented himſelf, and not only gave attention to their debates, and propoſed ſuch queſtions, as naturally aroſe from the ſubjects under conſideration; but propounded ſeveral difficult queſtions of his own, which, when the doctors could not clear up, he expounded himſelf to the ſatisfaction and ſurpriſe of all preſent. The learned doctors, with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, heard the young child manifeſt ſuch wiſdom and deep underſtanding, as not only exceeded men, but ſuch men as were deputed the moſt learned and judicious amongſt them. No doubt there was ſomething remarkably majeſtic and amiably divine in his appearance; and as he led the diſcourſe himſelf, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the queſtion which he debated with the doctors, had reference to ſome prophecy concerning the Meſſiah; which he threw ſuch light upon, and explained in ſuch a manner, as raiſed the admiration and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that heard him. It is certainly very ſtrange, that the admiration which the holy child excited in this public aſſembly, by his underſtanding and pertinent anſwers, did not excite ſome further inquiry after him. But, it is to be ſuppoſed, that the coming
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029927_0025_0FE3358E521EFE08"/>
of ſuch mean perſons as Joſeph and Mary, who appeared to be his parents, very much abated the regard which the learned doctors of the law would otherwiſe have had for ſo wonderful a child; but things which appear low in the world, are always deſpiſed by thoſe lazy inquirers after truth, who ſeek the praiſe of man, and are only candidates for popular applauſe.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH and Mary, who had been ſeeking the holy child with the utmoſt apprehenſions and concern, found him in this ſituation with equal ſurpriſe and joy. And there is no doubt but JESUS, when he perceived the approach of his parents, aroſe and went with them immediately; taking this occaſion to withdraw himſelf from the admiring aſſembly. His mother was very much affected with the appearance of her ſon, and the place and company in which ſhe had found him. She gently aſked him, <hi>Why he had left them in this manner?</hi> rather inquiring into the reaſon of his ſtaying behind, than deſigning to blame or chide him: for, no doubt, ſhe perceived that he was under divine direction; yet proceeding to inform him, that her huſband and herſelf had been extremely concerned for him, and had ſought him three days with the utmoſt anxiety and grief. The holy child, with the moſt amiable meekneſs, informed her, that they need not have wearied themſelves with ſeeking him, nor their minds with anxiety and care, for he was under the protection of his Father, on whoſe buſineſs he had been employed. The expreſſions which the heavenly child uſed on this occaſion, were not clearly underſtood by his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering parents; but his mother, on this, as on every other remarkable occurrence in the life and conduct of her ſon, took notice of his words, and treaſured them up in her heart: and the child JESUS, having given this early and remarkable inſtance of his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ready obedience in the work in which he was to be hereafter employed, now proceeded to give an open and manifeſt inſtance of his duty to his parents; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with them to Nazareth, and was ſubject to them as before. Here he remained till he arrived at the age of thirty years, and made wonderful improvements in wiſdom and knowledge, being favoured by God in an extraordinary manner, and highly eſteemed, reverenced, and loved by all that knew him.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing expreſsly recorded in the evangeliſts, relating to our Lord's life and converſation, from twelve years old, to the time when he entered on his public miniſtry, which was at the age of thirty; but from ſeveral paſſages of Scripture, various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be collected. It is plain, from his parents ſeeking him amongſt his relations and acquaintance, when he was left behind at Jeruſalem, that he was of a familiar, friendly diſpoſition; that he had no objection to company and converſation, and that he lived in familiarity and friendſhip with his neighbours and relations: it is alſo evident, that, though the learned doctors, and the people in the temple, were filled with the higheſt admiration at the abilities and knowledge of JESUS, when a child; and, though afterwards, he, no doubt, gave to his mother and ſome few particular friends, plain proofs of his heavenly wiſdom; yet his converſation with the common people was ſuch, as caſt a veil over his divinity; and the general courſe of his conduct and converſe with the common people was ſuch, that no noiſe was made about him, nor any great things expected from him in the Jewiſh nation, nor even in his own city. And it is to be ſuppoſed, that his mean appearance in the world, not a little contributed to prevent his being remarked and eſteemed for thoſe excellent qualities, which muſt certainly be apparent in him; for we find he was afterwards reproached in his own city, for pretending to teach them, when they knew the meanneſs of his extraction, and his illiterate education: <hi>Whence,</hi> they cried, <hi>hath this man this wiſdom, and theſe mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's ſon? Is not his mother named Mary, and his brethren James, and Joſes, and Simon, and Judas? And his ſiſters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all theſe things.</hi>

                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:029927_0026_0FE33590057629B0"/>AND it may further be remarked, that the bleſſed JESUS did not give himſelf any airs of ſuperiority amongſt his brethren and friends; but meekly condeſcended to attend to the meaneſt employment, aſſiſting the neceſſities of his parents with his labour, and not being deſirous of popular applauſe. For as it is to be ſuppoſed, that he weekly attended on the reading the law and the prophets in the ſynagogue, was it not ſurpriſing that he could hear the erroneous expoſitions, which, no doubt were frequently made, and remain ſilent at Nazareth, after he had diſputed with the learned doctors in the temple, and ſilenced the wiſe men of Jeruſalem? Herein appears the moſt profound humility, and the moſt conſummate wiſdom of our Lord, in concealing his ſuperior knowledge and underſtanding, when he might have gained the admiration and applauſe of his townſmen, and have been juſtly revered and eſteemed by all. It is ſuppoſed that Joſeph did not live till CHRIST began his public miniſtry, becauſe he is not mentioned in the Goſpels, after John began to baptize. Some of the antient writers have pretended to inform us what was the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſort of carpentry which Joſeph carried on: they ſay, it was making plows, yokes, and inſtruments of huſbandry for his neighbours. And it is not unlikely, that our Lord lived with his mother, and aſſiſted her in carrying on the trade, after her huſband's death: and hence, it is ſuppoſed, he is called by St. Mark, <hi>The carpenter, the ſon of Mary.</hi>

               <p>WE muſt now paſs over, in the hiſtory of the life of CHRIST, a period of eighteen years; all the account the evangeliſts give of our Lord, during this time, is, that he dwelt at Nazareth, and was ſubject to his parents. But, having paſſed over this time in ſilence, all the evangeliſts agree in giving the hiſtory of his entrance on his public miniſtry, and the preparatory preaching of his great forerunner John the Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>WHEN our Lord was about fourteen years of age, the emperor Auguſtus died, after a reign of about forty years. Great was the grief of the whole empire, at his death, for he was a prince of ſuch a diſpoſition, and reigned with ſuch wiſdom, juſtice, and goodneſs, as gained him the love of his ſubjects. He was ſucceeded by Tiberius, the ſon of his wife Livia, by a former huſband. Tiberius was admitted to a ſhare in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two or three years before the death of Auguſtus, and now ſucceeded without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. He was a prince of a diſpoſition vaſtly different to that of his predeceſſor, and governed the empire in ſuch a manner, as rendered him juſtly hated by his ſubjects. Archelaus, the ſon of Herod the Great, had been depoſed from the government of Judea about three years before the death of Auguſtus, and that country was reduced into the form of a Roman province. Rufus, who was governor of Judea, when the emperor died, was recalled in the ſecond year of Tiberius, and Valerius Gratus was ſent to ſucceed him. He, having continued in Judea about eleven years, was recalled, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Pontius Pilate, a man of a fierce, irreconcilable ſpirit, and of a cruel, covetous diſpoſition, too much like his maſter Tiberius.</p>
               <p>HEROD Antipas, the ſon of Herod the Great, was tetrarch of Galilee; which dignity he had enjoyed twenty-eight years. His brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea; and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029927_0027_0FE335918A9E23C0"/>
of Abilene. The dignity of the high-prieſthood was veſted in Caiphas, the ſon-in-law of Annas, who formerly had held that high office, and now was reverenced by the people as high-prieſt, and probably aſſiſted his ſon-in-law in the execution of the ſacred duties of the prieſthood.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the ſtate of the Jewiſh nation at the time of the opening of the glorious goſpel; for in the firſt year of the government of Pontius Pilate, <hi>the word of God came unto John, the Son of Zacharias, in the wilderneſs.</hi> The ſacred writings have been ſilent, with regard to the manner in which this extraordinary man paſſed the former time of his life; but there is an ancient tradition, that Elizabeth, hearing of the terrible ſlaughter which that execrable tyrant Herod made among the young children at Bethlehem, fled into the wilderneſs, to ſecure her child from his murdering cruelty and rage: and there attended him with all the care and tenderneſs of an affectionate mother. The child was about eighteen months old at the time of her flight, and about forty days after her abode in the deſart, ſhe died. His father Zacharias, next time he officiated in the temple, was ſlain by Herod, becauſe he would not diſcover the place of his ſon's retreat. The helpleſs infant, being thus deprived of all aſſiſtance from his parents, the Lord, who had a great work for him to accompliſh, had mercy on him; and ſent an angel to be his defender and ſupport, till he was able to provide for himſelf. Whether this tradition is true or falſe, cannot be aſcertained; but it is a certain fact, aſſerted by the evangeliſts, <hi>that he abode in the deſert till the day of his ſhewing unto Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME learned men, who have been at great pains in endeavouring to fix the preciſe time when the prophet John began his public miniſtry, have fixed it to the month of October, and at the time of the proclamation of a year of jubilee. They ſay, that his preaching began on the great day of atonement, when the high-prieſt went into the holy of holies. This was a particular day of penitence, and, it is ſaid in the law, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever did not afflict his ſoul, ſhould be cut off from the people. This day is ſuppoſed to anſwer to our nineteenth of October, and was the day whereon, by the ſolemn ſounding of trumpets, the thirtieth jubilee of the Jews was proclaimed, which was the laſt they ever ſaw.</p>
               <p>THIS extraordinary perſon, in his appearance, and his way of life, very much reſembled the antient prophets, particularly Elijah, to whom he had been compared in prophecy. The coarſeneſs of his clothing, and the hardneſs of his fare, were very remarkable: his garment was made of camel's hair, probably the ſack-cloth ſo often mentioned in the ſacred writings, to be worn by penitents and mourners; and his food, the wild productions of the wilderneſs: locuſts and wild honey, were his only proviſions, and his drink, the clear cold water which bubbled from the moſſy ſpring. In this ſituation, he began the work of God, and preached in the wilderneſs of Judea, <hi>Repent! for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> The remarkable auſterity of his life, and the air and appearance of the old prophets, which he aſſumed, commanded reverence from the people; and his whole demeanor, being ſo particularly adapted to the doctrine of repentance which he taught, engaged the attention of the public. Nor is it any wonder, that great notice ſhould be taken of ſo remarkable a perſon, at a time when the whole nation earneſtly expected the appearance of the Meſſiah. And as he preached the neceſſity of repentance, becauſe the kingdom of heaven was at hand, and had a commiſſion from God, to baptize in water, thoſe who confeſſed their ſins, and adhered to his miniſtry, great numbers of all ranks, ſects, and characters, ſurrounded him in the deſert, and, confeſſing their unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs, were baptized by him in the river Jordan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:029927_0028_0FE3359C968A8200"/>JOHN, when he began his miniſtry did not come to Jeruſalem, or the adjacent cities of Judea, but continued about the banks of the noted river Jordan, which, on many accounts, ſeemed proper to favour the deſigns of his preachings; for there had been ſo many wonderful things tranſacted near this ſacred ſtream, that it naturally prepared the minds of the people to expect ſomething extraordinary. Near the banks of this river it was that the prophet Elijah, who was the type of John the Baptiſt, was taken in a fiery chariot up to heaven; and what could be more natural, than to ſee the great perſon, who was the Elias ſpoken of by Malachi, diſcover the ſpirit and power of that great ancient prophet, near the ſtream which formerly was divided by the ſtroke of his mantle.</p>
               <p>A circumſtance which greatly ſurpriſed the Baptiſt, was the great numbers of Phariſees and Sadducees who attended his miniſtry, and came to his baptiſm. The Phariſees, he knew, pretended to the higheſt degree of ſanctity and holineſs of life; and the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees believed there would be no future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurpriſing, that either of theſe parties ſhould ſeek after remiſſion of ſins, for the former pretended to have no ſins that required pardon, and the other nothing to expect after death, as the conſequence of them. Nor can we ſuppoſe that John, when he began his miniſtry, expected to ſee the whole nation ſo much affected with his threatenings as was really the caſe; for he knew that the common people had a great dependance on God's covenant with Abraham, and expected to find favour with the ſupreme Governor and Judge of the univerſe, on that account: to check their daring preſumption, and diſcourage every hope of divine favour, while they lived ungodly and immoral lives, he addreſſed them in this alarming language, <hi>O generation of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits therefore worthy of repentance, and begin not to ſay we have Abraham to our father: for I ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children to Abraham. And now the axe is laid unto the root of the tree: every tree therefore, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi> The Baptiſt thus demoliſhed every hope of divine acceptance ariſing from the covenant God made with Abraham; and proclaimed to the world, that the glories of his kingdom would ſhortly be revealed, and a way of acceptance opened, to which a hearty and ſincere repentance of ſin was a neceſſary preparative. The awful manner in which this great man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced theſe ſolemn truths, alarmed and terrified the nation; and a mixt multitude crouded around him, full of anxiety and trouble, inquiring what they ſhould do. In anſwer to this, he informed them, that an hearty and ſincere repentance of their ſins, ſhould be accompanied with acts of mercy and benevolence. <hi>He that hath two coats,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewiſe.</hi> Amongſt the multitudes which ſurrounded this wonderful man, were numbers of publicans, who were collectors of the Roman taxes. They were, on that account, odious to the Jews, and had rendered themſelves more ſo, by injuſtice and extortion. As theirs was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, they applied to him for particular advice, and his anſwer was, <hi>Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</hi> Similar to their caſe, was that of the ſoldiers; who being men trained up to cruelty, ſlaughter, and all the terrors of war, and whoſe pay was ſo ſcanty, that they were very apt to plunder for ſubſiſtance; they were exceedingly terrified at the awful vengeance denounced by the prophet; and, with the utmoſt ſeriouſneſs and concern, inquired of him what they ſhould do; to which he replied, <hi>Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Baptiſt commenced his preaching ſix months before CHRIST was baptized, and vaſt multitudes reſorted to him from Jeruſalem, from other parts of Judea, and even from Galilee, deeply affected with his diſcourſes, dreading divine vengeance, and confeſſing their various vileneſs, they were baptized by the holy man in the river Jordan. He was now
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029927_0029_0FE3359F17742298"/>
generally known and acknowledged for a prophet, and ſo univerſal was his reputation, that we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, of ſome brethren at Epheſus, and Apollus of Alexandria, who had received the baptiſm of John; which proves, that he was reſorted to from foreign countries; and the dawn of the Sun of righteouſneſs was ſeen beyond the limits of the land of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>THOUGH John received his baptiſm from heaven, we are left in the dark concerning the name or names in which he baptized: the adminiſtration of that ordinance, in the ſacred names of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, ſeems particular to the inſtitution of it by JESUS CHRIST himſelf.</p>
               <p>THIS conſtant and unremitting courſe of preaching, delivered with holy vehemence, and the utmoſt force of expreſſion, accompanied with a manifeſt innocence of life, and a noble zeal in the cauſe of God, which reproved vice and error, however flattered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> however highly exalted, ſo far prevailed on the people, that they would willingly have perſuaded themſelves that John was really the Meſſiah; for it is very probable, that the viſion which Zacharias had ſeen in the temple, the coming of the Eaſtern ſages to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, the prophecy of Simeon, the diſcourſes of Anna, the perplexity of Jeruſalem, and the cruelty of Herod, were freſh in the minds of the people, and by them applied to the Baptiſt. They were ready to acknowledge him the Redeemer of Iſrael; and put the queſtion plainly to him, <hi>Whether he were the Chriſt?</hi> A deputation of prieſts and Levites was ſent from Jeruſalem, to aſk him the queſtion in form; to which he abruptly replied, <hi>I am not the Chriſt.</hi> They then proceeded to enquire whether he were the prophet Elijah; to which he anſwered, <hi>I am not.</hi> They then enquired whether he were one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prophets; to which he replied in the negative. Who then art thou, they enquired, and what anſwer may we give to them that ſent us? <hi>What ſayeſt thou of thyſelf?</hi> To which he replied, <hi>I am the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, make ſtraight the way of the Lord, as ſaid the prophet Eſaias.</hi> The prieſts and Levites then enquired, why baptizeſt thou then, if thou be neither CHRIST, nor Elias, nor one of the ancient prophets? to this the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt anſwered, <hi>I baptize with water, but there ſtandeth one among you, whom ye know not: he it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whoſe ſhoes latchet I am not worthy to unloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>WHILE John remained at Bethabara, beyond Jordan, our great Redeemer thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to leave his retirement at Nazareth, and repairing to his forerunner, who was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the river, he propoſed himſelf a candidate for his baptiſm. He, who was perfectly pure and holy, could not ſtand in need of the baptiſm of repentance, but being willing to honour the inſtitution, he offered himſelf to John, propoſing to be baptized. John, by a prophetic ſpirit, knew the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> acknowledged his ſuperiority, and would have declined the taſk. <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me!</hi> cried the holy man. Jeſus calmly replied, <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Our great Redeemer did not think proper to explain the caſe, and lay down the reaſons why it was neceſſary for him to ſubmit to that inſtitution; but, by this reply, gave the Baptiſt to underſtand, that the divine will required it to be done; it having a tendency to promote the great end for which they both came into the world. The good man's ſcruples being removed, the Son of God deſcended into the ſtream, and received the ſacred rite at the hands of the holy prophet. The exalted Redeemer aſcending from the water, kneeled down on the banks of Jordan and prayed with great fervency to his heavenly Father. As this holy rite was preparatory to his entering on his public miniſtry,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029927_0030_0FE335A0A4E21BB0"/>
no doubt he prayed for the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, in the great work which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. His prayers were heard: a flood of heavenly glory immediately illuminated the whole concave of the ſky, and the Eternal Spirit, arrayed in beamy light, whoſe whiteneſs exceeded the new fallen ſnow, appeared in the ſhape of a dove, hovering over the head of the Saviour of mankind: at the ſame time, a voice, awful as the thunders of heaven, yet ſoft and pleaſing as the moſt delightful muſic, proclaimed to the wondering multitude, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> This manifeſt teſtimony from heaven, of the divinity of JESUS, was received with wonder and joy by the Baptiſt: <hi>For he that ſent him to baptize with water, the ſame had ſaid unto him, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending, and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And, confirmed by this appearance and heavenly voice, beyond all poſſibility of a doubt, he immediately cried out to the aſtoniſhed beholders, <hi>This is he of whom I ſpake. He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me; and of his fullneſs have we all received grace for grace: for the law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JOHN continued baptizing and preaching at Bethabara, near the banks of the river Jordan, at which place JESUS came to him, whom when the prophet ſaw, he cried out, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world;</hi> and on every occaſion and opportunity that offered, the holy man pointed out the Redeemer of Iſrael, and proclaimed him to mankind.</p>
               <p>JOHN, after this, continued preaching and baptizing: his diſcourſes were delivered with ſuch freedom and plainneſs, and at the ſame time with ſuch energy and ſpirit, as gave him a commanding influence over the minds of his hearers. Full of the Spirit of God, he regarded not the frowns of the mighty, nor ſought the praiſes of man. With holy boldneſs, impartial freedom of ſpeech, and the high authority of a teacher ſent from God, he reproved the vices and miſcarriages of all orders of men. He ſpared not the hypocriſy of the Phariſees, the prophaneneſs of the Sadducees, the extortion of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, the rapine of the ſoldiers, nor the lewdneſs and inceſt of Herod himſelf. That prince, who was tetrarch of Galilee, had taken to wiſe a princeſs, whoſe name was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias; ſhe was daughter of Ariſtobulus, one of the ſons of Herod the Great, by his queen Mariamne. Her father was put to death by the old tyrant, when he was in ſo much perplexity and diſtreſs, on account of the troubles and quarrels in his family. This princeſs was afterwards married to Herod Philip, tetrarch of Itur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a, her father's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſhe had now eloped from her huſband, and lived with Herod Antipas. This prince was affected with the powerful plainneſs, and authoritative ſimplicity of the preaching of the Baptiſt, and frequently attended on his miniſtry. The prophet, as he ſpared no vice, nor man who was guilty of it, however eſteemed or exalted, warmly expoſtulated with him on the wickedneſs and lewdneſs of his life, and ſharply reproved him for his inceſtuous marriage. The haughty queen was ſo offended at the boldneſs of the prophet, that ſhe demanded his death. The king would have complied with her requeſt, but was afraid of an inſurrection amongſt the people; for John was highly eſteemed and reverenced by all men: Herod therefore endeavoured to gratify her revenge, by caſting the Baptiſt into priſon. Here the holy man remained ſeveral months, and his public miniſtry ceaſed.</p>
               <p>WHILE he was thus in confinement, he heard of the miracles which JESUS daily wrought, and his public miniſtry and preaching. But our Redeemer not having taken ſuch ſteps as the Jewiſh nation expected from the Meſſiah (for the prevailing notion was, that this great perſon, whenever he appeared, would ſet up a temporal kingdom, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029927_0031_0FE335A2298C0C20"/>
reign over all the earth) the Baptiſt ſeemed not to be thoroughly ſatisfied with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. His chuſing a company of illiterate fiſhermen to be his diſciples, and avoiding all popularity and applauſe, ſeemed not to promiſe the riſing of his kingdom. The good man therefore ſent two of his diſciples to the Son of God, to enquire into the meaning of theſe things, not directly, but rather ſeeming to heſitate whether he were the Meſſiah or not: <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or look we for another?</hi> It happened when theſe diſciples came to our Lord, he was employed in publiſhing his goſpel, healing the ſick, caſting out devils, and reſtoring ſight to the blind. He did not therefore think fit to return a direct anſwer to the queſtion of John, but referred him to the works he performed, and the miracles he wrought: <hi>Go and tell John,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what things you have ſeen and heard; how that the blind ſee, the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed, and the poor have the goſpel preached unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JOHN continued long in priſon, and was mortally hated by the inceſtuous queen: but it was not in the power of the enraged princeſs to procure his death. At length an opportunity offered, and the prophet fell a victim to her vengeance. Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, with whom ſhe lived in adultery and inceſt, made a great feaſt for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating his birth-day, to which he invited his courtiers, the chief officers of his army, and the nobles and great men of the country. At this entertainment a young damſel, named Salome, the daughter of the queen Herodias, by her former huſband Philip, entertained the noble company, and dignified the royal feaſt by her ſkill and graceful dexterity in dancing. This gave ſo much ſatisfaction and pleaſure to the company, eſpecially to the king, that he promiſed, with an oath, to give her whatever ſhe deſired; and aſſured her, that her requeſt ſhould not be denied, were it for half of his kingdom. The young damſel was not willing to make ſo important a demand without the advice of her mother. The enraged princeſs, having now an opportunity to accompliſh her revenge on the prophet, to whom ſhe bore a mortal hatred, commanded her daughter to demand the head of John the Baptiſt. This requeſt the damſel ſoon preſented at the throne. The king, as he little expected ſuch a demand, was very much concerned; yet, as he had given his oath, and was not willing to ſeem little in the eyes of his gueſts, he gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate orders that John ſhould be beheaded in private, in the caſtle where he was confined. The orders were immediately executed, and the bloody head of the prophet was brought into the banqueting room, and given to the damſel. She took the cruel preſent to her mother, who beheld, with much ſatisfaction, the full gratification of her great revenge. Thus fell this great and illuſtrious perſon. His diſciples hearing of his death, came to Herod, and begged the body of their maſter: they buried it in a decent ſepulchre, and knowing that John had always eſteemed JESUS to be the Meſſiah, they came and informed him of this mournful event.</p>

               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, having been baptized in the river Jordan, and having received the teſtimony of God, in the moſt manifeſt and glorious manner, amidſt vaſt numbers of ſpectators, declaring him to be the Son of the moſt High, now prepared to begin his public miniſtry, and enter upon the great work for which he came into the world.</p>

It ran a great way through the wilderneſs of Judea, which was not called a wilderneſs becauſe it was quite uninhabited, but becauſe it was more wild, uncultivated, and leſs inhabited than the reſt of the country. The river Jordan, like the Nile, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed its banks at one ſeaſon of the year: it was much infeſted with lions, and other wild beaſts, who, being driven out of their dens by the riſing of the waters, ſpread themſelves over the country; hence the alluſion in the prophet, he comes <hi>like a lion from the ſwellings of Jordan.</hi>

               <p>THE exalted Saviour of mankind, when he began his public miniſtry, did not ſeek to aggrandize himſelf, or court the honour or applauſe of men. It might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that, preceeded by his forerunner the Baptiſt, and with a blaze of divine glory round his head, he would have went to Jeruſalem, the ſeat of power, and made known himſelf and his pretenſions, to the great men of the kingdom. But the meek and lowly JESUS, ſhunning every thing that was grand and noble, retired to the deſart. The evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Mark informs us, that he was driven of the Spirit into the wilderneſs: it is not to be ſuppoſed, that he was driven by any irreſiſtible power, but by the influence of that Holy Spirit which deſcended on him at his baptiſm, and always reſided in him. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this retirement, no doubt, was, that by ſolitude, contemplation, and ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with his heavenly Father, he might prepare himſelf for the great work which lay before him; and by baffling the temptations of the evil ſpirit, might triumph over the grand enemy of mankind in our ſtead, and point out to us the duty of withſtanding his temptations. <hi>It behoved him in all things to be like to his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prieſt: for in that he hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> That part of the wilderneſs into which the holy JESUS retired, is ſuppoſed to be about four miles from the river Jordan, and twenty from Jeruſalem. It was in every reſpect, a diſmal and uncomfortable ſituation, dry, barren, and waſte, ſurrounded by vaſt craggy mountains, frequented by wild beaſts, ſolitary, dreary, and forlorn.</p>
               <p>IN this dreadful retreat, our great Redeemer remained forty days (the ſame time which Moſes was in the Mount, when he received the law) amidſt the howlings of beaſts of prey, and the conſtant temptations of wicked ſpirits, who, no doubt, uſed all their arts to interrupt his meditations and diſturb his peace. The deſart was barren and dry, it produced nothing to eat; nor was there any water to allay the thirſt. The Son of God faſted forty days, being ſupported by divine power; at the end of which time, he felt the calls of nature, and the painful ſenſations of hunger and thirſt. What our Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the temptations and deluſive arts of the wicked ſpirits, during his forty days abode in the deſart, is not particularly recorded; but it ſeems at the end of that time, he was attacked by the prince of apoſtate angels himſelf. It is not to be ſuppoſed but a ſpirit, ſo ſubtle and vigilant, muſt be fully acquainted with the late manifeſtation of divine glory, which had, at Chriſt's baptiſm, declared him the Son of God; nor could he be ignorant of the circumſtance attending his birth, and the various teſtimonies of his life. But the great adverſary of mankind, though he muſt certainly be convinced that he was an extraordinary perſon, ſeems not to be fully ſatisfied, that he was the Son of God; and to prove this important point, took this opportunity when he was afflicted with hunger and thirſt, to ply him with his temptations. The wily tempter approached the holy JESUS, very likely in human ſhape, and, knowing the extremity of his hunger, expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated with him, why he would endure ſuch hardſhips, when it was in his power, ſo eaſily to find relief. <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> This temptation, ſeeming ſo kind and harmleſs, was the more dangerous: the crafty
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029927_0033_0FE335AF9BCDEF68"/>
fiend deſigning to allure our great Redeemer to ſome ſuperfluous acts of his divine power, to ſupply his preſent neceſſity, which might have been contrary to an entire reſignation and obedience to the will of his heavenly Father: but our Lord repelled this inſinuating temptation, by quoting the words of Moſes, which implied, that God, when he pleaſes, can, by extraordinary means, ſupply the wants of his creatures, and provide food for the ſupport of the human race. <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE crafty fiend, repulſed in his firſt open attempt on the bleſſed JESUS, proceeded to a ſecond trial to enſnare our exalted Saviour; in order to which, it is aſſerted by the evangeliſt, <hi>that he took him to the holy city, and ſet him upon the pinnacle of the temple.</hi> Our great Redeemer muſt be hurried through air to the diſtance of twenty miles: it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he was ſet upon ſome ſpire on the ſouth ſide of the temple; probably on that part which was called Herod's tower, which was built upon the edge of a rock, under which was a valley of prodigious depth. Joſephus writes, that he that was on the top of this tower, and looked down to the valley beneath, his head would immediately ſwim, and grow dizzy! nay, it was farther than his very eyes could reach the bottom. At this giddy height, the crafty tempter ſet the bleſſed JESUS, and thus addreſſed him: <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thyſelf down: for it is written, He ſhall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands ſhall they bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Thus, by a partial and mutilated quotation from the Pſalms, the great adverſary of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind attempted to draw aſide and overcome their only Saviour; the words, <hi>to keep thee in all thy ways,</hi> were not to the artful tempter's purpoſe, and therefore were craftily omitted. The tendency of this temptation ſeems to be the exciting our Lord to preſume too much upon the divine protection, in his preſent ſtate of humility and ſubmiſſion; and as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the word of God, when he was in danger of being famiſhed in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the tempter quoted the ſame word to aſſure him, that God would ſend his angels to preſerve him, though he ſhould leap from that ſtupendous height. And, perhaps, the malicious fiend might ſecretly hope, that, if the Lord could be prevailed upon to make the experiment, he would be daſhed to pieces with the fall, and all the apprehenſions of the infernal powers, on his account, would then have been at an end. But the bleſſed JESUS was not thus to be overcome: he ſtood fixed on the immovable baſis of humility and meekneſs, and replied to the inſinuating tempter, in the words of Moſes, <hi>It is written again,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> By which we are to learn, that it is not lawful to try the goodneſs of God, or the reality of his paternal care in our preſervation, by putting ourſelves into unneceſſary danger, or making wild and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant experiments of his protection.</p>
               <p>THE grand adverſary of mankind, though twice repulſed with ſhame, yet ſcorned to give up the conteſt; but rallying all his powers of deception, ſtood prepared to make one more bold effort. The evangeliſt informs us, that from the pinnacle of the temple, the devil took our Lord <hi>to the top of an exceeding high mountain, and ſhewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</hi> The crafty deceiver here thought to work upon our Saviour's ambition; and, doubtleſs, by the powers of bold inchantment, he filled the wide-ſtretched landſcape with vaſt palaces, cities, temples, towers, fleets, and armies, chariots, warriors, foaming ſteeds, and all the mighty powers of ſovereign great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: which pointing in order to our Redeemer's view, <hi>all theſe things,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> To this boldneſs and blaſphemy, the holy JESUS gave a ſharper rebuke than he had done to the other temptations, and plainly manifeſting his divinity, while he aſſumed a commanding authority, worthy the Son of God, <hi>Get thee hence Satan,</hi> he cried, <hi>for it is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IT was during the retreat of our great Redeemer into the deſert, and his abode there, that the Jewiſh Sanhedrim ſent the deputation of prieſts and Levites to John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, as before related; and he having openly and honeſtly informed them, that he was not the Meſſiah, they returned to Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>THE next day after their departure, the Son of God, having defeated the cunning, and diſappointed the wiles of the great enemy of mankind, returned from the wilderneſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an abode there of forty days, and came to Bethabara, where John was baptizing. The holy Baptiſt, knowing that the great deſign of his coming into the world, was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for, and lead the people to the Meſſiah; no ſooner ſaw the exalted Saviour of mankind, than he pointed him out to the people as the object of their higheſt regard and reverence: <hi>Behold,</hi> he cried, <hi>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſin of the world!</hi> And that it might not be ſuppoſed, that he declared him to be ſuch a dignified perſon, without ſufficient grounds, he proceeded to inform the attentive multitude, that he had received a full aſſurance of this truth at the time when he baptized him, by the appearance of the Holy Spirit, in the ſhape of a dove, viſibly reſting on his head, <hi>John bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending like a dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not; but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt; and I ſaw and bare record, that this is the Son of God.</hi> After this public decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his great forerunner, JESUS departed; but returning the next day to the banks of Jordan, the Baptiſt being there with two of his diſciples, he no ſooner beheld the holy JESUS, than he repeated and confirmed his former declaration, which was made to the multitude, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God.</hi> It is probable theſe diſciples were abſent when JESUS was baptized, and the Spirit deſcended on him, while a voice from heaven declared him the Son of God. This plain and poſitive declaration of their maſter, excited their curioſity, and filled them with a ſtrong deſire to be further informed. To this end, they followed JESUS, no doubt deſiring to be acquainted with this extraordinary perſon. Our great Redeemer, knowing their intentions, turned towards them, and, with that condeſcending kindneſs and complacency ſo natural to him, took them with him to his houſe. We are informed, by the evangeliſt John, that one of theſe diſciples was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029927_0035_0FE335B2A64178E8"/>
the brother of Simon Peter; the name of the other is not mentioned, ſome ſuppoſe it was the evangeliſt himſelf. They, by this invitation, gained an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the Saviour of mankind, and that converſation, joined with the declaration of their maſter, the Baptiſt, fully convinced them of the truth of his miſſion, and they eſteemed and reverenced him as the great Meſſiah, the long-expected Redeemer of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>SOON after this, Andrew found his brother Peter, and with the utmoſt joy and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart, brought him to JESUS. The Lord immediately called him by his name, and informed him, that he ſhould hereafter be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a ſtone, or rock. The day following, Philip, an inhabitant of the town of Bethſaida, was ſo happy as to come in company with the great Redeemer; JESUS commanded him to follow him, which that diſciple immediately obeyed: perhaps he might not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the character of the Son of God; or if he was, the call of the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ſinners was accompanied with ſuch manifeſtations of divine power, that he gladly obeyed.</p>
               <p>SOON after this, Philip came in company with Nathaniel, an inhabitant of the town of Cana in Galilee: Nathaniel is thought by ſome to be the ſame perſon who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called Bartholomew. Philip told him, that they had found the Meſſiah, that great perſon foretold by Moſes and the prophets; and that his name was JESUS <hi>of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, the Son of Joſeph.</hi> Nathaniel well knew that, according to the ancient prophecies, the Meſſiah was to be born at Bethlehem: and that he was to belong to the family of David; and as Nazareth was a very low and vulger place, he could not believe that ſo exalted a perſon ſhould dwell in ſuch a contemptible city, and expreſſed his ſurpriſe, by inquiring, <hi>can any good thing come out of Nazareth!</hi> In anſwer to this, Philip referred him to the perſon he had mentioned, and deſired him to go with him, and ſee whether what he had reported was not evident from the plain marks of ſuperior greatneſs and divinity which appeared in this extraordinary man. Nathaniel, however mean and deſpicable his opinion of Nazareth might be, would not give way to his prejudice ſo much, as to be prevented from embracing ſo happy an opportunity, and therefore accompanied by Philip, went to viſit the Saviour of Iſrael. His ingenuous and candid diſpoſition, would not permit him to reject the pretenſions of JESUS without examination and trial; and, being introduced by his friend, and preſented to the Lord, the ſtranger immediately heard his heavenly lips pronounce this honourable character, applied by our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to Nathaniel; <hi>Behold, an Iſraelite indeed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, with a condeſcending ſmile replied, that, before Philip called him, he ſaw him under the fig-tree. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that Nathaniel had been under the fig-tree, at his private devotions; and doubtleſs, had expreſſed ſuch ſentiments, in the effuſions of his pious heart, as entitled him to the noble character which our Redeemer had given him; and it is plain that he perceived, from CHRIST's anſwer to his inquiry, that he knew what was done, where he was not preſent, and was fully acquainted with the thoughts of the heart; therefore, with the fulleſt conviction of mind, and the utmoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and joy, he cried out, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael.</hi> Our Redeemer, approving his faith, proceeded to inform him, that he ſhould hereafter ſee fuller and clearer proofs of his divinity; <hi>Becauſe I ſaid, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree, believeſt thou? Thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe. I ſay unto you, hereafter ye ſhall ſee heaven open, and the angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of Man.</hi>

                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:029927_0036_0FE335BD2ACAE520"/>OUR Lord having thus given manifeſt proofs of his divinity, and called five diſciples, was the third day after, with his mother and them, invited to a marriage feaſt at Cana, a ſmall town, not far diſtant from Nazareth. His mother, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, was either a relation, or intimate friend of the married pair; and it happened, at the ſupper, that they were ſcarce of wine: ſhe had often, no doubt, been witneſs of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power that attended her ſon, and as ſhe would willingly have every thing ſo conducted, that there might be no reproach fall on her new-married friends, ſhe applied to him, perhaps, expecting that he would work a miracle for their ſupply. JESUS, upon receiving the information from his mother, replied, with a kind of gentle rebuke, <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come:</hi> intimating by this, that the time for his working miracles in Galilee was not yet approached, but his buſineſs lay in other parts of the kingdom. His mother does not ſeem by this reply, to have given up her hopes of his doing ſomething for her friends in this neceſſity; and, therefore, ſhe ordered the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants punctually to perform whatever he commanded: nor was ſhe miſtaken in her ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; for our Lord kindly condeſcended, by his miraculous power, to relieve his friends, and to convince his new diſciples of the divinity of their maſter. He ordered the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to fill ſix water-pots, each containing about twenty gallons, with water; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants obeyed, and filled them up to the brim. The whole, in a moment, was changed into the moſt excellent wine; <hi>Bear,</hi> ſaid our exalted Redeemer, <hi>to the governor of the feaſt</hi>: the governor, ignorant of the miracle, and highly pleaſed with the delicious flavour and richneſs of the wine, which was much ſuperiour to what they had drank before, applied to the bridegroom, and, in the hearing of the company, informed him, that he had acted contrary to the common cuſtom of feaſts. <hi>Every man at the beginning,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>doth ſet forth good wine; and, when men have well drank, then that which is worſe; but thou haſt kept the good wine until now.</hi> The bridegroom, doubtleſs, was much ſurpriſed at this account, and upon inquiry, found that this excellent wine was produced by JESUS, in a miraculous manner. This miracle was the firſt which our bleſſed Saviour performed; by it he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the inſtitution of marriage, convinced his diſciples that he, in reality, was the Son of God, and the Saviour of Iſrael, and ſpread his fame over all the country around.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, that the enemies of our religion, who diligently watch for every opportunity to caſt contempt on the great Author of it, have preſumed to cenſure and ridicule this firſt miracle of our Lord. They repreſent the affair, as though the evangeliſt had reported our Saviour to have miraculouſly produced this wine, after the company had plentifully drank, and hence would inſinuate, that he was a friend to drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs. They might, however, have ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Beſides, our ſelf-conceited and impudent cavillers, might have given themſelves time to conſider, that, though the Jewiſh marriage-feaſts laſted ſeven days, our Lord did not order all this wine, which he miraculouſly produced, to be drank at that ſolemnity: nor is there one circumſtance in the account of this feaſt, which gives the leaſt intimation that any of the company were intoxicated; and it muſt be ſuppoſed that, when they had diſcovered the miracle, they would have ſo much reverence for the divinity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Lord, as would prevent them from making ſuch bad uſe of his wine, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his preſence. Nor can it be inferred, from the quantity of wine which our Lord thus miraculouſly produced, that he would connive at intemperance, and furniſh the means of exceſs: it rather ought to be concluded, that, by this miracle, he intended to make a ſeaſonable and valuable preſent to his friends, which might ſerve for their uſe, when the ſolemnity of the feaſt was over. And, it may further be obſerved, that by converting ſo large a quantity of water into wine, our Lord prevented all objections that

might have been raiſed againſt the miracle being true; for a ſmall quantity of wine might have been eaſily procured to carry on the deception, when ſo large a quantity could not: ſo that, if it be admitted that theſe water-pots were ever ſo large, there can be no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſed againſt the deſign of the miracle; nor can it be charged with giving indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to intemperance, any more than the plenty which the all-bountiful Creator ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the vineyard and the field: ſo that, notwithſtanding the objections and cavils which may ariſe from falſe wiſdom, this firſt miracle of our Lord appears to be, in every reſpect, worthy of God, and beneficial to man.</p>
               <p>THE paſſover, an annual feaſt of the Jews, kept in commemoration of their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Egyptian firſt-born were ſlain by a ſtroke from heaven, being at hand, and our Lord deſigning to be preſent at the feaſt, he departed from Cana, and taking Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum in his way, he went to Jeruſalem. He no ſooner arrived at the chief city of the Jews, but he went to the temple, and probably it being the eve of the feaſt, he found the ſacred apartments full of traders, money-changers, and merchants, who ſold ſuch things as would be wanted at the enſuing feſtival. The holy JESUS was filled with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee the holy place thus prophaned; and immediately applied himſelf to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the abuſe: accordingly, he made a ſmall whip, or ſcourge, and aſſuming the air and fervency of the ancient prophets, he drove this mercenary train out of the temple; awed by his majeſtic all-commanding appearance, they ran before him in a tumult: the oxen and ſheep afrighted, fled, and the owners after them, overthrowing the tables of the money-changers, and pouring out their money upon the ground, none daring to make reſiſtance: the ſellers of doves he alſo urged to depart, commanding them all for the future, to take care how they made the temple of God an houſe of merchandiſe. The Jews perceiving a promiſcuous throng of people and cattle driving out of the temple in the utmoſt aſtoniſhment and terror, and afterwards finding that JESUS had put them all into this hurry and confuſion, by commanding them to depart from the temple, and had drove them before him; they probably ſummoned a council, and demanded of him in form, by what authority he did this; at the ſame time, requiring him to give them a ſign, which ſhould prove that he did it by a divine commiſſion.

But JESUS knowing the ſecret of men's hearts, and not wanting any information concerning them, he was able to form a juſt conception of the nature of this belief; and knew how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it was to ſtand the day of trial, on account of the weakneſs and fickleneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In conſequence of this knowledge, he did not think it proper to run the hazard of the inconſtancy of the multitude, or truſt himſelf too much in their hands: for this reaſon, he avoided converſing too freely with them, or making more full and clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his divinity, and the end of his coming into the world; for he knew how likely it was, that great numbers ſhould deſert his cauſe, when he came to be publicly oppoſed to the great Sanhedrim, by the Scribes and Phariſees, the chief prieſts and elders, and all the great men of the nation.</p>
               <p>BUT the wonder and aſtoniſhment excited by the miracles which JESUS had performed, were not confined to the common people: the wide ſpreading report had reached the ears of Nicodemus, a man of great eminence amongſt the Jews; he was one of the great Sanhedrim, and in great honour and eſteem at Jeruſalem. He had heard the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the miracles which JESUS had wrought, and he believed it, and being a perſon of an ingenious, inquiſitive mind, he wanted to be further informed.</p>
               <p>IT is to be ſuppoſed, that he was not ignorant of the general expectation of the Jewiſh kingdom, reſpecting the appearance of the Meſſiah: and he ardently wiſhed to ſee the accompliſhment of the ancient prophecies, in the appearance of that great perſon. And, as the general opinion was, that the Meſſiah, when he came, would ſet up a temporal kingdom, and exalt the Jewiſh nation over all the kingdoms on the earth, it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the great men amongſt the Jews, as well as the common people, ſtrongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the approach of this happy event.</p>
               <p>NICODEMUS was convinced by the miracles which JESUS performed, ſo wonderful in their nature, ſo ſalutary in their effects, ſo worthy the character of the Son of God, ſo kind and advantageous to man, ſo happily adapted to the confirmation of the doctrines he taught, ſo perfectly agreeable to the attributes of God, and conformable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the ancient prophets concerning the Meſſiah, that theſe mighty works muſt proceed from a divine original, and that no power leſs than Omnipotence could produce them. But very likely ſome conſiderable ſcruples might ariſe in the mind of this ruler in Iſrael, when he conſidered the obſcurity of the birth, and the meanneſs of the appearance of the perſon who performed theſe wonderful works. This, in every reſpect, being ſo contrary to that magnificence and grandeur in which the Jewiſh nation expected the Meſſiah, to appear, might cauſe great ſcruples to ariſe in the mind of Nicodemus, and fill his ſoul with perplexity and doubt: but he being a perſon of judgment and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as probity and honour, would not ſuffer his prejudices to prevent him from fairly and impartially inquiring after truth, in an affair of ſuch importance, and therefore determined to have an interview with JESUS himſelf. He did not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to wait on our Lord in public; for he thought he might be reproached by the rulers and great men amongſt the Jews, and therefore concluded to make this viſit in private; and that it might be the more ſo, he choſe to make it in the night.</p>
               <p>HE accoſted our Redeemer with a confeſſion of his conviction of the truth and reality of the miracles he had performed; and that they could not be produced by inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any infernal aſſiſtance; but the nature of them proved them to be produced by the mighty power of God, and confirmed the doctrines JESUS taught to be divine: <hi>Rabbi,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that thou doſt, except God be with him.</hi> It does not by this ſalutation appear, that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029927_0040_0FE335CC6B914260"/>
Nicodemus was convinced that JESUS was the Meſſiah; that was the point which he wanted to be more fully demonſtrated, and hoped, by this interview, to receive ſome ſatisfaction concerning it. Our Lord did not think proper to ſatisfy the ſcruples of this ruler of Iſrael concerning this, but took the opportunity to inſtruct him in a matter of greater importance, and lead him into an acquaintance with the nature of his religion: in order to this, he began with introducing the firſt great doctrine of the goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting its operations on the mind of man; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> Our Saviour, by theſe remarkable words, may be ſuppoſed to inform the ruler of Iſrael, that though the luſtre of his miracles had forced him to acknowledge, that he had received his commiſſion from on high, yet he could not diſcern, that he really was the Meſſiah, nor underſtand the ſpiritual nature of his kingdom, without the operation of a ſupernatural power, which muſt produce ſuch a change in his ſoul, as might fitly be deſcribed by being born again. Nicodemus, being an utter ſtranger to this doctrine, and thinking our Lord's words had no figurative alluſion, but had reference to a natural birth, was very much ſurpriſed at the aſſertion; for he could not imagine that the ſeed of Abraham ſtood in need of any ſecond birth, to render them the children of God, and the heirs of his kingdom; and therefore haſtily and earneſtly inquired, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old; can he enter a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time into his mother's womb, and be born?</hi> Our Lord then proceeded to inform him, that his words had not a natural, but a ſpiritual meaning, <hi>Except a man be born of water and the Spirit,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> Nicodemus might learn, from theſe words, that his apprehenſions were groſs and wide from the purpoſe; for if it were poſſible for a man to be born a ſecond time of his earthly parent, he would not thereby become ſo holy and pure, as would render him ſit for the kingdom of God; but the birth our Redeemer had reference to, was of a ſpiritual nature, which, by producing that faith which have a lively and powerful influence on the heart and life, might prepare the poſſeſſors of it for the divine acceptance: <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> Whatever is born of woman, partakes of the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſinfulneſs of human nature; but that which is born of the Spirit, is pure and holy, and prevails over thoſe things which render mankind unfit to be partakers of the kingdom of God, by implanting a new and powerful principle of action, and working an entire renovation in the ſoul, which may very fitly be compared to a new birth. Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſtill continuing full of heſitation and ſurpriſe, our Lord proceeded to inform him, that the thing would not appear ſo myſterious, when rightly underſtood, as his prejudices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to think it was, but might, as to the probability of it, be illuſtrated by a familiar ſimile; <hi>Marvel not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again. The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell from whence it cometh or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit:</hi> The meaning of theſe words ſeems to be, that, though the entire renovation of heart, which Chriſt's religion required, might ſeem impoſſible to the blind eyes of carnal men, it might nevertheleſs be true: for in the natural world, there are many things of ſo fine a texture, that we cannot diſcern them with our eyes, but it is very manifeſt that they exiſt, and they are very great and powerful in their effects. The wind is a thing altogether inviſible, no man can behold its body or trace its motion, even when it blows with the greateſt violence; yet that there is ſuch a thing is ſufficiently evident, and the effects of it are univerſally known: thus, therefore, that regeneration, or renovation which is wrought in the heart of man, by the powerful agency of the Spirit of God, though, in itſelf, it be inviſible, and not at all diſcernible by the ſight or ſenſe; yet, in its effects, it is a great and plain thing, and really as great and manifeſt a change in the nature and diſpoſition, the deſires and purſuits of the ſoul, and conducing as much to all the purpoſes of divine and eternal life, as the birth of man does to this mortal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:029927_0041_0FE335CDEEDF4098"/>THOUGH theſe arguments were plain, and not to be evaded or denied, yet, Nicodemus retained his prejudices; this ſyſtem of ſpiritual religion was contrary to his apprehenſions, nor could he ſee how the children of Abraham could ſtand in need of a renovation and change, equal to that which the infant finds, when born, to fit them for the kingdom of God; and therefore, the ruler of Iſrael inquired, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> To which our great Redeemer replied, that it was ſtrange he ſhould be ſo hard to be inſtructed, <hi>Art thou a maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> Art thou a teacher of others, and yet unable to diſcern things which I have ſo plainly revealed? Our Lord then proceeded to inform him that he was certain of the truth of what he had advanced concerning the new birth, and therefore it ought to be received; but if theſe plain and eaſy truths, relating to the ſpiritual nature of the Meſſiah's kingdom, were ſo ſlowly received by men of the firſt eminence and underſtanding in the nation, how would they be able to comprehend the more ſublime and noble doctrines of the goſpel, which he was come to preach to the ſons of men. Our Redeemer further proceeded to inform Nicodemus, that it was the indiſpenſible duty of mankind to attend to his miniſtry, becauſe he came with ſuperior credentials, and higher authority than ever man had before him. Moſes had never aſcended into heaven, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his law from the top of mount Sinai: none of the ancient prophets had deſcended from the bleſſed abodes, to teach mankind; whereas the Son of God came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, fully commiſſioned from above: he had been favoured with the cleareſt and moſt extenſive view of ſpiritual things, and was fully acquainted with the deepeſt receſſes of the divine councils; nay, at this very time, is preſent with God in heaven, and at one comprehenſive view, beholdeſt the extent of the univerſe; he is conſcious to all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intentions of the King of heaven towards the human race, and, of conſequence, muſt be ſuperior in authority and dignity to Moſes, or any other perſon who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the world.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer, before the conference concluded, took occaſion to ſet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ruler to rights, reſpecting the kingdom of the Meſſiah, concerning which he ſo much wanted to be informed. He gave him to underſtand, that the nation in general, were greatly miſtaken in their views of that exalted perſon ſetting up a temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and aſſuming the authority and command of an illuſtrious and powerful conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; on the contrary, this divine teacher explained to Nicodemus, that it was conformable to the language of the ancient prophecy, as well as the councils of heaven, that the Meſſiah, when he appeared in the world, ſhould be poor and deſpiſed; that he ſhould aſſume no titles of honour, but be expoſed to a variety of miſery, poverty, and wretchedneſs; and, of conſequence, his kingdom muſt not be a temporal, but ſpiritual kingdom; and the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which he came to procure for his people, was not from temporal evils, but eternal wrath. This deliverance he proceeded to inform the noble Phariſee, muſt be procured by his ſufferings and death, by which, whoſoever believed on him, would be reinſtated in the divine favour, and made eternally happy: but whoſoever refuſed to receive him as their Saviour, and perſiſted in their obſtinacy and unbelief, would certainly periſh for ever, and juſtly fall into ſo ſevere a condemnation, becauſe their unbelief would not ariſe from want of evidence of the truth of his miſſion, but from their own inveterate prejudices, and the habitual wickedneſs of their hearts and lives. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS excellent and pathetic diſcourſe of our Lord, had an effect on Nicodemus propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the importance of it; he not only believed that JESUS was a teacher ſent from God, but was convinced that he was that great perſon who was to be the Redeemer of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029927_0042_0FE335CF74608DD8"/>
Iſrael. He conſtantly defended him in the council; and when JESUS was put to death, by the impious rage, and unexampled cruelty of the Jews, he, in conjunction with Joſeph of Arimathea, begged the body of our Lord, of the Roman governor, and beſtowed on him the honour of a decent funeral, when all the reſt of his diſciples had forſaken him.</p>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> converſes with the woman of Samaria, and revealeth himſelf unto her: he heals the nobleman's ſon at Cana, while he lay ſick at Capernaum. He repairs to Capernaum, and having called more diſciples, he preaches in Galilee, and delivers his ſermon on the Mount.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE feaſt of the paſſover being ended, JESUS departed from Jeruſalem, and went to ſome of the obſcurer parts of Judea; probably he might retire to the bank of the river Jordan, where he had been baptized, and had received the honour of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation, and the teſtimony of a voice from heaven, that he was the Son of God. The holy JESUS, remained here a conſiderable time, and his diſciples baptized great numbers of people, while his fame was ſpread through ſeveral parts of the country.</p>
               <p>JOHN the Baptiſt was not yet caſt into priſon, but continued preaching and baptizing, probably at Bethabara, the place, of his former reſidence. Some of the Jews, hence took occaſion to diſpute with the diſciples of John, about the propriety of this, and wanted to be informed, whether the baptiſm of JESUS was not ſuperior to that of their maſter. Not being willing themſelves to decide this controverſy, or anſwer ſo important a queſtion, they applied to the Baptiſt himſelf. The prophet took occaſion to remind them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how often he had declared, that the perſon they mentioned, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Meſſiah, whom God had ſent into the world, to accompliſh the deſigns of his grace, in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners; and that himſelf was no more than a meſſenger to prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this illuſtrious perſon. He likewiſe proceeded to inform them, that his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry now was on the decline, and would ſoon be at an end; <hi>He muſt increaſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but I muſt decreaſe.</hi> The holy man continued his teſtimony concerning CHRIST, by giving his inquiring diſciples to underſtand that he was above all; and as much ſuperior to him, as the heavens were above the earth; and though, comparatively ſpeaking, no man received his teſtimony, though he was low and deſpicable in the eyes of mankind, yet he was in the higheſt eſtimation in the heavenly world; that he was the well-beloved of his Father, and the heir of all things, both in heaven and earth; that the fulneſs of the divine Spirit dwelt in him, and it was of the utmoſt importance to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to hear, believe in, and obey him. And then the holy man concluded his miniſtry with theſe remarkable words, <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life; but he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after this, the holy Baptiſt departed from the banks of Jordan, and leaving the wilderneſs of Judea, repaired to Galilee, and often viſited the court of Herod, who ſeemed to attend to his precepts, and take delight in his company and converſation: but, as the Baptiſt was too ſtrictly virtuous to flatter that prince, he took occaſion ſeverely to reprimand him, on account of his cohabiting with the princeſs Herodias. This rouſed the rage of that haughty woman, who, on that account, procured his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and death, in the manner before related.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029927_0043_0FE335D0F93A5C30"/>IN the mean time, the bleſſed JESUS continued in the wilderneſs of Judea; great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes reſorted to him, attended on his divine inſtructions, beheld the miracles he wrought, and were baptized by his diſciples. His popularity daily increaſing, it excited the envy of the Phariſees, on which account, our Lord thought proper to retire into Galilee, and there continue that great work which he had ſo ſucceſsfully begun.</p>
               <p>IN this journey, he paſſed through Samaria, and being fatigued with travelling, and overpowered with the heat of the day, he ſat down to reſt by the ſide of a noted well, near the city of Sychar (which was reported to be given by the patriarch Jacob to his ſon Joſeph) while his diſciples repaired to the city to purchaſe proviſions.</p>
               <p>BEFORE their return, a woman came from the city to draw water at the well, and JESUS being thirſty, aſked her to give him to drink. The woman, knowing him to be a Jew, was very much ſurpriſed at this requeſt; for the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans, which had commenced four hundred years before this time, ſtill continued, and was, on all occaſions carried on by each party: <hi>How is it,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that thou, being a Jew, aſkeſt drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</hi> Little did the woman think, that no leſs a perſon than the Son of God, requeſted this ſmall favour at her hands: had ſhe been acquainted with his high dignity, ſhe would certainly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, have granted his requeſt. But JESUS, perceiving her delay, proceeded to let her know, that he was well able to make her the moſt noble and beneficial return for the favour he aſked. <hi>If thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink: thou wouldeſt have aſked of him, and he would have giving thee living water.</hi> The woman ſurpriſed to hear ſuch a declaration, and no doubt, perceiving ſomething awfully majeſtic, and divinely amiable in the countenance of our Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attending to his firſt requeſt, was touched with a curioſity to know who this ſtranger was, and how he could come at the water he ſpoke of: <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence then haſt thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himſelf, and his children, and his cattle?</hi> JESUS replied to this queſtion, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of this water ſhall thirſt again; but whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him, a well of water ſpringing up unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Thus this divine teacher, from the circumſtances of ſitting by the ſide of a well, and the woman preparing to draw water, deſcribed, in the moſt beautiful allegory, the efficacy and effects of divine grace, and at the ſame time repreſented the plenitude and perpetuity of its happy conſequences, which remain to an eternal duration. But the woman, ſtill underſtanding the words of our Lord in their plain literal ſenſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to give her a draught of the water he ſpoke of, that ſhe might thirſt no more, nor have occaſion to come daily to that well to draw. Our Redeemer then turned the diſcourſe in ſuch a manner, as gave him an opportunity of letting the woman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was acquainted with her former and preſent way of life, and all her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and affairs. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I perceive that thou art a prophet:</hi> and being convinced of his ſuperior knowledge, ſhe deſired his opinion of a queſtion which was a matter of contention between the Jews and Samaritans, whether the temple at Jeruſalem, or mount Gerizim was the place where God would be worſhipped: <hi>Our Fathers,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>worſhipped in this mountain: but ye ſay, that in Jeruſalem is the place were men ought to worſhip.</hi> Our Lord, in anſwer to her inquiry, informed her, that the time would ſoon approach, when the worſhip of God would not be confined, either to that mountain or Jeruſalem; but the great King of the univerſe, would be willing to accept all true ſpiritual worſhippers, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the place where they worſhipped. <hi>God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is a Spirit; and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> The woman replied to this, that ſhe ſuppoſed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029927_0044_0FE30EAB99CBB2E0"/>
this point would be ſettled by the Meſſiah, who was ſhortly expected to come, both by the Jews and the Samaritans. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that the Meſſiah cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> To this JESUS directly replied, <hi>I that ſpeak unto thee am he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JUST at the moment when JESUS had told the woman that he was the Meſſiah, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples returned; and finding their maſter in cloſe converſation with one that was a native of Samaria, and of conſequence an enemy to the Jews, and to the temple worſhip at Jeruſalem, they were very much ſurpriſed: but the woman, having heard JESUS call himſelf the Meſſiah, left her pitcher at the well, and ran to the city, to publiſh the glad-tidings, that the Redeemer was then ſitting at Jacob's well, and had told her all the ſecret tranſactions of her life. This declaration filled the liſtening Samaritans with the higheſt aſtoniſhment, and at the ſame time raiſed their curioſity to ſee this extraordinary perſon, whom Moſes and the prophets had foretold, and of whoſe appearance, there was at that time, ſo univerſal an expectation.</p>
               <p>DURING this interval, the diſciples ſet before their Lord the proviſions which they had been procuring, and requeſted him to eat; but he ſeemed little to regard their intreaties, having turned his thoughts to divine meditations: but being further urged, he replied, <hi>that he had meat to eat which they knew not of;</hi> and gave them to underſtand, that it was meat and drink to him to do the will, and proceed in the work of his heavenly Father: then looking about him, and ſeeing the Samaritans coming in crowds from their city; he ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>Say ye not that there are yet four months, and then cometh the harveſt? Behold, I ſay unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are white already to harveſt; and he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit into life eternal, that both he that ſoweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</hi> By this our Lord inſtructed his wondering diſciples, and let them know that the converſion of theſe Samaritans, who were now in great crowds ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding him, was a greater ſatisfaction to him, than the pleaſure he could receive from the refreſhment he might have experienced in partaking of their proviſions: he let them know, that to gather this ſpiritual harveſt, and finiſh the work of his heavenly Father, was his proper food; and adding, for the encouragement of his diſciples, that as they had laboured with him in this harveſt of ſouls, ſo ſhould they be partakers in the eternal harveſt of joy, which would be the reward of their diligence in the work of God.</p>
               <p>THE words of the woman had taken ſuch an effect on the inhabitants of the city, that many of them believed that JESUS was certainly the Meſſiah; and when they crowded about him with wonder and joy, their firſt requeſt was, that he would condeſcend to go to their city, and take his abode amongſt them. The kind, indulgent Saviour of ſinners was ſo favourable to them, that he complied with their petition, and ſtaid with them two days. This time he ſpent in preaching the kingdom of God, and inſtructing them in the nature of his religion. Such ſucceſs attended his miniſtry, that a great number of the inhabitants of the city believed on him, and declared unto the woman at his departure, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying; for we have heard him ourſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord, having thus favoured the Samaritans with his heavenly inſtructions, he left the city of Sychar, and continued his journey to Galilee: and though he did not expect much honour or eſteem amongſt his countrymen, he would not neglect giving them an opportunity of receiving his heavenly doctrine. He had performed ſeveral miracles at Jeruſalem, during the late feaſt of the paſſover, at which many of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Galilee were preſent: his preaching amongſt them, in conſequence of this,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029927_0045_0FE335DFC0646720"/>
was at firſt attended with great ſucceſs, and he dwelt ſome ſmall time at Cana, where he had turned the water into wine, and both himſelf and his doctrine were kindly received.</p>
               <p>WHILE he abode at that city, a nobleman of Capernaum, having heard of the many miracles he performed, came to him, and addreſſed him with the utmoſt reverence and reſpect; at the ſame time humbly beſeeching him to come to Capernaum, and heal his ſon, who lay at the point of death. Our Lord was ſo compaſſionate, as to comply with the latter part of the requeſt, but thought proper to give the concerned parent to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there was no neceſſity for him to take a journey to Capernaum to effect this cure; for that great Being, who was preſent in all places, could perform his mighty works, without perſonally appearing at the place where the miracle was wrought: JESUS, therefore diſmiſſed the father, with a declaration that his ſon was reſtored to health, but refuſed to accompany him to his city: <hi>Go thy way,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thy ſon liveth.</hi> The noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not doubting the truth of what our Lord had declared, departed to his houſe; but, before his arrival, he was met on the road by his ſervants, who brought the joyful news, that his ſon was perfectly recovered. The father inquired, at what time they perceived the firſt alteration in him; the ſervants replied, <hi>Yeſterday, at the ſeventh hour, the fever left him.</hi> By this, the joyful father perceived, that his ſon recovered immediately as JESUS had ſpoken the words, <hi>thy ſon liveth;</hi> and was fully convinced, that this cure was performed by the mighty power of God. This amazing inſtance of divine power and goodneſs, fully convinced the nobleman, and all his family, not only that JESUS was a true prophet, but that he was the Meſſiah, that great deliverer of his people, ſo long expected in the world.</p>
               <p>SOME ſhort time after this, JESUS departed from Cana, and went to Nazareth, the place where he had been brought up, and where he had dwelt till he entered on his public miniſtry. There, as had been his conſtant cuſtom, he went to the ſynagogue on the Sabbath-day, and attended on the reading of the law and the prophets. After the paſſages appointed for the ſervice of the day were read, JESUS took the book from the hand of the perſon who officiated, and opened it on this celebrated prediction of the Meſſiah, in the prophecy of Iſaiah, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>IT is the opinion of ſome learned and judicious commentators, that our Lord read this paſſage in native Hebrew, which was then a dead language, and as it was known by his townſmen, that he was not learned, it excited their admiration, eſpecially when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it with ſuch clearneſs of judgment, and beauty of expreſſion; and what the more raiſed their aſtoniſhment, he applied it to himſelf: but as he had performed no miracles in their city, they ſeemed to be offended: perhaps they imagined, that the place of his nativity ſhould have claimed his firſt regard, and that his friends and townſmen ſhould have been the objects of his peculiar care; and as it appeared, that with a word, he could heal the ſick or diſeaſed, at a diſtance, it is very likely, they thought that there ſhould not have been one ſick, lame, or blind perſon, at Nazareth. That they really entertained ſuch ſentiments as theſe, is plain from our Saviour's own words, <hi>Ye will ſurely ſay to me, Phyſician, heal thyſelf; whatever we have had done in Capernaum, do alſo here in thy country:</hi> they ſeem to have hinted to our Lord, that it was unkind in him to heal the nobleman's ſon at Capernaum, and take no notice of the ſick and diſeaſed at Nazareth; which being the place of his nativity and reſidence, ſhould have been a larger ſharer in his benevolence and care, than thoſe cities which were unknown to him, and therefore could have no claim on his goodneſs. To this inſinuation, our Lord thought fit to reply,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029927_0046_0FE335E1678CE890"/>
by giving them an account of the conduct of the two great prophets Elijah and Eliſha, who were directed by the God of Iſrael, to exert thoſe miraculous powers, which he had given them, in favour of Heathens, when many of the people of Iſrael ſtood in need of their aſſiſtance. <hi>I tell you of a truth,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>many widows were in Iſrael in the days of Elias, when the heaven was ſhut up three years and ſix months, when great famine was throughout all the land; but unto none of them was Elias ſent, ſave unto Sarepta, a city of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in Iſrael in the time of Elizeus the prophet; and none of them was cleanſed, ſaving Naaman the Syrian.</hi> No ſooner had our Redeemer ſpoken theſe words, than the ſynagogue was in an uproar; the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foamed with rage, and was the more unruly and turbulent, becauſe none of them knew how to reply; but forgetting the ſolemnity of the Sabbath, they ſeized the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world, and took him by force, to the brow of the hill on which their city ſtood, thinking to have thrown him down, and daſhed him to pieces; but no ſooner were they come to the place where they intended to have put their cruel deſigns in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, than they were impreſſed with awe; and each looked on the other, none dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the horrid attempt. Our Redeemer perceiving the conſternation which they were in, departed from amongſt them, and none preſumed to detain him.</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour being thus treated by the blind, outrageous fury of his townſmen, and the cruel uſage he had received, he removed his place of reſidence, and for ſome time abode at Capernaum. This was the capital city of Galilee, and was built on the borders of the lake of Geneſareth.</p>
               <p>IT may not be improper in this place, to give a ſhort account of this lake. It is called, in the Old Teſtament, the ſea of Chinnereth; but, in the Evangeliſts, it has three ſeveral names: it is called the ſea of Galilee, from the province where it was ſituated; the ſea of Tiberias, from a city of that name on its weſtern ſhore; and the lake of Geneſareth, from the name of a conſiderable part of Galilee, extending along its weſtern ſhore. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Joſephus, it was twenty-two miles in length, and five in breadth: the bottom being of gravel, rendered the water both clear and good taſted: it was ſaid to be ſofter than either fountain or river water, and at the ſame time ſo cold, that it would not grow warm, though expoſed to the rays of the ſun in the hotteſt ſeaſon of the year. The river Jordan runs through this lake, and it abounds with plenty of excellent fiſh, and ſome ſorts that are not to be found in any other place.</p>
               <p>THE countries ſurrounding this lake, according to the above mentioned hiſtorian, were fertile and populous, eſpecially the two Galilees, which contained a great number of towns and villages, the leaſt of which included fifteen hundred ſouls. On the eaſt ſide, were the cities of Choraſin, Bethſaida, Gadara, and Hippon; on the weſt, Capernaum, Tiberias, and Tarrichea. From all theſe advantages, it was a common ſaying amongſt the Jews, that God had a peculiar love to the ſea of Galilee: and if we conſider, that, added to the above-named privileges, it was ſo often favoured with the preſence of our great Redeemer, we muſt allow that the obſervation was juſt; for frequent were his excurſions on theſe waters, while he dwelt at Capernaum; and once he honoured them with his preſence, and worked a miracle in their ſtreams, after he had riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>IT was the divine will, that JESUS ſhould ſpend a conſiderable time in preaching, and working miracles, to confirm the truth of his divine miſſion, and inſtruct his diſciples in the doctrine which they were afterwards to preach through all the nations of the world. He did not chuſe to take up his abode at Jeruſalem, becauſe he knew the oppoſition which he would meet with from the Scribes and Phariſees, the chief prieſts and rulers, and the great men of the nation. The ambition and envy of theſe men would never have
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029927_0047_0FE335E2EC861DF8"/>
ſuffered ſo celebrated a teacher as JESUS CHRIST, to have reſided amongſt them. Our Lord therefore choſe to reſide at Capernaum, where he had lately, by reſtoring the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſon, procured himſelf friends, and he was ſure of a kind reception. Nor is it unlikely, that ſo great and benevolent a miracle ſhould be generally known in the city, and not have influenced the minds of the inhabitants in favour of our Redeemer, while it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them for the reception of his heavenly doctrine. This city ſeemed a place highly convenient for the execution of his great and benevolent deſigns; for it being the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the country, and nearly bordering on the lake, it was frequently crowded with merchants and traders; who, on their return to their reſpective countries, might ſpread the report of what they might be eye and ear witneſſes of; and by this means, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and doctrine of the Saviour of the world, might be related in diſtant places. It was in the city of Capernaum, and the adjacent cities and villages bordering on the lake, that our great Redeemer ſpent two out of three years of his public life; moſt commonly going to Jeruſalem at the public feaſts, but ſoon returning. He frequently preached in the ſynagogues on the Sabbath-day, not only in Capernaum, but in the other cities of Galilee; and often the country villages, the fields, the mountains, the plains, and the waters of the lake were bleſſed with his preſence; and his heavenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was learned by the attentive multitudes who followed him, to hear his words and ſee his wondrous works.</p>
               <p>IT was in one of theſe excurſions, that he called Simon, and Andrew. Theſe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were following their occupation of fiſhing on the lake: they had known him before, and immediately followed him. Soon after, he ſaw James, and John, who were buſy in the ſame employment: he called them alſo, and they readily obeyed. Perhaps, they might have been acquainted with our Redeemer on the banks of Jordan; or if not, his call was accompanied with ſuch a manifeſtation of divine power, that all their ſcruples were overcome, and with a joyful readineſs and elevation of mind, they followed the Saviour of the world.</p>
               <p>ACCOMPANIED by theſe diſciples, our bleſſed Redeemer took a tour through ſeveral cities, towns, and villages in Galilee: the time he ſpent in this progreſs, is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly noted by the evangeliſts, but we are told, that he wrought a great number of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that he healed the diſeaſes of thoſe that applied to him, and performed ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works, that his fame drew great multitudes of people after him, not only from Galilee, but the remoter parts of Judea, and even from beyond Jordan: nor was the fame of the wonders he performed, confined to the land of Iſrael, for the inhabitants of Syria brought their ſick into the province of Galilee, to be healed by the Saviour of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS, perceiving himſelf followed by a vaſt multitude of people, who all crowded around him, with the utmoſt earneſtneſs and attention, aſcended a mountain that was near at hand, and placing himſelf on an eminence, while all the people ſtood on the ſides of the hill, he addreſſed the liſtening throng from thence; and with the moſt intelligent ſimplicity and plainneſs, joined with the moſt powerful heart-affecting energy, he inculcated in them the moral precepts of his religion.</p>
               <p>HE began his divine diſcourſe, with the doctrine of happineſs, a ſubject which had claimed the firſt attention of the ſchools of the philoſophers, and the wiſe men of the age; and a ſubject, which, in its own nature, claims the conſideration of every intelligent being, and the more ſo, as the wiſeſt of mankind have differed very much in their defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions what true happineſs is, as well as the means by which it is to be attained. The Jews in general, concluded it to conſiſt in opulence, grandeur, and glory: on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029927_0048_0FE335E470BEF930"/>
they wiſhed to ſee the Meſſiah's kingdom, becauſe they ſuppoſed it would be a temporal dominion, and that a golden ſceptre, inſtead of a <hi>ſceptre of righteouſneſs,</hi> would be the <hi>ſceptre of his kingdom;</hi> and ſo prevailing was the opinion of the temporal reign of the Meſſiah, that the diſciples themſelves retained this notion, till after his reſurrection, and probably were induced to follow him at firſt, by the expectation of high honours and rewards.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS, therefore, thought fit to ſhew his hearers in general, and his diſciples in particular, their miſtakes in ſo important a point, and let them know, that happineſs did not conſiſt in the abundance of things poſſeſſed, nor in the opinion which the world might form concerning them, but in an entire reſignation of mind to the will of God, who is perfectly wiſe and good, who orders and diſpoſes all things with the utmoſt accuracy and exactneſs, ſo as to promote the beſt intereſt of his people; and an acknowledgment of his ſuperior wiſdom, and our own blindneſs and folly, tends to the eaſe and quiet of our minds, when we are oppreſſed and afflicted, and cannot diſcern the wiſe ends of his diſpenſations. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> And though the ſenſe of our own meanneſs and unworthineſs might excite us to mourn, and fill us with ſorrow of heart, the divine teacher informed his hearers, that this was a true ſign of ſucceeding happineſs: <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are they that mourn, for they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi> Our exalted Redeemer further proceeded to inform his attentive hearers, that true happineſs did not conſiſt in the gratification of their inordinate paſſions and inclinations, but in the ſuppreſſing of them, and keeping them within the bounds of reaſon and religion. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled. Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> The divine teacher then proceeded to obſerve, that happineſs did not conſiſt in what the world calls conqueſt and glory; for tyrants and conquerors, who diſturb the peace, and deſtroy the comforts of mankind are moſt deplorably miſerable: but true happineſs falls to the ſhare of thoſe who are lovers of peace, and ſeek to promote kindneſs, benevolence, and all the ſocial affections amongſt men; for they imitate the perfection of heavenly goodneſs, which ſo conſpicuouſly ſhines in their Maker, and will therefore be called his children. <hi>Bleſſed are the peace makers,</hi> ſaid our exalted Redeemer, <hi>for they ſhall be called the children of God.</hi> And if theſe holy and amiable perſons, ſhould not at firſt find that happineſs, which they are entitled to as heirs of heaven; though they ſhould be reviled and perſecuted by the wicked of this world; though they ſhould be deprived of their comforts, and undergo the ſevereſt trials; yet the great Saviour of mankind pronounces them bleſſed. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are they that are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Solid contentment and true happineſs, the heavenly teacher informs us, are not to be expected from the praiſe of men, nor from the noiſe of popular applauſe, but will hereafter be the portion of thoſe who are falſely reviled for their integrity and uprightneſs, and their ſteady attachment to truth; ſuch perſons meaſurably partake of the ſufferings of CHRIST: and it was by theſe perſecutions, and the contempt of the world, that the prophets have been in all ages diſtinguiſhed. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my ſake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the prophets which were before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH were the declarations of the Son of God, with reference to the happineſs of man; after which, the bleſſed JESUS addreſſed himſelf to his diſciples, and pointed out their duty as preachers of the goſpel, deſigned by the ſovereign Ruler of all things, to teach his will, and lead others in the paths of eternal happineſs. But, as the doctrine which he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced was ſo directly contrary to the traditions of the Scribes and Phariſees, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029927_0049_0FE335F133C743A8"/>
thought it neceſſary to inform his diſciples, that he had no intention to deſtroy the moral precepts contained in the law and the prophets, but to fulfil and confirm them. Nothing is more firm, and fixed on a more immovable baſis, than the great precepts of morality: theſe, being copied from the perfections of God, muſt remain fixed and immov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the eternal laws of righteouſneſs cannot be altered; heaven and earth will paſs away, but the moral law of God will always remain the ſame. This our great Redeemer ſtrictly enjoined his diſciples to inforce in the ſtrongeſt manner, both by precept and example; and gave them ſeveral inſtances in which the Scribes and Phariſees had interpreted the moral law in too looſe and careleſs a manner. He then condeſcended to aſſiſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, by teaching them that excellent form of Prayer, which is called by his name, and is in conſtant uſe amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OUR Father which art in Heaven.</hi> The great Creator and Preſerver of men, may be, with the higheſt propriety, called our Father; for it is to his almighty power, that we owe our exiſtence; he is, in a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing manner called the Father of ſpirits, becauſe he alone is the author of all ſpiritual exiſtence. The form of our bodies owes its original, to his boundleſs, unerring wiſdom, and all our active powers are the produce of his all-creating goodneſs. Nor is it only by right of creation, that the eternal God may juſtly claim the title of our Father; but the ſame endearing appellations is due to him on account of our daily preſervation: he watches over us, with the care of a Father, and we are conſtantly made ſharers in the benefits of his paternal tenderneſs and protection. But there is ſtill another and more emphatical ſenſe, wherein God is the Father of his people: it is by the almighty power of his ſpirit, that they are regenerated; and this great work is frequently, in the New Teſtament, ſtyled being born of God: by this it is, that poor, loſt, undone ſinners, are formed anew, ſo that, partaking of his divine nature, they become his children indeed, and are permitted to lift up their eyes to the great King of the univerſe, and call him their Father. In the former ſenſe, God is the Father of the creation, and a parent to all his creatures, good or bad: but in the latter ſenſe, he is a Father only to his own people, who are converted by his almighty power and ſpirit, enabled to believe in his Son, and to live ſuch lives as are conſiſtent with the rulers of his goſpel. Father, is the moſt grand and magnificent title which can be found in the whole compaſs of nature, and it conveys the moſt honourable and lovely idea that can be formed in the human mind: it is particularly happy in marking the eſſential character of the true God, who is the great Father of the univerſe. This noble and tender appellation not only diſplays him as the firſt cauſe of all things, but gives us a beautiful and lovely idea of his tenderneſs and care, which he extends over all his creatures, whom he nouriſhes with an affection, and protects with a watchfulneſs and care, vaſtly ſuperior to an earthly parent. We are permitted and encouraged to call the eternal God our Father, to encourage our hope in his goodneſs, and mercy, in granting us every requeſt that is not improper to be beſtowed: for a father would not deny a petition to a child, if it was in his power to give, and the petition was fit to be granted: and at the ſame time, our being permitted to call God our Father, ſhould raiſe in us an holy emulation, by exciting us to conſider what ſort of children we ought to be, who claim ſo high and honourable a relation. And our being exhorted to call God our Father, in the plural number, ought to put us in mind that we are all brethren, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of one common parent, and that we ſhould love one another in ſincerity, and ſincerely and fervently pray for the good of each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHICH art in Heaven.</hi> By theſe words, we are commanded to expreſs the glory, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and power of the great God: his preſence is not confined to the heavenly worlds; the heaven of heavens cannot contain him; the whole univerſe lies open to his eye: his preſence extends itſelf through the infinitude of ſpace: at one vaſt comprehenſive view,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029927_0050_0FE335F2B9117770"/>
he beholds the whole creation, paſt, preſent, and to come, heaven is his throne, and earth is his foot-ſtool; the night and the day, the darkneſs and the light, are equal to him, he ſees all things both in heaven and in earth; <hi>even hell is naked before him, and deſtruction hath no covering.</hi> But, by God's being in heaven, we are to underſtand, that this is the place where his glories are plaineſt ſeen, and where he is beſt worſhipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HALLOWED be thy name.</hi> By the name of God, the Hebrews underſtood the divine Majeſty himſelf, all his attributes, and his works; and therefore, we are to underſtand by this petition, a deſire in the worſhipper, that the honour, dignity, glory, and majeſty of the Great Creator, may be diſplayed and exalted amongſt men; as much as though we ſhould pray, may thy exiſtence be univerſally believed, thy ſupremacy over all things acknowledged, thy goodneſs believed and confided in, and may all men think well, honourably, and worthily of thee, of all thy works, and all thy ways, and all thy dealings towards them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THY kingdom come.</hi> May thy glorious goſpel, and the ſpiritual kingdom of thy Son, be extended over the whole earth; and may all ignorance, ſuperſtition, idolatry, and iniquity, be driven before the glorious riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THY will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> May the ſons of men be turned from darkneſs to light, and from ſin and Satan to the knowledge of thyſelf, and by the divine aids of thy Spirit, may they be enabled to do thy will, as ſteadily and ſincerely, though not with ſuch perfection, as it is done by the angels of light in the heavenly world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GIVE us this day our daily bread.</hi> Be pleaſed, O thou great parent of the univerſe! who ſupplieſt all thy creatures from the rich fountain of thy fullneſs, to give us, day by day, ſuch a portion of thy creature-comforts, as may enable us to ſerve thee with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and ſatisfaction of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> God being the ſupreme and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous governor of the world, he hath a right to puniſh thoſe who break his juſt and equitable laws. The ſuffering of puniſhment is therefore a debt, which ſinners owe to ſupreme juſtice: and when we are commanded to pray, that God will forgive us our debts, the meaning is, that he will remit that dreadful puniſhment due to our ſins. This enormous debt, the great king of the univerſe, on account of the ſatisfaction which his juſtice has received, in the blood and righteouſneſs of his Son, is ready to forgive to all that believe in him, with ſuch a lively and powerful faith, as produces a ſteady and prevailing obedience to his goſpel. But the infinite mercy of God in forgiving our tranſgreſſions, ought at all times to be remembered by us, in ſuch a manner as to ſoften our minds, and inſpire them with a readineſs to forgive thoſe who have tranſgreſſed againſt us. We give but a poor evidence, that by a ſincere and influential faith, we are become partakers of divine forgiveneſs, if we indulge an unforgiving temper of mind, and purſue with inexorable and implacable reſentment, thoſe who have tranſgreſſed againſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> Deliver us, O thou eternal Father of our ſpirits! thou great maker and ſupporter of the feeble frame of our bodies! from ſuch temptations as thou knoweſt will be too hard for us. Preſerve us, O Lord! from ſuch temptations as are too powerful for human nature, either by removing them from us, or granting ſuch a meaſure of thy grace, and ſuch aſſiſtance from thy holy Spirit, as may enable us to overcome. Make us ſenſible, O our God! how weak and frail we are; may we never preſume on our own ſtrength, but depending on thy grace,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029927_0051_0FE335F442FF74C0"/>
may we, in thy might, be enabled to overcome all our ſpiritual foes, and be preſerved to thy heavenly kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOR thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.</hi> Thou, O God! art the eternal, univerſal monarch, thy kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion extendeth over all: the government of the univerſe is thine, and thou reigneſt the great independent King of the creation: thou, by thine infinite power, firſt didſt eſtabliſh, and now preſerveſt the ſtupendous frame of nature: all power in heaven and earth is in thine hand, thou canſt do what thou pleaſeſt, and none can ſtay thine hand, or ſay unto thee, What doeſt thou? Thou art able, by thine almighty power, to protect and defend all thy faithful ſervants; and thou holdeſt omnipotence in thine hand to cruſh thy daring foes. Thou art all perfect and all glorious; thou art poſſeſſed of every attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and every perfection which juſtly renders thee the object of ſupreme adoration and the delight of the whole rational and intelligent creation. We adore thine almighty, thine irreſiſtible power; we venerate thy boundleſs, thine unſearchable wiſdom; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence thine impartial, thine inflexible juſtice; we rejoice in the glories of thine all-ſupporting goodneſs: and exult in the contemplation of thine immutable mercy. Open our eyes, O Lord! that we may ſee thy glory. May we be enabled at all times to bleſs and praiſe thy holy name, and may we be of the number of thoſe, whoſe delightful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment will be to do thy will, and ſing thy praiſes for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the prayer which the Son of God himſelf delivered to the multitude who ſurrounded him; from which it may be learned, that the great King of the univerſe, who is ſeated on the exalted throne of heaven, ſurrounded by angels and archangels, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adored by all the holy and happy inhabitants of the upper world, is ſo kind and condeſcendingly good, as to hear the cries, and attend to the petitions of ſinful men. What an animating, heart reviving thought it is, that poor, frail, ſinful creatures are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtand before the throne of the eternal God, and call him our Father! The glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering light of the dim-winking taper, which ſleeps in its ſocket, is not more exceeded by the ſplendor and glory of the ſun ſhining in his ſtrength, than the brightneſs of the throne, the extent of the dominions, the power, glory, and majeſty of the great King of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exceeds the moſt exalted prince on earth. Earthly princes are ſo proud, and their miniſters and attendants ſo covetous and haughty, that they are rendered inacceſſible to the greateſt part of their ſubjects; but the great Monarch of the univerſe, the ſupreme Lord of heaven and earth, is eaſy of acceſs; he calls upon ſinners to ſeek his face, and the meaneſt of mankind may at all times have free acceſs to his exalted throne. How blind and ſtupid, how regardleſs of their beſt intereſt, how cruel to themſelves are thoſe men who will not pray! We are poor neceſſitous creatures; we ſtand in need of various bleſſings; God hath all things to give; and God hath ſaid, <hi>aſk and ye ſhall receive:</hi> he hath erected a throne of grace, and is at all times ready to hear and anſwer our prayers; and ſhall we be ſo very deficient as not to pray? Shall we, when in diſtreſs, and preſſed with the moſt urgent neceſſities, ſtand at a gloomy diſtance, and refuſe to aſk? What folly and madneſs is this? It is highly incumbent on all who have neglected this duty, to conſider their ways, to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up our Lord's words in their hearts, and daily, with fervent prayer, approach the throne of that God, who is willing to hear, and able to help, in every time of need. And when we ſeriouſly reflect on this excellent Prayer propoſed by the Son of God, and are admiring the vaſt extent of divine mercy and forgiveneſs, we ought to remember, that in this Prayer, we are reminded of our duty to forgive one another; and we may learn from hence, that a mild, placable, forgiving ſpirit, is not only well-pleaſing to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but has a manifeſt tendency in its own nature, to prepare us, in the habitual temper of our minds, for the forgiveneſs of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:029927_0052_0FE335F5C9809A18"/>THE next point, which our Lord treated on, in his admirable ſermon, was the duty of faſting. In this part of his diſcourſe, he ſeverely blamed the conduct of the Phariſees, who made the greateſt oſtentation of their religion, and were particularly fond of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and faſting. Hence that they might be remarked for ſuperior degrees of ſtrictneſs and ſanctity, and appear to men of the moſt recluſe and mortified diſpoſition, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured their faces, and appeared with ſad and ſorrowful countenances; but our Lord enjoins us not to perform our religious exerciſes, with deſign to be ſeen of men, but, with all uprightneſs and ſincerity of heart, to regard the omnipreſence of our heavenly Father, who <hi>ſeeth in ſecret</hi> and will <hi>reward openly</hi> all his faithful worſhippers. The divine orator then turned his diſcourſe to another ſubject, and inculcated the neceſſity of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs on his attentive and reſpectful audience. So vaſtly important in their nature, and extenſive in their duration, are the concerns of the ſoul above thoſe of the body, that it is the higheſt wiſdom of man, cloſely to attend to heavenly things, and at all times to give them the preference to the frail and fleeting trifles of this preſent world. <hi>Lay not up for yourſelves treaſures upon earth,</hi> ſaid the heavenly Teacher, <hi>where moth and ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal; but lay up for yourſelves treaſures in heaven, where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and ſteal: for where your treaſure it, there will your heart be alſo.</hi> The ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our abode in this preſent ſtate, with the many diſaſters which may happen to us, and take away our worldly poſſeſſions, ſhould excite us not to put our truſt or confidence in any thing which belongs to this world; it is greater wiſdom to contemplate on heavenly things, to conſider their ſuperior excellency, and the extent of their duration, with ſuch a fixed and unremitting attention, as may work in the ſoul an habitual deſire after them, and prepare us, in the prevailing temper of our minds, for the enjoyment of them.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord was the more earneſt in recommending this heavenly-mindedneſs to his hearers, becauſe it was a doctrine which they had not been uſed to hear from their former teachers. The Jewiſh doctors were, in general, ſtrangers to the bleſſedneſs and glory of an happy eternity. The rewards promiſed to the keepers of the law, were chiefly of a temporal nature; and as it was the goſpel of CHRIST, which brought <hi>life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light,</hi> the doctrine of eternal happineſs was the peculiar province of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and that they might not ſuppoſe that the heavenly mindedneſs which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, was conſiſtent with a covetous and anxious deſire after worldly riches, our Lord informs them that theſe things are directly contrary to each other. <hi>No man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>can ſerve two maſters; for either he will love the one and hate the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other: ye cannot ſerve God and mammon!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord proceeded to enforce the heavenly doctrine by aſcertaining the univerſality of the providence of God, and his paternal care over the leaſt and meaneſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the fowls of the air: for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye much better than they?</hi> If the providence of God extends to the meaneſt and moſt inſignificant of his creatures, and his wiſdom hath ſo conducted his wide creation, that there is abundant proviſion made for the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the field, ſhall his creature man, whom he hath placed at the head of his lower creation, and made the object of his peculiar care, be over anxious and careful, or gloomy and diſcontented for fear he ſhould not be able to procure food and raiment? How unworthy is this of his ſuperior reaſon, and how diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to his great Maker, and moſt bountiful Benefactor! Thus the divine Teacher led the moſt ignorant and illiterate of his hearers to entertain great and ſublime ideas of God and his providence; and gave them a more elevated and extenſive view of the nature of his government than had been taught in the ſchools of the philoſophers: for
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029927_0053_0FE336003678FA10"/>
though they believed that there was a God, and that he made and governed the world, they had but very dark and confuſed notions of his particular providence, as it relates to the ſtate of every individual in his creation. This, our great Redeemer gave them to underſtand, was fixed by the univerſal Governor, with more exactneſs and preciſion, than was generally imagined, and leſs in the power of individuals to alter, by their utmoſt anxiety and care. <hi>Which of you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by taking thought, can add one cubit unto his ſtature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE illuſtrious Preacher then proceeds from the animal, to the vegetable part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and infers the abſurdity of anxious and vexatious cares concerning raiment. Can it be ſuppoſed that the great Being, who ſpread freſh verdure over the fields, and adorns them with thoſe flowers which ſhine brighter than the golden embroidery which glitters on the purple robes of kings, will not provide raiment for his own people? Will he thus cloathe the inanimate, and neglect the nobleſt part of his creation? <hi>Conſider,</hi> ſaid the exalted Redeemer, <hi>the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they ſpin; and yet I ſay unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe. Wherefore, if God ſo cloathe the graſs of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more cloathe you, O ye of little faith?</hi> Let theſe conſiderations excite you, he adds, to be eaſy and quiet, patient and reſigned to the allotments of Providence. <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs.</hi> Make it your firſt great concern, to purſue the intereſt of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls, and reſt not till you have obtained a rational and ſcriptural ſatisfaction, that your eternal intereſt is ſafe; and, when this great bleſſing is obtained, be not anxious or vexatiouſly careful concerning the things of time and ſenſe, but reſt aſſured, that <hi>all theſe things,</hi> ſo far as neceſſary to your ſupreme good, <hi>ſhall be added unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE exalted Redeemer, now drawing towards the concluſion of his diſcourſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to forbid all raſh and uncharitable judgment, either with regard to the general characters, or particular actions of men. This is an evil of the moſt atrocious kind; innocence and virtue often ſuffer, and, however ſorry the ſlanderer may be for the wrong done, the injury cannot be repaired. No character is more hurtful to ſociety, and no perſon more hateful to God and man, than the ſlanderer; and our Lord intimates that both God and man will reſent the injury done to his creatures, <hi>Judge not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that ye be not judged.</hi> If you judge charitably, ſaid the kind and compaſſionate, the meek and benevolent Saviour of mankind; if you make allowances for the frailty of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are ready to pity and pardon thoſe who have offended you, both your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and your fellow-mortals will deal with you in the ſame manner. But if you are always ready to hear, and eager to ſpread ſlanderous reports; if you put the harſheſt conſtruction on every action: if you are pleaſed to hear of another's miſconduct, or miſfortunes, and never touched with the feeling of your brother's infirmities; if you take all opportunities to injure him in the opinion of mankind, or purſue him with inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and implacable reſentment; if you are a ſtranger to mercy or forgiveneſs, no mercy or forgiveneſs will you find, either from offended Omnipotence, or injured and inſulted man. <hi>For with what judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN order to prevent mankind from paſſing raſh and cenſorious judgment, our great Redeemer adviſes them to look unto themſelves; and if they would carefully advert to their own errors and failings, they would find leſs time, as well as leſs deſire, to cenſure the reſt of mankind. It frequently happens, that thoſe perſons who are moſt ready to cenſure and condemn their fellow-creatures, and moſt eager to ſearch out, and expoſe the failings of others, are not the moſt blameleſs themſelves: but frequently more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable than the perſons whom they are ſo ready to accuſe. It is therefore with the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029927_0054_0FE33602F6C3E5C0"/>
higheſt reaſon that our great Redeemer exhorted his hearers to look unto themſelves, and carefully mend their own faults, which would be of greater ſervice to them, than endeavouring to expoſe and ſcandalize thoſe who are better than they. <hi>And why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye: or how wilt thou ſay to thy brother; let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH are the ſeveral branches of moral righteouſneſs inculcated by the Son of God; but ſome are ſo perverſe in their diſpoſitions, and ſo obſtinately attached to their evil practices and errors, that it is impoſſible to reclaim them; and therefore our Saviour adviſes his followers not to attempt it: <hi>Give not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that which is holy unto the dogs; neither caſt ye your pearls before ſwine, leſt they tread them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</hi> Laſtly, that it might not be ſuppoſed that the moral precepts of chriſtianity were above the attainment of mankind, our Lord proceeded to inform his hearers, how gracious, and full of compaſſion, their heavenly Father was, and how ready to hear and aſſiſt all who called upon him; and in conſequence adviſed them humbly to intreat his aſſiſtance, and at the ſame time that they exerted their utmoſt endeavours to do his will, and be found in the way of his commandments. <hi>Aſk,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and it ſhall be given; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you: for every one that aſketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> Our Lord appeals to their own feelings towards their children, as an encouragement to be earneſt in their petitions to their heavenly Father: <hi>If ye being evil,</hi> ſays he, <hi>know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father, which is in heaven, give good things to them that aſk him?</hi> But, that they might not depend on the divine aſſiſtance without the diligent exertion of their utmoſt endeavours, our Lord immediately adds, <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtraight gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat; becauſe ſtraight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth to life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE illuſtrious preacher, before he concluded his diſcourſe, proceeded to warn his hearers of falſe prophets and teachers, who would come with fair pretences; but as their lives and converſations were not anſwerable to their profeſſion, nor honourable to the cauſe they eſpouſed, they were to be deſpiſed and diſregarded: <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits,</hi> ſaid the divine teacher; <hi>do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</hi> It is not the pretences to extraordinary piety and goodneſs; it is not the moſt flaming zeal, or the moſt ardent devotion, that will compenſate for a diſregard to the divine commands, or a departure from the unvariable rules of righteouſneſs and goodneſs. <hi>It is not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord,</hi> ſaid the exalted Saviour of mankind, <hi>ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> And then he ſums up the whole, with a beautiful and ſtriking ſimile, intended to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the abſolute neceſſity of ſuch a regard to the words of CHRIST, influenced the mind and determined the conduct in an univerſal and perſiſting obedience: <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, which built his houſe upon a rock; and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and heat upon that houſe, and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth theſe ſayings, of mine, and doeth them not, ſhall be likened unto a fooliſh man, which built his houſe upon the ſand; and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> Thus ended our Lord's excellent and admirable ſermon. The multitudes ſtood around him
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029927_0055_0FE33604827A1050"/>
with the utmoſt attention and ſurpriſe. The plain tokens of divinity which attended his diſcourſe, joined with his all-commanding eloquence, attracted every eye, and affected every heart: but what ſurpriſed them the more was, the difference of his doctrine from what they before had heard; <hi>for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> having finiſhed his ſermon on the mount, repairs to Capernaum, and on his way there is met by a leprous perſon, whom he cleanſes: On his entering the city, he is accoſted by a Roman Centurion, whoſe ſervant was ill of the palſy, whom he heals: He afterwards repairs to the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, where he diſpoſſeſſeth a devil: He cures Peter's wife's mother of a fever, and many other diſeaſed perſons: He travels through Galilee; and directs the diſciples to take a great draught of fiſhes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE exalted Saviour of ſinners, having finiſhed his ſermon, came down from the mountain, attended by a great concourſe of people, who had liſtened to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with the mixt emotions of wonder and joy. They ſurrounded the divine perſon of our Redeemer, with the moſt reſpectful regard, and ſoon an incident aroſe which gave them freſh cauſe of wonder and praiſe. As he was on his way to Capernaum, he was met by a leprous perſon, who, doubtleſs, having heard of his wonderful works, and the condeſcending goodneſs with which he relieved the afflicted and diſeaſed, threw himſelf with the utmoſt humility at his feet, and cried, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſpecies of leproſy common amongſt the Eaſtern nations, and the Jews, was very nauſeous and infectious, as well as extremely hard to be cured. Our Lord was not deterred by this, from approaching an object ſo loathſome; but, full of pity, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended ſo far as to touch him, with this reply, <hi>I will: be thou clean.</hi> The dire infection immediately fled before the touch of the Son of God; who charged the perſon, thus inſtantaneouſly healed, not to publiſh the matter abroad, but go directly and ſhew himſelf to the prieſt, offering, at the ſame time, the oblations which the law in ſuch caſes required.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS then proceeded to Capernaum, but as he entered the city, he was accoſted by a Roman centurion, who with the care and tenderneſs of an indulgent maſter, informed him of the dreadful condition of his ſervant, who was afflicted with a paralytic diſorder, and grievouſly tormented with pain. The compaſſionate Redeemer of mankind, liſtened to his complaint with pitying attention, and replied to his addreſs, that he would come and heal him. The centurion thought this goodneſs too much to be expected by one who was not of the Iſraelitiſh nation, and therefore told our Lord, that he was not worthy ſo illuſtrious a perſon ſhould come under his roof; and he, very probably, having heard of the nobleman's ſon, who, while he lay ſick at Capernaum, was healed by JESUS, when he was ſo far off as Cana, deſired our Lord only to ſpeak the word, and he doubted not but his ſervant would be healed; for he believed, that diſeaſes and devils were as much under the command of our Redeemer, as his ſoldiers were ſubject to the will, and obeyed the word of their commander. Our Lord was well pleaſed with the centurion's faith, and commended it in the higheſt terms; <hi>I have not found,</hi> ſaid be, <hi>ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:029927_0056_0FE3360608F93DC0"/>THE believing ſtranger, having applied the moſt exalted ideas of the divine power and goodneſs to JESUS CHRIST, who appeared to be no more than a man, our Lord took occaſion, from the open confeſſion of his faith, to declare the gracious deſign of his Almighty Father towards the Gentile world, and gave the ſurrounding multitude to underſtand, that the divine goodneſs was not confined to the ſeed of Abraham, nor to the land of Iſrael: <hi>And I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> And having a clear view of the obſtinacy, impenitence, and final unbelief of the Jewiſh nation, he added, <hi>But the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Having thus ſpoken to the liſtening throng, our Lord directed his diſcourſe to the centurion, and ſaid, <hi>Go thy way; and as thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſo be it done unto thee;</hi> and immediately the ſervant was healed.</p>
               <p>ON the next Sabbath day, JESUS went to the Jewiſh ſynagogue at Capernaum, and inſtructed the people with ſuch energy and power, and at the ſame time, with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable plainneſs and ſimplicity, that the congregation heard him with the greateſt pleaſure and ſurpriſe: and to increaſe their admiration, there was a perſon in the aſſembly, that was poſſeſſed by an unclean and wicked ſpirit, who cried out in the moſt dreadful manner: <hi>Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth? Art thou come to deſtroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the Holy one of God.</hi> But the bleſſed JESUS, who wanted no ſuch teſtimony, commanded him to keep ſilence, and immediately come out of the man; this command, the wicked ſpirit durſt not diſobey, and directly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, leaving the diſordered perſon, to the aſtoniſhment of the whole congregation.</p>
               <p>IT is conſtantly alledged, by thoſe who are enemies to our religion, and delight to cavil with the conduct of our Redeemer, and depreciate his mighty deeds, that the perſons, who are ſaid in the goſpels to be poſſeſſed by devils, were only affected by ſome ſtrange and unaccountable diſorders; and becauſe ſepulchres were eſteemed polluted places, the melancholy perſons who frequented them, were ſaid to be poſſeſſed with the devil. And the adverſaries of our religion, are fond of inquiring, why there ſhould be any more demons in Judea, than in any other country.</p>
               <p>TO theſe objections it may, with great certainty be replied, that theſe daemoniacs were not perſons affected only with ſome uncommon and dreadful diſeaſe; for the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts have taken care to be very particular on that head: and being poſſeſſed with the devil, is carefully diſtinguiſhed from any other affliction and complaint: St. Matthew tells us, that, <hi>They brought unto Chriſt, all ſick people, that were taken with divers diſeaſes, and thoſe that were poſſeſſed with devils, and thoſe that were Lunatic; and he healed them,</hi> chap. iv. ver. 24. And again, chap. x. ver. i. <hi>He gave to the apoſtles power againſt evil ſpirits, to caſt them out, and to heal all manner of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes.</hi> And we are informed by St. Mark, chap. i.34. <hi>That they healed many that were ſick of divers diſeaſes, and caſt out devils.</hi> There is in theſe paſſages a plain diſtinction between thoſe who were ſick of various diſeaſes, and thoſe who were poſſeſſed with devils; and this being diſtinctly noticed by the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that there were not plain, evident marks of diſtinction, which made the cure ſo manifeſt, that there was no danger of being deceived.</p>
               <p>AND it may further be obſerved, to thoſe who doubt of the exiſtence of evil ſpirits, that they cannot entertain ſuch doubts without queſtioning the truth of the Holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for the ſacred writers have laid down ſeveral particulars concerning theſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and envious beings; they have taken care to acquaint us with their original and fall, their names and numbers, their government and orders, their malicious deſigns,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029927_0057_0FE3361294E79FA0"/>
and various of their employments; and it is abundantly evident, both from ſacred and prophane hiſtory, that before our Saviour's aſcenſion, there were great numbers of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons poſſeſſed with evil ſpirits. Theſe evil ſpirits had gained ſo great an aſcendancy, and taken poſſeſſion of ſo large a part of the world, that they reviled the great Creator in his worſhip; and in ſeveral Heathen nations, there were oracles which were applied to, in order to reſolve the doubts, and anſwer the inquiries of their worſhippers. And as the deſign of our Lord's incarnation, and his whole miniſtry, was <hi>to deſtroy the works of the devil;</hi> perhaps, the reaſon why theſe apoſtate ſpirits were ſo frequently permitted to appear in Judea at this time, was, that the Son of God might, in a more manifeſt and triumphant manner, diſplay his authority and power over the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all his infernal legions, and thereby convince the wondering world, that he was really the Son of God, and the Saviour of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE fame of this miracle was ſoon ſpread over the neighbouring country. Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer had healed the ſick, and done various wonderful works, which had excited the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the people, and raiſed their expectations of ſomething very great and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Jewiſh nation, to ariſe from ſo extraordinary a perſon. But when the people beheld him, in the public aſſembly, with a commanding authority, diſpoſſeſs the devil, and drive the powers of darkneſs before him; their aſtoniſhment increaſed, and they acknowledged that this was <hi>the mighty power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having performed this miracle in the ſynagogue, he departed to Peter's houſe, whoſe wife's mother law ſick of a fever: he took her by the hand, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the fever left her; and ſo perfectly was ſhe reſtored to her former health, that <hi>ſhe aroſe and miniſtered unto him.</hi> The evangeliſt Luke, in his account of this wonderful cure, ſays that <hi>he rebuked the fever;</hi> which is a figurative way of ſpeaking, conformable to the language of the Scriptures, where not only the inanimate parts of the creation, but diſeaſes, famine, peſtilence, and the like, are perſonated and repreſented as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the almighty, to execute his vengeance on rebellious ſinners: hence, ſays the prephet, <hi>before him went the peſtilence: and burning diſeaſes went forth at his feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord being grown popular, and famed through the city of Capernaum, for the authority and eloquence of his teaching, and the manifold wonders which he wrought, vaſt numbers of people reſorted to him while he abode at Peter's houſe, and brought with him great numbers of ſick perſons, and thoſe who were poſſeſſed with devils. The kind and compaſſionate Saviour of the world, was touched with pity at the ſight of ſo many diſtreſſed and afflicted objects; when he immediately healed them all, and fulfilled, by his extenſive all-relieving goodneſs, the prophecy of Iſaiah, which ſays, <hi>He himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the vaſt crowds of people, who now gathered about him in Capernaum, were not eaſily to be borne, and to avoid the troubleſome preſs, our Redeemer retired to the deſert, whither he was ſoon followed by great multitudes of people, who were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his inſtructions, and had conceived ſo high an opinion of him, from his kind condeſcenſion, and his many wonderful works, that they deſired him never to depart from them. But this requeſt being inconſiſtent with the nature of his miniſtry, and the great deſign of his coming into the world, he departed from the deſert, <hi>and preached in the ſynagogues of Galilee;</hi> and after he had proceeded through various cities of that country, he returned to Capernaum.</p>
               <p>WHEN our great Redeemer was known to be returned to the city, he was ſoon ſurrounded by great multitudes of people; ſo that he was forced to retire into a ſhip, which being
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029927_0058_0FE33614197BD590"/>
a little way from the ſhore, the divine Inſtructor taught them from thence, while the attentive multitude crowded the ſea-ſide, and liſtened with great attention to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly words.</p>
               <p>WHEN he had finiſhed his diſcourſe, he turned to Peter, who was the owner of the veſſel, and adviſed him to launch out further from the ſhore, and let down his fiſhing net into the ſea. Peter informed him of their unſucceſsful toil during the night, but ſaid, at his command, they would let down their net and make one trial more. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, they caſt into the water, and immediately found that their net had encloſed ſo prodigious a number of large fiſh, that it was in danger of breaking. Peter ſurpriſed at ſo ſtrange a turn, and ſuch an unexpected ſucceſs, and knowing it muſt be produced by a ſupernatural power, fell down at JESUS's feet. <hi>Depart from me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for I am a ſinful man, O Lord!</hi> He was convinced, by this miracle, of the divinity of his maſter, and was at that time impreſſed with awe from a ſenſe of his own unworthineſs: but the all-gracious Saviour of mankind bid him baniſh his fears, and informed him, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth himſelf and his companions ſhould be engaged in more noble employments. Our Lord declared that they ſhould catch men, meaning, that they ſhould be made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in turning them from darkneſs to light, and from ſin and Satan to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
               <p>THIS miracle was conſidered, by the diſciples of CHRIST, as a fuller and plainer manifeſtation of his divine power, and a clearer evidence of his being the Son of God, than thoſe they had ſeen him perform in Capernaum and the adjacent country. It was the common opinion amongſt the Jews, that good men, by their prayers, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo far with the almighty Governor of the world, as to heal the ſick and caſt out devils; but they concluded that the creatures inhabiting the elements of the air or water, were ſubject only to the commands of our great Creator: and as he never granted to man an authority over theſe, the miracle which our Saviour had juſt wrought, proved him to be the Son of God, and the great Meſſiah; and accordingly this manifeſtation of divine power, fully convinced the diſciples of the divinity of their maſter, and all they, without heſitation, joined in the reſolution to follow him through the world.</p>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> cleanſeth a ſecond leper: He rebukes the ſtorm and calms the ſea: He caſteth out the Legion of Devils, and ſuffereth them to enter into an Herd of Swine: He cures a Perſon who had long been afflicted with the Palſy: And calls Matthew, who was ſitting at the Receipt of Cuſtom.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE diſciples now having every ſcruple removed, and being fully convinced that their maſter was the Meſſiah, left their employment and followed him, while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual cuſtom, he went through various cities of Galilee, preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God, and confirming his divine doctrines, with the moſt aſtoniſhing miracles.</p>
               <p>IN one of the cities which he viſited on this occaſion, he found a man, ſaid by the evangeliſt, to be <hi>full of leproſy, who, ſeeing Jeſus, fell on his face, and beſought him, ſaying, Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean.</hi> It was the cuſtom of the prieſts in Judea to drive from the converſation of mankind, thoſe perſons who were infected with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious kind of leproſy; and as this perſon was permitted to dwell in the city, it may
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029927_0059_0FE336159D23EE30"/>
be ſuppoſed that his leproſy was not of the worſt kind. His caſe however, excited the compaſſion of our great Redeemer, who immediately cleanſed him, and commanded him to depart to Jeruſalem, and ſhew himſelf to the prieſt, and offer the cuſtomary gifts; but not publiſh abroad the account of his cure, nor make any noiſe about it. But the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which the poor man had received, was ſo great and unexpected, that his heart was ſo full of gratitude and joy, that he could not contain it; and he publiſhed the great things which our Lord had done for him, to all men where ever he came. This brought ſuch crowds of people to the Son of God, that he was obliged to depart from Capernaum into the wilderneſs, where he ſpent ſome time in retirement, meditation, and prayer.</p>
               <p>SOME writers have ſuppoſed that this leper, and the other mentioned in the foregoing chapter, were one and the ſame perſon; but this muſt be a miſtake, the former being cleanſed in the fields, the latter in the city: after cleanſing the firſt, JESUS went to Capernaum and healed the centurion's ſervant; after curing the latter, JESUS retired into the wilderneſs, to ſhun the vaſt multitudes which ſoon gathered round him, from the leper being ſo careful to proclaim to all men the miracles which JESUS had wrought.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it may ſeem ſtrange that the bleſſed JESUS ſhould be ſo careful to conceal his wondrous works, and be looked upon in ſome meaſure, contrary to the end for which they were performed, which muſt certainly be to prove his divine miſſion. But it may be obſerved, that his modeſty and humility would not allow his works to have the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of oſtentation; nor the Jews to have the leaſt pretence of accuſing him of ſeeking his own glory, or aiming at popular applauſe.</p>
               <p>AND it may be ſuppoſed that our great Redeemer did not think it proper, at this time, to irritate the Scribes and Phariſees by the proclamation and publication of his miracles through the kingdom. He very well knew that at the appointed time they would perform whatever had been determined, concerning him, in the councils of heaven. In the mean time, he was to work the works of him that ſent him, and proclaim his goſpel amongſt mankind. This he knew could not be ſo conveniently performed if the fame of his miracles had rouſed the rage of his enemies, and excited their malice and envy to exert their utmoſt power againſt him. He likewiſe was ſenſible of the unruly humour of the multitude; they were convinced that he was the Meſſiah; they had no further views than a temporal reign; and he might be apprehenſive that they would <hi>come by force and make him king,</hi> if the fame of his miracles blazed abroad before he had informed them of the ſpiritual nature of his kingdom. If ſuch were his views, there was the greateſt neceſſity to keep his miracles concealed as much as poſſible. The fame of his cleanſing the laſt leper had brought ſuch numbers of people to Capernaum, that he was forced to retire into a ſolitary retreat in the neighbouring deſart: nor could he even in this retirement long enjoy the repoſe he ſought; for the people ſoon found out the place of his retreat, and flocked to him in great numbers from every part of the country.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord finding his endeavours to conceal himſelf in the wilderneſs would be in vain, he ordered his diſciples to accompany him to the other ſide of the lake. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Scribe, who happened to be amongſt the company, declared that he would follow him whitherſoever he went; JESUS, who well knew that his only deſire was to gain the profits and honour of that temporal kingdom which he ſuppoſed the Meſſiah would eſtabliſh, told him, that if he wanted nothing more than to advance and improve his worldly fortune, he would be greatly deceived; for the bleſſed JESUS informed this teacher of Iſrael, <hi>That the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi>

                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:029927_0060_0FE33617222DDCD8"/>THE Son of Man is a name by which the Meſſiah is called in the prophecy of Daniel, where his wide and extenſive dominion is deſcribed; and therefore when this title is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our Lord, it hath reference to his human nature, and at the ſame time conveys an idea of that glorious kingdom to which his manhood will be exalted. But as it was alſo a name by which the old prophets were called by way of contempt, it is uſed in ſeveral places to expreſs the deep humiliation of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples having provided a ſhip, took their Maſter on board, and croſſed the lake, being followed by ſeveral boats full of people, who were deſirous of hearing his heavenly diſcourſe, and ſeeing the wonderful works which he conſtantly performed. Our Lord, being fatigued with the labour of the day, fell aſleep in the ſhip, while ſhe ſmoothly glided along the level ſeas.</p>
               <p>But ſoon the weather, which till now had been calm and ſerene, changed, black clouds covered the ſkies, and the big ſtorm burſt from the dark concave of heaven, the winds roared aloud, and the white foam appeared on the face of the waves; the ſhip could ſcarce bear the daſhing tides, which beat inceſſantly againſt her; the darkneſs of the night increaſed the horrors of the tempeſt; the waves began to break over the ſhip, and ſhe was in the utmoſt danger of ſinking. All hopes of being ſaved were loſt, and in the agonies of deſpair the diſciples ran to JESUS, crying, <hi>Maſter, Maſter, we periſh!</hi> This pitious exclamation awakened him from his ſleep, and raiſing that hand, ſo often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in acts of benevolence and mercy, he with an awful all-commanding voice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the boiſterous ocean. The elements knew his voice; the roaring winds forſook the ſeas; and the foaming waves ſubſided. All was quiet, all was ſtill, and the ſhip ſmoothly cut the ſmiling deep, ſoon arriving at her deſtined port.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples, before this, had ſeen our Lord perform many miracles, and had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon to rely on his power and goodneſs. They had certainly no cauſe to be ſo much affrighted, or to give way to ſuch deſpair and terror: they might have conſidered, that the ſame divine perſon who had ſo often healed the ſick, and had lately ſhewn ſuch power over the watry element, as to bring the fiſh to their nets, was equally able to ſtay the wild waves, or to have preſerved them alive, had the ſhip ſunk beneath them: but they ſeemed, in the hurry of mind conſequent on the terrors of the ſtorm, to have forgot the power of their maſter, and therefore he gently rebuked them, <hi>Why are ye ſo fearful! How is it that ye have no faith?</hi> They ought to have remembered likewiſe, that the voyage was undertaken at his command, and it was not to be feared, that he would permit them to periſh: but when the terror of the ſtorm was over, they wondered at his power, and though they frequently had occaſion to remark the effects of his heavenly goodneſs, they exclaimed, <hi>What manner of man is this! that even the winds and the ſea obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after the ſtorm was ſtilled, the ſhip arrived in the country of Gadara; and on their landing, two men poſſeſſed with devils, came to meet our Redeemer. They were both exceeding fierce, turbulent, and unruly; but one of them was more furious than the other: this perſon had often been bound with chains and fetters, but all in vain, for his fetters were always broken with the greateſt fury, ſo that no man attempted any longer to reſtrain him; being therefore at full liberty, he ſhunned all human ſociety, and wandered day and night, in deſert and dry places, and amongſt the ſepulchres and tombs, filling the ſilent repoſitories of the dead, with the moſt diſmal and horrid howlings, and ſometimes tearing his fleſh, and cutting himſelf with ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:029927_0061_0FE336208A4B21C0"/>THE diſciples were very much alarmed and terrified at the approach of theſe horrid and furious beings, but JESUS ſoon quieted their apprehenſions of danger, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devils to come out of the men, while they were at ſome diſtance. The heavenly command had no ſooner paſſed from the lips of our great Redeemer, than the men fell on their faces crying, <hi>What have we to do with thee Jeſus, thou Son of the moſt high God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? I adjure thee, by God, that thou torment us not.</hi> The infernal ſpirits were not ignorant of the power of the Son of God, and were afraid, that he would caſt them immediately into the torments prepared for them, and ſuffer them no longer to wander about the earth, which they ſeem to have hoped would be permitted them, till the judgment of the great day.</p>
               <p>JESUS, being willing that the torment of theſe miſerable men ſhould be the more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, aſked one of the daemons his name, who immediately anſwered, <hi>my name is Legion, for we are many:</hi> at the ſame time, he humbly requeſted, that our Lord would not immediately caſt them into the ultimate torments prepared for them in the great deep of bottomleſs perdition, but would permit them to enter into an herd of ſwine, then feeding on a neighbouring mountain.</p>
               <p>The grand deceiver of mankind, no doubt, beheld with gnawing envy, the effects of our Redeemer's power and goodneſs; and to abate the opinion which the inhabitants of Gadara might form of him, and make him odious in their view, ſeems to be the reaſon of his petition to enter into the ſwine; for doubtleſs the Devil knew, that if his legion could gain this permiſſion, it would be in their power to deſtroy them; but though his ſecret deſigns could not be hid from the Saviour of the world, yet ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord was pleaſed to grant to the fiend, the permiſſion he deſired: perhaps this might be complied with, to give the diſciples a full proof that theſe perſons were really poſſeſſed with devils, and to give a terrible inſtance of the power of theſe malicious beings when free from reſtraint.</p>
               <p>THE commiſſion was no ſooner granted, than the devils forſook the men, and, ſwift a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, ſeized their briſtly prey. The whole herd were immediately in a tumult, and the torments the poor creatures ſuffered, were plainly perceived by the ſpectators at a diſtance; the keepers were affrighted, and found it impoſſible to calm or reſtrain the wild fury of the herd; they poured, with amazing rapidity, down the mountain's ſide, and approaching the confines of the lake, leaped from the rocks and precipices into the ſea, and the whole herd <hi>periſhed in the waters.</hi> The perſons, who but a moment before, were roaring, raving, and cutting themſelves, were now become calm and compoſed; they were become mild and gentle, having recovered the uſe of their reaſon, and being now proper members of ſociety, they, doubtleſs, believed in the Son of God.</p>
               <p>THE keepers of the herd, aſtoniſhed at this ſurpriſing event, ran into the city, in the utmoſt terror and amazement, and related the cure of the men who had been poſſeſſed with devils, and the deſtruction of the ſwine. This wonderful report, threw the whole city into the utmoſt conſternation, and the inhabitants in crowds, left their houſes, to be ſpectators of the ſtrange event. They ſaw the men ſitting at the feet of JESUS, and in their right minds; but as they were conſcious of having committed a treſpaſs againſt the law of Moſes, by keeping ſuch numbers of ſwine, which were ſtrictly forbid to be eaten, they were afraid, and ſeemed to expect ſome ſeverer judgment: they might have been convinced of the goodneſs and compaſſion of the great perſon who had performed theſe wonders, by the cure of the men; but they were afraid, and meekly beſought our Lord to depart from their country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:029927_0062_0FE3362262BF3BB0"/>THE ſtupid Gadarines, had they known how great a benefit they might have received by attending on the illuſtrious perſon who had worked ſuch wonders amongſt them, would not have been ſo cruel to themſelves, as to have preſented ſuch a petition. It is true they had loſt their ſwine, but had received two of their countrymen and fellow-creatures; theſe happy men were delivered from the power of the Devil, and their country was freed from ſo intolerable a burden; and the benefit they might have received to their ſouls, by attending on our great Redeemer and hearing his words, would have been of greater value than the <hi>cattle on a thouſand hills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS, however, thought fit to comply with the requeſt of the fooliſh Gardarines, and ſoon returned to the country from whence he came. The perſons who were happily delivered from the power of the Devil, deſired to accompany him, but our Lord ordered them to remain in their own country, as a ſtanding monument of his divine power and goodneſs: <hi>Go home to thy friends,</hi> ſaid our exalted Redeemer to one of them, <hi>and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compaſſion on thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT may be remarked on this miracle, that here we have a fuller diſplay of the tyranny and power of the Devil, than in any other part of Scripture; and therefore it is fit to be recommended to the ſerious attention of thoſe infidels, who, like the Sadducees, will not believe in the exiſtence of ſpirits, and ſcoff at the power of the Devil. Let ſuch perſons behold the picture of theſe unhappy men poſſeſſed by the devils, as drawn by the evangeliſts: they were driven from their abodes, and from the ſociety of men; one of them was ſo fierce that he could not be confined, but broke chains of iron like a burnt thread, and fetters like rotten wood; he frequented the moſt ſolitary places, and filled the deſert with more dreadful howlings, than the wild beaſts; he dwelt amongſt the tombs, and abode in the diſmal and ſolitary manſions of the dead, forlorn and naked, crying out day and night, cutting himſelf with ſtones, and tearing his own fleſh.</p>
               <p>IF ſuch perſons would give themſelves time to conſider this dreadful repreſentation of human miſery, ſurely their ſcoffs would be changed into compaſſion for theſe unhappy creatures, and fearful apprehenſions for themſelves; ſurely they would no longer ſcoff at the power of the Devil, nor the pains of eternal damnation. It would certainly be more worthy the ſuperior wiſdom they boaſt of, to be cautious and diffident; they are men, and ſurely they will allow, that it is poſſible they may be miſtaken: and when their eternal intereſt is at ſtake, one would think they might condeſcend to conſider. But if they will deride, and ſtill perſiſt in their unbelief, a ſhort ſpace of time will convince them of their fatal error; and dreadful experience, force them to confeſs the greatneſs of the tyranny, and the bitterneſs of the malice, of this prince of darkneſs, againſt the ſouls of men. May they ſee the error of their conduct, and be enabled, by the Divine Spirit, ſincerely to repent of their evil thoughts, and perverſe ways, and ſeek the things which belong to their eternal peace.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS, with his diſciples, being landed in Galilee, he ſoon repaired to Capernaum; no ſooner was his arrival known, than great multitudes reſorted to him; the houſe where he was could not contain them, nor even the court before the door. He preached the doctrines and duties of his goſpel to the liſtening throng, amongſt whom where many Phariſees and doctors of the law, whom the fame of his miracles had brought from diſtant countries to behold his perſon, and hear his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:029927_0063_0FE33623E87EAB30"/>HE not only, by his preaching, repreſented the great precepts and principles of his religion, in a plain and ſtriking point of light, but worked ſuch miracles amongſt them, as were ſufficient to convince every judicious, unprejudiced, and impartial inquirer after truth, of his divine miſſion; and he proved himſelf to be the Son of God, by thoſe illuſtrious and benevolent actions, which God only could perform.</p>
               <p>AMONGST many other inſtances of his almighty power and God like benevolence, was that of his reſtoring a perſon to perfect health, who had long been afflicted with the palſy, and was reduced by that deplorable diſorder, to the moſt melancholy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful condition: he was unable to move any member of his body, and was become an helpleſs bundle of miſery and diſtreſs. In this deplorable condition, he was carried in his bed, with deſign to have petitioned our Lord to take pity on his diſtreſs, and exert that healing power, for which he was ſo remarkable in his relief. The multitudes who ſurrounded our Lord, had filled the houſe, and preſſed ſo cloſe, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring the ſick perſon into his preſence. The perſons that carried this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object, perceiving the difficulty which attended their deſign, took the lame man to the top of the houſe, lying in his bed. The houſes in Judea had flat roofs, with battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments round them, according to the command of the law, Deut. xxii.8. on theſe roofs there was a kind of trap-door, by which they came up from the houſe upon the roof, where they ſpent a conſiderable part of the day. It was alſo common to have a flight of ſtairs from the garden to the roof of the houſe, by which the perſons who carried the ſick muſt be ſuppoſed to have aſcended. When they came to the roof, they found the door ſhut: but being reſolved, if poſſible, to compaſs their deſign, they uncovered the roof, and by ropes let down the ſick of the palſy, lying on his bed, into the midſt of the company before JESUS. Our Redeemer ſeeing the faith of the friends of the afflicted perſon, had compaſſion on him, and ſpake aloud, <hi>Son be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE words gave great offence to the Scribes and Phariſees, who ſaid in their hearts, <hi>This man ſpeaketh blaſphemy;</hi> for he takes to himſelf that which belongs only to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. <hi>Who can forgive ſins but God only?</hi> They were ignorant of the high dignity of the perſon who pronounced the words, and they murmured againſt him in their hearts. But JESUS, who knew what paſſed in the inmoſt receſſes of their minds, was willing to let them underſtand that he was endued with the Spirit of God; and to convince them that he knew their thoughts, he ſaid unto them. <hi>Why think ye evil in your hearts? For whether is it eaſier to ſay to the ſick of the palſy, Thy ſins be forgiven thee, or to ſay, Ariſe, take up thy bed and walk?</hi> By theſe words our Lord might have convinced them that he had really a right to forgive ſins; for certainly it muſt be eaſier to forgive ſins, than to remove the puniſhment which is inflicted on men for ſin. As therefore it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent our Lord had power to perform the latter, why ſhould it be queſtioned whether he had a right to pronounce the former; but theſe haughty teachers of Iſrael cheriſhed a gloomy rancour in their hearts, and, frowning, held their peace. Our Lord then turned to the diſeaſed perſon, and ſaid, <hi>Ariſe, take up thy bed, and go unto thine houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NO ſooner had our great Redeemer ſpoken theſe words, than the diſeaſed perſon was perfectly reſtored to his former health and ſtrength; and, to the aſtoniſhment of the ſurrounding multitude, aroſe, took up his bed, and departed to his own houſe, praiſing and glorifying God; while the affected beholders, with the higheſt acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, joined the praiſe, and glorified the God of Iſreal, <hi>who had given ſuch power unto man;</hi> but the Scribes and Phariſees, however confounded they were at the miracle, ſtill perſiſted in their unbelief; an inſtance which ſhould fill us with the moſt ſerious thoughts,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029927_0064_0FE336256EB588E8"/>
as it demonſtrates that a pride of heart, which produces an haughty ſelf-ſufficiency, and generates an obſtinate and determined hatred and oppoſition to the truth, and by ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtupifying all the noble powers of the ſoul, operates like the palſy of the mind, is a much more dreadful and deplorable diſeaſe than the palſy of the body.</p>
               <p>OUR adorable Redeemer having performed this miracle, he departed to the ſea-ſide; and a multitude of people gathering about him, he made uſe of the favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enlighten their dark minds with the rays of heavenly truth. What were the particular points he choſe, the evangeliſts have not informed us; but we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that theſe diſcourſes, like the reſt delivered by this divine perſon, were worthy of God and advantageous to man.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour having finiſhed his diſcourſe, he returned to the city of Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, and going by the keys where the goods which were brought by ſea from various nations were landed, he ſaw Matthew, a rich publican, ſitting in his office to receive the cuſtoms; Matthew is ſometimes in the goſpels called Levi, and was the ſon of Alpheus. CHRIST no ſooner ſaw him than he called him. <hi>Follow me,</hi> was his mild and gracious language; which the heavenly teacher had no ſooner ſpoken, than the wealthy publican felt a divine power warm his heart, which overpowering every worldly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he ſeems to have left his acounts all unfiniſhed, and immediately obeyed. He ſoon, by our great Redeemer, was led into a more honourable and important employment, and afterwards became an evangeliſt, as well as an apoſtle.</p>
               <p>A few days after this, the new called publican made a great entertainment, to which he, with CHRIST and his diſciples, invited ſeveral of his own profeſſion; no doubt hoping that his heavenly converſation might ſtrike their hard hearts with remorſe for their wickedneſs and extortion, and lead them in paths worthy of partaking the benefits ariſing from the glorious Redeemer of mankind. In the courſe of the entertainment CHRIST reminded them that in the goſpel diſpenſation, God <hi>will have mercy, and not ſacrifice;</hi> and as thoſe who confeſſed themſelves ſinners were the only proper objects of that mercy, our Lord declared that he was <hi>not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> and to blame him for converſing with publicans and ſinners was as great a piece of abſurdity as to blame a phyſician for viſiting the ſick. This declaration from the great friend and Redeemer of loſt ſinners, diſſatisfied greatly the haughty ſelf conceited Scribes and Phariſees: and as they made great oſtentation of their faſting and abſtinence, they took this opportunity to give themſelves conſequence on that account; and joining with John's diſciples, preſumed to blame our great Redeemer becauſe his diſciples were not ſo frequent in this practice as themſelves. To this our Lord replied, that the preſent was not a time for faſting, for his diſciples need not faſt and mourn in the preſence of their maſter, any more than the friends of the bridegroom need faſt and afflict themſelves while they enjoyed his company. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the day will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they ſhall faſt.</hi> Intimating by this, that the calamities, troubles, and afflictions which they would ſuffer after the death of their maſter, would oblige them to faſt and mourn; but the corrupt nature of man, which was the cauſe of his coming into the world, required different treatment; the rent would not be patched up with mortification, faſting or any external performances; ſuch treatment as this would be like ſewing a piece of new cloth on an old rotten garment, which would only make the rent worſe; or putting new wine into old leather bottles, which would burſt as ſoon as the liquor fermented.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHILE the bleſſed JESUS was diſputing with the Scribes and Phariſees in the houſe of Matthew, whom he had lately called into the number of his diſciples, an afflicted father, in all the agonies of diſtreſs, haſtily preſſed into his preſence. This was Jarius, the ruler of the Jewiſh ſynagogue in Capernaum, and the cauſe his preſent affliction was the dangerous illneſs of his daughter, who lay at the point of death.</p>
               <p>HAVING earneſtly implored the aſſiſtance of our great Redeemer in this diſtreſſing caſe, the Lord of life graciouſly condeſcended to comply with his requeſt, and accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the diſtreſſed father to his houſe; and great multitudes of people, who were deſirous of beholding the miracles of Chriſt, crowded around and preſſed to behold what the divine Inſtructor would do on this great occaſion.</p>
               <p>But as they paſſed through the ſtreets of the city, the attention of the ſurrounding multitudes were turned to a woman, who came behind the Son of God, and touched the hem of his garment. This woman had been afflicted twelve years with a terrible diſorder, which had baffled the force of medicine. She had ſpent her whole ſubſtance on phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, but could obtain no relief; but hearing of the miracles performed by the bleſſed JESUS, ſhe was ſo fully convinced of his divine power, that ſhe concluded if ſhe could but touch his clothes ſhe ſhould be made whole. Nor was ſhe deceived, for ſhe no ſooner touched the border of the garment of our great Redeemer, than the iſſue of blood dried up; and ſhe felt ſuch a flow of vital ſpirits, and uncommon gladneſs warm her heart, that ſhe was fully convinced that ſhe had received a cure.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS, who knew the heart of all men, was not ignorant of the minuteſt circumſtances attending this affair; he knew the woman's thoughts, and was pleaſed with her faith: and with deſign to begin a converſation in which he might teſtify his approbation, he turned about and aſked who touched him? His diſciples, as they were not appriſed of the tranſaction, wondered at their Maſter's queſtion. <hi>Thou ſeeſt,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>the multitude thronging and preſſing thee, and ſayeſt thou, who touched me?</hi> JESUS, however, perſiſted in the inquiry, and the woman, perceiving ſhe could not be concealed, came to him trembling, and told him what ſhe had done. She approached him with hiſitation and diffidence, fearing he would be offended at the liberty ſhe had taken; but the divine Phyſician received her with condeſcending goodneſs, ſpake to her in the kindeſt manner, and commended her faith; <hi>Daughter,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the midſt of the ſurpriſe occaſioned by this miracle, a meſſenger approached from Jarius's houſe, and informed him that his daughter was dead, ſo that he need not give our Lord the trouble to come any further; for they ſuppoſed it far beyond the power of this extraordinary perſon to overcome the mighty conqueror Death, or recall the fleeting ſpirit from the eternal world. This meſſage was received by the affectionate parent with the ſtrongeſt emotions of ſorrow, and bittereſt agonies of diſtreſs. Our Lord took compaſſion on him, and deſired him to be comforted with hopes, that his daughter ſhould be reſtored.</p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:029927_0066_0FE3362EF3DA8558"/>WHEN our great Redeemer came to the ruler's houſe, he found it full of mourners, who made great lamentation, and were preparing for the funeral. Our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ceaſe their preparations; <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the maid is not dead, but ſleepeth: and they laughed him to ſcorn.</hi> Theſe words of CHRIST were uſed with peculiar propriety, to denote that it was determined the virgin ſhould not continue in the cold embraces of death, but ſhould inſtantly be reſtored to her friends as one awakened out of ſleep; and having thus ſpoken, our Lord approached the apartment of the dead, taking with him none but Peter, James, and John, except the father and mother of the maiden: then laying hold of the cold hand of the dead virgin, he ſaid with a gentle voice, <hi>Maid, ariſe!</hi> The heavenly voice was immediately obeyed, and the damſel aroſe, freſh as from a ſound ſleep, all healthful and vigorous; and JESUS commanded to give her ſomething to eat.</p>
               <p>THUS the great Son of God gave a full and clear manifeſtation of his heavenly power: and not only proved that he was the true Meſſiah, but gave a clear demonſtration of the poſſibility of the reſurrection of the dead: and thoſe who have imbibed the abſurd opinion of the ſoul's ſleeping with the body till the reſurrection, would do well to conſider the expreſſion of the evangeliſt, <hi>Her ſpirit came again,</hi> Luke viii.55: by which it appears that the ſoul exiſts in a ſtate of ſeparation, when the body lies all cold and breathleſs in the dark chambers of the grave.</p>
               <p>HAVING performed this great and benevolent miracle, our bleſſed Saviour left the ruler's houſe; and going through the ſtreets of the city, he was followed by two blind men; they had, doubtleſs, heard of the great miracle which he had juſt performed, and ſupplicated his aſſiſtance in their preſent deplorable circumſtances, well knowing that he was able to reſtore them to ſight. The benevolent Saviour of ſinners condeſcended to favour their requeſt; and having entered an houſe to eſcape the crowding of the multitude, he touched their eyes, and ſaid, <hi>According to your faith be it unto you;</hi> when immediately the great and deſirable bleſſing of ſight was reſtored unto them; the ſacred beams of all-chearing day reviſited their eyes, and filled their hearts with gladneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their tongues with praiſe; and ſuch a flood of gratitude and joy overflowed their hearts, that they could not conceal their miraculous reſtoration to ſight, though our Lord required them to keep ſilence, but publiſhed our Redeemer's fame and their own happy condition, through every part of the country.</p>
               <p>THE men who had thus miraculouſly received their ſight being departed, the multitude brought to the benevolent Saviour of Sinners a dumb man, poſſeſſed with a devil. So affecting a caſe attracted the compaſſionate regard of the bleſſed JESUS, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The dumb man inſtantly recovered the uſe of ſpeech, and ſpake in ſo ſenſible and ſatisfactory a manner, that the whole multitude were amazed, and, declared that ſuch wonderous works were never wrought by the greateſt and moſt eminent of the ancient prophets, <hi>It was,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>never ſo ſeen in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Phariſees whoſe hearts were full of infernal rancour, and whoſe pride and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice prevented their receiving inſtruction from the diſcourſes, or conviction from the miracles of our great Redeemer, beheld the miracle now performed with a ſcornful ſneer, and put the moſt invidious conſtruction upon it, that could poſſibly enter into the heart of man: <hi>He caſteth out Devils,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>through the prince of the Devils.</hi> The bleſſed JESUS, ſeems, at this time, to have taken no notice of this calumny: but leaving the haughty, ſelf-conceited doctors, under the dominion of their blindneſs, and prejudice, he proceeded in the proſecution of the duties of his miſſion, and exerted himſelf more and more in the great work of promoting the cauſe of truth, and enlightening and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing mankind. Accordingly leaving Capernaum, he took a tour through the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent

country, bringing happineſs and peace to the ſons of miſery and diſtreſs, <hi>viſiting all the cities and villages, teaching in their ſynagogues, and preaching the goſpel of the kingdom, and healing every ſickneſs, and every diſeaſe amongst the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT his return to Galilee, he was ſurrounded by vaſt multitudes of people, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed an earneſt deſire to hear his inſtructions, and learn the way of truth and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from his lips. This tractable diſpoſition of mind engaged the attention of the great Redeemer of ſinners, and filled his heart with compaſſion for them, in their preſent deplorable ſtate of blindneſs and ignorance, and excited him to exert his divine power for their relief. Indeed the ſtate of the Jewiſh nation at this time was worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; for, with reſpect to ſpiritual things, the common people might juſtly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſheep without a ſhepherd. The Scribes, Phariſees, and lawyers, who ought to have inſtructed them, were blind, lazy guides, and their teaching tended rather to lead them aſide from the paths of truth and righteouſneſs, than to afford them any real advantage: their teaching tended rather to magnify and exalt themſelves than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the knowledge or worſhip of their maker; and to encourage a ſcrupulous exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in external ceremonial performances, rather than promote the cauſe of truth, purity, and virtue. In this dark and forlorn condition, our Lord had compaſſion on the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and, in his divine wiſdom and benevolence, proceeded to take proper meaſures for their relief. He always regarded the ſeed of Iſrael with peculiar affection; and as they were wandering on the dark mountains of error and ſuperſtition, without any to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train their wanderings, or teach their ſteps to find the way of peace, he recommended their caſe to his diſciples, and commanded them to approach the throne of God, with earneſt prayers in their behalf: <hi>The harveſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harveſt, that he will ſend forth labourers into his harveſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR did our great Redeemer recommend this affecting caſe to his diſciples, without employing his own moſt powerful interceſſion with his heavenly Father: for he aſcended a mountain, and continued all night in prayer to God. Having ſpent the night in earneſt ſupplication, the morning no ſooner returned, than he ſet about the important taſk of divine inſtruction. To this end, he choſe twelve out of the number of his diſciples, and named them apoſtles, <hi>to be always with him, and that he might ſend them forth to preach.</hi> Theſe were Simon Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James the ſon of Zebedee, and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew; James the ſon of Alpheus, and Lebbus, whoſe ſurname was Thaddeus Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iſcariot. Theſe twelve having been conſtant attendants on our Lord, having learnt his heavenly doctrine, and ſeen his wonderous works, and being fully qualified to preach to the world, thoſe divine truths, which themſelves had received, were ſent out to preach the goſpel of the kingdom; but commanded not to enter into any city of the Samaritans, or of the Gentiles, but confine themſelves to the land of Iſrael, and to proclaim through the nation, that <hi>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> They were alſo provided with miraculous power to prove the truth of their doctrine, and manifeſt to the world, that they came from God, and were commanded to exert thoſe divine powers with unremitting ardour, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of mankind. The command of their divine Maſter, was to <hi>heal the ſick; cleanſe the lepers; raiſe the dead; caſt out devils; freely,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye have received, freely give.</hi> And that they might be ſenſible of the care of their heavenly Father, over the moſt minute circumſtances which concerned them, they were enjoined to make no proviſion for their journey, nor take any care about temporal things: <hi>Provide,</hi> ſaid their divine Maſter, <hi>neither gold nor braſs in your purſes, nor ſcrip for your journey, neither two coats, nor ſhoes, neither yet ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:029927_0068_0FE336320460F8C0"/>PROBABLY the apoſtles, knowing that the whole Jewiſh nation was elated with the apprehenſion of the appearance of the Meſſiah, and the high expectations they had formed of his ſitting up a temporal kingdom, might expect to be received with honour and eſteem by their countrymen, as they were going to publiſh the ſpeedy approach of that kingdom which they ſo ardently deſired, and to work ſuch miracles, as might convince them that their declaration was true: but their Maſter informed them, that the event, in this caſe, would not be anſwerable to their expectation; for, inſtead of being careſſed and honoured by their countrymen, he aſſured them, they ſhould meet with deriſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: he informed them that they ſhould be deſpiſed and perſecuted, delivered to the rulers, and puniſhed as wicked man. But, at the ſame time, he promiſed them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant protection and aſſiſtance of his heavenly Father, and gave them minute and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtructions for their behaviour on every occaſion; and let them know, that whoever rejected them and their meſſage, ſhould be rejected and treated with indignation and ſcorn, by the great Judge of the world: but thoſe who received them with kindneſs, attended to their preaching and received it with honeſty and openneſs of mind, kindly contributing to their ſupport, though they gave but a cup of cold water to the leaſt of his diſciples, ſhould not fail of receiving a large reward.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtles having received this commiſſion, viſited all parts of the country, preaching the doctrine of repentence and proclaiming the kingdom of the Meſſiah at hand. They confirmed the truth of their declarations, by working of miracles, healing the ſick, and performing every great work which was worthy their maſter's cauſe, and neceſſary to prepare the minds of mankind to receive him; while our great Redeemer continued the courſe of his miniſtry in Galilee, and by the divine eloquence of his preaching, and the wonders he wrought proved himſelf to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>IN the eye of worldly wiſdom, it muſt ſeem a very fooliſh and unpopular attempt to ſend a parcel of illiterate, deſpiſed Galileans to reform the world: how was it poſſible, that ſuch perſons as theſe, ſhould confound the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bafflle the power of the mighty? How was it poſſible, that they ſhould overturn the many falſe religions which then flouriſhed in the world, which were ſupported by civil government, and had eſtabliſhed themſelves by long continuance, were deep-rooted in the human heart, and maintained by the paſſions, prejudices, and intereſt of mankind. Had human prudence directed to the choice of perſons to be employed on this great occaſion, they doubtleſs would have been men of great learning, ſuperior eloquence, and poſſeſſed of every art of perſuaſion and addreſs. But the wiſdom of God ſtoops not to be directed by the wiſdom of man; his ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts. When his glorious goſpel was ſent to enlighten and enrich the world, this divine treaſure was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power might appear to be of God: accordingly, it appeared that the religion which theſe illiterate fiſhermen, theſe deſpiſed Galieans publiſhed through the world, was far ſuperior, was more worthy of God, and beneficial to man, than the acuteſt reaſonings, or the ſublimeſt ſtrains of the Greek and Roman philoſopers and poets, though they were furniſhed with all the ſtores of human literature, and ſpent their whole time in ſtudy and contemplation. Hence, it is manifeſt, that the glorious goſpel of God, by its noble ſimplicity, by its own intrinſic dignity and worth, as well as by the miraculous power which attended it, and the heavenly glory which ſhone around it, proved itſelf to be wholly original and divine.</p>
               <p>NOR was the ſucceſs which attended the attempts of theſe weak and deſpiſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wanting to prove the divine original of the doctrine they taught; while the tenets
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029927_0069_0FE3363AA86270A0"/>
of the philoſophers were confined to their reſpective ſchools, the glorious goſpel ſpreads over the world, and was received in every country, and by men of every ſtation; it was received by the bulk of mankind, with the higheſt ſatisfaction, and the ſublimeſt joy; as ſomething neceſſary to their ſupreme good, which hitherto they had been ſeeking in vain. It was, therefore, the higheſt wiſdom which conducted the propagation of the goſpel, and made uſe of ſuch low and contemptible perſons; for hence, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that theſe noble truths were not of human invention, but were the production of Infinite Wiſdom, and were firſt advanced, and are ſtill ſupported, by the mighty power of God.</p>
               <p>AFTER our great Redeemer had appointed his twelve apoſtles, he came down from the mountain, and was joyfully received by multitudes of people, who were waiting for him in the plain: and ſuch was the heavenly virtue which attended and ſurrounded him, that whoever touched the border of his garment, was healed of his diſeaſe. This is ſufficient to account for the great numbers of people which daily followed this illuſtrious perſon, who crowded around him, wherever he went, and accompanied him to the remoteſt part of the wilderneſs of Judea; nor was it only the vulgar and neceſſitous that purſued our Redeemer's ſteps whereſoever he went, but perſons of high rank and character, came from the remoteſt parts to converſe with him, hear his divine doctrine, and be ſpectators of his wondrous works, and partakers of the benefits reſulting from them.</p>
               <p>AFTER healing the ſick amongſt the multitude, he proceeded to inſtruct them, and delivered a divine diſcourſe, in ſubſtance nearly the ſame as that which he before preached from the mountain: the chief difference in theſe diſcourſes, is the threatenings which are here denounced againſt particular ſinners, whereas the diſcourſe recorded by St. Matthew, contains only bleſſings. It may not be amiſs, briefly to conſider theſe male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, as a large paraphraſe hath been given on the former ſermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WOE unto you that are rich,</hi> ſaid our exalted Saviour, <hi>for you have received your conſolation.</hi> Riches in this world are no evidence of the love of God, but are frequently beſtowed on the worſt of men; they are not beſtowed upon any as a reward for ſuperior degrees of moral goodneſs, but are diſtributed by the great governor of the univerſe, ſo as to anſwer the wiſe ends of his own government, and bring about his great deſigns: they have no tendency to promote the beſt intereſt of man, but are frequently made uſe of by the worſt of men, to the worſt of purpoſes, and enable them to be more extenſively and deſperately wicked: they are frequently a ſnare to the truly religious, and have a natural tendency to pervert the affections, and corrupt the heart. It requires great grace to keep them from degrading the ſoul, and generating a low, mean, worldly ſpirit; for, wherever the natural courſe and tendency of riches prevail, it will always remain an eternal truth, that <hi>it is eaſier for a camel to paſs through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WOE unto you that laugh, for ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> It is not a joyful, cheerful, thankful frame of ſpirit, which our Lord here exclaims againſt, but a fooliſh, trifling, levity of mind. The goſpel of CHRIST, is particularly calculated to inſpire a conſtant cheerfulneſs of temper, and Chriſtians are commanded always to rejoice; the aſſurance they have of reconciliation with God, the lively hope of everlaſting life, the conſtant pleaſure which they find in communion with God, and the contemplation on heavenly things, tend to fill the mind with ſolid ſatisfaction and ſubſtantial joy. This joy will be conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, as Chriſtians advance in the divine life, and will be fully completed in the eternal world: but thoſe giddy, gay ſallies of mirth, and the thoughtleſs diſſipation of

mind which ariſes from an immoderate love of vain amuſement and ſenſual pleaſure, that gives no time for conſideration, but ſcatters ſerious thoughts, and creates an utter averſion to ſober reflection, will ſoon lead the ſoul into ſuch a labyrinth of wretchedneſs and woe, that they ſhall then mourn and weep. This will certainly be their lot in this world, when their vain deluſive gratifications can pleaſe no more; and it will eternally be their lot, when they will be deprived of every gleam of hope and comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the dark regions of ſorrow and deſpair, <hi>where will be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT our great Redeemer added, <hi>Woe unto you when all men ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their fathers of the falſe prophets.</hi> This malediction of our bleſſed Saviour, is denounced againſt thoſe teachers who, for fear of offending men, ſhall keep back the truth of God, and fear to proclaim the unpopular and humbling truths of the goſpel, which are ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying to human pride, and by flattering the vices, and humouring the pride and paſſions of men, ſhall gain their commendation and applauſe. Such teachers as theſe, are compared to the falſe prophets of old, who, by humouring the vanity and flattering the pride of princes and great men, were more careſſed and attended to than the true prophets of God.</p>
               <p>WHEN our great Redeemer had finiſhed his diſcourſe, he departed to Capernaum, and was met by ſome meſſengers from a Centurion, who deſired him to come and heal a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom he highly eſteemed, that was ſick, and in danger of death. This Centurion, from the character given him by the evangeliſt, ſeems to have been a proſelyte to the Jewiſh religion. The inhabitants of Capernaum ſpake much in his favour, and ſtrongly recommended his caſe; for they ſaid, that <hi>he was a lover of their religion, and had built them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſynagogue.</hi> The great Saviour of mankind, who went about doing good, graciouſly attended to the petition, and readily accompanied the meſſengers; but before he arrived at the houſe, he was met by a party of the centurion's friends, who expreſſed the high conception which that officer had of the divine power of our Redeemer, and deſired he would not give himſelf the trouble of a perſonal attendance, as his word would be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to accompliſh the cure. Our Lord was pleaſed with the meſſage, and turning to the ſpectators, ſaid, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no, not in Iſrael,</hi> Luke vii.9. The perſons having delivered their meſſage, returned to the Centurion's houſe, and found the ſick perſon perfectly recovered.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſeveral circumſtances attending this miracle, and that related by St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, proves that this Centurion was not the ſame perſon. The Centurion mentioned by St. Matthew, attended on CHRIST in perſon; him whoſe caſe is laſt related, preſented his petition by the elders of Capernaum. It does not appear that the former Centurion was a proſelyte to the Jewiſh religion; but we find a very high character given of the latter: theſe, and ſeveral other particulars which might have been mentioned, to prove that this miracle ought to be conſidered ſeparate from the former.</p>
               <p>THIS miracle being performed, our Lord repaired to the houſe of Peter, to eat bread; the place of his reſidence could not be concealed; great multitudes of people ſurrounded the houſe; ſome, no doubt, deſiring to behold the wonders which he wrought, and others, to be partakers of the benefit reſulting from them; they continued there ſome time, advancing their reſpective claims, in a tumultuous manner, and it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they were perſuaded to diſperſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> retires to Nain, a City of Galilee, where he raiſes a Widow's only Son from the Dead: He receives Meſſengers from John the Baptiſt, and gives his Teſtimony concerning him: After which he dines with Simon the Leper, where he is anointed by Mary, whoſe affection he acknowledges and rewards.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHILE the apoſtles were proceeding through the ſeveral cities of Judea, executing the commiſſion of their Divine Maſter, our great Redeemer was carrying on the work of his miſſion in Galilee; and when they had returned to our Lord, they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him and his diſciples to Nain, a city near mount Tabor, where he was followed by a great multitude of people. On their approaching the gate of the city, a ſcene of the moſt affecting affliction and diſtreſs preſented itſelf to their view; <hi>Behold there was a dead man carried out, the only ſon of his mother, and ſhe was a widow.</hi> What an affecting ſcene was this, and how was the affliction and diſtreſs of the mournful parent heightened by every circumſtance which could make it the more bitter? A young man cut down, probably in his prime, and followed to the grave by his weeping parent. With ſlow and ſolemn ſteps, ſcarce able to bear up under the load of her woes, the mourning matron follows the dead to interment, attended by her affected friends and neighbours, who had ſtrove in vain to comfort her for the loſs of her only ſon; for the young man was <hi>the only ſon of his mother,</hi> on whom perhaps, ſhe depended for ſupport; and to render her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the laſt degree heavy and inſupportable, <hi>ſhe was a widow.</hi> With tender pity our great Redeemer beheld this daughter of affliction, and immediately exerted his divine power for relief. There was no need of any interceſſor to prevail with the bleſſed JESUS to attend to ſuch a caſe as this; his own compaſſion was ſufficient to excite him to relieve her. The evangeliſt informs us, that <hi>when the Lord ſaw her, he had compaſſion on her,</hi> and gently approaching, he bid her forbear to weep. But ſo great was her loſs, that it had opened all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Her huſband was no more, and now ſhe had loſt her only ſon, the ſurviving image of his departed father, and the laſt hope of her afflicted ſoul. What comfort in the ordinary courſe of nature could be adminiſtered to this mournful widow? She had loſt her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſhe had loſt her ſon. What diſtreſs could be more overwhelming? What caſe could be more deplorable? And how natural is it to ſuppoſe that ſhe ſhould <hi>refuſe to be comforted;</hi> and to determine to <hi>go down to the grave with mourning.</hi> Our Lord well knew the weight of her affliction and the heavy preſſure of her preſent grief, and therefore uſed no arguments to comfort her; but approaching the corpſe, he <hi>touched the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

What a flood of tenderneſs would burſt upon the ſoul, and with what gratitude and joy would ſhe behold his great deliverer, who did not make any ſhew of this ſtupenduous miracle amongſt the multitude of his followers, and the attendants on the funeral, but immediately delivered the revived young man to his late afflicted, but now wondering and rejoicing mother, as a teſtimony that this great work was wrought in compaſſion to her diſtreſs. The ſurrounding multitudes beheld this wonderful event with a mixture of aſtoniſhment, pleaſure, holy awe, and fear; <hi>and they glorified God, ſaying, that great prophet is ariſen amongst us, and that God hath viſited his people.</hi>

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:029927_0072_0FE336404C2010A0"/>IF we take a review of this miracle, we may obſerve that it is liable to no objection, and abundantly proves the exertion of divine power. It is to be obſerved that it was wrought in the open field amongſt a vaſt number of ſpectators. A great number of the inhabitants of the city attended the funeral; they all bewailed the diſconſolate ſtate of the afflicted widow, and had the opportunity of being ſatisfied that the youth was really dead. The powerful word which called the dead man to life was delivered in an audible voice before all the company; and this was done at the gate of the city, a place of general reſort; every one had the opportunity of ſatisfying themſelves that the young man was really reſtored to life. There was no poſſibility of deception, nor room for objections of any kind; and this miracle, joined with the reſt wrought by the ſame divine perſon, abundantly proves that he was the Son of God, and the Saviour of ſinners.</p>
               <p>THE fame of the wonderful works which JESUS conſtantly performed, was rapidly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed through the various cities of Judea, and by the diſciples of John the Baptiſt carried to their maſter. This prophet, as we before related, was caſt into priſon by Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee. The cauſe of his impriſonment was the offence which that prince had taken at his boldly and freely blaming his conduct reſpecting his inceſtuous connection with the princeſs Herodias. John had now been confined above a year in priſon, and as he was fully convinced that CHRIST was really the Meſſiah, and no doubt having imbibed the national expectation of the Jews, that the Meſſiah would ſet up a temporal kingdom, he perceived that things did not anſwer his expectation: for, doubtleſs, he apprehended, that before this time CHRIST would have manifeſted himſelf, and made ſome advances towards his taking the reins of government. He therefore ſent two of his diſciples to our great Redeemer, with this queſtion, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or look we for another?</hi> We are not to ſuppoſe by this inquiry, that John entertained any heſitation or doubt, whether CHRIST was the true Meſſiah, or not; for it is to be obſerved, that throughout the whole courſe of his miniſtry, he had borne a regular and ample teſtimony to the truth of his divine miſſion: he had been convinced by a particular revelation from heaven, and by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, in a viſible form at CHRIST's baptiſm, that he was that divine perſon who was to come to be the Saviour of Iſrael; and accordingly he made it his conſtant care to diſpoſe the Jews in general, and his own diſciples in particular, to receive and reverence him as the Meſſiah, bearing witneſs concerning him that he was ſuperior to himſelf, and holding him up to view as <hi>the Lamb of God who taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> It cannot therefore be ſuppoſed as before obſerved, that the Baptiſt entertained any ſcruples in his mind concerning our Lord's divinity; but his deſign ſeems to be to lead his diſciples into an acquaintance with our great Redeemer, that by beholding his miracles, and hearing his divine conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, their minds might be prepared to receive him; for it is not improbable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the prophet John might have ſome expectations of his own approaching death.</p>
               <p>NOR was the conviction of his diſciples, perhaps, the only view which the prophet had in ſending this meſſage to our great Redeemer; it is to be ſuppoſed that, like the reſt of his countrymen, he expected the Meſſiah to ſet up a temporal kingdom. Nor is this ſuppoſition derogatory to the dignity of a great prophet, ſince we are informed, that though John was <hi>a prophet and more than a prophet, the leaſt in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he;</hi> the meaneſt preacher of the everlaſting goſpel is greater than the Baptiſt, becauſe he had the opportunity of being informed of the ſpiritual nature of CHRIST's kingdom. As then, it is to be ſuppoſed, that great forerunner of our Redeemer ardently deſired, and impatiently expected the appearance of his kingdom; and as the bleſſed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029927_0073_0FE336491A427150"/>
JESUS had aſſumed no earthly honour or dignity, but every thing in the Jewiſh church and ſtate continued the ſame; the Baptiſt might ſend this meſſage gently to remind him of what was expected from him as the Redeemer of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples of John brought this meſſage from their maſter to the exalted Saviour of the world, while he was attending to the various diſtreſſes of the multitude which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, curing many of their infermities, plagues, and evil ſpirits, and reſtoring ſight to the blind. Theſe miracles the diſciples of John beheld, and having delivered their meſſage, our Lord did not think proper to return them a direct anſwer, but referred them to the wonderful works they had now been obſerving, and ordered them to carry an account of theſe things to their maſter, as an anſwer to his inquiry: <hi>go your way,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and tell John what things you have heard and ſeen, how that the blind ſee, the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed, and the poor have the goſpel preached unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT that the multitude, from the propoſal of this queſtion, might not form an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of John the Baptiſt, our bleſſed Saviour at this time thought proper to place his character in the moſt favourable point of light. He commended him as a perſon of the moſt invincible courage, reſolution, and fortitude, who ſtood firm in the midſt of trouble and affliction, and was not like <hi>a read ſhaken with the wind</hi>; and praiſed him for his auſtere and mortified courſe of life, not <hi>wearing ſoft raiment, like thoſe in king's palaces,</hi> but maintained a manly hardineſs, and abhorred all luxury, effeminacy, and diſſipation. Our great Redeemer then gave a full and clear teſtimony to the prophetic office of the Baptiſt, and declared that he was the perſon referred to by the prophet Iſaiah, in thoſe remarkable words, <hi>Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee:</hi> and added, that this extraordinary perſon was that <hi>Elias which,</hi> the ancient prophets declared, <hi>was to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having done juſtice to the character of his great forerunner, he took occaſion from thence to blame and rebuke the obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of the great men and high pretenders to religion amongſt the Jews, who had rejected both his own and the Baptiſt's teſtimony. It ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, by the nature of CHRIST's rebuke, that the Scribes and Phariſees, who pretend to great faſting and mortification, thought themſelves eclipſed, and with envious vexation beheld themſelves outdone by the real auſterity of the Baptiſt. His living in the deſert, and ſhunning the company of men and the conveniences of life, the coarſeneſs of his cloathing, the abſtemiouſneſs and plainneſs of his diet, and the real ſeverities he practiſed, they beheld with growing rancour, and not only repreſented them as imprudent and unneceſſary but proceeded ſo far as to declare him poſſeſſed with an apoſtate ſpirit: <hi>For John came neither eating nor drinking; and ye ſay, He hath a devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT though theſe bold pretenders to ſuperior ſanctity and mortification, could exclaim againſt the Baptiſt on account of the auſterity of his life, it was manifeſt that it was envy and not reaſon which promoted their unbelief: for when CHRIST, on the contrary, dwelt in cities, and converſed with mankind, enjoining no auſterities nor mortification, they could make uſe of this conduct as a ground of reproach. <hi>The ſon of man came eating and drinking:</hi> though he could not by his moſt inveterate enemies be charged with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or with encouraging it in others; yet theſe determined oppoſers of heavenly truth could ſay, <hi>Behold a man, gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, and a friend of publicans and ſinners! But,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>wiſdom is juſtified of her children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE then proceeded to upbraid the ſeveral cities where his moſt wonderful works had been performed; they had enjoyed the opportunity of attending his heavenly diſcourſes,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029927_0074_0FE3364AA1370D40"/>
and had been witneſs to his wonderful works; frequently had they ſeen him perform miracles which could not be diſputed, but fully manifeſted the mighty power of God; they had often ſeen him perform wonders ſufficient to have convinced the moſt ignorant and idolatrous nations, who were immerſed in the depth of ſenſuality, and had imbibed the ſtrongeſt prejudices againſt the truth: yet, ſo great was their obſtinacy, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their unbelief, they perſiſted in their wickedneſs notwithſtanding all he had done to convince and reform them. <hi>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethſaida!</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay unto you it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum, that art exalted unto heaven, ſhalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works that have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. But I ſay unto you, that it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.</hi> Matt. xi.21, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>AFTER having, in the moſt awful, affecting and awakening manner, pronounced ſuch woes on theſe unbelieving and profligate cities, our great Redeemer concluded his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with theſe gracious and reviving words, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> It is the Son of the eternal God, the Heir of all things, the almighty Judge of heaven and earth, who kindly condeſcends to addreſs poor, loſt, undone ſinners in this affecting language; having pronounced heavy woes on the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious race, whoſe haughty ſelf-ſufficiency, inveterate prejudice, pride and obſtinacy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their receiving the truth, the kind and condeſcending Saviour of ſinners gives the moſt tender, heart-affecting invitation to the humble and penitent. Thoſe who <hi>labour and are heavy laden;</hi> thoſe who are conſcious of their vileneſs and ſinfulneſs, who are preſſed with the weight of their iniquities; whoſe guilt lies upon them like an heavy burden, from the weight of which they ardently deſire to be delivered, are here called upon and earneſtly invited to come to the only perſon who is able to relieve them. It is not the great and noble; it is not the powerful, proſperous, and happy; it is not the exulting ſons of joy, but the poor, needy, and afflicted, who are labouring under a ſenſe of ſin, and burdened with the weight of their iniquities, who are thus invited to come to our great Redeemer. The great Maker of all things, the all-wiſe and all-powerful Preſerver, the ſupreme Governor and Judge of the univerſe, graciouſly condeſcends to call unto, and with the utmoſt tenderneſs to invite poor, heavy-laden, burdened ſinners to come; he does not call upon them to come with a deſign to puniſh their offences; he does not ſummon them to appear before his awful ſeat of judgment; he does not call them with a deſign to deride or expoſe their miſeries; he does not call them with an intent to puniſh their offences, but with a deſign to releaſe them from their afflctions, to releaſe them from their burdens, to give them reſt and peace, and make them eternally happy. <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ſays our great Redeemer, <hi>all ye that labour and are heavy laden;</hi> all you who are humbled under a ſenſe of your iniquities; who ſee the dreadful condition to which you are reduced by your ſins; who have been long groaning under the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable weight of your guilt, and panting for deliverance; but throughout the limits of the wide creation can find no refuge; no help, no deliverer. <hi>Come unto me, look unto me and be ſaved;</hi> truſt in me as <hi>mighty to ſave</hi>; venture your all in my hands; ſeek no other refuge, no other help, no other deliverer; but <hi>come unto me and I will give you reſt.</hi> It is not my deſign to upbraid you with the vileneſs and folly of your conduct; it is not my deſign to enter into judgment with you and puniſh you for your iniquities, but to lead you into the paths of peace, truth and happineſs: be not afraid to liſten to my words and follow my directions, but with a full reliance on my power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, <hi>take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye ſhall find reſt to
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029927_0075_0FE3364C26E71B40"/>
your ſouls: for my yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light.</hi> Can there be a greater evidence of the corruption and depravity of the human heart than the coldneſs with which the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſons of Adam, receive ſo tender, ſo affecting, and ſo important an invitation. The great Creator hath formed them with ſtrong deſires of happineſs, and they toil out a weary life, in the eager purſuit of every appearance of good. They are loſt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and inſtead of happineſs, find themſelves plunged in trouble, vexation and woe; they find themſelves burdened with many griefs, but will not come to him who only is able to relieve them. What blindneſs, ſtupidity, and abominable pride poſſeſs the human heart, and excite it to reject the gracious calls and invitations of the only Saviour of ſinners!</p>
               <p>AFTER our great Redeemer had finiſhed his diſcourſe, he was invited by one Simon a leper, to go to his houſe, and take ſome refreſhment. The invitation he accepted, and accompanied him to his apartment, where, as he ſat at meat, a woman whoſe courſe of life was known to have been looſe and profligate, ſat at his feet beholding him with the tendereſt affection, and ſhed ſuch floods of tears that they trickled down his feet, which according to the cuſtom of the country were bare. She ſeeing that her tears had wet the feet, of her beloved Lord, wiped them with her hair, frequently kiſſing them with the utmoſt tenderneſs and affection, and anointed them with precious ointment. It was doubtleſs the ſenſe of her former courſe of life, and a deep conviction of her crimes, which cauſed this woman to ſhed ſuch a profuſion of tears; and her love to the bleſſed JESUS aroſe from the benefit ſhe had received from his heavenly diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>THE cuſtom, which then prevailed in the Eaſtern countries, of pouring fragrant oil on the heads of thoſe gueſts on whom they deſigned to beſtow peculiar and diſtinguiſhed marks of honour, ſeems to have brought this woman to our Redeemer at this time; and it appears to have been her original intention to have poured the ointment on his head; but being deeply humbled under a ſenſe of her unworthineſs ſhe could not approach her divine Inſtructor with ſo much freedom as to accompliſh her firſt intention, but thought it more conſiſtent with her humility and ſelf-abaſement to anoint only his feet.</p>
               <p>THE leper, who it ſeems was a Phariſee had attentively obſerved the woman, and knowing her character, concluded that JESUS could not be a prophet. <hi>This man,</hi> ſaid Simon to himſelf, <hi>if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is that touched him; for ſhe is a ſinner.</hi> And ſo full of pride and ſelf-ſufficiency was the man, that he was offended at, and was ready to rebuke the bleſſed JESUS for his deigning to take notice of and converſing with ſuch contemptible characters: but our great Redeemer, to convince him that he was a prophet, and that he knew not only the character of the woman who had touched him, but was acquainted with the thoughts of all who thought mean of him in their hearts, began a converſation with him on the very ſubject he had been revolving in his mind. He did not expoſe his folly to the company by openly relating the ſecret thoughts of his heart, and inſiſting on the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of them, but with the utmoſt delicacy pointed out to Simon himſelf the unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the concluſion he had formed. <hi>Simon,</hi> ſaid, the bleſſed JESUS, <hi>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay unto thee: there was a certain creditor which had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty; and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt. Simon anſwered and ſaid, I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt. And he ſaid unto him, thou haſt rightly judged.</hi> Our divine Inſtructor then immediately applied this ſhort parable to the cauſe of the woman, concerning whom the Phariſee had ſo unjuſtly reaſoned in his heart. <hi>Simon,</hi> continued he, <hi>ſeeſt thou this woman? I entered into thine houſe, thou gaveſt me no water for my feet; but
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029927_0076_0FE3364DABE23120"/>
ſhe hath waſhed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gaveſt me no kiſs; but this woman ſince the time I came in hath not ceaſed to kiſs my feet. Mine head with oil thou didſt not anoint; but this woman hath anointed my feet with oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Wherefore, I ſay unto thee, her ſins, which are many, are forgiven; for ſhe loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Saviour having thus, with great delicacy, rebuked the unjuſt and injurious ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of the Phariſees, and vindicated his own character, as well as the conduct of the woman, whoſe extraordinary kindneſs and tender affection were in no danger of loſing their reward from one who enjoyed the fine feelings of human nature in their higheſt perfection, now addreſſed the woman with the ſoul-reviving news, that her ſins were forgiven. But while her heart expanded with that holy gratitude and joy, which was inſpired by the great declaration, the Phariſees beheld both our Redeemer and the woman with rancour, diſdain, and ſullen contempt: they could not endure the thought, that great ſinners ſhould be pardoned, and ſet on a level with themſelves; nor could they be reconciled to the authority which our Redeemer had aſſumed; for being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his divinity, they concluded that he had infringed on the prerogative of the Almighty, who only had a right to pardon ſins. But the great friend of ſinners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their malicious murmurs, confirmed his gracious words, by repeating his aſſurances to the woman, adding, that her faith had ſaved her, and bidding her depart in peace.</p>
               <p>SOME little time after this, our great Redeemer departed from Capernaum and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through ſome parts of Galilee, going <hi>through every village, preaching and ſhewing the glad-tidings of the kingdom of God,</hi> Luke viii.1. And after this ſhort tour he prepared to go to Jeruſalem to eat the paſſover; this being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>NEAR the temple in Jeruſalem was a pool of water, into which ran the blood of the ſacrifices, and the water which was uſed by the prieſts in preparing the victims, and on other occaſions. This pool was called in the Hebrew tongue <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> that is, <hi>the houſe of mercy.</hi> It was ſurrounded by five porches, or cloiſters, and theſe were filled
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029927_0077_0FE336574B36D1B0"/>
with <hi>a great multitude of impotent folks, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain ſeaſon and troubled the water: whoſoever then firſt, after the troubling of the water, ſtepped in, was made whole of whatſoever diſeaſe he had.</hi> The account of this miraculous pool is given us by the evangeliſt John, but is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by any more of the ſacred writers: and various queſtions have ariſen concerning th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe whonderful waters, which it hath been impoſſible to reſolve, becauſe the pool of Bethſada is not mentioned by any other Jewiſh writer, ſacred or profane.</p>
               <p>FOR the above reaſons, it cannot be preciſely determined, when this miraculous power of healing firſt appeared in this pool; but it is almoſt univerſally agreed, that it could not be long before the coming of our Redeemer; and that the miracle was intended to lead to the Son of God, and to prepare the nation for the reception of him. Nor is it ſtrange, that a healing virtue ſhould attend thoſe waters, which were ſtained with the blood of the ſacrifices, which pointed to CHRIST, at the time when this great perſon was about to be manifeſted. The gift of prophecy, and that of miracles, had ceaſed amongſt the Jews above four hundred years; and therefore, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that this miraculous event would rouſe the attention of the nation, awaken every deſire in their hearts for the coming of the Meſſiah, and make them more circumſpect in obſerving the tokens of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And as the Jewiſh nation, at this time, was under great tribulation and contempt, and oppreſſion of the Gentiles, it may be ſuppoſed, that the God of Iſrael graciouſly condeſcended to give them this eminent token of his favour, and gave this wonderful heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue to theſe blood-ſtained waters, that they might not deſpair of the fulfilment of his ancient promiſes, but have an eye to the blood of the covenant, and expect the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that great perſon, of whom Iſaiah propheſied, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities.</hi> And as God was pleaſed, at this time, to give ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful healing virtue to a fountain of water, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that he deſigned to lead the minds of the devout worſhippers in his temple to that great perſon, of whom it was propheſied that he ſhould be <hi>a fountain opened for ſin and uncleanneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JESUS being come to Jeruſalem to the feaſt of the paſſover, he repaired to the pool of Betheſda, and took a view of the various ſubjects of diſeaſe, infirmity, and affliction, which crowded the porches, and waited for the troubling of the waters. Had theſe miſerable objects applied to our great Redeemer for help, no doubt, they would all have experienced the great effects of that divine power of healing, which this illuſtrious perſon ſo eminently poſſeſſed: but it is to be ſuppoſed, that he was abſolutely unknown amongſt them and no bleſſing or benefit was expected from him. This may be ſuppoſed to be the reaſon why our great Redeemer did not extend his heavenly goodneſs to the whole number of thoſe afflicted and diſeaſed perſons; for the general account which the evangeliſts give of his divine compaſſion on other occaſions is, that <hi>he healed all who came to him.</hi> Such diſeaſed perſons who left their habitations, out of a perſuaſion of his divine power and goodneſs, were the firſt objects of his compaſſion, and never returned without a cure; but the ſick at the pool of Betheſda, were attentive to other means of relief, and thought not of the Redeemer of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>AMONGST theſe miſerable objects, was a man who had laboured under his diſeaſe no leſs than thirty-eight years. The long continuance, as well as the diſtreſsful nature of this man's affliction, was well known to the Son of God; and amongſt the great number of diſeaſed perſons which he beheld crowding the porches that ſurrounded the pool, our exalted Saviour ſingled out this poor man as the object of his compaſſion; and accoſted him with this queſtion, <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> this queſtion ſeemed deſigned to excite the attention of the people around, and to give the impotent man an opportunity of relating
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029927_0078_0FE33659969061E8"/>
the malignant nature, and long continuance of his diſeaſe, and, of conſequence, making manifeſt the divine power which could inſtantaneouſly remove it. The infirm perſon, thinking the queſtion of our Lord had an immediate reference to the waters of the pool, replied, <hi>Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The impotent man felt a ſudden warmth and vigour run through his relaxed nerves, and his feeble limbs aſſumed their youthful ſtrength; when, finding himſelf able to perform the command of his great benefactor, he made no ſcruple of taking up his bed, and carrying it along the ſtreets, though it was the Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>SO great a miracle could not fail exciting the wonder of the ſpectators; and the new cured man, carrying his bed through the city on the Sabbath-day, which was a thing not practiſed by the Jews, and muſt have a ſtrange appearance to the beholders, would not fail to ſpread the account of this ſurpriſing event through the whole city. The man, who had ſo wonderfully recovered the uſe of his limbs, did not ſcruple to obey the commands of the Divine Phyſician, though they were contrary to the cuſtom of his country, and would be likely to expoſe him to the blame of the Jews; he well knew, that a perſon who could perform ſuch wonderful works, muſt be a great prophet; and he ſuppoſed that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would not order him to perform any action which was ſinful, and therefore, regardleſs of the reproaches he met with from the Jews, he carried his bed through the ſtreets of the city. The Jews beheld him with a mixture of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>nation and contempt, and angrily told him, that it was not lawful for him to carry his bed on the Sabbath-day. But the man, elated by his happy deliverance, and holding his great benefactor in the higheſt eſteem, thought it ſufficient to anſwer, <hi>He that made me whole, the ſame ſaid unto me, Take up thy bed and walk,</hi> John v.11. The Jews, not ſatisfied with this anſwer, ſharply inquired, who it was that had made him whole; which queſtion the man was not able to anſwer, as JESUS, as ſoon as he had performed the miracle, had mixed with the crowd, and was imperceivably departed from them.</p>
               <p>SOME time after this, the perſon who had thus been miraculouſly reſtored, met with the Divine Phyſician in the temple, who took the opportunity to impreſs on his mind, a ſenſe of the great benefit he had received, and the obligations he lay under to amendment of life: <hi>Behold thou art made whole,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> The evangeliſt has not informed us what effect this admonition had on the perſon who had been healed; but having, by this event, found out his great benefactor, he, no doubt, expecting the whole nation would revere ſo extraordinary a perſon, went to the ruler of the Jews, and told them, that <hi>it was Jeſus who had made him whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS information had a very different effect than what might be expected; the pride and obſtinacy of the rulers of Iſrael, prevented their conviction, and their inveterate preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices blinded their eyes, ſo that every manifeſtation of divine power was loſt on them: for inſtead of reverencing the Redeemer of Iſrael, and rejoicing that God had remembered his people, they tumultuouſly attacked him in the temple, and, probably, carried him before the Sanhedrim, with an intention to take away his life, becauſe he had done good on the Sabbath-day. Our great Redeemer, in anſwer to their calumny, obſerved, that by doing good on the Sabbath-day, he acted conſiſtent with the conduct of his heavenly Father, who, as Supreme Governor of the univerſe, carried on the order of nature, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029927_0079_0FE3365B1A1790C0"/>
ſupplied the wants of his numerous creatures, without diſtinction of days; and whoſe providence is conſtantly employed in doing good to the ſons of men without intermiſſion, or regard to times and ſeaſons. But the Jews were not to be convinced by argument, they cheriſhed in their minds a growing rancour, and an implacable hatred to the Son of God; ſo that what he had obſerved, inſtead of compoſing their minds, only tended to irritate and inflame them: and they attacked him with mortal hatred, and all the virulence of abuſe, and ſtood determined to take away his life becauſe <hi>he not only had broken the Sabbath, but had ſaid that God was his Father; making himſelf equal with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAD the Jews been wrong in this concluſion, that CHRIST, in the account which he gave of himſelf, made himſelf equal with God, no doubt that divine perſon, in whom dwelt eternal truth, would have ſet them to rights in a matter of ſuch high importance, which ſo nearly concerned himſelf, and which he was the only proper perſon to explain. But we find, that the following diſcourſe of our great Redeemer, did not tend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit ſuch a concluſion, but to eſtabliſh and enforce it. He begins with obſerving, that ſo cloſe is the connection, and ſuch the equality between himſelf and the Father, that the ſame works which are aſcribed to one, may be properly aſcribed to the other. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>the Son can do nothing himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do: for what things ſoever he doeth, theſe alſo doeth the Son likewiſe: for the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things, that himſelf doeth; and he will ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w him greater works than theſe, that ye may marvel.</hi> From this teſtimony which the Son of God bears to his own divinity, it is evident, that all men ſhould honour the Son as they honour the Father, and that the ſtupendous works of creation, providence, and grace, may be juſtly aſcribed to our dear Immanuel: and him we may adore, as the Great Maker, the All-wiſe and All-potent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſerver, the Great Supreme Governor, and Judge of the univerſe.</p>
               <p>THE Saviour of the world then proceeded to refer to thoſe particular works which manifeſted him to be the Son of God, and, of conſequence, by their own concluſion, equal with the Father; and in this view, he mentions the manifeſtation of his divine power in raiſing the dead: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear ſhall live. For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo he hath given to the Son, to have life in himſelf: and hath given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> The evidence of the divinity of the Saviour of the world, ariſes not only from the divine power which he manifeſted in raiſing the natural dead, but was alſo abundantly manifeſt by his divine power, exerted in raiſing dead ſinners; which is a work which can be effected by nothing leſs than the mighty power of God; and to which theſe remarkable words ſeem to allude.</p>
               <p>BUT our great Redeemer proceeds further to aſſert and enforce his own divinity, and equality with his Father, by obſerving, that to him is aſſigned the great work of ſitting in judgment, and fixing the eternal ſtate of all mankind. <hi>Marvel not at this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves ſhall come forth: they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the reſurrection of damnation. And my judgment is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of my Father who ſent me.</hi> In that great and terrible day, the fate of a falling world will be decided by Unerring Wiſdom, and the invariable rules of righteouſneſs and goodneſs: for the great Judge of heaven and earth, hath a full and clear perception of every action which has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the beginning to the end of time; and he is abſolutely impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed, having no inclination to ſatisfy, no end to purſue, different from thoſe of his heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:029927_0080_0FE3365CD0FED098"/>THE great Saviour of the world, as a further confirmation of his divinity, appealed to the teſtimony of John, to whom the Phariſees had formerly ſent a deputation to know his opinion of CHRIST. Our Lord obſerved, that <hi>he was a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> in which, for a time, the Jews greatly rejoiced, and they had cauſe to rejoice, becauſe the prophetic ſpirit, which had ſo long ceaſed in Iſrael, had been revived in that holy man; and he had given a full and clear teſtimony, that JESUS was the Son of God: but our Redeemer proceeded to a greater teſtimony than that of John, which was no other than God himſelf, who, by his miracles which he daily directed him to perform, was bearing a conſtant witneſs to the truth of his divinity, and had by an audible voice at his baptiſm, declared him to be his well-beloved Son; a voice which multitudes of people had heard, and perhaps ſome of thoſe to whom he was now ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>AND for a further confirmation of the great truth he had been maintaining, our Lord, as a means to ſtrike a full conviction in the minds of the Jews, with whom he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, appealed to their own Scriptures: <hi>Search the Scriptures; for in them ye have eternal life: and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> But notwithſtanding the clearneſs of the ancient prophecies, and the remarkable manner in which they deſcribed and pointed out the Saviour of ſinners, that unhappy nation was ſo blinded by their prejudices and vices, that they could not believe. The Jews had long expected the Meſſiah to appear amongſt them, but they had formed very different conceptions of his appearance, than the deſigns of heaven, or the deſcriptions of their prophets. The Scribes and Phariſees had long amuſed themſelves, and filled the minds of the people with grand and magnificent ideas of the Meſſiah's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; they had repreſented him as a potent prince, who was to be adorned with all the enſigns of power, and the glory of ſovereign greatneſs; he was to ſit on the throne of his father David, and raiſe it in power, greatne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, glory, grandeur, and magnificence, above all the kingdoms of the earth. Hence it was, that they could not acknowledge JESUS as their Meſſiah; they took offence at the meanneſs of his appearance; and though the mighty works which he performed, fully manifeſted the truth of his miſſion, and were ſufficient to convince every impartial and unprejudiced mind, that he was really the Meſſiah; yet the pride of that infatuated nation, could not ſtoop ſo low as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him: nor could their teachers, who had filled their minds with ſuch vaſt expectations of temporal greatneſs, condeſcend to confeſs themſelves ſo much miſtaken in the meaning of the prophets.</p>
               <p>BUT to conclude this diſcourſe, our Lord proceeded to obſerve that he himſelf ſhould not be their only accuſer to his Father, but they would be condemned for their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by their great legiſlator, Moſes, on whom they truſted as their invariable friend. <hi>Do not think,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I will accuſe you to the Father; there is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes, in whom ye truſt: for had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me: but if ye believe not his writings, how ſhall ye believe my word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WITH ſuch obſervations and arguments as theſe, the bleſſed JESUS combated the pride and prejudice of the Jewiſh nation, and proved himſelf to be the Son of God, the great Judge of the whole earth, and the Meſſiah promiſed by the ancient prophets; and ſo plain and convincing were the proofs and arguments he brought, that his adverſaries could not reply: but though they were ſilenced by the wiſdom of his words, their old prejudices remained; and their being baffled and overcome in every conteſt, filled them with a growing rancour and ſettled hatred to his perſon, which ſhewed itſelf on every occaſion, and proceeded ſo far as to induce them to endeavour to take away his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:029927_0081_0FE336688FD2A4D8"/>NOR was it long before the proud and envious Scribes and Phariſees found a freſh opportunity to exclaim againſt our great Redeemer, and purſue him with their imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent objections and cavils; for going with his train through the corn-fields on the Sabbath-day, his diſciples plucked the ears of corn and eat the grain, after rubbing it in their hands, and the Phariſees with the utmoſt ſeverity and bitterneſs exclaimed againſt this as a profanation of the Sabbath. Our Lord, in reply to this calumny reminded them of the conduct of David, who, in a caſe of neceſſity, when he fled from Saul, permitted his ſervants, and preſumed himſelf, to eat of the ſhew-bread which was kept in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and was not lawful for any to eat but the prieſts; and further to convince them of the folly of their remarks, our Lord referred them to the conduct of their own prieſts, who conſtantly performed the neceſſary work of the temple on the Sabbath-day: from whence it appears, that works of neceſſity had been always permitted on the Sabbath-day, though it was contrary to the command of the law. Our Lord further obſerved, that it was neceſſary the Scribes and Phariſees ſhould know that <hi>the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath:</hi> for as the work which himſelf and his diſciples conſtantly attended to was promoting the eternal intereſt of mankind, they had a greater right to claim an exemption from the ſtrict obſervance of the Sabbath than the prieſts in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were only concerned in the practice of ritual obſervances, could pretend to. And in the concluſion of this diſcourſe, our great Redeemer took notice, that acts of mercy ſhould always be performed, though they were attended with the violation of ſome of the ſacred inſtitutions of the ceremonial law; for it would be inverting the order of nature, and reverſing the immutable rules of reaſon and the nature of things, to ſuppoſe that <hi>man was made for the Sabbath, and not the Sabbath for the uſe and benefit of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after this debate with the Scribes and Phariſees, our bleſſed Saviour entered one of the ſynagogues of Jeruſalem on the Sabbath day, and in the aſſembly there was a man whoſe right hand was withered.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees rightly concluded that ſuch an object of diſtreſs would excite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of that divine phyſician, who had ſo often exerted the wonderful power he poſſeſſed in behalf of the helpleſs and miſerable: and, obſerving that JESUS took particular notice of the infirm perſon, they watched him with all the keenneſs and rancour of the moſt inveterate malice, concluding that they ſhould now have an opportunity of accuſing him to the people as a breaker of the Sabbath. So full of pride and ſelf-ſufficiency was this hypocritical generation, and ſo greatly they valued themſelves on the exact performance of external ceremonies, that they could openly accuſe our great Redeemer of a capital offence for healing the diſeaſed on the Sabbath-day: but ſo blind and ſtupid were theſe doctors of the law, that they could not ſee that themſelves were profaning and polluting that ſacred day of reſt, by indulging the moſt diabolical diſpoſitions, and practiſing the moſt attrocious actions which could be committed. Such was their endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a virtuous and innocent perſon, who had never injured them, whoſe conduct and character demanded the higheſt reſpect, and whoſe life was ſpent in promoting the beſt intereſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE Saviour of the world was not unacquainted with their deadly malice, nor their preſent intentions to take an advantage of his heavenly goodneſs; he knew the rancour of their hearts; he penetrated their deepeſt deſigns; and unmoved by their impotent rage, he ordered the perſon to ſtand up in the full view of the whole congregation, and publicly avowed his deſign to heal him.</p>
               <p>THE hypocritical teachers of Iſrael exclaimed againſt the beneficent action he was about to perform, as an impious and unlawful profanation of the Sabbath. <hi>Is it,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029927_0082_0FE3366A16776F30"/>
they, <hi>lawful to heal on the ſabbath-day?</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed that, by this exclamation, they deſigned to prevent the performance of the miracle, but rather to draw from our great Redeemer ſuch an anſwer as they might take advantage of, and which might give them an opportunity to accuſe him with the greater ſucceſs: but our Lord anſwered them in ſuch a manner as let them know that he penetrated their deepeſt deſigns, and at the ſame time baffled and confounded their utmoſt rage. <hi>Is it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day, or to do evil? To ſave life, or to deſtroy it?</hi> Is it lawful for you, ye moſt deteſtable hypocrites, to harbour in your minds the moſt infernal rancour and hatred againſt me; and with the higheſt injuſtice and cruelty to plot againſt my life on the Sabbath-day? And is it not lawful for me to reſtore to his former ſtrength, this poor diſtreſſed man who ſtands before you? The juſtice and ſeverity of this rebuke ſtruck them dumb; and, not being able to reply, they pretended not to underſtand his meaning: but to leave them without excuſe, our Lord made uſe of an argument which ſtupidity itſelf could not miſtake, and which all the ſophiſtry of theſe hypocritical teachers was not able to evade. <hi>What man,</hi> ſaid our exalted Saviour, <hi>ſhall there be amongst you, who ſhall have one ſheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a ſheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS plain reference to their own practice was ſo clear and convincing, that they could not pretend to be ignorant of it; and ſo full that they were effectually ſilenced though they were determined not to be convinced. This wicked perverſeneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable obſtinacy, grieved the ſpirit of the meek and lowly, the kind and benevolent Son of God, who looking round on his enemies with a mixture of compaſſion and ſorrow, kindly commanded the lame man to ſtretch out his hand: the man gladly obeyed, and inſtantly it was reſtored whole as the other.</p>
               <p>THIS aſtoniſhing work, our great Redeemer performed in a large congregation in the full view of all the people, in whom the foregoing diſpute had raiſed a curioſity to behold the event; and as, no doubt, it was performed on a perſon that frequented the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, moſt of the perſons there preſent were acquainted with the man, while he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under this infirmity, and ſeeing JESUS in ſuch a ſituation in the midſt of his moſt inveterate enemies, it muſt certainly have a great effect on the minds of the beholders, eſpecially as they ſaw that it had effectually ſilenced the Phariſees, who had nothing to offer, either againſt the miracle itſelf, the proofs and reaſonings urged for the fitneſs and propriety of it, or the divine power of him who had performed it.</p>
               <p>BUT though theſe proud, envious, and hypocritical teachers were aſtoniſhed at the miracles, and ſilenced by the arguments of the Son of God, yet they were far from giving up their unjuſt and cruel inſtitutions: for though they bore an inveterate hatred to the Sadducees and Herodians becauſe they preſumed to differ from them in their religious ſentiments, yet they could join with theſe perſons they ſo much deſpiſed, and conſult with them in order to take away his life.</p>
               <p>FOR they well knew that if he continued the courſe of his miniſtry, and produced ſuch inconteſtible evidences of divine power, the people would follow him; when their own weight and influence would quickly decline, and their preaching become contemptible. JESUS well knew their wicked deſigns, yet he did not think proper at this time, any further to oppoſe them, but retired into Galilee, to the borders of the lake of Chinnereth.</p>
               <p>THIS retreat of our great Redeemer ſeems to have diſpleaſed ſome of his diſciples, who had ſtrongly imbibed the popular idea of the Meſſiah's temporal kingdom, and expected
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029927_0083_0FE3366B9DDD8200"/>
that he would have eſtabliſhed his authority by force, and exerted his divine power to bear down all oppoſition; and they were extremely mortified to find their Maſter give way, and ſeem to decline any further conteſt. But the obſcurity of his retreat could not conceal him from the multitudes who flocked to him from all quarters, bringing with them their ſick and diſeaſed; and his heavenly goodneſs healed them all. Nor would the diſciples have been offended at this mild and peaceable conduct of their Maſter, had they attentively conſidered the prophecy of Iſaiah, where this peaceable diſpoſition is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſiſted on as eminently diſtinguiſhing the character of the Meſſiah. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen; my beloved, in whom my ſoul is well pleaſed: I will put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall ſhew judgment to the Gentiles. He ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry; neither ſhall any man hear his voice in the ſtreets. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax he ſhall not quench, till he ſend forth judgment unto victory. And in his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> Matthew xii.12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THE ſmall variations between this prophecy, as quoted by St. Matthew, and the original in the book of Iſaiah, are of no conſequence, as the ſenſe is the ſame; and here it may be worthy of remark, that this prophecy deſcribes the publication of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by JESUS CHRIST, vaſtly different from that of the Jewiſh religion by Moſes. The law of Moſes was publiſhed with thunder and fire, and the ſtrongeſt circumſtances of terror from mount Sinai, and only extended to the ſingle nation of the Iſraelites: the doctrine of ſalvation, as publiſhed by the Meſſiah, was mild, peaceable, and gentle, and was extended to every nation and people under heaven. Accordingly, our Lord, by retiring to Galilee, fulfilled the firſt part of this famous prophecy, <hi>He ſhall ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w judgment to the Gentiles;</hi> for we are informed by the evangeliſt that great multitudes came to him from beyond Jordan, and from Syria, and from the countries about Tyre and Sidon.</p>
               <p>WHILE our Lord remained in Galilee, there was brought unto him a blind and dumb man, poſſeſſed with a devil; but he, with a ſingle word, caſt out the evil ſpirit, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſtored to the poor man the noble faculties of ſight and ſpeech. An event ſo ſurpriſing, ſo miraculous, and ſo ſuddenly wrought, could not fail of exciting the aſtoniſhment of the beholder; and the honeſt plain-hearted part of the nation were inclined to believe. But the Phariſees, who had followed him from Jeruſalem with the baſeſt intentions, were filled with the moſt tormenting envy at ſeeing him perform ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing miracles and burning with all the rage of diſappointed malice, contrary to all the rules of reaſon and the conviction of their own minds, impudently and wickedly aſcribed his miracles to the power of the devil: an affirmation ſo horrid, abominable, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, could not eſcape the notice, or fail of exciting the ſharp rebukes of the Son of God; who addreſſing himſelf both to his enemies and the ſurrounding multitude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the abſurdity and impoſſibility of ſuch a concluſion from the common affairs of life. <hi>Every kingdom</hi> ſaid the bleſſed JESUS, <hi>divided againſt itſelf ſhall not ſtand: and if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf: how then ſhall his kingdom ſtand?</hi> How fooliſh and ridiculous is it to ſuppoſe that the Devil would act againſt himſelf, and undermine the foundations of his own kingdom! To which our great Redeemer thought fit to add, <hi>If I by Belzebub caſt out devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? Therefore they ſhall be your judges. But if I caſt out devils by the Spirit of God, then is the kingdom of God come unto you.</hi> You did not impute the miracles of your prophets to Belzebub but received them on the evidence of theſe miracles as the meſſengers of God: but ye reject me, who work greater and more numerous miracles than they, and impute them to the power of the Devil. Is this conduct conſiſtent; or is it poſſible to reconcile it to reaſon or common ſenſe? Theſe prophets therefore ſhall be your judges; and they ſhall condemn you. But if it is
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029927_0084_0FE3366D22F1DCA0"/>
true, that I caſt out devils by the Almighty Power and Spirit of God, it follows, that the kingdom of God ſo long expected, and ardently deſired, is going to be eſtabliſhed amongſt you. Is not the horrid impudence of this blaſphemy of yours really aſtoniſhing! But, great as your crime is, it may yet be forgiven; becauſe fuller and more manifeſt evidences of the truth of my miſſion, may hereafter convince you of your wickedneſs, and excite you to believe; and the time is coming, when the Son of man ſhall be raiſed from the dead, and the gift of miracles by the power of the Holy Ghoſt will be beſtowed on almoſt every believer. The nature of the Meſſiah's kingdom will be more fully explained, and ſuch proofs given, as if attended to, will be abundantly ſufficient to remove your prejudices and overcome your obſtinacy and prevailing unbelief. But if you then ſhut your eyes, and ſpeak evil againſt the Holy Ghoſt, contrary to the conviction of your minds, maliciouſly aſcribing the miracles wrought by his power, and his extraordinary gifts, to proceed from the prince of darkneſs, you have wilfully ſhut your eyes againſt the light; you have dared to inſult the eternal God to his face; you have reſiſted, wilfully reſiſted, the laſt means which he will uſe to convince you: and you never will be forgiven, but ſhall ſurely fall under the fierceneſs of his wrath, both in this world, and that which is to come. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE awful and alarming denunciation againſt the blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably laid down by our Saviour at this time, to appriſe the Phariſees of their danger, to awaken them to a ſenſe of their obſtinate and envious oppoſition to the truth, and make them afraid of the conſequence, if they perſiſted in ſuch deteſtable calumnies, when their own hearts told them, that they had no foundation in reaſon, but what flowed from malice and reſentments: but the moſt powerful arguments, or the moſt awful threatenings, had no effect on this obſtinate and perverſe race of mortals, who ſarcaſtically anſwered, <hi>Maſter, we would ſee a ſign from thee.</hi> What aſtoniſhing ſtupidity! Had he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had not he cleanſed lepers, raiſed the dead, and rebuked the tempeſtuous winds, and raging waves of the ſea! Were not theſe ſigns ſufficient to have convinced the moſt obſtinate and bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mortal! What therefore could theſe ſtubborn doctors of the law require! Well might the great Saviour of the world call them <hi>a wicked and adulterous generation;</hi> for certainly they could juſtly pretend to no part of the faith and piety of their great father Abraham; he believed God, and, it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs: but they, by their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſtinacy, and determined unbelief, added ſin to ſin, and plunged themſelves into the depth of iniquity and wickedneſs. Perſons of ſuch perverſe diſpoſitions, and incorrigible tempers, merited no indulgence; and, therefore, our great Redeemer told them, that no ſign ſhould be given them, but that of the prophet Jonah, who, by laying three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, was a type of the Son of God, who ſhould continue three days and three nights in the chambers of the grave.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord then proceeded to obſerve, that the obſtinacy, perverſeneſs, and wickedneſs of that generation, was greater than that of the moſt barbarous, ignorant, and idolatrous nations, who would riſe in judgment with them and condemn them.</p>
               <p>THE people of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah; and the queen of the South took a long journey to behold the wiſdom of Solomon: but the obſtinate, wicked, and unbelieving Jews, would not repent at the preaching, and repeated warnings of the Son of God, nor learn wiſdom from the Eternal Fountain of Wiſdom itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:029927_0085_0FE336780AAA1270"/>OUR Lord then concluded his diſcourſe with a parable, which ſhewed the great danger of wilfully oppoſing and reſiſting the truth, as ſuch practices tend to make men habitually and deſperately wicked, and, in every reſpect, more obdurate and abandoned than before.</p>
               <p>DURING this diſpute with the rulers of Iſrael, JESUS was informed, that his mother and his kinſmen waited without, deſiring an interview with him; upon which, with a look of the tendereſt affection, he ſtretched out his hand towards his diſciples, and ſaid, <hi>Behold my mother and my brethern! for whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the ſame is my brother, and ſiſter, and mother,</hi> Matt. xii.49, 50. Theſe remarkable words ought to be received with the warmeſt gratitude, and the moſt exalted joy, by every Chriſtian; ſince from this divine declaration, it may be learnt, that a faith in CHRIST, which works by love, and produces a conformity to the precepts of the goſpel, gives the believer a claim to the high title of a Son of the Moſt High, and a near relation to his dear Redeemer: by this divine principle, the believer lays hold on the bleſſings and privileges which belong to his ſpiritual birth, he claims a kindred to the ſkies, he becomes acquainted with his union with the Divine Nature, and can ſtand before the throne of the Eternal God, and call him his Father.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JESUS</hi> delivers ſeveral Parables from a Ship, to the Multitudes that were ſtanding on Shore: He receives a ſecond Viſit from his Relations: At Evening he retires to Capernaum, and delivers more Parables to his Diſciples: Afterwards, he returns to Nazareth, his own City, and ſends his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach about that Country: He then repairs to the Deſert of Bethſaida and provides a miraculous Repaſt for the whole Multitude.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE public debate in which JESUS was engaged with the Phariſees, and the miracle which was the occaſion of it, brought together ſuch a vaſt concourſe of people, that, for the greater facility of inſtructing them, our great Redeemer repaired to the ſea-ſide. The crowd preſſed ſo cloſe about him, that he was incommoded in his office of ſpeaking, and for the greater conveniency, he entered a ſhip, and put off to ſome ſmall diſtance from the ſhore, while the attentive multitudes remained on dry land: being thus conveniently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated for public ſpeaking, our divine Inſtructor proceeded to lay down ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the utmoſt importance, which he thought proper to introduce in the parabolical ſtile. This was a mode of inſtruction very common in the Oriental nations, and it was the general method of the old prophets, John the Baptiſt, and our bleſſed Saviour, to inculcate divine and moral truths, in the beautiful method of alluſion and fable; and ſometimes ſo to contrive the diſcourſe, that it had an immediate reference to thoſe objects, which at that very time preſented themſelves to the view of the audience. This method of inſtructing was, on ſeveral accounts, particularly adapted to the deſigns of divine conduct, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Jewiſh nation, at the time of the Meſſiah's appearance. Similitudes of this kind, are the moſt eaſy and ſimple methods of teaching; they are beſt accommodated to the apprehenſions of the ignorant and unlearned, and are very eaſy to be underſtood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, and applied at the ſame time, they are the fineſt veil for myſteries, and the beſt medium for concealing from the proud and obſtinate, thoſe truths which their perverſeneſs and infidelity render them unworthy of having more clearly revealed.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations ſeem to be alluded to by our great Redeemer himſelf, when his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples aſked, why he taught the people in parables? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it is given unto you to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029927_0086_0FE3367A5C6005D8"/>
know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given: for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that he hath. Therefore, ſpeak I unto them in parables; becauſe, in ſeeing they ſee not: and in hearing they hear not, neither do they underſtand,</hi> Matt. xiii.11, &amp;c. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciples, whom our Redeemer, by his divine power, had made of an humble, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition, whoſe minds, by an heavenly influence, were become docile, apt to learn, and open to inſtruction, were thus addreſſed by the divine Inſtructor, and he gives them to underſtand, that it would be no advantage to them, nor to any that ſincerely deſired to be inſtructed, and attended on him in humility of heart, that the truths he delivered were clothed in parables; for ſuch perſons would carefully conſider his words, and reſort to him for their explanation: and the truths themſelves, clothed in this beautiful veil, would be more attractive to the humble inquiring mind: and, when carefully conſidered, appear plain, ſimple, and eaſy to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>BUT the proud, ſelf-conceited Scribes and Phariſees, were ſo blinded by their prejudices, that they would not give themſelves time to conſider, but would heartily deſpiſe ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of teaching, and condemn, as low and contemptible, the plain alluſions in which the divine truths were repreſented. Our great Redeemer did not alter his manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for their ſakes, but dreſſed the great truths of the goſpel in ſuch metaphorical robes as they did heartily deſpiſe, and which would for ever conceal them from perſons of their temper and conduct. Nor need it be wondered at, the bleſſed JESUS further obſerved: that he took this method with this ſort of men; for it had been propheſied of him, that he ſhould <hi>open his mouth in parables, and utter things which had been kept ſecret from the foundation of the world.</hi> And concerning the pride, obſtinacy, perverſeneſs, and infidelity of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Jews, Iſaiah had long ago propheſied to them, that, <hi>by hearing ye ſhall hear, and not underſtand; and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive: for this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed: leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is ſome little variation between the words, as quoted by our Saviour, and thoſe found in the prophecy of Iſaiah, but the meaning is the ſame in each, and the ſenſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly is, that the Jewiſh nation ſhould hear the doctrines of the goſpel, but not underſtand them: and ſee the miracles wrought in confirmation of the truth of thoſe doctrines but not perceive them to be wrought by the power of God: not becauſe the evidences produced by our great Redeemer, were inſufficent to convince a judicious and impartial inquirer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truth; but becauſe the corruption and depravity of the hearts of the proud Phariſees, would not ſuffer them to examine and weigh theſe evidences; for the ſins of that people had hardened their hearts, their pride and vanity had ſhut their ears, and their hypocriſy and bigotted adherence to tradition, and forced interpretations of the law, had cloſed their eyes; ſo that the bright rays of divine truth could not ſhine upon their dark minds, nor the powerful voice of heavenly wiſdom, awaken their attention, or command their aſſent.</p>
               <p>SUCH were the reaſons aſſigned by our great Redeemer, for his teaching the people in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables; and then he proceeded to remind his diſciples of the great privileges they enjoyed, in having the opportunity of learning, from his heavenly lips, thoſe things which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old ſo earneſtly deſired to know and underſtand: <hi>But bleſſed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear: for verily I ſay unto you, that many prophets and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt parable which the bleſſed JESUS delivered to the multitude, was that of the ſower, who caſt his ſeed into different kinds of ſoil, the product of which was anſwerable
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029927_0087_0FE3367BE1362AB0"/>
to the nature of the ground; ſome yielding a large increaſe and ſome none at all; by which he elegantly diſplayed the ſucceſs of his own doctrine, amongſt the ſeveral kinds of hearers to which it would be preached. <hi>A ſower,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>went forth to ſow; and when he ſowed, ſome ſeeds fell by the way ſide, and the fowls came and devoured them up: ſome fell upon ſtony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they ſprung up, becauſe they had no deepneſs of earth; and when the ſun was up, they were ſcorched; and becauſe they had no root, they withered away. And ſome fell among thorns, and the thorns ſprung up and choaked them; but others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty fold, ſome thirty fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS parable was peculiarly proper to be conſidered by the multitudes who attended on the Son of God, when ſuch vaſt numbers heard his diſcourſes, and ſo few practiſed his precepts, or profited by the heavenly doctrines which he taught. Not only the multitude, but the diſciples heard him with a mixture of pleaſure and ſurpriſe; and, not underſtanding his meaning, they were impatient to hear it explained; and were very urgent to know, why he choſe that method of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>THE laſt of theſe queſtions, our Lord anſwered in the manner before related; and then, with condeſcending kindneſs, proceeded to give them the explanation of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſower: <hi>When any one,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>heareth the word of the kingdom, and underſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his heart. This is he which received the ſeed by the way ſide.</hi> The perſons who are here repreſented as hearing the word of God without underſtanding, are thoſe careleſs hearers, whoſe minds are diverted from attending to thoſe things which concern their everlaſting peace, by the gay, trifling amuſements and alluring objects of ſenſe. Such perſons hear the word of God with ſo little attention, that they ſcarcely know what they hear; and, for want of an habit of ſerious thinking, their ideas are looſe and ſcattered, and an univerſal diſſipation of mind drives out all ſolid reflection. Such perſons as theſe, are at all times proper objects for the great enemy of mankind to work upon; he well knows how to take advantage of the vacancy of thought, which expoſes ſuch minds to his malicious attempts; and, where he finds the mind empty, he takes care to enter there, and fill it with ſuch furniture, as ſoon eraſes the ſlight impreſſions it may have received by hearing the word of God.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond kind of hearers, deſcribed in the parable of the ſower, are thoſe who receive the word with a greater degree of attention, and in whom it produces an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation of conduct and behaviour; but, not being impreſſed on the mind by the operation of the Divine Spirit, it does not effect a real change of heart. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, while things go on ſmooth, and they meet with ſucceſs and encouragement in the world, may make a profeſſion, and appear to others, and think themſelves religious, but, like ſeed ſown on hard, ſtony ground, which, though it ſprings up, and looks green for a while, yet, when the ſun ſhines hot and bright, ſoon withers for want of root; they cannot ſtand in the day of adverſity and trouble: <hi>for when tribulation, or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by they are offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE third kind of hearers, are thoſe who ſeem to receive the word of God with great earneſtneſs and attention; but however they may be delighted with it in the houſe of God, they do not carry a favor of it into the world. In ſome, the toil, trouble, care, and vexation ariſing from their circumſtances in the world, ſo fill the mind, engage the attention, overwhelm the ſpirit, and oppreſs the heart, that, like a plant incumbred and ſurrounded with rank, poiſonous weeds, the word of God, which they have heard,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029927_0088_0FE3367D676AAED8"/>
cannot grow; the noble truths of the goſpel cannot have their proper influence on the mind, but gradually ſink and decline, till at laſt they are diſbelieved, or totally forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Others, who meet with their deſired ſucceſs in their worldly cares, are ſo aſſiduous in the purſuit, and ſo entirely devoted to the acquiſition of wealth, that every thing to them ſeems little and low which does not produce ſome temporal advantage: as riches increaſe, they ſet their hearts upon them, and a worldly ſpirit <hi>chokes the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN oppoſition to thoſe unprofitable hearers of the word, a fourth ſort are repreſented in this parable, whoſe hearts, by the Holy Spirit, are prepared for the reception of divine truth; for, as the beſt of ground, except it be ploughed, harrowed and cleanſed by the huſbandman, will not receive the ſeed, nor produce a plentiful harveſt; ſo the heart of man, except it be changed by divine power, will not receive the word of God, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch fruit as the goſpel requires: but, when the heavenly ſeed falls on thoſe hearts which have been wrought upon and prepared by the Divine Spirit, the word is received with gladneſs, it takes deep root in the mind, it operates on all the powers and faculties of the ſoul, it terminates in obedience to the precepts of the goſpel, and brings forth fruit to the honour and intereſt of the cauſe of CHRIST, in proportion to the capacities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the different ſubjects on which it falls, <hi>in ſome an hundred fold, in ſome ſixty, and in ſome thirty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer, having finiſhed his explanation of the parable of the ſower, he turned to his diſciples, and explained to them, by the ſimilitude of a lighted candle, the uſe they were to make of the knowledge which they would acquire by converſing with him, and receiving his divine inſtructions. <hi>Is a candle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>brought to be put under a buſhel, or under a bed, and not to be ſet on a candleſtick? For there is nothing hid which ſhall not be manifeſted, neither was any thing kept ſecret, but it ſhould come abroad.</hi> By which the divine Inſtructor gave them to underſtand, that, though now theſe heavenly truths were veiled in ſhades and figures, and taught to mankind in parables, the time would come, that they would be more clearly revealed, and as a lighted candle, exalted on high, illuminates the whole apartment where it is placed, ſo ſhall the brightneſs of divine truth, by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be ſpread abroad, and enlighten the dark nations of the earth: therefore, as the diſciples of CHRIST were intended to convey the precepts of heavenly inſtruction to the dark, uninlightened nations of the world, our Lord reminded them, that it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the higheſt importance, that they ſhould be rightly and fully taught thoſe truths they were to bear to the remoteſt nations; and, therefore, it behoved them to hear him with the utmoſt care and attention. <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what ye hear; with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you; and unto you that hear ſhall more be given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER our Lord had been thus diſcourſing to his diſciples, he turned to the multitude on the ſhore, and, addreſſing them in the moſt pleaſing and powerful manner, he delivered to them the parable of the enemy's ſowing tares amongſt the wheat. <hi>The kingdom of heaven,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is likened to a man which ſowed good ſeed in his field: but while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares amongst the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo. So the ſervants of the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came and ſaid unto him, Sir didſt not thou ſow good ſeed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He ſaid unto them, an enemy hath done this. The ſervants ſaid unto him, Wilt thou then, that we go and gather them up? But he ſaid, Nay; leſt, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them. Let both go together until the harveſt: and in the time of harveſt, I will ſay unto the reapers, Gather ye the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:029927_0089_0FE30EAA0D7753A0"/>THIS parable, as our Lord afterwards explained it to his diſciples, relates to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates of men at the end of the world. The huſbandman is our great Redeemer himſelf; the field is the chriſtian church, planted in various parts of the world; thoſe Chriſtians who are enabled by the Holy Spirit to love the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and bring fruit worthy their high profeſſion, are the wheat; and thoſe who make an empty profeſſion, without knowing the power of true religion, are the tares. Theſe are ſeduced into the paths of wickedneſs by the enemy of God and man; and the parable elegantly repreſents, the mixed ſtate of the profeſſing church on earth, and the deplorable end of the hypocrite and thoſe who know not God. Such characters as theſe may mix with the real Chriſtians, and may deceive for a time, by aſſuming the appearance of ſuperior ſanctity and ſtrictneſs of life; yet they will not fail ſooner or later, to betray themſelves, and make it manifeſt that they are but tares amongſt the wheat. Yet we are taught by this parable, how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſoever we may wiſh to free the church from all corruption both in doctrine and practice, it is not lawful for us to aſſume the prerogative of the great Judge of heaven and earth, by perſecuting, or following with any corporal puniſhment, any who we apprehend to be hypocrites and corrupters of ture religion. The tares and the wheat are to grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till harveſt, they are not to be ſeparated, leſt by miſtaking the character of the perſons, we beſtow the cenſure on the true Chriſtian, which belongs to the hypocrite: but the harveſt will come when they will be ſeparated by our great Redeemer himſelf, and his attending angels: then the tares will be bound up in bundles and burnt, but the wheat carefully gathered into the barn. For at the end of the world, our great Redeemer will diſtinguiſh between the pretended and the real Chriſtian; the wicked will be condemned to eternal torment, but the righteous will be received to life eternal; when they <hi>ſhall ſhine forth, as the ſun, in the kingdom of their Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE next parable which our exalted Redeemer though fit to propoſe to the liſtening mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, was that of the ſeed which ſprang up and grew imperceptibly. <hi>So is the kingdom of God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itſelf; firſt the blade, and then the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the fickle, becauſe the harveſt is come.</hi> This beautiful picture repreſents the gradual and ſilent progreſs of the goſpel in the heart of man; as the huſbandman does not by any power of his own, cauſe the ſeed to grow when he has ſown it, but the blade and fruit are produced by the power of the great Creator, and by thoſe laws of nature which he he hath eſtabliſhed in the vegetable creation: ſo the ſeed of divine truth does not thrive in the heart of man by the power of the preacher, but by the ſilent and efficacious energy of the Spirit of God. Thus JESUS and his apoſtles, having preached the goſpel in the world, and taught the doctrines of true religion, they gave no commiſſion to any to uſe the terrors of fire and ſword to propagate them, but left it to the ſilent and ſecret influence of the Holy Spirit. And it is very probable that the bleſſed JESUS ſpoke this parable to convince the Jews of their miſtake, in ſuppoſing that their Meſſiah would ſet up a temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and advance his dominion by the means which are uſed in the world to riſe to ſovereign greatneſs: and alſo it might be intended to quiet the minds of his diſciples, and prevent them from being diſcouraged when they ſaw that an immediate and rapid ſucceſs did not attend their labours in the goſpel.</p>
               <p>THE next parable which JESUS ſpake to the multitude was that of the grain of muſtard ſeed, which in Paleſtine and other parts of the Eaſt, riſes from a ſmall ſeed to a large ſpreading tree. <hi>The kingdom of heaven,</hi> ſaid the divine Inſtructor, <hi>is like to a grain of muſtard ſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his field; which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds: but when it is grown, it is the greateſt among herbs, and becometh a tree, ſo that the birds of the air come
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029927_0090_0FE3368CBB775F98"/>
and lodge in the branches thereof.</hi> This may be conſidered as a continuation of the ſubject of the former parable; for though the goſpel ſeed may at firſt ſeem ſmall and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ariſing from the crucifixion of its divine author, the inveterate hatred and final unbelief of the Jews, the mortifying nature of its precepts, the weakneſs of the perſons employed to propagate its divine truths, and the ſmall number and meanneſs of thoſe who firſt received it; yet being founded on eternal truth, and ſupported by divine power, it would increaſe to a ſurpriſing extent and greatneſs, filling the whole world, and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine inſtruction and comfort to perſons of all nations, who ſhould enjoy the high privileges of the Meſſiah's kingdom, while the Jews, for their wickedneſs in oppoſing the truth, ſhould be left in unbelief, cut off from being a nation, and ſcattered like chaff over the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer then concluded his diſcourſe with another parable of nearly the ſame import with the foregoing. <hi>The kingdom of heaven,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole is leavened:</hi> alluding to the ſilent and effectual ſpreading of the goſpel, by the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit, and prevailing efficacy of divine truth.</p>
               <p>WHILE our Lord was employed in delivering theſe elegant and beautiful diſcourſes, his mother and brethren came a ſecond time, deſiring an interview with him: perhaps they were unwilling that he ſhould weary himſelf with the continual fatigue of preaching, and did not approve of his making himſelf ſo public, and appearing in ſo diſtinguiſhed a character amongſt ſuch vaſt multitudes of people: and as it hereafter will appear in the courſe of this hiſtory, that his brethren did not believe in him, it is very likely they deſigned to take him home with them, and perſuade him to attend to ſecular affairs. But our exalted Redeemer was not to be diverted from following his Father's work, and performing the great duties of his miſſion. On theſe grounds he appears to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the deſired interview, with this anſwer, <hi>My mother and my brethren are thoſe who bear the word of God, and do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EVENING now approaching, the bleſſed JESUS diſmiſſed the multitude, and retired with his diſciples to an houſe in Capernaum; where, at their deſire, he explained to them the parable of the tares of the field in the manner before related; and then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to deliver to them the parable of the treaſure hid in the field, and the parable of the pearl of great price. The firſt of theſe parables holds forth the abundant glory, excellency, and value of the goſpel, above all earthly poſſeſſions; and the laſt denotes the willingneſs of all thoſe who are made acquainted with the high excellency and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant worth of the goſpel, to part with their all in this world to obtain it. But, that the diſciples might be informed that a mixed multitude of people would make a profeſſion of the goſpel, and the hypocrites would be blended with the Chriſtians in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it would be difficult to ſeparate them, he compared the goſpel church to a net, which encloſed every ſort of fiſh, good and bad, but were carefully ſeparated when they were drawn to land; the good were preſerved, and the bad thrown away: alluding to the great day of univerſal and eternal deciſion and ſeparation, when the righteous will be received into life eternal, and the wicked caſt into hell.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having finiſhed theſe diſcourſes, he aſked his diſciples if they underſtood them, they anſwered in the affirmative; and our great Redeemer added that every teacher of the goſpel ought to reſemble a perſon whoſe houſe was completely furniſhed, and bringeth <hi>forth out of his treaſures things new and old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOT long after this, our great Redeemer left Capernaum, and repaired to Nazareth, the city where he had ſpent his younger years, and where he had dwelt with his relations
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029927_0091_0FE3368F0C61D0A8"/>
till he entered on his public miniſtry, and preached, amongſt his old friends and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, the glad-tidings of the kingdom. But they, though aſtoniſhed at his doctrine, could not overcome the prejudices they had formerly conceived againſt him, on account of the meanneſs of his family, and therefore would not own him to be the Meſſiah; they could not overcome the ſtrong national prejudice they had conceived againſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed deliverer's appearing in a low, mean condition in the world; nor could they give up their ideas of the glory and grandeur of the Meſſiah's appearance, ſo far as to ſuppoſe it poſſible that JESUS ſhould be the man. Our Lord, therefore, finding them in the ſame temper of mind as when he formerly viſited them, did not chooſe to ſtay long amongſt them, but departed and taught in the neighbouring villages.</p>
               <p>DURING our Saviour's ſtay at Nazareth, he ſent out his diſciples to preach in different parts of Galilee, and proclaim the glad-tidings that God was going to eſtabliſh the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdom of the Meſſiah, in which he would be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth; and that they might confirm the doctrines they taught, and convince the whole nation that they received their commiſſion from the Son of God, they were endowed with the power of working miracles. The evangeliſts have not informed us how long they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their preaching; but it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they ſpent a conſiderable time in carrying on their work in ſeveral parts of the country.</p>
               <p>THE people perceiving ſuch wonderful works performed by the diſciples of CHRIST, were exceedingly amazed, and their expectations were raiſed very high; for they could not recollect that the old prophets had ever given to their ſervants the power of working miracles, and of conſequence, they concluded that JESUS muſt be greater than any of them. This extraordinary circumſtance raiſed the attention of the nation, and ſpread his fame ſo effectually about the country, that it reached the ears of Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee. This prince having lately, in an unjuſt and cruel manner, taken away the life of John the Baptiſt, he heard of the mighty works performed by CHRIST, and his diſciples, with the utmoſt uneaſineſs and concern. His attendants endeavoured to diſſipate his fears, by telling him that one of the old prophets was riſen from the dead; but a conſciouſneſs of his guilt would not permit him to reſt; for he apprehended, that the illuſtrious perſon he had ſo baſely murdered, was riſen from the dead, and would doubtleſs be revenged on his murderer. He ſaid unto his ſervants, <hi>This is John the Baptiſt; he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT has been before related, on what occaſion, and in what manner the Baptiſt was put to death; and the news of this mournful event having reached the diſciples of CHRIST, while they were preaching in Galilee, thoſe of them who had formerly been the diſciples of John, went and paid their laſt reſpects to the remains of their maſter, whom having decently interred, they carried the tidings to JESUS. When our great Redeemer had heard of the death of his relation and forerunner, he found himſelf diſpoſed for retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſought the ſilent ſhades of the deſert of Bethſaida: he departed as private as poſſible, that he might not be incommoded by the multitude, and for the greater ſecrecy he went by ſea. But every precaution was inſufficient to ſcreen him from the penetrating eyes of the multitude who followed him; and his departure was not long concealed, for great numbers repaired to the deſert, and found out the place of his retreat. The miracles which he performed, the benefit which the helpleſs and miſerable, always found from his goodneſs, and the ſtrain of divine eloquence which flowed from his lips, had ſuch an effect on the honeſt, open-hearted part of the nation, that the multitudes who had ſeen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he performed, and heard his heavenly voice, thought no difficulties too great to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, no hardſhips too great to endure, nor no place too retired for them to penetrate, in order to attend on his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:029927_0092_0FE336908FB94C90"/>THE kind and compaſſionate Saviour of ſinners, ſeeing the multitude had found out his place of retreat, and beholding them crowding about him, he viewed them with tenderneſs and love, becauſe they were as ſheep having no ſhepherd; for, having none to inſtruct them in thoſe things which concerned their everlaſting peace, they wandered about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guide, without a defender. Their ſituation indeed, was like that of a large flock of ſheep wandering upon the mountains, without a ſhepherd to feed and defend them from the ravenous jaws of the various beaſts of prey which waited to devour them. The bleſſed JESUS, therefore, <hi>that good Shepherd, who came to lay down his life for the ſheep,</hi> beheld them with compaſſion: that ſame pity which brought him down from the throne of glory in heaven, for the ſake of his loſt and wandering ſheep, now brought him to this multitude of people: his heavenly goodneſs healed all the ſick amongſt them, and from his lips they heard the words of eternal life.</p>
               <p>THE divine Inſtructor continued his heavenly diſcourſes, and attended to the great work of healing the diſeaſed, not diſmiſſing the people, though the day wore away, and the ſhades of the evening were approaching. His diſciples, thinking this circumſtance had eſcaped his notice, thought proper to remind him, that the day was far advanced, and the place a ſolitary deſert, where neither food nor lodging could be procured: it would, therefore, be convenient to diſmiſs the people, that they might repair to the towns or villages on the borders of the wilderneſs, and provide themſelves food and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations; for they had nothing to eat. But our Lord informed them, that he did not intend to diſmiſs the ſurrounding multitude ſo haſtily, for, as they were weary and faint in the wilderneſs, it was his intention to give them a repaſt; at the ſame time, to try what opinion his diſciples entertained of his power, he turned to Philip, who was well acquainted with the country, and inquired, <hi>Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat?</hi> Philip, aſtoniſhed at the propoſal, conſidering the vaſtneſs of the multitude, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous quantity of proviſions which would be neceſſary to ſupply them, he apprehended it impoſſible to procure them in the deſert; and not conſidering his Maſter's power to ſupply them by extraordinary means, he replied, <hi>Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not ſufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord might juſtly on this, as on a future occaſion, have replied, <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and haſt thou not known me, Philip!</hi> But he did not reproach his diſciples with their inattention to his former character and conduct, but commanded them to give the multitude to eat. The diſciples, not yet underſtanding the deſign of their maſter, repeated the objection of Philip, and propoſed to go and buy a quantity of proviſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this was not their Lord's intention, who, without making them a direct anſwer, aſked them how many loves they had. It does not appear that they had any bread in poſſeſſion; for after the diſciples had made a diligent inquiry, Andrew came and informed his Maſter, that there was a lad amongſt the multitude, that had five barley loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes, a quantity ſo inconſiderable, that they were aſhamed to mention it: <hi>What are they,</hi> ſaid the diſciples, <hi>amongst ſo many?</hi> And what, indeed, would they have been among ſuch multitudes of people, if they had not been diſtributed by the all-creating hand of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>JESUS, notwithſtanding the ſmallneſs of the number of loaves, and ſcantineſs of the proviſion, ordered them to be brought to him; and at the ſame time commanded the multitude to ſit down on the graſs, and ordered his diſciples to arrange them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies at convenient diſtances, that their number might be aſcertained, and that they might be regularly ſerved. In obedience to his command, the people ſat down as they were ordered, no doubt wondering what would be the conſequence of ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, and what benevolent action our great Redeemer was about to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:029927_0093_0FE3369BC3AB6078"/>THE multitude thus ſeated in order, our Lord, in open view, took the five loaves and two ſmall fiſhes in his hands, and the whole multitude had an opportunity of beholding what a ſmall quantity of proviſions, in the hands of the Creator of all things, were ſufficient to provide a repaſt for ſuch a number of perſons as were then aſſembled. The great maſter of the feaſt then looked up to heaven, and returned thanks to his heavenly Father, for his all-preſerving and all-ſupporting goodneſs, manifeſted at all times to his creatures, but particularly for his paternal care, in providing for their preſent refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he praiſed his Almighty Father, for the miracles which he had been enabled to perform for the benefit of mankind, and particularly for that which he was now going to perform, for the refreſhment of the multitude, who had left their habitations with deſires to ſee his mighty works, and hear his words, and followed him into the deſert, where they were weary and faint for want of proviſions. After which, our great Redeemer bleſſed the bread, and his divine bleſſing had ſo wonderful an effect, that the five ſmall barley loaves and two dry fiſhes, were multiplied to a quantity ſufficient to ſatisfy the craving appetites of ten thouſand perſons; for the men were five thouſand, and it is very probable the women and children might not be leſs. The great Maſter of the feaſt diſtributed to his diſciples, and they ſerved the multitude as they ſat on the graſs; and ſo plentiful were the proviſions, that every one was ſatisfied, and ſuch fullneſs crowned our great Redeemer's board, that, when all the people had eat and were ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, there were twelve baſkets filled with the broken meat.</p>
               <p>THUS, the great Son of God, provided a feaſt in the deſert, for the people who followed him; and though they had no canopy but the azure ſky, no table but the verdant graſs, no better fare than barley-bread and dried fiſh, and no drink but the clear ſpring; yet they were more honoured by the preſence of the illuſtrious founder of the feaſt, than ever was a royal banquet, which was given by the Aſſyrian or Perſian kings; and doubtleſs there was more heart-felt joy, and ſolid ſatisfaction at this feaſt, than ever was at the noble banquet of the gorgeous Ahaſuerus, or the ſplendid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the imperious Belſhazzar.</p>
               <p>HAVE we not reaſon to wonder at the obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of the heads of the Jewiſh nation, that ſuch a manifeſt diſplay of divine power would not convince them. The account of this miracle, as recorded by the ſeveral evangeliſts, is very plain and circumſtantial; and, it may be obſerved, that the particular circumſtances of time and place, tended to make it more wonderful, more conſpicuous, and leſs, liable to objections and cavils. The place was a deſert, where no bread could be procured, and therefore, it is manifeſt, beyond contradiction, that it muſt be produced by a miracle. Had this repaſt been given to the ſurrounding multitude, at one of the towns or villages, it might have been objected, that bread had been ſecretly ſupplied: but neither the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees of thoſe days, nor the infidels of ours, can tell us, how it was poſſible for any deception of that kind to be practiſed in the deſert. And it may be further obſerved, that this mighty work was performed in the evening, when the people had been faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all day, and, with the fatigue of travelling were, doubtleſs weary and very hungry. Had this repaſt been given in the morning, the miracle might have been depreciated, by ſuppoſing, that the people did not ſtand in need of refreſhment, and this treat might have been repreſented as unneceſſary: but the particular circumſtances attending this wonderful work, cut off every ſhadow of an objection, and abundantly proved, that <hi>God can furniſh a table in the wilderneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE conſideration of the wonderful power of the Son of God, thus manifeſted in procuring bread in the wilderneſs for ſo many thouſands of people, ought to relieve the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029927_0094_0FE3369E0F4E9058"/>
cares, and quiet the minds of his people concerning their daily bread. With what joy and ſatisfaction of ſoul ought we to conſider, that we are under the immediate care of our heavenly Father, whoſe paternal goodneſs provides ſubſiſtence for all his creatures; and, <hi>who openeth his hand, and ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing.</hi> It is the beloved Son of the eternal Father, that ſhowers down ſuch a wide profuſion of bleſſings on a thankleſs world; and according to the beautiful language of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, "viſiteth the earth and bleſſeth it; who maketh it very plenteous, who watereth her furrows, and ſendeth rain into the little vallies thereof; who maketh it ſoft with ſhowers, and bleſſeth the increaſe thereof; who crowneth the year with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while his clouds drop fatneſs, making the vallies ſtand ſo thick with corn, that they laugh and ſing." With what thankfulneſs and praiſe ought we to behold the conſtant effects of that heavenly goodneſs, which ſupplies the whole creation with food: ought we not to rely on the paternal care of the great Parent of nature, who manifeſts his goodneſs, and diſplays his bounty to an undeſerving world, by <hi>giving them rain and fruitful ſeaſons, and filling their hearts with food and gladneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR ſhould we be unmindful of the manifeſt exertion of divine power, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupplies which are provided for a world of creatures, and in the abundant provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is made for the daily ſupply of all mankind. Is it any leſs a miracle, that the ſupreme Lord of univerſal nature, ſhould, every day, ſupport and feed the whole race of mankind, and all the brute creation, than that he ſhould feed ten thouſand perſons in the wilderneſs, with five loaves and two ſmall fiſhes? What proportion does ten thouſand perſons bear to all the myriads of men on the face of the earth, who are daily feed by its fruits? And is not the increaſe of thoſe fruits as great a miracle, and as manifeſt an exertion of divine power, as the increaſe of the bread by the bleſſing of our great Redeemer.</p>
               <p>IF we had hearts to conſider the works of God with attention and care, we ſhould perceive the manifeſt exertions of his power, in the ſecret operations of Nature, and as clear proofs of his divinity in her regular productions, as in the moſt extraordinary and miraculous events. The marks of divine power are equally ſeen in the wine, which ariſes from the moiſture of the earth, through the tubes of vegetation, and is received from the branches of the vine; as in that inſtantaneouſly made from water at the marriage at Cana. Nor ought they leſs to be regarded in the corn, gradually ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and made into bread for the ſupport of all mankind; than in the bread mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly bleſſed to the ſupport of the multitude in the wilderneſs: but we are very prone to overlook the common operations of creative wiſdom and power, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that, if we are unaffected with the divine munificence and bounty, ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly and richly diſplayed in the works of nature and providence, there is much reaſon to conclude, that outward miracles would not awaken us to a ſenſe of our duty, nor effectually mend our hearts: we are, however, very apt to deceive ourſelves in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and often led to conclude, that had we been preſent at ſo ſtupendous a miracle, as that we are now conſidering, we ſhould have adored the divine hand that wrought it, and never have forſaken the Lord of life. But, alas, if all the diſplay of divine wiſdom and goodneſs in the works of creation; if all the evidences of the omnipotence of the Son of God, in the conſtant ſupplies which he provides for his numerous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if the conſtant manifeſtations of his goodneſs to ourſelves, in providing for us, and feeding us the whole courſe of our lives; will not elevate our hearts, and raiſe them to himſelf in gratitude and joy, there is the higheſt reaſon to conclude, that, had we ſeen the bleſſed JESUS feed ten thouſand men, women, and children, with five loaves
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029927_0095_0FE3369F957028C0"/>
and two fiſhes; yea, had we been partakers ourſelves of this miraculous repaſt, we ſhould have been like many, who really enjoyed theſe privileges, yet, afterwards took offence at ſome of his words, which they called hard ſayings, and <hi>walked no more with him.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Multitudes, after having been miraculouſly fed in the Wilderneſs, attempt to take <hi>CHRIST</hi> by Force, and make him King: He ſhuns their Importunity by withdrawing himſelf from them: He walketh on the Sea to his Diſciples: He ſaves Peter, who deſired to accompany him, but was ſinking for want of Faith. <hi>CHRIST</hi> diſputes with the Jews in the Synagogue of Capernaum, and declareth himſelf to be the Bread of Life: He goes to Jeruſalum at the Paſſover; then returns to Galilee, and reproves the Phariſees for their Superſtition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHEN the wondering multitudes had partook of the miraculous banquet, prepared for them by our great Redeemer, a ſudden flow of gladneſs and elevation of mind ran through the deſert; every eye was fixed on the great Founder of the feaſt; every heart was glad, and every tongue reſounded his praiſe.</p>
               <p>AND now, being thoroughly convinced, that he was their promiſed Meſſiah, and having no notion of the reign of the Meſſiah, but that of his ſetting up a temporal kingdom, they reverenced him as the great deliverer of their nation, and ſtood determined, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to make him King, whether he conſented to it or not. Loud acclamations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded through the woods and wilds, and the voice of exultation and triumph ran along the ſide of the mountain where the miracle had been performed: the diſciples ſeemed to join with the multitude in their deſires, and every thing was preparing to proclaim him King.</p>
               <p>JESUS, to prevent the execution of their deſign, without their perceiving his intention, ſent his diſciples away in a boat, with orders to ſail to Bethſaida. The multitude were very willing to let the diſciples depart, when they ſaw that JESUS did not go with them; perhaps, they imagined, that the diſciples were ſent to provide ſuch things as were neceſſary againſt he aſſumed the kingdom; nor did they refuſe to diſperſe when our Lord diſmiſſed them, no doubt, deſigning to return in the morning; which, we find, was really the caſe.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus ſent the diſciples, and the multitude away, JESUS aſcended to the ſummit of the mountain alone, ſpending the night in heavenly contemplation, and ardent prayers to his almighty Father.</p>
               <p>BUT the diſciples meeting with a contrary wind, could not continue their courſe to Bethſaida, which lay about two leagues northward of the deſert mountain, where the multitude had been miraculouſly fed. They, however, did all in their power to land as near the city as poſſible: but a tempeſt ariſing they were toſſed all night in the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſea, without being able to make the deſired port. At the concluſion of the fourth watch, which was about five o'clock in the morning, they were advanced no further than about a league from the ſhore; they were toſſed by the foaming waves, and oppoſed in their courſe by the ſtormy wind; and, though they toiled hard, had no proſpect of reaching the place where they deſired to land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029927_0096_0FE336A11D6636F0"/>OUR Lord had, from the mountain, beheld the diſtreſs of his diſciples, and was now coming to their relief, though they had not the leaſt expectation of his preſence. Thus the Chriſtian, when ſtorms and tempeſts of trouble and affliction overtake him, is too prone to forget his almighty ſupport, and overlook the promiſe of his great deliverer: but, it would be well for him to remember, that the bleſſed JESUS beholds every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of his diſtreſs, and hath <hi>not forgotten to be gracious,</hi> but in his own time and way, will certainly appear in all his mightineſs to ſave and work out his deliverance. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that the time when human wiſdom fails, when our diſtreſſes and trouble ariſes to its higheſt pitch, when there appears no refuge, no help, no deliverer, then is the time for a God to manifeſt his divine power; and, at ſuch a time, he hath often been found to be nigh at hand, and hath brought deliverance to his people in the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and unexpected manner.</p>
               <p>THUS the diſciples, when toſſed by the mighty tempeſt, and in danger of being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the foaming ſeas, ſaw their divine maſter at a diſtance, walking upon the frothy ſurface of the mighty waters; they ſaw, but they knew him not: nor were they convinced by his nearer approach, but thinking they had ſeen an apparition, ſhrieked with fear. Their terrors, however, were ſoon at an end; with kind compaſſion, and condeſcending goodneſs, in his well known voice, the bleſſed JESUS diſpelled their fears with theſe words, <hi>Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</hi> No ſooner had our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer uttered theſe words, than every fear vaniſhed, and ſatisfaction and joy filled every heart. Peter was ſo elated with the ſight of his Maſter, and ſo overjoyed to ſee him walking on the ſea, that he felt in his mind a ſtrong deſire to accompany him; and, accordingly, begged his maſter to permit him to come upon the water.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer having, with condeſcending goodneſs, granted his requeſt, he left the boat, and walked on the ſurface of the ſea; and ſome time continued the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous courſe, wondering at himſelf, and rejoicing in the power of his maſter. But the ſtorm increaſed, the whiſtling winds roared around him, and the wild ſurges toſſed their raging heads on high, and daſhed about their foam; ſo that it was with the utmoſt difficulty that he kept on his feet. Peter was not ſo ſtrong as he imagined; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind forſook him; his faith failed; he forgot the preſence of his divine maſter, and he began to ſink in the mighty waters. In this extremity, he looked earneſtly for his divine ſupporter, and, upon the brink of being ſwallowed up, he cried, <hi>Lord ſave me!</hi> His kind, compaſſionate maſter, immediately relieved him; <hi>he ſtretched out his hand and caught him;</hi> at the ſame time, gently rebuking his ſtaggering reſolution and wavering faith, he ſaid unto him, <hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE caſe of Peter ſhould be a ſtanding warning to the Chriſtian, and excite him to be very cautious of putting a vain confidence in his own ſtrength. Peter thought that he could endure all things in the company of his maſter, and, while he felt his heart warm, he ſuppoſed that his reſolution and courage would bear him above every fear. But on this, as well as on a future occaſion, which will hereafter be remarked, he found himſelf miſtaken. When he perceived the ſtorm to increaſe, and foaming billows rage more horribly than before, his fears ſuggeſted, that either his maſter would be unable or unwilling to ſupport him amidſt the furious blaſts of the tempeſt. He had, on various occaſions, beheld the divine power and goodneſs of his maſter, and his fears were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and he was juſtly to be blamed; becauſe the ſame power which had before been ſo fully manifeſted, and which now had enabled him to walk on the ſea, was able to ſupport him there, notwithſtanding all the horrors of the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:029927_0097_0FE337F7B2E74BB8"/>PETER might have reaſoned thus, had he been in his right mind; but his fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, his courage and reſolution, which he depended ſo much upon, forſook him, and he began to ſink. Thus the Chriſtian, when he enjoys the preſence of his Saviour, thinks that he can <hi>endure all things;</hi> and concludes, that <hi>his mountain ſtands ſtrong, and he ſhall never be moved:</hi> but, when affliction and trouble ariſe, he has a very different view of things; when great dangers are before him, and the boiſterous waves of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vexation, and diſtreſs, roar around him, he is very prone to be diſheartened, and to think, that he ſhall certainly be ſwallowed up, that God hath forſaken him, and will be favourable no more. Such are too often his ſentiments, and, if the divine hand of his Saviour did not hold him out, he would, like Peter, ſink in the mighty water.</p>
               <p>THIS miracle of our exalted Redeemer's walking on the ſea, ſeems to have aſtoniſhed the diſciples, more than any which had been before it; for though they had ſo lately ſeen the miracle of feeding the multitude with five loaves, it did not appear to have ſuch an effect on their minds, as this laſt manifeſtation of his divine power; for now, with the utmoſt veneration, gratitude, and joy, they <hi>came and worſhipped him, ſaying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR was walking on the ſea, the only miracle which our Redeemer wrought at this time; for we are informed by the evangeliſts, that as ſoon as their almighty maſter, and his relieved diſciple, were received into the ſhip, the veſſel was inſtantaneouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to its intended port. <hi>Then they willingly received him into the ſhip; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the ſhip was at the land whither they went.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was in the country adjacent to Capernaum, that our great Redeemer landed; and, as he had not been in that neighbourhood ſince his viſiting Nazareth, the country people flocked about him in great numbers, bringing their ſick and diſeaſed, which the divine phyſician immediately healed: and, as it had been a conſiderable time ſince he had been in that country, they crowded around him in ſuch numbers, that he could not pay a particular attention to every object of diſtreſs; but they had ſo great an opinion of the healing virtue, which he ſo eminently poſſeſſed, that they beſeeched him, <hi>that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made perfectly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT hath been before related, that after CHRIST had fed the multitude in the deſert, he diſmiſſed them; but, though they diſperſed at his command, they did not return to their habitations: for, perceiving that the diſciples were ſent to the other ſide of the lake, and that JESUS ſtayed behind, they probably concluded, that they were ſent to provide neceſſaries for their maſter's aſſuming the kingdom; though he had modeſtly declined that high dignity in the evening, they were encouraged to hope, that he would accept of it the enſuing day. This expectation, it may be ſuppoſed, induced them to lodge in the ſolitary wilderneſs, and ſhelter themſelves in caverns of the rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, though they were very much incommoded by the raging of the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>WHEN morning arrived, the multitude left the places of their retreat, and ſearched for our Redeemer in every part of the deſert mountain: they ſaw him aſcend to the ſummit the foregoing evening, and were very much ſurpriſed that he could not be found; but having wearied themſelves in an unſucceſsful ſearch, they probably concluded that he had departed in ſome boat which belonged to the ſea of Tiberius, that had been forced by the ſtorm to take ſhelter in ſome creek, at the foot of the mountain. With this expectation, they departed to Capernaum, where they found him in the Synagogue, teaching the people; and, with a mixture of joy and ſurpriſe, aſked him, <hi>Rabbi, when
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029927_0098_0FE30EB293D915D0"/>
comeſt thou hither?</hi> To this queſtion, our great Redeemer anſwered, that they did not follow him becauſe they were convinced by his miracles of the truth of his divinity, but becauſe they had been miraculouſly fed: <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye ſeek me, not becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</hi> Hereby our great Redeemer intimated, that their views in following him were low, ſelfiſh, and ſordid, and far below what might be expected from the Meſſiah's kingdom. Food for the body is of ſmall conſequence, when compared with thoſe bleſſings which promote the welfare of the immortal ſoul. It was not mere animal food which the Son of God came down from heaven to beſtow, but that divine wiſdom and grace which would lead the immortal mind in the paths of eternal happineſs; and, therefore, he exhorted them not to follow him for common food, but for that meat which endureth to everlaſting life. <hi>Labour not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the ſon of man ſhall give unto you: for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews, if they had attentively conſidered the writings of their prophets, where divine wiſdom and knowledge are frequently held forth, under the metaphors of meat and drink, might eaſily have underſtood what our Saviour meant by <hi>the meat which endureth unto everlaſting life.</hi> But their popular notions of a temporal dominion, led them into the idea of ſome corporeal food, which the Meſſiah would give them to enable them to purſue the deſigns, and eſtabliſh the glories of his kingdom. It is, therefore, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they aſked him, what they ſhould do to erect the Meſſiah's kingdom, and obtain that wonderful bread, which, he ſaid, God had commiſſioned him to beſtow.</p>
               <p>THE minds of the Jews were filled with vaſt conceptions of the ſplendour and glory of the Meſſiah's reign; as they expected that CHRIST was about to eſtabliſh his great empire, doubtleſs they imagined he would have given proper directions for their riſing againſt, and oppoſing the Roman power, as the firſt ſtep towards raiſing that dominion which had been ſo long promiſed to their nation. But our great Redeemer, to convince them of their miſtake, and inform them what God really required of them, in order to erect the Meſſiah's kingdom, told them, that the way to obtain favour of the God of Iſrael, was to believe in the perſon whom he had ſent. The Jews were exceedingly offended at this unexpected anſwer, and ſeemed determined not to receive CHRIST as their Meſſiah, becauſe he declined all means of eſtabliſhing a temporal kingdom: as, therefore, he appeared in a character ſo contrary to their expectations of the manifeſtation of the Meſſiah, they required him to produce ſome ſigns, which might demonſtrate that he was greater than Moſes, or any of the old prophets. As to the miracle of feeding the multitude, they ſuppoſed, that ſuch a pre-eminency could not be gathered from thence, becauſe Moſes had fed their whole nation with manna in the wilderneſs, which, they inſinuated, was a greater miracle than CHRIST's feeding ten thouſand perſons in the wilderneſs. <hi>What ſign ſheweth thou then,</hi> ſaid they unto him, <hi>that we may ſee, and believe thee? What doſt thou work? Our fathers did eat manna in the deſert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</hi> To this objection, our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE manna which ſuſtained the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs, was not the production of Moſes, but the gift of God; it was not ſent as an evidence of Moſes, being a great prophet, but was intended to carry on the deſigns of divine providence, in the ſupport of that peculiar people, and to be an emblem, or repreſentation of that true ſpiritual, heavenly bread, which God hath given for the ſpiritual life of all who believe in his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:029927_0099_0FE336AB4E2C8270"/>SOME of the audience, who had liſtened with great pleaſure, to the deſcription which our Lord had given of the coeleſtial bread, were poſſeſſed with an careſt deſire to be partakers of ſo great a bleſſing: and immediately cried out, <hi>Lord, evermore give us this bread.</hi> To which, the divine Inſtructor replied, <hi>I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> But, continued our great Redeemer, as I have often ſaid, your nation obſtinately and reſolutely reſiſts the light, and continues in unbelief, notwithſtanding the manifeſt and glaring evidences of divine power, which you have ſeen, and the glorious fruits which would follow on your believing; but think not, that your unbelief will prevent the riſing glories of my ſpiritual kingdom; for many there are which my father hath given me, theſe ſhall be induced by the power of his ſpirit to come unto me, <hi>and him that cometh, I will in no wiſe caſt out: for I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the Father's will which hath ſent, that, of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day. And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS the greateſt part of the Jews were deſirous only of temporal privileges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from the Meſſiah's kingdom, it is no wonder they ſhould be offended at this doctrine; they could not bear the thought, that a man who declined all earthly honours, ſhould be ſuppoſed to be the Meſſiah: nor could they tell what he meant by calling himſelf the bread of life, and aſſerting, that he came down from heaven. With mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and diſcontent, therefore, they haſtily exclaimed, <hi>Is not this Jeſus, the ſon of Joſeph, whoſe father and mother we know? How is it then that he ſaith, I came down from heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO theſe degrading expreſſions, our Lord thought fit to reply, that no objections ariſing from the meanneſs of his birth and education, could invalidate the teſtimony of the miracles which he had wraught, or excuſe their obſtinacy and unbelief. But it was not ſtrange, that they ſhould oppoſe and reſiſt the truth, for it required the agency of divine power to teach them to underſtand what he meant by declaring himſelf the bread of life: and alſo it muſt be the mighty power of God, which enabled them to receive him, and live upon him as ſuch. A believing in the Son of God, as the only Saviour of ſinners, and reſting upon him for life and ſalvation, and thereby partaking of the divine nature, and receiving ſpiritual nouriſhment from him, as the body does from corporeal bread, was not within the reach of the natural abilities of the unbelieving Jews, nor any of the human race, without divine aſſiſtance; and, therefore, our Lord told them, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> And he further proceeded to inform them, that it was related in their prophets, concerning the kingdom of the Meſſiah, that all the ſubjects of that kingdom ſhould be taught of God, <hi>Every man, therefore, that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> But, continued our great Redeemer, you are not to ſuppoſe, that men will be ſo favoured as to ſee God with their corporeal eyes; <hi>for him none hath ſeen, or can ſee:</hi> but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory of that kingdom will conſiſt in believing on me, in ſuch a manner as to receive me as the true bread of life: by this the believer will obtain a vital union with me, and draw ſpiritual nouriſhment from me; and, by that means, grow up to everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord, having thus declared himſelf to be the bread of life, which came down from heaven, and ſhewn the way in which it is to be obtained, proceeded to examine the compariſon between himſelf, conſidered as the bread from heaven, and the manna,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029927_0100_0FE336ACE5A45E28"/>
which, in the time of Moſes, the Iſraelites eat in the wilderneſs. <hi>Your fathers,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>did eat manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my fleſh, which I will give for the life if the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH the Jews were no ſtrangers to a figurative way of ſpeaking, yet ſuch was their blindneſs and perverſeneſs, that they underſtood thoſe words, and the reſt of CHRIST's declaration, in a literal ſenſe, and inquired, with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But our Lord, knowing what manner of perſons he was converſing with, did not think proper to explain his meaning in any other way of ſpeaking; but continuing in the ſame figurative way of expreſſion, he repeated, and affirmed what he had before aſſerted, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed;</hi> meaning, that no perſon can obtain that eternal life, which the goſpel of CHRIST makes known, but by a vital faith, which receives the Son of God, and, partaking of his divine nature, draws ſpiritual nouriſhment and life from him. 'He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.'</p>
               <p>OUR Lord proceeded to inform them, that this is the bread which he had before told them came down from heaven, infinitely ſuperior, in its nature and conſequences, to that bread which their fathers eat in the wilderneſs; 'for they eat the manna and are dead; but whoſo eateth this bread ſhall live for ever.'</p>
               <p>SUCH was the conference which our Saviour had with the Jews, in the Synagogue at Capernaum, which took its riſe from the miraculous repaſt which he had ſo lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the multitude in the deſert, and thence naturally turned on bread. Though the Jews were no ſtrangers to a figurative way of ſpeaking, and might have found the ſame mode of expreſſion in their own prophets, yet they had no clear idea of his meaning, eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, they ſtill underſtood literally; and, as it was a thing prohibited in the law of Moſes, and abhorred by the moſt barbarous nations, they looked upon it with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment and averſion; and many of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, with a mixture of diſſatisfaction and ſurpriſe, ſaid, <hi>This is a hard ſaying; who can hear it?</hi> Our Lord, perceiving their diſcontent, ſaid, Are ye offended becauſe I told you my fleſh was meat, and my blood was drink; what would you think if you ſaw <hi>the Son of man aſcend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life.</hi> Thus, our Lord further explained the meaning of what he had before advanced; as much as if he had ſaid, When you ſee me aſcend with this body into heaven, you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I really deſcended from thence; and you will alſo perceive that you cannot eat my fleſh, or drink my blood in a corporeal manner; I never intended you ſhould think my words had any ſuch meaning: my fleſh in ſuch caſe, could not be of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Sons of men; but the great bleſſings I have been relating, ariſe from receiving the doctrines I preach; to reveal theſe, I laid aſide the glory which I had with my Father; I took upon me the veil of fleſh, and aſſumed the nature of man: it is, therefore, entering into the ſpirit of theſe doctrines, which will bring you to eternal

life; but I know your hearts are ſo wicked, and your prejudices ſo ſtrong, that you will not receive them; nor am I diſappointed in you; for, I have told you before, that <hi>no man can come unto me, except it be given him of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews were ſo puzzled, confounded and offended at this diſcourſe, that many who had profeſſed themſelves the diſciples of CHRIST, departed out of the ſynagogue, and followed him no more. They did not underſtand his views, nor like his method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; nor could they perceive how a temporal kingdom, that idol of Jewiſh vanity, was likely at this rate to be eſtabliſhed: and, therefore, they could no longer acknowledge JESUS to be the Meſſiah, whoſe appearance and reign they expected ſo vaſtly different.</p>
               <p>WHEN the Jews were departed, our Lord turned himſelf to his diſciples, with benignity of countenance, and with an air of condeſcending goodneſs, bid them remark how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading and ſhameful it was for the ſons of men, to conſider, and reflect, on the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obſtinacy of the unbelieving Jews; who thought themſelves offended, and made it a crime, for aſſerting and ſpreading ſuch divine, immutable truths, and knowledge, to which <hi>they deafened their ears,</hi> and which affected ſo materially their future welfare and tranquility. Divine truths! demonſtrated to them in ſupernatural miracles, heavenly goodneſs, and by the fulfilments of the predictions of the ancient prophets, out of all probability of doubt, if they would only reflect and conſider on the ſacred writings, and how inconſiſtent it ought to appear to all, who were not blinded, nor led aſtray by evil-minded men, nor over fond of following implicitly, without conſidering the manifeſt contradictions, and abſurdities contained in the dogmas of their Elders; whom they themſelves deſpiſed, by performing the leaſt, and neglecting the moſt material rites which they contained.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Redeemer added, that by ſuch an ungrateful conduct towards his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, they rendered themſelves unworthy to partake the bleſſings ariſing from his divine and ſpiritual kingdom, to which they turned their hearts, in defiance to the precepts and examples of the Son of Man; delighting in iniquity and walking in darkneſs; preferring the works of feeble men, to the paths of his heavenly kingdom, turning their hearts againſt his miniſtry, by entertaining ſuch notions of the Meſſiah's temporal kingdom, ſo inconſiſtent with the divine will of his heavenly Father; but that the time will come, when, convinced of their iniquitous proceedings, they ſhould atone for their tranſgreſſions, and the power of the Son of man will be fully known. Adding, alſo, that becauſe he permitted his diſciples to eat with unwaſhen hands, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tradition of the elders, by which the Phariſees explained the law of Moſes. Several inſtances of legal uncleanneſs were particularly ſtated, and forbidden by the Jewiſh legiſlature; but theſe, and other cerimonial performances, were multiplied in the moſt extravagant and ridiculous manner in thoſe traditions, which were held in ſuch high veneration by the Phariſees. Theſe people, who valued themſelves on an exact and ſcrupulous performance of every title of the law, conſidered it as a notorious offence to eat bread with unwaſhen hands, though at the ſame time, they were ſcandalouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in things of the higheſt importance.</p>
               <p>TO ſhew the ſtupidity and folly of this conduct, our Lord anſwered the queſtion of the Phariſees, by retorting on them the wickedneſs of their conduct in a ſcrupulous exactneſs and punctuality, in the obſervance of human traditions, and, at the ſame time, neglecting the poſitive commands of God. <hi>Why do you alſo,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>tranſgreſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, ſaying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curſeth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029927_0102_0FE336AFF1B84198"/>
to his father or his mother, it is a gift, by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me:</hi> that is, whatever I might have ſpared for the relief of my parents, I have dedicated to God, and thus ſuffers his parents to want, <hi>not honouring his father and mother, he ſhall be free.</hi> Thus have you, continued our great Redeemer, ſet aſide the immutable duties of natural religion, and dared to oppoſe and contradict the poſitive commandments of God, by your ridiculous and contemptible traditions: <hi>ye hypocrites,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>well did Iſaias propheſy of you, ſaying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they worſhip me, preaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having thus ſharply rebuked the Phariſees, he turned to the people and explained to them the nature of the argument, and deſired them to reflect on the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſees. <hi>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man,</hi> ſaid he; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the common ſenſe and underſtanding of mankind, for the apparent truth of this obſervation, deſiring them to judge what contemptible hypocrites thoſe perſons muſt be, who could profeſſedly neglect the great duties of morality, which are of univerſal and eternal obligations, and at the ſame time, value themſelves on the exact and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous performance of ſuch a trifle as waſhing of hands.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees were highly offended at our Lord, becauſe he ſpake in a degrading manner of their traditions, of which, having complained with ſome warmth, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came and informed their maſter. JESUS replied, that they need not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any pain about the offence which that ſet of men had taken at his words, nor need they be afraid of their anger; for both themſelves and their doctrine would ſoon be deſtroyed, for neither of them were of God. <hi>Every plant,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which my heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, they ſhall both fall into the ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the diſciples themſelves did not fully underſtand, nor were they entirely ſatisfied with his doctrine; and Peter having deſired his Lord to explain it to them, the divine inſtructor proceeded to inform them, that meats being of a corporeal nature, could not defile the ſpirit of a man, or render him polluted in the ſight of God: no real guilt can be contracted this way, except the meats are uſed to exceſs, or in direct contradiction to the command of God; and then the pollution proceeds from the man, who ſuffers himſelf to be prevailed on to tranſgreſs a poſitive command, and not from the meat, which, as the good creature of God, is lawful to be received. Thus, that which entereth in at the mouth, doth not defile the man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a wicked heart, ſuch as <hi>evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſs, blaſphemies: theſe are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwaſhen hands, defileth not a man.</hi> Diſcourſes like theſe, could not fail of exceedingly offending the proud, ſelf-conceited Phariſees, and raiſing their reſentment to its higheſt pitch: for theſe, and ſuch like obſervations of our Lord, tended to ſtrip them of that outſide ſhew of ſanctity and ſuperior ſtrictneſs, with which they ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe diſcourſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the general oppoſition the proud Phariſees met with from the Son of God, excited them, with the utmoſt pride and envy, not only to oppoſe his doctrine and degrade his miracles, but to attack his reputation, and plot againſt his life. Our great Redeemer thought it unneceſſary to continue the conteſt with ſuch hardened hypocrites, and determined oppoſers of the truth, and immediately departed out of the country.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>JESUS,</hi> at the repeated Requeſt of the Wowan of Canaan, cures her daughter: Reſtores the Faculty of Speech to a dumb Man at Decapolis: Miraculouſly feeds the Multitude a ſecond Time in the Deſert: Warmly exhorts his Diſciples to beware of the Leaven of the Scribes and Phariſees: Reſtores Sight to a blind Man, near the City of Bethſaida: After which, he departs into the Towns of Caeſarea-Philippi, where he approves and commends the Faith of Peter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Lord of life having departed from Galilee, to evade the cruel and malicious deſigns of the Phariſees, he retired to the borders of Paleſtine, and approached near to thoſe two famous maritime cities Tyre and Sidon: but ſo great was the veneration of the common people, ſuch the fame he had acquired by his kind and beneficent actions, and ſo many the benefits which multitudes had received from his all-healing goodneſs, it was not poſſible he ſhould be concealed. And though he was ſo famous in the land of Iſarel.</p>
               <p>THE firſt, amongſt the inhabitants of theſe Heathen cities, which implored the aſſiſtance of the Son of God, was an unhappy parent, whoſe only daughter had an unclean ſpirit, and was <hi>grieveouſly vexed with a devil.</hi> Various were the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lay in the way of the afflicted matron; ſhe was a Canaanite, one of that deteſted race with which the Jews would have no dealings, and with whom they diſdained to converſe, and had every reaſon to fear, that her petition would be diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one of the moſt eminent of the ſons of Iſrael; but, notwithſtanding all theſe circumſtances, ſhe, as an humble petitioner, threw herſelf upon the tender mercies of the benevolent Son of God: ſtrong neceſſity urged her on, grief and growing diſtreſs cauſed her to be importunate; ſuch dreadful ſorrow, ſuch preſſing diſtreſs ſurrounded her, it is no wonder that ſhe would take no denial, but purſued, with repeated petitions, the only perſon who was able to help. Accordingly, in the deepeſt humility of mind, with the moſt reſpectful reverence and ſubmiſſion, and the moſt ardent, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and powerful addreſs, ſhe came and fell at the feet of our great Redeemer; ſhe beſought him, and cried, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David.</hi> The earneſtneſs of this woman's petition, and her calling our Lord the <hi>Son of David,</hi> plainly indicate, that ſhe believed him to be the Meſſiah; ſhe ſeems to have received that faith, which was always honoured by the Son of God, and always recommended the perſons who poſſeſſed it, to his firſt regard; and one would have expected, that ſuch a petition would not have been rejected by that bountiful and merciful Redeemer, who <hi>went about doing good,</hi> and who kindly invited the weary and heavy-laden, to come to him with the promiſe of relief.</p>
               <p>THIS woman, being a native of Syrophoenicia, was, no doubt, educated in all the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous ſuperſtition of the Greeks; but had been enabled to believe in the Son of God, and earneſtly and vehemently to apply to him for relief. And there is no reaſon to doubt, but that divine Perſon, who had enabled her to believe his ability to heal her daughter, and thus, with all her heart and ſoul, to implore his aſſiſtance, beheld her with an eye of tender pity, and ſtood determined to grant her requeſt.</p>
               <p>BUT we find, that our Lord did not think proper to let her know his intentions towards her at firſt. He made no reply to her petition, nor did he ſeem to take the leaſt notice, either of her, or her diſtreſs; but this ſilence, and ſeeming diſregard, did
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029927_0104_0FE336BE9D560668"/>
not intimidate her ſo far as to induce her to deſiſt; but excited her to preſs her petition with the more earneſtneſs. She continued her cries with a vehemence which would take no denial, till the diſciples were affected with her grief, and became her advocates; and they, however ſtrongly they had imbibed the prejudices of their nation, againſt the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſought their Maſter to diſmiſs this troubleſome petitioner, to grant her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſend her away.</p>
               <p>BUT JESUS ſoon ſilenced his diſciples, with an anſwer agreeable to their own preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> To this, the whole train readily aſſented; they had an high opinion of the peculiar privileges and high prerogatives of the Jews, and looked upon the Gentiles as abſolutely unclean, and unworthy of the leaſt favour from the God of Iſrael: ſo that they were entirely ſatisfied with this anſwer, and urged the matter no further.</p>
               <p>But the woman herſelf was not ſo eaſily prevailed on to give up her requeſt: it was her own cauſe; ſhe had no hopes of relief from any other quarter; and that divine power which had wrought faith in her heart, and given her a full perſuaſion, that J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>SUS was the Meſſiah, and able to help her, had alſo given her ſtrength and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in her requeſt. She took ſome encouragement, from obſerving herſelf the ſubject of converſation between CHRIST and his diſciples, and, though conſcious of her unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to approach ſo illuſtrious a perſon, yet fully convinced of his divinity, ſhe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, and prayed, <hi>Lord, help me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord now condeſcended to ſpeak to this humble and earneſt petitioner: but his words were ſeemingly ſufficient to have diſcouraged every future attempt; and though ſhe had conceived ſo high an opinion of the perſon and condeſcending goodneſs of our Lord, his reply ſeems ſufficient to have inſpired her with bitter diſlike and averſion. 'It is not meet,' ſaid he, 'to take the childrens' bread, and to caſt it to dogs.' Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that the Jews were the children of God, to whom all the privileges and bleſſings of the covenant of Abraham belonged; and, as the Gentiles were vile and contemptible, they could not expect to ſhare thoſe bleſſings with the ſons of Iſrael. This anſwer, however ſevere, did but ſpeak the language of the petitioner's humility, and therefore, it did not excite her reſentment, or cauſe her to go murmuring away; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the juſtice of his remark, ſhe meekly replied: 'Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their maſter's table.' Thus, continuing the ſimilitude which our Lord had laid down, ſhe artfully introduced her own caſe, and beautifully and meekly urged her petition, at a time when, it might have been expected, ſhe would have declined it with murmuring reſentment.</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour, having thus given the woman an opportunity of manifeſting the ſtrength and ſteadineſs of her faith, and declaring what juſt notions ſhe had of her own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and the power and goodneſs of our great Redeemer, he now beheld her with a gracious ſmile, commending her faith, and wrought the cure which ſhe had ſo warmly and ſucceſsfully ſolicited in behalf of her daughter; 'O woman,' ſaid he, 'great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt.' Theſe gracious words were no ſooner ſpoken, than the great event followed; and the affectionate parent had reaſon to rejoice, for 'her daughter was made whole from that very hour.'</p>

however impoſſible it might ſeem to us, that our comfort ſhould be reſtored; yet there is the higheſt encouragement to ſeek to that great Perſon, who is mighty to ſave, and in his own time and way, will deliver all that commit their caſe to him, that believe in his name, and come to him for deliverance. Nor ought we to be diſcouraged by the moſt humbling views which we may have of our own unworthineſs: the Syrophoenician wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was an Heathen and an idolater, but yet ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not prevented by thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from imploring the pity of the Son of God: ſhe ſought it perſeveringly, and ſhe found it. Thus, how loſt ſoever we may ſuppoſe our condition to be, how deſperate ſoever our caſe, we ought not to deſpair: the moſt humbling and abaſing ſenſe of our unworthineſs, ought not to keep us from the great Saviour of ſinners, but rather urge us to follow him with our petitions, and ardently and vehemently implore his relief.</p>
               <p>AND further, from the ſucceſs of this afflicted parent, we may be excited to perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in our petitions, though we do not meet with the deſired relief, after a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in our ſupplications: the perſon whoſe caſe we are conſidering for ſome time met with no anſwer, and was afterwards repeatedly denied; but ſtill ſhe perſiſted, and at laſt prevailed: ſo, though the Lord ſtands at a diſtance from us, leaves us to our ſorrows, and does not anſwer our prayers in the time, or the way we might expect; ſtill we are encouraged to continue our addreſs: he is not offended at our importunity, he is not angry at our wants, nor weary of our cries; but the language of his words is, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint. Nor ought we to be weary of this pious practice though the Lord may ſeem to deny our requeſt; though inſtead of removing our affliction and deſtreſs by his gracious ſmiles, he ſeems to frown upon us, and lays freſh burdens on our ſouls; though, at the time when we expected delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we meet with new diſtreſſes; and, though the Lord follows us with ſtroke after ſtroke, and lays one affliction upon another; ſtill we ought to continue our petitions, to lay them at his feet, to take no reſt till he anſwers our prayers, and to determine, that we will not let him go until he bleſs us. And we may reſt aſſured that whoſoever is enabled, like the Canaanitiſh woman, thus ardently, vehemently, humbly, and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to continue their ſupplications to the Son of God, will ſooner or later, like her, find the deſired relief.</p>
               <p>JESUS being returned from the coaſts of Tyre and Sidon, and taking a tour through the region of Decapolis, a man was brought to him who was deaf and dumb. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Phyſician was always ready to relieve ſuch objects of affliction and diſtreſs as applied to him: but, as the multitude thronged about him, expecting he would ſoon ſet up his kingdom, he thought proper to take the diſeaſed perſon and his relations aſide from the throng; he then put his fingers in his ears, and touched his tongue, that the deaf man, who could not be informed by language, might mark the great perſon who was his benefactor. He then <hi>looked up to heaven, and ſighed, and ſaid unto him, Epha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, that is, Be opened: and ſtraightway his ears were opened, and the ſtring of his tongue was looſed, and he ſpake plain. And he charged them, that they ſhould tell no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS injunction, however, was very little regarded; for, the man and his relations were ſo elated with the benefit they had received, and the miraculous manner in which that benefit had been conferred, their hearts were ſo full of gratitude to the great perſon from whom this unſpeakable favour had been received, that they publiſhed it in every part of the country; doubtleſs, thinking they could not be too laviſh in the praiſes of ſo great a benefactor, eſpecially as the modeſty in which he performed the miracles, fully manifeſted the uprightneſs of his intentions, and ſhewed, that he did not aim at popular applauſe, but only ſought after the real benefit of mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:029927_0106_0FE336C1A7931E68"/>THE vaſt crowds that gathered about our exalted Redeemer, were ſuch as it was a trouble to bear: he, therefore, to avoid ſuch prodigious numbers of people as the fame of his miracles had brought together, retired to a deſert mountain near the ſea of Galilee. But the ſolitary ſhades of the widlderneſs could not long conceal the great Benefactor of the human race: multitudes who were related to helpleſs objects of diſtreſs, ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the place of his retreat, and brought to him from all quarters, the ſick, the lame, the blind, the dumb, and the maimed. The compaſſionate Saviour of ſinners was moved at the ſight of ſo many piteous objects; he graciouſly releaſed them from their ſeveral complaints, and reſtored them to health and ſtrength. Miracles like theſe could not fail of exciting the veneration and wonder of the numerous ſpectators: but above all, the reſtoring the dumb to the faculty of ſpeech filled the beholders with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, it muſt be obſerved, that he not only conferred on theſe perſons the faculty of hearing, and pronouncing ſounds, but inſtantaneouſly conveyed into their minds, the whole language of their country: they were inſtantly acquainted with the various words it contained, their ſignifications, their forms, their powers, and their uſes, and, at once acquired the habit of ſpeaking properly and fluently. This ſurely was ſufficient to have convinced the moſt ignorant and ſtupid of the human race, that ſuch works could be effected by nothing leſs than the mighty power of God; and, we are informed, that <hi>the multitude wondered when they ſaw the dumb to ſpeak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to ſee, and they glorified the God of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE attending to the various cures our great Redeemer performed, detained the multitude three days in the deſert; during which time, they had conſumed all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which they brought along with them into this ſolitary retreat: no refreſhment was to be procured in the deſert, and the kind, compaſſionate JESUS would not ſend them away faſting, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WITH this view, our exalted Saviour called his diſciples unto him, and ſaid, <hi>I have compaſſion on the multitude, becauſe they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I will not ſend them away faſting, leſt they faint by the way.</hi> The diſciples, thought they had lately had ſo plain a manifeſtation of divine power on a like occaſion, ſeemed to wonder at the propoſal: <hi>Whence,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſhould we have ſo much bread in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to fill ſo great a multitude?</hi> Their divine Maſter did not rebuke them for their unbelief, but calmly aſked them, <hi>How many loaves have ye?</hi> To which they replied, <hi>Seven, and a few ſmall fiſhes.</hi> Our great Redeemer then <hi>comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he took the ſeven loaves, and the fiſhes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his diſciples, and the diſciples to the multitude; and they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up the broken meat that was left, ſeven baſkets full. And they that did eat, were four thouſand men, beſides women and children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is not unworthy of remark, that the bleſſed JESUS, during the courſe of his public miniſtry, very frequently wrought his wonderful works, and publiſhed his divine diſcourſes in the ſilent retreats of the wilderneſs, and the ſolitary ſhades of the deſert. Here he was followed by great numbers, who were diſeaſed either in body or mind, and who came after him with a ſincere deſire of receiving benefit, either from the miraculous powers of healing which he poſſeſſed, or from the heavenly doctrines which he taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, were not ſincerely deſirous of receiving inſtruction, would endure the hardſhips to which they were frequently expoſed in the wilderneſs, where they were ſometimes two or three days without food: ſo that we may obſerve the wiſdom of our great Redeemer,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029927_0107_0FE336CF9B3AB7E8"/>
who took this method to collect together, the honeſt, plain-hearted part of the nation, who were more likely to be affected with his miracles, and profit by his inſtructions, than the proud rulers of the people, or the haughty and opulent inhabitants of the crowded cities, and it may be further remarked, that our heavenly Inſtructor choſe theſe deſert places and obſcure retreats, that he might have the opportunity of conveying his divine doctrines to the perſons whoſe hearts were prepared to receive them, without oppoſition from the proud ſelf-conceited Scribes and Phariſees. How happy were people, who thus ſat under the divine inſtructions of the Son of God! who left the buſy, buſtling ſcenes of folly and diſſipation in the crowded city, and retired to the ſilent and ſolitary ſhades of the deſert, to attend to thoſe things which concerned their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace; thus exchanging the loud roar of laughter and folly, for the calm dictates of eternal wiſdom; and, giving up the <hi>bread that periſheth,</hi> for that <hi>which endureth to everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER having miraculouſly fed the multitude, JESUS departed to the territory of Magdala, and appeared in a province of that country, called Dalmanutha. The Phariſees, having heard that he had again fed the multitude, followed him there; for they feared that the common people would be convinced by his miracles, and acknowledge him to be the Meſſiah; and they were determined to oppoſe him with all their might, and openly and publicly confute whatever he advanced, with a view to prevent the nation from owning him under that character.</p>
               <p>IN order to this, they boldly demanded of him a ſign from heaven, to make it plain, beyond all contradiction, that he was a greater prophet than Moſes. JESUS replied, by rebuking their blindneſs and folly, who, by obſerving the face of the ſky, could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſigns of fair and rainy weather, with a preciſion which was fully manifeſted by the event; but, at the ſame time, they were ſo blind and fooliſh, they could not perceive the evident manifeſtation of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>filment of the prophecies reſpecting the Meſſiah, nor diſtinguiſh the ſigns of thoſe times which they ſo ardently expected and deſired. Had the Phariſees duly attended to the evidences which our Lord produced to prove his divine miſſion, and examined them with the ſame care as they did the face of the ſky, when they predicted the fairneſs or foulneſs of the weather, they would doubtleſs have been convinced of the truth: but their obſtinate and inveterate prejudices, prevented their receiving the Redeemer of Iſrael, and filled their hearts with ſo much pride and envy, that our divine Inſtructor would not attempt their information and conviction; but fetching a deep ſigh, becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, he declared, that their expected ſign ſhould never be given them; and further obſerved, that the only ſign which Divine Providence would allow them, was that of his own reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the cold regions of the dead, in which dark abodes he ſhould be no longer held, than the prophet Jonah was in the belly of the whale. This miracle of our Lord's reſurrection, was a ſign greater than any which had formerly been ſhewn by the ancient prophets, and was juſtly inſiſted on by our great Redeemer, to prove that he excelled and was far ſuperior to them all: <hi>A wicked and adulterous generation,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeeketh after a ſign; and there ſhall no ſign be given unto it, but the ſign of the prophet Jonas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING given this anſwer to the Phariſees, our Lord departed with his diſciples, and went by ſea to Bethſaida. During this ſhort voyage, he cautioned his diſciples to beware of the doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſees, which he introduced under the metaphor of leaven, deſcribed its wide-ſpreading contagion, and pernicious influence on the minds and actions of men. Theſe hypocrites, valued themſelves for their zealous attachment to a religion, which conſiſted in the ſcrupulous obſervance of frivolous
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029927_0108_0FE336D120C2D358"/>
tradition, while they neglected the immutable duties of natural religion, as well as the weightier and more important precepts of the law: but the diſciples, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to take bread with them in their voyage, thought our Lord introduced the diſcourſe of leaven, to caution them againſt procuring it of the Heathens, or Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; for, though their Maſter had ſo lately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed the multitude in the deſert, they had forgotten his miraculous power, and ſeemed not to be ſenſible, that he who had fed ten thouſand perſons with five loaves, was able, at all times, to provide for their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>HAVING croſſed the lake, and landed at Bethſaida, there was brought to our Lord a blind man, and he was earneſtly intreated to reſtore him to ſight. He received the petition with his uſual kindneſs, and taking the man by the hand, he led him out of the city; then he ſpit in his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, and aſked him, if he ſaw any thing: to which, the man replied, <hi>I ſee men as trees walking:</hi> which words very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly expreſs the indiſtinctneſs of his ſight: JESUS then laid his hands on him a ſecond time, and he was immediately reſtored to clear, diſtinct, and perfect ſight.</p>
               <p>IT is proper in this place to be remarked, that the inhabitants of Bethſaida, had, by their ingratitude, impenitence, and unbelief, greatly provoked our great Redeemer; and it may be ſaid of this city, as it was of another, <hi>he would not do many mighty works there, becauſe of their unbelief:</hi> and this, no doubt, was the reaſon why he would not perform this miraculous cure in the city, but led the blind man into the fields; and ſoon after departed into the territory of Caeſarea-Philippi.</p>
               <p>BEING retired into this country, our Lord thought proper to try the faith of the apoſtles; not that he did it for his own information, but that it might be manifeſt to themſelves that they believed in the Lord. With this view, he aſked them, <hi>Whom do men ſay that I, the Son of man, am?</hi> In anſwer to this queſtion, the diſciples replied, <hi>Some ſay that thou art John the Baptiſt; ſome, Elias; and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</hi> The people in general, were convinced that JESUS was a great prophet; but though they were convinced of this, they did not acknowledge him as the Meſſiah. The reaſon of their miſtake is very apparent: they expected that the Meſſiah, when he appeared, would aſſume the honours, grandeur, and power of a temporal kingdom; but, as JESUS diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and declined all earthly honours, they could not receive him under that character. JESUS, therefore, gave the diſciples an opportunity of declaring what their conceptions were of his perſon and character; and, with this view, he aſked them, <hi>But whom ſay ye that I am?</hi> To this queſtion, Peter immediately replied, <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> With a condeſcending ſmile, our Lord accepted the title, and, to teſtify his approbation of Peter's faith, immediately replied, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Our great Redeemer, then alluding to the name of Peter, which ſignifies a rock, led him, and the reſt of the diſciples, to a view of that eternal Rock, on the faith he had before expreſſed, and the whole church of CHRIST reſts, as on a ſure foundation. <hi>And I ſay unto thee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT cannot, without great abſurdity, be concluded, that Peter was the rock on which CHRIST declared he would build his church: weak indeed, and eaſily aſſaulted and overcome by the powers of hell, would the noble fabric be, if it reſted on any creature; and much more ſo, was it ſupported by a weak, mutable, and fallible man: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifeſt, that CHRIST himſelf is the Rock, on which his univerſal church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029927_0109_0FE336D2A5894C78"/>
the whole number of his redeemed, is erected; and this is a foundation which will ſtand for ever: not all the powers of earth and hell, can ſhake the immovable baſis of this rock: and whoſoever is ſo happy as to be fixed on this foundation, need not fear the dreadful earthquake, the ruſhing inundation, the raging tempeſt, or the devouring flame: not all the rage and confuſion of a tumultuous world, can hurt ſuch a perſon as this; but he may ſtand ſecure amidſt the laſt convulſions of expiring nature, and behold, without fear, "the wrecks of matter and the cruſh of worlds."</p>
               <p>BUT our Lord proceeded to ſhew the favourable regard which he had for his diſciples, and the gifts which he would beſtow upon them; and, therefore, he adds, <hi>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven,</hi> Matth. xvi.19. As Peter had ſpoken in behalf of himſelf and the reſt of the apoſtles, ſo our Lord lays down theſe gifts which were common to all; for the ſame words, with very little variation, are applied to the whole number, in Matt, xviii.18, and in John xx.23. They cannot be ſuppoſed to contain a declaration of any ſuperiority aſſigned to Peter over the reſt of the apoſtles; for, it is evident, that, when they afterwards diſputed on this head, and held any contention amongſt themſelves, who ſhould be greateſt, they were always reproved by their Maſter: nor can we find, that the reſt of the apoſtles ever confeſſed any ſuch ſuperiority, or that Peter ever claimed it.</p>
               <p>THE keys of the kingdom of heaven being given to the apoſtles, by a very eaſy and beautiful figure, repreſents the ſucceſs of their miniſtry. The kingdom of heaven, in the language of the evangeliſt, is the kingdom of grace, or the diſpenſation of the glorious goſpel: and what can be more natural, than to ſay, that the keys of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven are given to them who open thoſe noble truths to the ſons of men. And when it is ſaid, that whatſoever the apoſtles bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; it evidently relates to the divine approbation of thoſe regulations and reſtrictions, which the apoſtles ſhould eſtabliſh in the church; for binding and looſing, are frequently uſed in the talmudical language, to repreſent the allowing or forbidding particular ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and practices: ſo that, from the whole, we may conclude, that however our Lord approved or applauded Peter's faith and zeal, he did not, by theſe declarations, intend to give him any pre-eminence or authority over the reſt of the apoſtles.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE diſciples, as they ſtill retained their expectations of a temporal kingdom, were, doubtleſs, highly elated with the diſcourſe of their Maſter, which they had lately heard; giving them the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and enabling them to bind and looſe with ſuch authority, were very agreeable to them: and, it is to be ſuppoſed, that they explained theſe grants to mean ſome great temporal powers and honours they were
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029927_0110_0FE336D42BF62298"/>
to be inveſted with. Their divine Leader, to abate their high ſwelling conceits, and to lead them into clearer views of the nature of his kingdom, and the final iſſue of his miniſtry amongſt the Jews, informed them that it was appointed in the eternal councils of his Father, that he ſhould be rejected by the rulers of Iſrael, perſecuted with the utmoſt malice, followed with falſe accuſations, and, at laſt, put to death as a malefactor, with circumſtances of the greateſt cruelty and public ſhame.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples were exceedingly alarmed at this prediction of their Maſter; he had juſt before accepted the title of the Meſſiah, and declared, that he would beſtow high honours, peculiar privileges, and extraordinary powers on his apoſtles; and his now declaring, that he ſhould be arraigned, condemned, and put to death as a malefactor, was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectations, that they thought it impoſſible to be true. Peter, who was of a warmer temper than the reſt, heard his Maſter talk of dying at Jeruſalem with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, and could not forbear hinting, that he did not believe it to be true; and he proceeded to blame his Maſter, for mentioning any ſuch thing. For this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our Lord ſharply rebuked him: <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me; for thou favoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was the falſe notions of the nature of the Meſſiah's kingdom which Peter had imbibed, and his love to the world, and deſires after its grandeur and glory, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to utter that imprudent language, which brought ſo ſevere a rebuke from his Maſter. It was, therefore, a leſſon, which our Redeemer, at this time, thought pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper to inculcate, that all who would afterwards obtain that glory which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſubjects of his kingdom, muſt deny themſelves; that is, they muſt always be ready to give up every worldly pleaſure, every thing which tends to gratify the ſenſes, and even life itſelf, whenever the cauſe of CHRIST required it. And he informed them, that whoſoever purſued the glory and bleſſedneſs of his kingdom, in ſuch a way as to be likely to obtain it, muſt expect to meet with trouble, vexation, diſappointment, affliction, and diſtreſs: for, our Lord declared, that he who would be his diſciple, muſt take up his croſs daily, and follow him.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord thus opened to his diſciples the true nature of his kingdom, and let them know, that it was quite the reverſe of what they had expected: for, though they had undergone many afflictions, difficulties, and trials, there were greater and more ſevere exerciſes of their patience and fortitude ſtill to come; theſe it would be in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſhun or evade, for they muſt follow their Maſter in the foot-ſteps of his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, if they attempted to ſhun, they would fall into greater evils; but thoſe who perſevered in the way of their duty with patience and fortitude, though they might loſe their temporal lives, they would certainly gain an happy immortality: <hi>For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: but whoſever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake, the ſame ſhall ſave it. For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer, having explained to his attentive diſciples, the uſage they muſt expect to find from the world, and the reproach, trouble, affliction, and variety of diſtreſs which they muſt expect to go through; he then thought proper to change the ſcene, and repreſented to them the grandeur, glory, dignity, and majeſty in which he ſhould appear, when thoſe ſufferings were at an end: <hi>For the ſon of man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall come in the glory of his Father; and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi> This conſideration might have been abundantly ſufficient to quiet their minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the various difficulties, troubles, and afflictions which lay before them.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029927_0111_0FE336DF85978C90"/>
Then their deſpiſed Maſter will appear in greater glory and dignity than the moſt pompous earthly prince; he will aſſume the birth-right of the ſkies, and ſit as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge of heaven and earth: then will his enemies meet with the puniſhment which they have ſo juſtly deſerved, and his friends moſt aſſuredly receive their eternal reward; but thoſe who, through fear of the difficulties and troubles which lay before them, have deſerted his cauſe, will find themſelves deſerted, and finally rejected at that awful day; for, ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>Whoſoever, therefore, ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS this is the firſt time which our exalted Redeemer mentioned this great event to his diſciples, it may not be amiſs to take a ſhort view of this grand, magnificent, awful, and moſt intereſting ſcene. As the Son of God is the exalted perſon who ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs, let us, for a moment, contemplate the glory, grandeur, and dignity in which he will appear: he himſelf declares, that he will appear <hi>in the glory of his Father, and with the holy angels:</hi> he will appear arrayed in the majeſty of that God, who dwells in light, and whoſe glory no mortal can approach; not the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inhabitants of the heavenly world, can bear the blaze of that boundleſs glory which ſurrounds the eternal throne, but veil their faces in the preſence of that God, who dwells in light, and fills the heavenly regions with the boundleſs blaze of uncreated brightneſs. How ſmall, how dim a ſpeck is the ſun, when compared with the eternal fountain of light, or with the brightneſs of that God, who pours the beamy radiance from world to world, and could, with one ray of glory darted from his throne, light up a thouſand ſuns.</p>
               <p>IN this boundleſs brightneſs, and majeſtic pomp, will the Son of God appear. Ah! how unlike the deſpiſed Galilean; how unlike the perſon, who groaned and bled on Calvary! Not now attended with twelve weak diſciples, twelve mean, illiterate fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but ſurrounded with myriads of celeſtial ſpirits, and numberleſs hoſts of mighty angels. With what celeſtial pomp, with what unutterable brightneſs, they deſcend through the ſky, while the ſun, overpowered with exceſſive light, ſhrinks and diſappears; and the whole bright aſſembly deſcends from heaven <hi>with a ſhout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God.</hi> The trumpet, with tremendous roar, reſounds through the regions of the dead: the dead awake and riſe; ſome exulting with joy at the ſight of their Saviour, and others terrified, confounded, and filled with inexpreſſible horror, at the ſight of their judge: the great and mighty, the rich and noble, warriors, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, princes, and potentates who ruled the world, and did what they pleaſed amongſt the ſons of men, now have loſt all their honours and command, and are filled with the utmoſt conſternation, amazement, and diſmay: they cannot bear the brightneſs of the Judge, they would plunge into eternal darkneſs, to avoid his piercing eye, and they call upon the rocks and mountains to fall on them, <hi>and hide them from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER reluctant, they are forced to appear: urged by ſtrong neceſſity, and driven by frowning angels, they crowd to the bar, and ſtand, trembling and aſtoniſhed, on the left-hand of their Judge. The elect of God, gathered by angels from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, are placed on the right-hand; they lift up their heads with joy, and, beholding the great Judge of heaven and earth, with exultation and tranſport can ſay, <hi>This is our God, we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in him.</hi> And now the time is come, when flagrant outrageous vice ſhall be thrown down and deſpiſed, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,

afflicted virtue ſhall be exalted; now is the time, when the myſteries of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhall be unveiled, when all the clouds and darkneſs, which ſurrounded the ways of God, will be cleared away, and the wiſdom, juſtice, and goodneſs of divine conduct, fully vindicated, both in thoſe who are ſaved, and thoſe who periſh: now the church of CHRIST, his ſpotleſs bride, purchaſed with his blood, ſhall appear in all her glory and beauty, all vain hypocritical pretenders will be expoſed, and every thing that offendeth, done away.</p>
               <p>AN awful ſilence is proclaimed; the books are opened; the ſecrets of all hearts, and every dark deed which had been carefully concealed, are brought to light, and then the exalted King of the univerſe, who fits in Judgment, proceeds to paſs that ſentence, which muſt ſtand for ever. With looks of the moſt kind, condeſcending goodneſs, and unſpeakable complacency and delight, he firſt beholds the happy heirs of life and glory, who had been enabled, by his grace, to believe in him for life and ſalvation, and bring forth ſuch fruits of righteouſneſs, as were honourable to his cauſe: theſe happy ſouls look up to their Judge, with ſuch emotions as are above deſcription, and, with inexpreſſible joy, hear him pronounce this heart-expanding ſentence, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; for I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE redeemed of the Lord, with ineffable joy, receive the approbation of their Judge; but their meek and humble hearts will not take any praiſe to themſelves, nor aſcribe the happineſs they are going to receive to any thing done by them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they meekly reply, 'Lord when ſaw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took the in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee.' Our Lord approves and commends their humility, but at the ſame time, to let the whole aſſembled world know, how kindly he accepted of every inſtance of the kindneſs and benevolence they had ſhewn to his people, he adds, 'Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'</p>
               <p>THE Judge then changes his countenance, and, with a look of indignation and riſing wrath, which pierces through the inmoſt ſoul, he beholds the guilty wretches, who ſtand trembling at his left hand: filled with conſcious guilt, and all the agonies of rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpair, they ſtand expecting their final doom, while theſe accents break from the lips of their angry Judge: 'Depart from me, ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.' The wicked, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſcious of guilt, not recollecting the preciſe acts of kindneſs and contempt of the Son of God, here literaly ſpecified, are emboldened to reply. <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungered, or athirſt or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi> However willing they may be to juſtify themſelves, our Lord well knows the naughtineſs of their heart, and is fully acquainted with their evil deeds, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he confounds them for ever with this reply; 'Inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.'</p>
               <p>THE final and eternal ſentence thus paſſed, the execution immediately ſucceeds: a legion of mighty angels drive the black, horrid train of trembling ſinners from the

judgment ſeat; and, caught in a fiery tempeſt, they are precipitated into their dreadful place of puniſhment; the gulph of eternal horror and deſpair ſtretches wide its burning jaws to receive them at their fall; and they are tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: and the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>MEAN while, the friends and favourites of the eternal king, are conducted to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God, and ſafe lodged in the realms of eternal bleſſedneſs and reſt: theſe happy realms, formed by the eternal God for the abode of his people, contain every thing which can ſatisfy the pure deſires of an immortal ſpirit, and fill the ſoul with holy and ever-growing delight; now every fear, every ſorrow, and every ſin is done away; and the happy inhabitants of this glorious place, drink full ſtreams of bliſs, and partake of thoſe joys which proceed from the throne of God, and of the Lamb: now the redeemed of the Lord, forming one vaſt, one happy ſociety, dwell in that ſplendid city, where the full glory of the eternal God is manifeſt in that exalted Saviour, who is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtyled, 'the brightneſs of his Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.' Here every happy believer in the Son of God, dwells in the preſence of his Saviour; beholds this ſupreme object of his love, face to face, and is clothed by him in the beauty and glory of immortality. But all deſcription fails: the human mind, in its preſent beclouded ſtate, cannot bear the blaze of immortal glory, nor receive any ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ideas of that boundleſs bliſs, which the Lord will beſtow on his people: <hi>For eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS this doctrine of CHRIST's being appointed, the univerſal Judge of heaven and earth, might ſeem incredible to the diſciples; eſpecially, as our Lord had but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given them the humbling account of his ſufferings and death; he proceeded to inform them, that ſome who heard him ſpeak, ſhould ſee ſo much of his glory and his kingdom while they lived, as ſhould convince them, that his declaration was true: <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſte of death, till they ſee the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</hi> Agreeable to this prediction, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples lived to ſee the transfiguration of their Maſter, and to be witneſſes of his glorious reſurrection, and his triumphant aſcenſion into heaven; they lived to ſee the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and the doctrines of the goſpel propagated in various remote parts of the world; and ſome of them lived to ſee that awful and ample diſplay of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, manifeſted in the deſtruction of that unbelieving race, who were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies and murderers of the Lord of life, and that wicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> city where he was crucified.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe great events ſucceeded the declaration in about ſix days, when our great Redeemer being with the multitude in the country of Caeſarea-Philippi, he left them in the plain, and, accompanied by Peter, James, and John, aſcended an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high mountain. In this ſolitude, while our Lord was praying, he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured; his face aſſumed a glorious radiance, and emitted a beamy brightneſs, not inferior to the ſun ſhining in its ſtrength; his garment ſhone with a ſnowy whiteneſs, far beyond any thing which human art could produce, and, like the fair beams of the morning light, glowed with a ſweet refulgence, not inferior to the brightneſs of his countenance. Thus, for a ſhort time the Son of God appeared in his native glory, and the majeſtic brightneſs of his divinity ſhone through the veil of his human nature. To heighten the ſolemnity of the ſcene, Moſes, the great lawgiver of Iſrael, and Elijah,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029927_0114_0FE336E4D91D90C0"/>
the great prophet of the Lord, and ſupporter of the law, appeared in the beauties of immortality, and ſhone in thoſe robes with which the inhabitants of the heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem are adorned.</p>
               <p>IT appears that the diſciples, being heavy with ſleep at the time of prayer, did not ſee the beginning of this glorious ſcene; they, however, awaked in the utmoſt ſurpriſe, to behold the place ſhining with heavenly glory; they had loſt the firſt part of this bright diſplay of our Redeemer's divinity, and of the converſation he held with the two great prophets who came down from heaven on this great occaſion; but they heard ſo much, as gave them to underſtand, that theſe glorious perſons had been talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things which their Maſter had lately informed them of. His ſufferings and death, which would ſoon be accompliſhed at Jeruſalem, though they appeared to them of ſuch an humbling nature, and contrary to the character of the Meſſiah, they found were not unworthy the contemplation of the greateſt perſonages of the heavenly world; and though the mentioning them, had lately given ſuch offence to Peter, he perceived that they were ſpoken of by perſons of ſuperior dignity and underſtanding, as highly honourable to the character of his Maſter. But the feeble nerves of the three diſciples could not bear the blaze of heavenly glory; they were amazed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and terrified, and ſcarce knew where they were, or how they ought to behave: but the forwardneſs of Peter's diſpoſition prompted him to ſay ſomething on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though he conſidered not the propriety or tendency of it: <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> having beheld ſuch glory, as never before darted on mortal ſight, and ſeen his Maſter aſſume an appearance of grandeur and majeſty, far beyond his moſt ſanguine expectations, he concluded, no doubt, that JESUS had now taken upon him his proper dignity, and that the temporal kingdom, which he had ſo ardently deſired, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expected, was now actually begun; eſpecially as Elias, according to the prophecy of Malachi the prophet, had made his appearance; he no doubt, concluded that he was come from heaven to aſſiſt in the rearing the Meſſiah's kingdom: Peter, therefore, thought it highly neceſſary to provide ſome accommodation for his Maſter, and his noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; perhaps, he intended to bring the reſt of the diſciples, and the multitude, who were waiting below, to behold the peerleſs glory of their Maſter, and his auguſt aſſiſtants; this, he thought, would be much better, and more honourable for him, than being put to death at Jeruſalem, or ſuffering thoſe things which had been the ſubject of the late heavenly converſation; the deſign of which, Peter, at this time, could not comprehend: but, <hi>while he yet ſpake, a bright cloud overſhadowed them: and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the three diſciples heard the voice, which was vaſtly different to any they had heard before, and, at the ſame time, that it ſeemed ſoft as the ſouthern breeze, yet it was awful and majeſtic as the thunder's roar; impreſſed with trembling awe, they fell with their faces to the ground, and continued in that poſture, till their compaſſionate Maſter came to them, and gently touched them, bid them ariſe, and not be afraid. They imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately looked about them, but the heavenly ſcene was withdrawn, and no perſon was ſeen but their divine Maſter, in the plain and unadorned form in which he appeared before he aſcended the mountain.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord, having continued on the ſummit of the mountain all night with his three diſciples, he early in the morning deſcended to the plain, and charged them to conceal
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029927_0115_0FE336F0340CBCD0"/>
what they had ſeen, till he was riſen from the dead. He was well aware, that the world, and even his own diſciples, were ſtrangers to his ſpiritual kingdom, and had no idea of his aſcending to heaven, and being highly exalted at the right hand of God: therefore, they could not comprehend the deſign of his transfiguration, and it was unneceſſary to publiſh it before his reſurrection, as it could not be deſcribed; and, perhaps, would not have been believed: and the preſent appearance of our Redeemer, joined with the afflictions, perſecutions, ſufferings, and ſorrows which lay before him, might ſtill tend to prejudice the minds of the people, and prevent them from believing any account of his exaltation and glory.</p>
               <p>NOR were the diſciples, at this time, able to underſtand the doctrine of CHRIST's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; they had never learnt that the Meſſiah was to die, nor had they any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his riſing from the dead; for they were fully perſuaded that he was to abide for ever, and that his kingdom was to have no end. They ſeemed very much ſurpriſed at the departure of Elias, and at their Maſter's ceaſing to ſhine in the glorious manner they had ſo lately beheld on the mountain: nor could they comprehend the meaning of the prophet Malachi, who had propheſied of the coming of Elias, which their readers of the law explained to refer to a time, prior to the appearance of the Meſſiah. After long debating amongſt themſelves, they concluded to apply to their Maſter, to ſolve the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and therefore aſked him, <hi>Why ſay the Scribes, that Elias muſt firſt come?</hi> To this inquiry, our Lord replied, that the Scribes had rightly explained the prophecy of Malachi, by declaring that Elias muſt come before the appearance of the Meſſiah; but, at the ſame time, he informed them, that this great prophet had made his appearance, and had been uſed by that perverſe generation, in the ſame manner as the prophets of old had been treated by their fathers: <hi>But I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatſoever they liſted: likewiſe ſhall alſo the Son of man ſuffer of them. Then the diſciples underſtood that he ſpake to them of John the Baptiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN JESUS deſcended to the foot of the mountain, attended by his three diſciples, he ſaw a great multitude ſurrounding the nine, who had continued with the people while our Lord had been transfigured, and the Scribes diſputing with them. The people ſeeing JESUS approach, ran to him with exultation and joy, and ſaluted him with the warmeſt gratitude, and the moſt reſpectful reverence. Our Lord having joined the company, he immediately aſked the Scribes, what was the ſubject of their debate with his diſciples? to which one of the company anſwered, <hi>Maſter, I have brought unto thee my ſon, which hath a dumb ſpirit; and whereſoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnaſheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I ſpake unto thy diſciples, that they ſhould caſt him out, but they could not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS anſwer ſeems to indicate, that the Scribes had been reproaching the diſciples, on account of their inability to reſtore the afflicted youth: and, no doubt, they rejoiced, that, at laſt, a devil had appeared who was too hard for them, and, perhaps, would not ſubmit to their Maſter. Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſomething like this had been the ſubject of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is evident from our Saviour's reply: <hi>O faithleſs generation,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how long ſhall I be with you? How long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> After having ſpoken in this manner to the proud, ſelf-conceited, ſceptical Scribes, our Lord turned to the father of the afflicted young man, and ſaid, <hi>Bring thy ſon hither.</hi> The afflicted father obeyed; but no ſooner was the youth brought into the preſence of the great ruler of earth and heaven, than the evil ſpirit attacked him with double fury: <hi>the ſpirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:029927_0116_0FE336F2A207F5B8"/>IT is not to be ſuppoſed, that the bleſſed JESUS could not have prevented this furious attack; but he was pleaſed to ſuffer it, probably, that the minds of the ſpectators might be the more affected with the deplorable condition of the ſufferer, and have the more juſt and lively ideas of that wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, which ſhould give him relief; and, it is probable, with the ſame views, he aſked the mournful father, how long his ſon had been in this pitious condition? To which he replied, <hi>Of a child. And oft times it hath caſt him into the fire, and into the waters to deſtroy him: but, if thou canſt do any thing, have compaſſion on us, and help us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeems, that the inability of the diſciples to caſt out this evil ſpirit, had greatly diſcouraged the afflicted father: and the exquiſite torture, and apparent agonies of his ſon, and the remembrance of their long continuance, had diſpirited him ſo much, that he began to fear, that this poſſeſſion was too ſtrong for the power of JESUS himſelf, as the Scribe had affirmed; which was the reaſon of his expreſſing himſelf with ſo much heſitation and doubt, when he told our Lord, how long his ſon had been afflicted. But JESUS, to make him ſenſible of his miſtake, as well as gently to reprove him for his unbelief, and groundleſs fears, ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him that believeth.</hi> The father, affected with this declaration, and with a heart full of tenderneſs and joy, at the ſuppoſed poſſibility of the relief of his ſon, replied with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</hi> The vehement manner in which the afflicted parent ſpoke theſe words, cauſed the crowd to gather about him; when <hi>Jeſus rebuked the ſoul ſpirit; and ſaid unto him, Thou dumb and deaf ſpirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE awful voice, at which all the devils tremble, had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, than the devil, with an hideous howling, and convulſing the tormented youth in the moſt frightful manner, came out; leaving the youth, in a manner, ſenſeleſs and motionleſs, as one dead. Our Lord then, taking him by the hand, reſtored him to life, and delivered him perfectly recovered, both in body and mind, to his father.</p>
               <p>THE nine diſciples, who had unſucceſsfully attempted to drive out this obſtinate demon, remained moſt attentively ſilent during this tranſaction; doubtleſs they were glad to find, that this dreadful and powerful devil, was not an over-match for their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however they were mortified to find, that he was too hard for them. They were very deſirous to know the reaſon, why they could not diſpoſſeſs this demon, as they had done others, but did not chuſe to aſk their Maſter in the hearing of the multitude; but when he had retired, they aſked him, why they failed in their attempt to reſtore the poſſeſſed young man? Our Lord informed them, it was becauſe of their unbelief, <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if ye have faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay unto this mountain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove; and nothing ſhall be impoſſible to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord then retired to the unfrequented parts of Galilee; and in this ſolitary retreat, he again inſtructed his diſciples in the nature of his kingdom, and the deſign of his coming into the world; laying before them a view of his ſufferings, death, and ſpeedy reſurrection. There, doubtleſs, was a neceſſity of inculcating theſe diſagreeable and unpopular truths frequently on their minds; for, though they muſt remember how ſharply Peter was reproved for oppoſing the declaration of theſe events, yet our Lord's predictions concerning this matter, were very ſlowly received; and the national prejudices which the diſciples had ſo ſtrongly imbibed, which repreſented the grandeur, glory and perpetuity of the Meſſiah's temporal kingdom, would not permit them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it poſſible that he ſhould die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:029927_0117_0FE336F427C92288"/>AFTER having abode a ſhort time in the deſert part of Galilee, our Lord returned to Capernaum, the place of his general abode. Soon after his arrival at that city, the tax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gatherers applied to Peter, inquiring if his Maſter would pay the tribute: Peter promiſed them that his Maſter would ſatisfy their demand; but, on further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was afraid to mention the thing to him: perhaps he thought it derogatory to the dignity of ſo great a perſon to pay tribute to any potentate on earth. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cautious Peter might be of mentioning the affair, it was no ſecret to his Maſter, which our Lord ſoon appriſed him of, by propoſing the following queſtion: <hi>What thinkeſt thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take cuſtom or tribute? Of their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſtrangers? Peter ſaith unto him, Of ſtrangers. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Then are the children free.</hi> Peter, by this queſtion, was fully ſatisfied, that our Lord knew his thoughts, and had fully penetrated the affair which was in agitation; he was alſo convinced, that, as the Son of God, and heir of all things, he was under no obligation to pay tribute to the greateſt monarch on earth: but our Lord, to avoid giving offence, condeſcended to ſubmit to the claim; and propoſed to Peter the following miraculous method of raiſing the money: <hi>Go thou to the ſea,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and caſt an book, and take up the fiſh that firſt cometh up, and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhalt find a piece of money; that take, and give it unto them for me and thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord, by this miraculous manner of paying that tribute, which he was under no obligation to pay, teaches us, that in all common caſes, we ſhould avoid giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the civil power; and rather ſubmit to a demand, which may ſeem burdenſome and oppreſſive in a ſmall degree, than offend our brethren, or diſturb the tranquility of the ſtate. And ſure it becomes the children of the Prince of peace to avoid all occaſions of contention and diſcord, and rather give up ſome ſmall part of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, than give the rulers of the ſtate any reaſon to complain. It may further be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this miracle is a manifeſt proof of the omnipreſence of the Son of God; no leſs a perſon than he, who knows all things and is preſent in all places, could know that the fiſh had the piece of money in its mouth, while it was covered with the roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurges of the ſea; and that this ſame fiſh, ſtill holding the piece of money, would come to Peter's hook. Theſe are moſt ſurpriſing events, and with the reſt of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by our great Redeemer, blaze out like a bright conſtellation, adorn his royal crown, and proclaim him the great King of the univerſe, the ſupreme Lord of heaven and earth.</p>

continuance, nor had they yet given up their favourite notion of the Meſſiah's temporal kingdom: for, not many days after, they had ſo far forgot the predictions of their Maſter, that they were engaged in a warm diſpute concerning the poſts of honour in that kingdom. On what grounds ſeveral of the diſciples advanced their pretenſions to be greateſt, is not related by the evangeliſts; but it is very plain, that thoſe claims did not originate from any intimations given them by their Maſter, of his deſign to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any of them above the reſt; for he very ſeverely rebuked them for their pride and folly, and they were fearful of letting him know what ſubject they had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting about.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord did not directly proceed to reprimand his diſciples on account of the above converſation, but firſt aſked them, what they were diſputing about by the way? They were confounded at the queſtion, and, as they knew it would be in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, either to evade a diſcovery, or to conceal the truth, they feared to return an anſwer. JESUS, perceiving their confuſion, ſoon gave them to underſtand, that he well knew the ſubject of their debate, and that he highly diſapproved it: having commanded their particular and earneſt attention to what he was going to advance, he ſaid, <hi>if any man deſires to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt, and ſervant of all.</hi> And then, to teach them the uſeful leſſon of humility, he took a little child, and ſet him in the midſt of them: <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoſoever, therefore, ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is greateſt in the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS our Lord, at this time, thought proper to diſcountenance all pretenſions to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority amongſt his diſciples, it is evident, that he had given no ſupremacy to Peter, when he declared his approbation of his declaration of faith, as before related. Had he, when he told that diſciple that he gave him <hi>the keys of the kingdom of heaven,</hi> deſigned to exalt him above the reſt of the diſciples: or had they underſtood his words in that ſenſe, they could not poſſibly have been at any loſs to know who was to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; nor is it likely they would have contended about an affair which had in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them all, been finally ſettled by their Maſter: neither is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that, if our great Redeemer had given the pre-eminence to Peter, he would have blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſciples for talking about it, and not on this occaſion have confirmed his former grant.</p>
               <p>THE juſtice of this remark is further confirmed by the anſwer which our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer gave to the wife of Zebedee, when ſhe preſented a petition to him in behalf of her ſons; ſhe had ſtrongly imbibed the national error of the Jews, reſpecting the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's kingdom; and, as ſhe ſuppoſed that her ſons, from their near relation to our Lord, might claim a peculiar ſhare in his favour, ſhe preſented her requeſt, that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left, in his kingdom. To this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Saviour replied, <hi>To ſit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE reſt of the diſciples having heard the requeſt, and remarked our Redeemer's reply, were much offended at the pride and vanity of the brothers, and could not ſee any reaſon, why they ſhould expect ſo peculiar and diſtinguiſhed a mark of favour. To put an end to all contention on ſo weak and frivolous an account, our Lord call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſciples in ſuch a manner, as to engage and fix their attention, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exerciſe lordſhip over them; and their great ones exerciſe authority upon them; but ſo it ſhall not be amongst you,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029927_0119_0FE33701B2E9DBF8"/>
but whoſoever will be great amongst you, ſhall be your miniſter; and whoſoever of you will be the chiefeſt, ſhall be the ſervant of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH is the language of our great Redeemer, who is ſole king and lawgiver in his church; and may we not juſtly conclude, that the pretences of the church of Rome to infallibility and ſupremacy, which ſhe would have us believe have deſcended from the apoſtle Peter to the pope, as his ſucceſſor, have no foundation in ſcripture or reaſon, but are unjuſt and arbitrary uſurpation, deſigned to advance and enrich the prieſthood, and impoveriſh, abuſe, and enſlave mankind.</p>
               <p>THE exalted Saviour of mankind, having thus gently rebuked his diſciples for their eager and unabating deſires after worldly grandeur, John, one of the ſons of Zebedee, perhaps to give a turn to the converſation, informed his Maſter, that they had ſeen one caſting out the devils in his name, and had forbidden him, becauſe he had not joined himſelf to their company. To which our Lord replied, that they ought not to have forbidden him, becauſe no perſon would attempt to work miracles in his name, who did not entertain a very juſt conception of his divinity. <hi>Forbid him not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for there is no man which ſhall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly ſpeak evil of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY this language our Redeemer exorted them to conſider, that whoſoever did not oppoſe him, may be conſidered as his friends; and the caſting out devils in his name, would advance his reputation; and promote his intereſt, though the devils themſelves, and the perſons who rejected them, might deſign the contrary: he further informed them that the leaſt degree of friendſhip and reſpect ſhewn to his cauſe, though it was no more than a cup of cold water given to his diſciples, when they ſtood in need of ſuch a favour, was acceptable to him, and would certainly find its full reward hereafter. <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall give you a cup of cold water in my name, becauſe you belong to Chriſt; verily, I ſay unto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> At the ſame time, our Lord gave them to underſtand, that the leaſt diſcouragement to his ſervants in their duty, would be remarked, and puniſhed with the greateſt ſeverity: <hi>And whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were caſt into the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM hence our great Redeemer took occaſion to remark, that it was better and more advantageous to us, to deny ourſelves the enjoyment of thoſe things which are moſt pleaſing to our ſenſe, and which our corrupt affections might be as loth to part with, as with an hand, a foot, or an eye, than by any indulgence or ſenſual gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give offence to the diſciples of CHRIST, or prevent the ſucceſs of his goſpel: and, as the diſciples of CHRIST were appointed to preach the glorious goſpel to a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, to ſhew all nations the ſtupidity and folly of their idolatry, to teach the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted worſhip of the true God, and the practice of every virtue, JESUS exhorted them to be particularly careful of their conduct and behaviour; for, if their lives were diſhonourable to the cauſe of the goſpel, they would be uſeleſs and deſpiſed, like ſalt which had loſt its favour. But amongſt all the vices which prevail in the hearts of mankind, there is none more contrary to the nature and genius of the religion of JESUS, or more likely to prevent the uſefulneſs of the preachers of his goſpel, than a ſpirit of pride; of this, therefore, our Lord particularly cautioned his diſciples to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; for, he aſſured them, that the meaneſt perſon is an object of the paternal care of the great Creator, and is ſupported and defended by his particular providence; ſuch, therefore, are not to be deſpiſed; for our Lord declared, that their angels do always behold the face of his heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:029927_0120_0FE3370337D50B88"/>AND to ſhew the particular notice and care which his eternal Father takes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with what tender regard he always beholds the believers in his Son, our great Redeemer proceeded in this manner, 'How think ye,' ſaid he, 'if a man have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and ſeeketh that which is gone aſtray? And if it be, that he finds it, verily, I ſay unto you, he rejoiceth more of that ſheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not aſtray. Even ſo, it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.'</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having declared the heavy vengeance which would certainly fall on all who injured his diſciples, and oppoſed the propagation of his goſpel; and obſerved the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care with which his Almighty Father beholds his people, and their certainty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and defence; he proceeds to warn them of taking their cauſe into their own hands, and purſuing, with haſty and unreaſonable reſentment, any who had offended them. 'If thy brother,' ſaid he, 'ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican.'</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour then proceeds to inform them, that the Supreme Judge of heaven and earth will intereſt himſelf in their behalf, when they are juſtly offended, and the ſentence which they paſs on ſuch offenders will be ratified in heaven: 'Verily, I ſay unto you,' proceeded he, 'whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.' The meaning of this is, that if the method you take with an offending brother is bleſſed to the end you deſigned, and he is brought to a repentance, he is looſed from the guilt of his ſin, and ſtands acquitted at the bar of ſupreme juſtice: but, on the other hand, if all methods are uſed in vain, and the offender ſtill continues impenitent, and perſiſts in his evil ways, he is bound by the chains of his guilt, and cannot eſcape deſerved puniſhment.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour then proceeded to lay down ſome conſiderations, which ought to encourage good men to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to convince ſinners of the error of their ways, and bring them to ſincere repentance, and to offer up their earneſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering prayers to the God of all grace, for his divine aſſiſtance in ſo great a work, by which only it can be effected: for our Lord informs them, that his heavenly Father would always hear their prayers, and grant their petitions, if conſiſtent with the deſigns of his providence, and the methods of his grace. 'Again, I ſay unto you,' ſaid he, 'that if two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven: for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them.'</p>
               <p>PETER had carefully attended to the doctrine of forgivneſs of injuries, as inculcated by his Maſter; doubtleſs, he ſaw the beauty and dignity of ſuch a rule of conduct, and deſired it to be further explained: 'Lord,' ſaid he, 'how oft ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him, till ſeven times?' It ſeems by this queſtion, that, however great and noble he apprehended this rule of conduct to be, he thought it was neceſſary to obſerve ſome reſtrictions in the practice of it; but his Maſter informed him, that it muſt not be limitted to ſeven times, but carried on to ſeventy times ſeven, if the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:029927_0121_0FE33704C25E1828"/>IN order to ſhew the beauty and dignity of this excellent moral precept, and the neceſſity of forgiving the greateſt injuries in every caſe, where the offending perſon is ſenſible of his fault, and promiſes amendment; our Lord, by way of illuſtration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the parable of two ſervants, debtors to one lord: 'Therefore,' ſaid he, 'is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thouſand talents. But, for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be ſold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The ſervant, therefore, fell down, and worſhiped him, ſaying, lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that ſervant was moved with compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgave him the debt. But the ſame ſervant went out, and found one of his fellow-ſervants, which owed him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, ſaying, pay me that thou oweſt. And his fellow-ſervant fell down at his feet, and beſought him, ſaying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and caſt him into priſon till he ſhould pay the debt.'</p>
               <p>'So when his fellow-ſervants ſaw what was done, they were ſorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, ſaid unto him, O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me: ſhouldeſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him unto the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.'</p>
               <p>BY this affecting narrative, our Lord beautifully diſplays the extent of divine forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the obligations which the ſons of men, to whom God hath forgiven ſo much, are under to forgive one another. God is the great king and ſovereign of all creatures, to him all are accountable, as ſervents are to a maſter; he keeps a regiſter of their actions, as a tradeſman keeps an account of his debts, and a day will ſurely come when they will be called to a reckoning. The ſervant who owed ten thouſand talents, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents every man that lives in the world: the enormous debts which men owe to their Creator, is but faintly deſcribed by that prodigious ſum; for their ſins of thought, word, and deed, which the moſt correct and regular of mankind commit, exceed all concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may juſtly be compared to the ſtars of heaven for multitude, or the ſand on the ſea ſhore. The plea of the inſolvent debtor 'Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all,' is an elegant deſcription of the expectations of men in general, to obtain the divine forgivneſs, by their future good behaviour, and thinking to perform ſuch good deeds as may make amends for their former guilt; but the lord, knowing how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was for this ſervant to pay this enormous ſum, had compaſſion on him, and freely forgave the debt. Hence, we learn the freeneſs of divine forgivneſs; it is not on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing which has been done, or can be done by the ſons of men, that the great Jehovah is induced to pardon their iniquities; but his forgivnſs ſlows from the rich fountain of his own infinite mercy, that mercy which he hath magnified, and fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world in the goſpel of his Son: and whoſoever is made partaker of the rich bleſſing of divine forgivneſs, is laid under the higheſt obligations to forgive his fellow-creatures, and to extend that forgivneſs, if required, beyond the limits preſcribed by our Lord, even beyond the number of ſeventy times ſeven: but ſuch is the corruption and depravity of the human heart, that we are too prone to forget, or careleſsly overlook the mercies received, and conſider not how juſtly the great Judge of heaven and earth might call us to a ſtrict account for our numerous offences, while we are purſuing our fellow-creatures with implacable reſentment; nor do we conſider how much we are indebted to
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029927_0122_0FE3370645DDD8A8"/>
the ſupreme Lord of univerſal nature, while, like the unmerciful ſervant, we take our fellow-creature by the throat, with, 'Pay me what thou oweſt.' But whoſoever duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the vaſt debt they owe to God, and are enabled to rely on his infinite mercy for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givneſs; if they have a juſt view of their unworthineſs and inſolvency, and are enabled to ſeek forgivneſs in the way which God hath appointed, will, in a greater or leſs degree, be careful to cultivate a placable forgiving frame of mind; eſpecially when they conſider thoſe remarkable words with which our Lord concludes this narrative: for having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the lord delivered the cruel ſervant 'to the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him;' he adds, 'ſo likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not one another your treſpaſſes.'</p>
               <p>HAVING delivered theſe precepts, our great Redeemer departed into Galilee, paſſing through the country beyond Jordan; by that means giving the Jews which inhabited that country an opportunity to hear his heavenly diſcourſes, and to receive the benefit of his all-healing power: and after having taken a tour through thoſe diſtant parts, he returned to his own city Nazareth.</p>
               <p>THE feaſt of tabernacles now approached, when the males of the Jewiſh nation, capable of travelling, repaired to Jeruſalem, and dwelt ſeven days in the tabernacles, or booths made of boughs of trees, in commemoration of their fathers having had no other habitation during their forty years ſojourning in the wilderneſs. Some of the kinſmen of the bleſſed JESUS, being about to take a journey to the capital on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they deſired him to accompany them thither, and openly ſhew himſelf to the whole nation of the Jews. They did not believe, that he was really the Meſſiah ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by their nation, and they condemned his conduct, as unnatural and abſurd, from a perſon who made ſuch pretenſions: they could not conceive what induced him to ſpend ſo much of his time in deſerts, and remote parts of the kingdom, while he aſſumed ſo public a character as that of the Redeemer of Iſrael. Jeruſalem, the ſeat of power, the habitation of the great men of the nation, and the place of general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, was, in their opinion, the propereſt place for him to publiſh his doctrines, and work his miracles in: theſe, they thought, being exhibited in public, before the great and learned men of the nation, might have a better effect, than being performed in obſcure retreats amongſt the ignorant and illiterate. The deciſion of the doctors of the law, and the great men of the nation in his favour, they thought would increaſe the number of his diſciples, and be a means of inducing the whole nation to own him for the Meſſiah, whether he were really that great perſon or not: <hi>Depart hence,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>and go into Judea, that thy diſciples alſo may ſee the works that thou doeſt: for there is no man that doeth any thing in ſecret, and himſelf ſeeketh to be known openly. If thou do theſe things, ſhew thyſelf to the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT our Lord was no ſtranger to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and, therefore, he did not think proper to reſide amongſt them any longer than was abſolutely neceſſary: he well knew their inveterate prejudices, their obſtinacy and preverſeneſs, and their prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbelief; and was fully convinced, that they would not receive his doctrines, nor be induced, by his miracles, to believe in him, but would be more likely to uſe all their power to deſtroy him, before he had finiſhed the work, which he aſſumed our nature to perform: for which reaſons he did not chooſe to accompany his relations to the feaſt, or go in a public manner to Jeruſalem: <hi>My time,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, to theſe unbelieving relations, <hi>is not yet come: but your time is always ready. The world cannot hate you: but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this feaſt: I go not up yet unto this feaſt: for my time is not yet full come.</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:029927_0123_0FE337119DD44E88"/>
This was as though he had ſaid, it is not expedient that I ſhould go to Jeruſalem before the feaſt begins: you may advance to the city whenever you pleaſe, there is nothing to make you afraid; the Jews are your friends, you have never offended them, nor have you done any thing to diſpleaſe them: but the purity of the doctrine I have preached amongſt them, and the plainneſs and freedom of ſpeech with which I have oppoſed their fooliſh traditions, and reproved their hypocriſy, and other enormous vices, have raiſed their reſentment, and provoked their malice to the utmoſt height; and, therefore, as the time of my ſuffering is not yet come, it is not proper for me to go ſo ſoon to Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS there might be another reaſon why our Redeemer did not chooſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his relations to the feaſt of tabernacles at this time: the vaſt concourſe of people which annually attended this ſolemnity, would fill all the roads to the capital, and theſe gathering around him, and attending him to Jeruſalem, would have made a noiſe in the city, and have given freſh offence to his enemies, which might have exaſperated them to that degree, that they might, as they had done before, have attempted his life, and their cruelty and rage might have prevented his doctrine and miracles having their proper effect: he, therefore, choſe to continue in Galilee till the crowd were gone up to the the feaſt, when he followed, <hi>as it were in ſecret,</hi> neither preaching nor working miracles by the way; ſo that no crowd followed him, nor was there any rejoicing at his approach.</p>
               <p>AS JESUS did not go publicly to Jeruſalem, ſo neither did he, on his arrival, repair to the temple, and there preach openly to the people. This gave riſe to ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes amongſt the Jews concerning his character and conduct; ſome affirmed that he was a true prophet, and his not coming to the feaſt could only ariſe from ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which had prevented him; others maintained that he was an impoſter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and though he aſſumed the ſacred character of a prophet, he did not keep the law; nor regard the inſtitutions which they had received from heaven.</p>
               <p>BUT about the middle of the feaſt, JESUS appeared openly in the temple, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly taught the people, delivering his divine diſcourſes with energy, force, and ſpirit, and ſuch ſtrength of reaſoning joined with ſuch elegance of expreſſion, that his enemies were aſtoniſhed, as they knew he had not enjoyed the benefit of a learned education. <hi>Now, about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up and taught. And the Jews marvelled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</hi> To this the exalted Saviour of mankind replied: My doctrine was not produced by human wiſdom; the learned men and ſages of this world were not my inſtructors; but I received it from heaven, and it is the doctrine of the great, ſupreme, eternal Father of the univerſe, whoſe meſſenger I am: <hi>My doctrine,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> And our Lord further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it might be gathered from the manner of his teaching, that his doctrine was really divine; he ſought not the praiſe of man, he did not ſtand candidate for popular applauſe, he did not ſeek to advance his own intereſt, but the eternal intereſt of mankind, and the glory of the heavenly Father: <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeeketh his own glory; but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs is in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME of the Jews preſumed to call JESUS a falſe prophet, becauſe, in the porches of the pool of Betheſda, he had healed an impotent man on the Sabbath-day, which, they pretended was a violation of the law of Moſes, and what a good man would not be guilty of: in anſwer to which, our great Redeemer told them, that however they might

pretend to reverence the authority of Moſes and his law, they made no ſcruple to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the moſt ſacred and eſſential of his precepts; this was manifeſt in their conduct towards himſelf: contrary to all the principles of juſtice and humanity, and every law of God and man, they had reſolved to put him to death; and, in order to execute their black, horrid, and infernal ſcheme, they were now laying plots againſt his life.</p>
               <p>TO this charge the Jews replied, <hi>Thou haſt a devil: Who goeth about to kill thee?</hi> To which JESUS anſwered to this effect, I have performed a miracle, in favour of a diſtreſſed poor man, on the Sabbath-day: this you think contrary to the character of a good and pious man, and wonder how I could undertake it; but I can give you an example out of your own law, in the caſe of circumciſion: Moſes gave you that law, and you make no ſcruple of performing the inſtitution on the Sabbath-day: you think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtified in this, becauſe it is a precept both of Moſes and the fathers. Since, therefore, ye think yourſelves bound to diſpenſe with the ſtrict obſervance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in order to perform a ceremonial precept, can you be angry with me becauſe I, on the Sabbath-day, have fulfilled the moſt ſacred and immutable part of the moral law, by curing a man who was infirm in all the members of his body, and have not exerted ſo much bodily labour as you do in the practice of the rite of circumciſion: conſider therefore, the nature of the thing, be not blinded by prejudice, be no longer attached to fooliſh traditions, or ſuperſtitious opinions; but make uſe of your reaſon, ſhew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men, and judge impartially: <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>therefore gave unto you circumciſion (becauſe it is of Moſes, but not of the fathers); and ye on the Sabbath-day circumciſe a man. If a man on the Sabbath-day receive circumciſion, that the law of Moſes ſhould not be broken; are ye angry at me, becauſe I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath-day? Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</hi>

               <p>THOUGH the Jews could not anſwer this argument, they would not be convinced, but objected to JESUS's being the Meſſiah, becauſe they were acquainted with his parents and relations: they apprehended, that when the Meſſiah appeared, his pedigree and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſhip would not be known; and they founded their opinion on a paſſage in the prophet Iſaiah, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> They were full of reſentment and malice, and ſome of them were deſirous that he ſhould be apprehended; but Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would not permit them to accompliſh their cruel purpoſe, becauſe the time of his ſufferings were not yet come. But though his enemies beheld hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Evangeliſt informs us, that <hi>many of the people believed on him, and ſaid, When Chriſt cometh, will he do more miracles than theſe which this man hath done?</hi> John vii.31.</p>
               <p>THE Scribes and Phariſees beheld the attachment of the common people to the Saviour of ſinners, with the higheſt indignation and contempt, and were ſo provoked, that they could bear it no longer; and, accordingly, on the laſt and great day of the feaſt, they met in council to conſider on ſome means to prevent his growing popularity: the reſult of their deliberations, was a determination to apprehend him; and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the proper officers were diſpatched from the council to arreſt him, and bring him before them. While theſe things were in agitation in the council, JESUS was teaching in the temple, and he exhorted the people to give a diligent and unabating attention to his diſcourſes; not only becauſe the ſubject matter of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>NOT underſtanding that our Saviour alluded to his death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion to the right hand of God, whither no perſon in the body could follow him, the Jews were very much puzzled with this declaration, and could by no means underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: they could form no other conjecture concerning the meaning of theſe words, than that our Lord deſigned to leave Judea, and go amongſt the Gentiles, to preach amongſt their brethren who were diſperſed in the neighbouring nations: but they were aware, that this conjecture did not anſwer to the latter part of our Lord's declaration: for though he ſhould go amongſt the Gentiles, it would not be impoſſible for them to follow hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHILE our exalted Redeemer was teaching in the temple, according to the annual cuſtom, the water of the pool of Siloam was brought in. Part of this was drank in the temple with loud acclamations, in commemoration of the great deliverance wrought for their fathers, who were miraculouſly relieved and preſerved by a ſtream which flowed from a hard dry rock, and revived the nation which was fainting with thirſt: the other part was poured out as a drink-offering, accompanied with their prayers to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, for the former and latter rain to fall in their ſeaſon; which ceremony was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the whole congregation, ſinging this paſſage out of the prophet Iſaiah, <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of ſalvation.</hi> chap. xii.3.</p>
               <p>IT was the conſtant mode of inſtruction which our great Redeemer purſued, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate his diſcourſes to the particular occaſion and circumſtances of his hearers, and to engage and fix their attention, by alluding to occurrences and objects actually in view; and, accordingly, he took this opportunity of repreſenting the rich bleſſings which ſinful creatures would receive from him under the metaphor of water: and, in alluſion to the ceremony which they had ſeen performed, <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink. He that beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHILE our Lord was thus ſpeaking to the people, with a beautiful ſimplicity, and heart-affecting ſtrength and energy, ſuch as never were joined before, the officers ſent from the council to apprehend him, came into the temple: before they proceeded to the execution of their miſſion, they ſtaid a few moments to hear his diſcourſe; to this they were excited by their curioſity, but his divine eloquence overcame their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, removed their prejudices, and melted away their rage: the harmony of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, the beautiful ſimplicity, and plainneſs, and the amazing ſtrength, energy, and clearneſs of his reaſoning, diſplayed the beauties of divine truth, and cauſed them to ſhine on the underſtanding with reſiſtleſs brightneſs; even his enemies who were ſent from the council to apprehend him, were aſtoniſhed and overcome: the greatneſs of the ſubject affected their minds, and its importance filled their underſtandings: the warmth and tenderneſs with which he delivered his diſcourſes, fixed their attention and penetrated their hearts; they felt new and uncommon emotions, and overwhelmed with the greatneſs of their admiration, were fixed in ſilent aſtoniſhment; they were abſolutely overcome, and could not think of executing the commiſſion which brought
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029927_0127_0FE3372149AB4BC8"/>
them to the temple; they blamed themſelves for having undertaken it, and returned to the rulers of Iſrael without performing it.</p>
               <p>IF we conſider the remorſeleſs diſpoſition of the perſons who are uſually ſent about ſuch buſineſs, and the nature of the ſubject which employed our great Redeemer's eloquence, we ſhall have reaſon to join the officers in their admirations, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that our great Redeemer's elocution was ſuperior to all praiſe: ſuch ſurely that diſcourſe muſt be, which addreſſed to others, and on a divine ſubject, could diſarm the reſolution of the moſt determined enemy, and penetrate the receſſes of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling heart.</p>
               <p>NOR were the officers the only perſons who were affected with this divine diſcourſe: for the ſurrounding multitude were ſenſible of very remarkable impreſſions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their wonder in various conjectures; many of them declared he muſt certainly be one of the old prophets, and others, that he could be no leſs than the Meſſiah him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; others, led away with the common miſtake, that he was born at Nazareth, aſked, with ſnearing diſdain, if the Meſſiah was to come out of Galilee, when the ſcripture has abſolutely declared, that he was to be born in Bethlehem, the native town of his father David. Thus we are informed, <hi>Many of the people, therefore, when they heard this ſaying, ſaid, Of a truth, this is the prophet: others ſaid, this is the Chriſt; but ſome ſaid, Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee? Hath not the ſcripture ſaid, That Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was.</hi> This diſpute was carried to ſuch an height, that ſome of them, knowing that the officers were ſent to apprehend our Redeemer, threatened to lay hands on him: but divine Providence would not permit them to execute their cruel deſign; for though <hi>ſome of them would have taken him, yet no man laid hands on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE officers now returned to the council, and were aſked, with warmth, why they had not brought JESUS of Nazareth, whom they were ſent to apprehend? They endeavoured to excuſe themſelves, by relating the manner in which they were overcome, and diſarmed by his eloquence: <hi>No man,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſpake like this man.</hi> But if they thought to ſoften the reſentment of the council, by declaring what a wonderful man JESUS CHRIST was, and what an heart-affecting ſtrain of divine eloquence flowed from his lips, they were very much miſtaken: the perjudices of the rulers of Iſrael were too de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? But this people, who knoweth not the law, are curſed.</hi> They thought it a piece of the moſt unparalleled impudence, that the common people ſhould preſume to acknowledge JESUS to be the Meſſiah, when the great doctors of the law, the chief prieſts and Phariſees, and all the learned men of the nation, publicly oppoſed his preaching, defamed his character, and determined to deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>BUT their pride and envy ſoon received a ſevere reprimand from Nicodemus, who had formerly attended on JESUS by night; and was convinced that he was the Meſſiah, though he did not openly confeſs him, for fear of the Jews. On this occaſion he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the pride and ſelf-ſufficiency of the enemies of JESUS, by inquiring, <hi>Does our law condemn any man before he is heard.</hi> They had juſt now condemned their officers for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the law, when it appeared that themſelves where more ignorant, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to condemn a perſon before they had proved him guilty: they were acting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the fundamental principles of the law of equity, at the ſame time, that they boaſted their ſuperior knowledge of, and cloſeſt attachment to its precepts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:029927_0128_0FE33722CE2A8A88"/>THIS ſharp reproof of Nicodemus, ſo highly exaſperated the whole council, that, with an air of indignation and contempt, they aſked him, if he alſo was one of thoſe mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had joined together to ſupport the pretenſions of a Galilean, though the ſcriptures had plainly declared, that Bethlehem was the place of the Meſſiah's nativity: to which they added, that, if he refuſed to liſten to them, he ſhould ſearch the ſcriptures, and he would ſoon be convinced, that the great prophet, mentioned by Moſes, was not to be born in Galilee: <hi>Art thou alſo of Galilee? ſaid they. Search and look: for out of Galilee ariſeth no prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE council ſoon broke up, after making this anſwer to Nicodemus, and our Lord, well knowing their malicious intentions, retired to the Mount of Olives, where he ſpent the night with his diſciples; but early the next morning he returned to the temple, and taught the people.</p>
               <p>THE Scribes and Phariſees purſued him with unabating reſentment, and were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined either to render him odious to the people, or an offender in the eye of the Roman governor. Accordingly, they brought before him, a woman who had been taken in the act of adultery; deſiring him to declare what puniſhment ſhe ought to ſuffer: <hi>This woman,</hi> ſaid they to our great Redeemer, <hi>was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moſes in the law, commanded us, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned: but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> Had JESUS preſumed to pardon the adultereſs, and inflicted no puniſhment on her, they would, doubtleſs, have repreſented him as a perſon who contradicted the law, and favoured adultery, which would certainly have rendered him odious in the eyes of the people. On the other hand, had he ordered her to be ſtoned, it would have afforded an opportunity of accuſing him to the Roman governor, as a perſon who ſtirred up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rebellion; the Romans having, at that time, taken the power of life and death out of the hands of the Jews. But JESUS well knew their wicked intentions, and therefore made them no anſwer, <hi>but ſtooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</hi> They, not ſatisfied, ſtill continued preſſing him to give an anſwer; when, at laſt, JESUS, in alluſion to the law, which ordered that the hands of the witneſſes, by whoſe teſtimony a criminal was convicted, ſhould firſt be upon him, ſaid, <hi>He that is without ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her.</hi> Our Lord well knew the hearts, and the ſecret crimes of theſe furious accuſers, and he delivered theſe words in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as convinced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This ſudden rebuke, had ſuch an effect on them, that they could not reply, but immediately departed, no doubt, fearing if they had ſtaid, JESUS would have expoſed their moſt ſecret tranſactions, and abominable crimes: they, therefore, durſt not proceed in their accuſation, but, <hi>being convicted by their own conſciences, went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt, even unto the laſt: and Jeſus was left alone, and the woman,</hi> who had been <hi>ſtanding in the midſt.</hi> JESUS had been, all the while the Jews were retiring, ſtooping down and writing on the ground, as though he did not perceive what they were about: but now riſing up, and looking upon the woman who ſtood alone, he aſked her, if ſhe had been condemned? To which ſhe anſwered in the negative. Our Lord ſaw her covered with ſhame, and knowing her repentance was ſincere, he looked upon her with an eye of pity and forgivneſs; and diſmiſſed her with theſe gracious words, <hi>Neither do I condemn thee; go and ſin no more.</hi>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> declareth himſelf to be the Light of the World, and juſtifieth his Doctrine againſt the Phariſees: He promiſeth Freedom, through Knowledge of the Truth, to thoſe Jews who believed on him: Confuteth their vain Boaſt of being Abraham's Seed, and the Children of God: Anſwereth their Reviling, by ſhewing his Authority and Dignity; and, by Miracle, reſcueth himſelf from their Attempts to ſtone him: He reſtoreth to Sight, a Man that was born blind, who relateth to his Neighbours the Means of his Cure; and he is brought to the Phariſees, who examine ſtrictly into the Fact, and are offended with his Acknowledgment of the divine Miſſion of the Author; they excommunicate him; he is received of <hi>JESUS,</hi> and confeſſeth him. <hi>CHRIST</hi> taxeth the Phariſees with ſpiritual Blindneſs: He declareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Door, and the good Shepherd: Divers opinions concerning him. <hi>CHRIST</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the fiery Zeal of James and John againſt the Samaritans, who would not receive him; and propoſeth Terms to three Perſons, who offer to follow him: He ſendeth out the ſeventy Diſciples, a ſecond time, to work Miracles and to preach: He pronounceth a Woe againſt Chorazin, Bethſaida, and Capernaum: The ſeventy return with joy; <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſheweth them wherein to rejoice: He thanketh his Father for having revealed his Goſpel to the Simple only: He teacheth a Lawyer how to attain eternal Life; and, by the Parable of the good Samaritan, ſheweth whom we are to conſider as our Neighbour.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>JESUS having, by an amazing diſplay of his wiſdom and penetration, defeated the malice, and mortified the pride of the Scribes and Phariſees, and they being ſent away aſhamed, under a full conviction that he knew the ſecrets of their hearts and lives; our Lord having, by his ſuperior wiſdom, made uſe of their own conſciences to defeat their cruel and villainous deſigns, he turned to the people, and with the utmoſt propriety declared, that he was <hi>the light of the world;</hi> that light which could penetrate through the darkneſs of the human heart, and diſcover and bring to light the dark deſigns and wicked devices of the ſons of men; that light which could pierce through the outſide ſhew of ſanctity and holineſs, and diſcover the ſecret abominations of the moſt proud and accompliſhed hypocrite; and that light which could diſcover the paths of darkneſs and error, and lead thoſe who are enabled to follow our Redeemer, in the road to eternal bleſſedneſs and reſt. Hence, our bleſſed Saviour declared, 'I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life.' John viii.12.</p>
               <p>SOME of the enemies of our Lord were amongſt the people who heard this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were ſo highly provoked, that they told him, he muſt be a deceiver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he boaſted of himſelf: <hi>Thou beareſt record of thyſelf,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>thy record is not true.</hi> To this, the great Saviour of ſinners replied, that he did not call himſelf the light of the world, from a principle of pride and falſehood, but it was a title that juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, which they would acknowledge, had they conceived true ideas of the Meſſiah's kingdom: but their carnal views had blinded their eyes, and corrupted, and depraved their judgments, ſo that they did not know from what authority he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his commiſſion, nor whether he ſhould return when he had executed it: <hi>Though I bear record of myſelf,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I go: but ye cannot tell whence I came, and whither I go. Ye judge after the fleſh: I
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029927_0130_0FE33725E4692EA8"/>
judge no man.</hi> Nor, added he, is there any truth or juſtice in your remark, that I bear witneſs of myſelf, and have none to witneſs for me: for, let it be known, that my Father is with me; and joins me in whatſoever I ſay or do: <hi>And yet if I judge,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me. It is alſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your law, that the teſtimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witneſs of myſelf, and the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews then inquired, where is thy Father, the other witneſs to whom thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeſt? To which our Lord replied, that their conduct and fooliſh inquiries, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated, that they were ſtrangers, both to him and to his Father: for, had they known who he was, they would certainly have been at no loſs to know who it was that he called his Father: had they known that he was the Meſſiah, they muſt have underſtood that his Father was the great JEHOVAH, that all-wiſe and all-powerful Being, who was the great Maker, the all-wiſe and all-potent Preſerver, the ſupreme Governor, and King of the univerſe: <hi>Ye neither know me, nor my Father,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer; <hi>if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS diſcourſe, the evangeliſt informs us, was held in the treaſury, where the cheſt was placed for receiving the offerings of all who came up to worſhip in the temple, and muſt, therefore, have been a place of great reſort, being frequented by all ſorts of people: but, notwithſtanding the public manner in which our Lord advanced his claim to the character of the Meſſiah, and the pride and rage of the Scribes and Phariſees, no man attempted to ſeize him; Divine Providence did not permit them to put their cruel deſigns into execution, becauſe his hour, or the time of his ſufferings and death, was not yet come.</p>
               <p>AFTER this diſcourſe was ended, JESUS repeated what he had before told them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he ſhould ſhortly depart from them, and that then they ſhould ſeek him, and not be able to find him: <hi>I go my way,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall die in your ſins. Whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> Perhaps, in theſe words, he might allude to the ſtate of the Jewiſh nation after his death, and may be ſuppoſed to ſay, I ſoon ſhall depart from amongſt you, and ſuch miſeries, and calamities, will overſpread the land, that you will be glad of a prophet to direct your conduct, and to pray for you: the Roman armies will ſpread ſuch devaſtation and horror over the face of your country, that you will then earneſtly wiſh for the coming of the Meſſiah, in expectation of being delivered, by his power from your cruel enemy: but ye ſhall then find your miſtake: ye ſhall die in your ſins, and be for ever excluded the realms of bleſſedneſs and reſt.</p>
               <p>BUT the Jews were very far from underſtanding what he meant by going from them, they were ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that he deſigned to put an end to his life, with his own hands; for they thought the only retreat where they could not find him, muſt be the dark and ſilent chambers of the grave: <hi>Will he kill himſelf,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>becauſe he ſaith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> To this, the bleſſed JESUS replied, your baſe inſinuation, betrays at once, the wickedneſs of your hearts, and the corruption and depravity of your natures: ye are from the earth, and are partakers of all the corruption and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity conſequent on the fall of man; and from the evil paſſions which ariſe in your own wicked hearts, you form your conceptions of me; and, thinking me like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conclude, that I can be capable of committing ſo horrid a crime as ſelf-murder: but you are miſtaken in me; my extraction, and my diſpoſition are very different from yours: I am not of this world; I am no partaker of the evils conſequent on ſin; I have no propenſity to corrupt and evil paſſions; my mind is not tainted with the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029927_0131_0FE3372D1A84A2A0"/>
corruption of human nature, the ſource of temptation, and the fountain of all evil: I came from above, and if you believe in me, you will find a remedy for thoſe evils which flow from the bitter fountain of the fall of man, and will be cleanſed from that pollution which flows from your earthly origin; but if ye ſtill continue in unbelief, <hi>ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews, in order to vindicate themſelves, inquired what ſort of a perſon he was, or who he pretended to be? To which our Lord replied, <hi>Even the ſame that I ſaid unto you from the beginning;</hi> meaning <hi>the light of the world,</hi> which he had ſtiled himſelf in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſcourſe: adding, <hi>I have many things to ſay and to judge of you: but he that ſent me is true; and I ſpake to the world thoſe things which I have heard of him.</hi> However plain this diſcourſe may appear, it was not underſtood by the ſtupid Jews; they did not perceive, <hi>that he ſpake to them of the Father.</hi> But JESUS told them, that when they had crucified him, they would be convinced by the miracles attending that awful hour, his reſurrection from the dead, the deſcent of the Holy Spirit on his diſciples, and the deſtruction of the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h nation, both who he was, and who the Father was, that ſent him: <hi>When ye have lifted up the Son of man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>then ſhall ye know that I am he, And that I do nothing of myſelf; but as my Father hath taught me, I ſpeak theſe things. And he that ſent me is with me; the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS he ſpake theſe words, many of the Jews believed him to be the Meſſiah; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by his being lifted up, they did not underſtand his crucifixion, but his being exalted to the throne of David: but JESUS told them, if they perſevered in the belief of his word, they ſhould really become his diſciples, and being fully inſtructed in every doctrine of the goſpel, they ſhould not only be freed from the ſlavery of ſin, but alſo from the ceremonial part of the law of Moſes: <hi>If ye continue in my word,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>then are ye my diſciples indeed; and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews, on hearing him declare, that they ſhould be made free, haſtily and warmly replied, <hi>We be Abraham's ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man.</hi> This aſſertion, if taken in a literal ſenſe, was abſolutely falſe, the whole nation being, at that very time, in bondage to the Romans; nor were their anceſtors any ſtrangers to bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, having ſeverely felt the tyrannical yoke of the Egyptian, Aſſyrian, and Babylon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kings. It muſt therefore be ſuppoſed, that the expreſſion was meant in a metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſenſe, and alluded to ſpiritual bondage: in this ſenſe, it was a freedom in reſpect to religion which they aſſerted, and they meant, that they were the deſcendants of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious anceſtors, who, in the worſt of times, had preſerved ſentiments in religion and government worthy the poſterity of Abraham; nor had the hotteſt perſecution of the Aſſyrian kings, been able to compel them to embrace the religion of the Heathens; in reſpect to truth, they were never in bondage to any man, and they aſked our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, <hi>How ſayeſt thou, ye ſhall be made free?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN anſwer to this queſtion, JESUS replied, that they who gave themſelves up to a vicious courſe of life, and to the gratification of their ſenſual appetites, were the worſt of ſlaves, and it was highly neceſſary for them to conſider whether this character did not belong to themſelves: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> And, as a ſlave connot be aſſured of the continuance of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's favour, nor of abiding in his houſe continually, ſo our great Redeemer obſerved, that his Father might juſtly, for their ſins, deprive them of the external privileges
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029927_0132_0FE3373043906A20"/>
which they had ſo groſsly abuſed: as their ſins had rendered them bond-ſlaves to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, they might expect to fall under the ſevereſt marks of his diſpleaſure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they prevented the dreadful evils, conſequent on their wickedneſs, by believing on his Son, and receiving him, who alone was able to make them free indeed, and place them in the heavenly Jeruſalem. Our Lord then proceeded to inform them, that though, in a natural ſenſe, they were the ſeed of Abraham; yet, in a moral ſenſe, they were the offspring of Satan, which was fully manifeſted by their unjuſt, and cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deſtroy their great deliverer: <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that ye are Abraham's ſeed; but ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my word hath no place in you. I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father: and ye do that which you have ſeen with your father.</hi> To this the Jews haſtily and angrily replied, <hi>Abraham is our father:</hi> but our Redeemer informed them, that it appeared from their conduct, that they were of another original: <hi>If,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye ſeek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having declared to the Jews, that it was manifeſt from their deeds, and their wicked inclinations, whoſe children they were; they, willing to juſtify themſelves, replied with ſome warmth: <hi>We be not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</hi> By theſe expreſſions, the Jews did not mean a natural, but a ſpiritual lineage, and by their not being born of fornication, their being free from idolatry, which, in the language of the prophets, is repreſented as fornication and adultery: they were not idolaters themſelves, nor born of idolatrous parents, and therefore, they ſtyled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the children of God. But JESUS gave them to underſtand, that if they were the children of God, they would manifeſt their relation by their love to his Son: <hi>If God were your Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye would love me: for I proceedeth forth and came from God; neither came I of myſelf, but he ſent me:</hi> but ye, continued our great Redeemer, are of your father the devil; ye appear in his likeneſs, and continue to gratify the evil incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and diabolical paſſions, which ye have learnt of him, and derived from him; falſehood, pride, and cruelty, are the paſſions which he conſtantly inſpires, and theſe are abundantly manifeſted in your temper and conduct; he delights in murder and blood, and you are plotting againſt the life of the innocent; falſehood and lies are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, and he never ſpeaketh the truth, but to put off ſome lie which he hath joined to it: <hi>Ye are,</hi> ſaid the exalted Saviour of ſinners, <hi>of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe their is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it. And becauſe I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord then publicly challenged all his enemies, to prove him guilty of any falſehood: <hi>Which of you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>convicteth me of ſin?</hi> Are any of you able to ſhew that I have done any thing which renders me unworthy of belief? Can you prove that I have taught falſe doctrine? Have I reproved you unjuſtly for your actions? Have I charged you with crimes you were not guilty of? And can any of you prove me guilty of any ſinful action, or prove any part of my conduct to be inconſiſtent with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have aſſumed? If none of you can do this, but muſt confeſs that my doctrine and life are ſuch as might be expected from a meſſenger ſent from God; <hi>Why do ye not believe me?</hi> But the reaſon is plain, you do not belong to God, ye have no intereſt in his favour, nor are partakers of his grace: <hi>He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS declaration exaſperated and enraged the Jews to the higheſt pitch, and with a mixture of diſdain and contempt, they replied, <hi>Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029927_0133_0FE33731C885F9F0"/>
and haſt a devil?</hi> His calling the deſcendants of Abraham the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, they thought was a ſufficient proof, that either he muſt be a profligate wretch, which they meant by calling him a Samaritan, or elſe muſt be inſtigated by ſome evil ſpirit. But JESUS replied, that he was not under the dominion of any evil ſpirit, but ſpoke the words of eternal truth; he was not in league with hell, nor in alliance with the prince of darkneſs: on the contrary, he honoured his Father, by ſpeaking the words of truth, which he ſent him to deliver: <hi>I have not a devil,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but I honour my Father, and ye do diſhonour me, and I ſeek not mine own glory; there is one that ſeeketh and judgeth.</hi> Our great Redeemer, by theſe words, gave them to underſtand, that he did not court their applauſe, or fear their reproaches: for there was one concerned, that was able to vindicate his honour, and ſeverely puniſh all who ſhould dare to attack him with unjuſt and malignant reproaches.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer, having vindicated his character, proceeded to make a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which very much ſurpriſed the Jews with whom he was converſing, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if a man keep my words, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> The Jews, thinking theſe words had reference to a natural death, cried out with an air of triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Now we know that thou haſt a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets: and thou ſayeſt, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never taſte of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom makeſt thou thyſelf?</hi> John viii.52, 53. To this our great Redeemer replied, that as they had lately objected to the teſtimony which he bare of himſelf, he ſhould not reſt the cauſe on that foundation, but refer it to his Father, whom they acknowledged to be the ſupreme Lord of heaven and earth: but, though they pretended to worſhip the true God, they were totally ignorant of him; they neither formed juſt conceptions of him, nor worſhipped him in the manner they ought; they were not the perſons by whom he required to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and whom he always accepted: on the contrary, JESUS declared, that he formed juſt ideas of God, and obeyed his precepts; if he was to ſay he did not know him, he would be a liar, like the Jews with whom he was converſing. And as to the patriarch Abraham, of whom they boaſted ſo much, he earneſtly deſired to ſee the day of the Meſſiah, and had ſo much of it revealed to him, as filled his heart with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>If I honour myſelf,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye ſay, he is your God, yet ye have not known him, but I know him; and if I ſhould ſay, I know him not, I ſhould be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his ſaying. Your father Abraham rejoiced,</hi> or deſired, <hi>to ſee my days; and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews underſtanding theſe words in a natural ſenſe, concluded that he affirmed, that he was before Abraham, and knowing that he was under fifty years old, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this declaration as abſolutely impoſſible, and highly ridiculous. They had no conception of his divine nature, though he had ſo often told them he was the Son of God, and, of conſequence, exiſted with the Father before the commencement of time. This groſs ſtupidity and perverſeneſs, induced our great Redeemer to aſſert his dignity in the plaineſt terms; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, before Abraham was, I am.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſo enraged the Jews, that they ruſhed upon him with the utmoſt violence and fury; and, as nothing leſs than his immediate death would ſatisfy them, they took up ſtones to ſtone him: but JESUS, either rendering himſelf inviſible, or filling the minds of his enemies with confuſion, and abſence of thought, paſſed immediately and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly through the crowd, and departed out of the temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:029927_0134_0FE337334B7793D0"/>WHILE JESUS remained in Jeruſalem, he ſaw in one of the ſtreets of the city, a man who had been blind from his birth: the ſight of ſo diſtreſſed an object, ſoon excited the compaſſion of the kind and benevolent Saviour of ſinners; the various affronts and indignities which he had ſo lately received from the Jews, could not prevent him from the exertion of his omnipotence in favour of ſuch objects as theſe, though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to that cruel, malicious, and unbelieving nation; he was not to be provoked by their crimes, ſo far as to withhold his bleſſings from them. Accordingly, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this poor blind man, not with a ſhort and careleſs view, but with a ſteady and fixed attention; he caſt on him the eyes of his divine compaſſion, and determined to afford him unexpected relief.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples, remarking their Lord's attention to this diſtreſſed, helpleſs perſon, and, doubtleſs, imagining that as he had engaged the pity of the only perſon who was able to help him, he would ſoon, by divine power and goodneſs, be reſtored to ſight, aſked their Maſter, what was the cauſe of his blindneſs: and they were the more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to be ſatisfied in this matter, as the diſorder had commenced before his birth: they had learned from the law, that ſin was the cauſe of affliction and bodily diſtemper, and that the Lord viſits the iniquities of the fathers upon their children; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they inquired of their Maſter, who did ſin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? To this queſtion, our Lord replied, that this diſorder was not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequence of the man's own ſin, nor that of his parents, but that he was born blind, that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</p>
               <p>BY this reply, our bleſſed Saviour has taught us, that a curious inquiry into the cauſe of thoſe afflictions and diſtreſſes of particular perſons, which ſeem very extraordinary, and are peculiarly affecting, and unaccountably deplorable, is impertinent and vain; and our cenſure of ſuch perſons as the greateſt of ſinners, and bringing down re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable vengeance from heaven on their wickedneſs, is cruel and unjuſt; the deſigns of the great Governor of the univerſe are not open to our view; he is perfectly and immutably wiſe; we are full of blindneſs and folly; he knows how to anſwer the ends of his own government, and accompliſh the deſigns of his grace, by the afflictions and diſtreſſes, which he ſometimes permits to fall upon his own people: while the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our hearts, and our fooliſh pride and vanity, are prone to aſcribe thoſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a man's own perſonal vices, which are for the glory of God, and intended to work out the ſuperior good of the ſuffering perſon, or ſome way or other to promote the real advantage of mankind.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour having declared the cauſe of this man's blindneſs, namely, that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him, further declared, I muſt work the work of him that ſent me, while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work: declaring to his diſciples, and all the world, his unwearied labour, and ceaſeleſs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care in the work of his Almighty Father; in this he laboured inceſſantly, both day and night, during the time of his ſojourning in the fleſh; to this only he directed his thoughts, with unwearied ardour, and unremitting diligence: this he eſteemed even as his meat and drink, and ſuffered the neglect of his ordinary food, that he might finiſh the great work which he came into the world to accompliſh, and bring about the ſalvation of loſt periſhing ſinners: to accompliſh this he left that glory which he had with his Father in the higheſt heavens, came down into a world of labour and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and went about doing good.</p>
               <p>AS it was now the Sabbath-day, and our Lord was about to perform an act of mercy and benevolence, which required ſome little labour, it appears, that the above declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>HENCE it may be obſerved, that the miracles wrought by our great Redeemer, were not only plain proofs of his miſſion, and full evidences of his being the Meſſiah, but had a reference to the ſpiritual nature of his kingdom, and were emblems of the various parts of his divine character, and victorious deeds. Thus, his miraculouſly feeding the multitudes with common bread, was a plain indication, that he came into the world to ſeed the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lievers in his name with the bread of life, that all-nouriſhing food for the ſoul. His reſtoring ſight to the blind, was a lively emblem of the tendency of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and efficacy of his power, to diſpel the darkneſs of the ſoul, and illuminate the blinded underſtanding of men. His healing their bodies, repreſented his power to heal the ſoul, and was an evidence of his authority to forgive ſins, as all bodily diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rs are the conſequences of ſin; and a removal of the puniſhment, ſtrongly implied a power equal to the removal of the guilt. His caſting out devils, was an earneſt of his final victory over the prince of darkneſs, and his future triumph over all the powers of hell. His raiſing particular perſons from the dead, was the beginning of his triumph over death, and a demonſtration of his ability to accompliſh a general reſurrection. And finally, his curing all promiſcuouſly, who applied to him, ſhewed that he was the friend of ſinners, and that none who came to him would be rejected, let their ſins be ever ſo numerous, or their caſe ever ſo deplorable. Such are the ſpiritual truths which may be collected from the miracles of the Son of God; and accordingly, we find, that this exalted perſon himſelf, at, or ſoon after the performing his miracles, while the great events were freſh on the memory, often turned his diſcourſe to the ſpiritual things they repreſented.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour having declared, that he was the light of the world, <hi>he ſpit on the ground, and made clay of the ſpittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and ſaid unto him, Go waſh in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, ſent.) He went his way therefore, and waſhed, and came ſeeing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is no doubt but our bleſſed Saviour, could have performed this miracle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any external means; indeed the means he uſed on this occaſion, were ſo far from being likely to effect the cure, that they ſeemed calculated to produce a contrary effect. We muſt therefore conclude, that theſe means were deſigned, to direct our attention to higher myſteries, and ſhew us, that it can be no other power than that which firſt created man out of clay, that enlightens the dark mind of the dead ſinner, and gives ſpiritual light to thoſe eyes, which are cloſed by the thick darkneſs of guilt.</p>
               <p>WHETHER the blind man, whoſe caſe we are now conſidering, was acquainted with the name and character of our Redeemer, the evangeliſts have not informed us: but as his miracles had been publiſhed in Jeruſalem ſo often, as well as in all the country round, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that this man, who reſided at Jeruſalem, could be totally ignorant of them; and it ſeems, by his ready obedience to the directions of the Son of God, though the means directed, ſeemed to have no tendency to promote the cure, that
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029927_0137_0FE3373F39C35E68"/>
he knew who it was that gave him thoſe directions: and we find, that he was amply rewarded for the readineſs of his obedience, by receiving the gift of ſight.</p>
               <p>SO wonderful an event, could not fail of engaging the attention, and exciting the ſurpriſe of all that beheld it; and thoſe who had often ſeen the blind man in his dark and deplorable condition, it may be expected, would be very particular in their inquiries into the means of ſo ſingular, and ſurpriſing an event: it was, doubtleſs, the ſubject of general converſation: and one would have thought, it might have been the cauſe of general converſation; but the obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of the Jewiſh nation, was not to be overcome; their unbelief and hardneſs of heart, would not give way to the cleareſt evidence. Great was the ſurpriſe of the neighbours, and friends, of the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon: They which before had ſeen him, that he was blind, ſaid, is not this he that ſat and begged? Some ſaid, this is he; others ſaid, it is like him; but he ſaid, I am he.</p>
               <p>THE poor man's heart was full of gratitude and joy, and therefore, perceiving his neighbours to doubt the identity of his perſon, he proclaimed himſelf to be the very ſame whom they had lately ſeen begging in total darkneſs; I am he, thus wonderfully bleſſed with ſight by the mighty power of God, ſaid he; I am the man who was blind from my birth, whom ye have all ſeen, and many of you have relieved me in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable diſtreſs; I am he who was even, from my mothers womb, involved in pitchy darkneſs, but now with joy and wonder, which I cannot expreſs, behold the beauteous beams of day.</p>
               <p>ON hearing ſo frank and full a declaration, they were anxious to know how this great event was produced; and they haſtily inquired, How were thine eyes opened? To which the man replied, a man, that is called JESUS, made clay, an anointed mine eyes, and ſaid unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and waſh: and I went and waſhed, and I received ſight. They then aſked him where the perſon was who had performed ſo wonderful, merciful, and beneficial a work? To which the man replied, <hi>I know not:</hi> for JESUS had retired while the man went to waſh in the pool of Siloam; perhaps our Lord choſe to retire, to avoid the applauſe of the people, which would naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſo ſtupendous a work, and which, we frequently find in the goſpels, he was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly careful to ſhun.</p>
               <p>THE perſons who were witneſſes of this wonderful event, either out of envy againſt JESUS, or being deſirous to ſearch the affair to the bottom, brought the man who was the ſubject of this miracle, before the council, as proper judges of the matter: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as ſoon as he was placed before the aſſembly, the Phariſees began, in a brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beating way, to queſtion him how he recovered his ſight? However awful and terrible ſuch an aſſembly might be to a poor beggar, the man boldly mentioned the name of JESUS, and poſitively declared—He put clay upon mine eyes, and I waſhed, and do ſee. The Phariſees, having heard this account of the miracle, maliciouſly declared, that the perſon who had performed it, was a deceiver: for, if he was a prophet, he would be an obſerver of the law, which he had openly violated, by working this work on the Sabbath-day. But ſome in the council, with a ſpirit of greater candour and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave it as their opinion, that no deceiver could work ſo great and beneficial a work; for no wicked man would have either inclination or power to perform it.</p>
               <p>THE court, being thus divided in their opinion with regard to the character of JESUS, they aſked the man, what he thought of the perſon who had reſtored him to fight? To which he boldly and plainly replied, <hi>He is a prophet.</hi> But the Jews, ſtill
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029927_0138_0FE33740C12DAA90"/>
hoped to invalidate the miracle, and therefore inſinuated, that it was not true, that this man was really born blind: to come to the bottom of this matter, they ſent for his parents, and aſked them, whether he was their ſon, and if he really was born blind, and by what means he had received his ſight? To which they anſwered, that he was moſt certainly their ſon, and was born blind; but by what means he had received his ſight, or what perſon had conferred this great bleſſing upon him, they could not tell: but, as their ſon was of age to anſwer for himſelf, they referred them to him: <hi>Theſe words ſpake his parents, becauſe they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man ſhould confeſs that Jeſus was the Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the conduct of the parents of this poor man, we may behold the great evil of the fear of man, and how powerfully this ſlaviſh principle acts on the mind; they well knew by what means their ſon had received his ſight; and, like him, they ſhould, with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and joy, have confeſſed the divine hand which had wrought this wonderful work; and dared to have acknowledged this extraordinary perſon before all the world, whatever the conſequences of ſuch conduct might have been. Let us hence learn the weakneſs of human nature, and never preſume too much on our own ſtrength, but implore the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Spirit at all times, and not love the praiſe of men more than the Favour of God.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees, finding all their attempts to diſapprove or leſſen this miracle, did but tend to eſtabliſh the matter of fact, and make it ſhine with greater luſtre, proceeded to their old method of calumniating the divine author of it: <hi>They called again the man that had been born blind, and ſaid unto him, Give God the praiſe: we know that this man is a ſinner.</hi> To which the man anſwered, <hi>Whether he be a ſinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS anſwer was not ſufficient to ſatisfy the proud and envious oppoſers of the Son of God, but they ſought to confound the poor man, who had thus plainly and boldly affirmed the truth reſpecting a matter of fact, in which it was impoſſible he ſhould be miſtaken, with a multiplicity of queſtions, and would meanly lead a poor ſimple beggar into all the windings of ſophiſtry; and with this view aſked him 'What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?' Theſe queſtions they had aſked before, and received plain and poſitive anſwers to each: but they ſeemed now to repeat them with a deſign, that the man, by repeating the manner in which he received the cure, might be ſenſible that JESUS had, by effecting this miracle, violated the Sabbath, and muſt, of conſequence, be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſter. Thus the enemies of our Redeemer would have perſuaded the perſon who had received the invaluable bleſſing of ſight, to join with them in the judgment they formed of the great perſon who had been his generous benefactor: but their obſtinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs appeared ſo plain to him, that he boldly anſwered, <hi>I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? Will ye alſo be his diſciples?</hi>

               <p>THIS anſwer was received by the council with indignation, ſcorn, and contempt; for <hi>they reviled him, and ſaid, thou art his diſciple, but we are Moſes's diſciples. We know that God ſpake unto Moſes: as for this follow, ye know not whence he is.</hi> The poor beggar was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that ſo extraordinary a perſon, and one who poſſeſſed ſuch wonderful powers, and exerted them for the good of mankind, ſhould be unknown to the rulers of Iſrael, <hi>Why herein is a marvellous thing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes: we know that God heareth not ſinners; but if a man be a worſhipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began, it was not heard, that any man opened the eyes, of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</hi>

                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:029927_0139_0FE3374B9525AA70"/>SUCH was the plain and powerful reaſoning of this poor man; his inference was juſt and natural, and founded on a plain matter of fact, and principles which could not be denied: they all knew, nor durſt they deny, that <hi>God heareth not ſinners</hi>: they all knew, that God had heard JESUS; the miracle which he had juſt now wrought, and which could not be denied, plainly proved this; for it was a miracle which never had been performed by any man ſince the beginning of the world: it was far above the reach of the powers of nature, or the attainments of human art; and, therefore, its origin muſt be truly divine. It therefore undeniably followed, that JESUS was not a ſinner, but ſent from God, otherwiſe he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees were not ignorant, that this argument was concluſive; they felt its whole force, and well knew that it could not be reſiſted; accordingly, they did not attempt to anſwer it, but had recourſe to puniſhment, and abuſive language: <hi>Thou waſt altogether born in ſins, and doſt thou teach us,</hi> ſaid they: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> impudent illiterate mortal, whoſe underſtanding is as dark as thy body lately was, doſt thou preſume to judge and determine, and diſſent in opinion from the wiſe and learned! Thou, who waſt born under the heavieſt puniſhment of ſins, doſt thou pretend to inſtruct the rulers of the people, who are eminent for their knowledge of the law! Having thus vented their pride and envy, in reviling the poor man, the evangeliſt adds, <hi>they caſt him out:</hi> that is, they paſſed on him the ſentence of excommunication, which is the higheſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was in their power to inflict: but, though he was cut off from the Jewiſh ſynagogue and ſociety, he was received into a ſociety, whoſe privileges are great, and from which he could never be excluded by any unjuſt ſentence, by any body of men, however powerful: he was united to a ſociety whoſe members are never cut off, but will unite in happineſs, love, joy, and glory, during a boundleſs eternity.</p>
               <p>THAT this poor man was received amongſt the number of the diſciples of CHRIST, is manifeſt from the converſation which ſoon after paſſed between the reſtored perſon and our great Redeemer: <hi>Jeſus heard that they had caſt him out; and when he had found him, he ſaid unto him, Doſt thou believe in the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE man did not know how to anſwer this queſtion, till he knew who was the great perſon which JESUS had mentioned to him; and therefore, he inquired, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? Our great Redeemer would not keep him in ſuſpence, but immediately and explicitly replied, <hi>Thou haſt both ſeen him, and it is he who talketh with thee.</hi> The poor man anſwered, with gratitude and joy, <hi>Lord I believe; and he worſhipped him.</hi> Our Lord graciouſly accepted of his adoration, and glancing at the pride, and perverſeneſs of the Phariſees, he ſaid, <hi>For judgment I am come into this world, that they which ſee not, might ſee; and that they which ſee, might be made blind.</hi> Some of the Phariſees, which were with him, heard theſe words, and perceiving the reference to themſelves, they aſked, are we blind alſo? To which our Lord replied, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin: but now ye ſay, we ſee, therefore your ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord then, to ſhew the diſparity between himſelf, and thoſe proud, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal teachers, aſſumed the character of a ſhepherd, and diſplayed his love, tenderneſs, and care for his choſen followers, by the ſimilitude of the care and watchfulneſs of a good ſhepherd over his flock, while ſuch falſe pretenders, and hypocritical teachers as the Phariſees, might fitly be compared to a gang of thieves, whoſe only view is to diſturb and deſtroy: <hi>The thief cometh not, but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy: I am come that the ſheep might have life, and they might have it more abundantly. I am the good ſhepherd: the good ſhepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:029927_0140_0FE3374DF1DC09C0"/>AND further to ſhew the abſolute neceſſity of believing in him, and receiving his doctrine, our great Redeemer compared himſelf to a door; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, I am the door of the ſheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. He that entereth not by the door into the ſheep-fold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief, and a robber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH theſe ſimilitudes contained a very ſevere reproof, directed to the falſe teachers of Iſrael, they did not underſtand the meaning of them, and the people were much divided in their ſentiments concerning him and his teaching; ſome ſaid, <hi>He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? Others ſaid, Theſe are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the pride, envy, obſtinate perverſeneſs, and implacable reſentment of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, we ſhould learn to contemplate the crafty inſinuation, and ſubtle endeavours of the enemies of the croſs of CHRIST in theſe latter times: nor need we be ſurpriſed, if we find the ſame malicious inſinuations in different ſhapes levelled againſt ourſelves, if we are enabled to embrace the truths of the goſpel, and to confeſs before all men the glory, honour and dignity of him who hath opened our eyes, and brought us <hi>out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> It is contrary to the nature of the world, or worldly minded men, to love our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or to eſteem thoſe who profeſs to know him, and bear witneſs concerning the world, that its works are evil. Let us not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be diſcouraged if we find the world to hate us, and load us with unjuſt reproaches for our attachment to the cauſe of our great Redeemer; but, like the blind man, whoſe caſe we have been conſidering, let us openly and boldly profeſs the truth, and declare the power of God, who hath illuminated our dark minds, and led us in the paths of everlaſting light and happineſs.</p>
               <p>THE feaſt of dedication now drew near, and our Lord prepared to go to Jeruſalem, to be preſent at the ſolemnity. This feaſt was not appointed by Moſes, but by that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warrior, and heroic reformer, Judas Maccabeus, in commemoration of his having cleanſed the temple, and reſtored its worſhip, after both had been prophaned and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by that abominable tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes.</p>
               <p>BUT, though this feaſt was of human inſtitution, our Lord choſe to be preſent at it, although he knew that freſh attempts would be made againſt his life; his time on earth he knew was ſhort, his public miniſtry was drawing to a period, and, therefore, he would not omit any opportunity of preaching to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and doing good to the children of men; nor did he now, as he had formerly done, travel in private, but openly declared his intention of going to Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>THE road to the capital from Galilee, to which our Lord had retired after the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of reſtoring ſight to the blind man, lay through Samaria. The inhabitants of this country entertained the moſt inveterate hatred againſt all who worſhipped in the temple at Jeruſalem: JESUS was no ſtranger to this diſpoſition of the Samaritans, and therefore he ſent meſſengers before him, that they might find reception for him in one of the villages: but the Samaritans being informed, that the intention of his journey was to worſhip at the temple in Jeruſalem, they ſuffered their old national pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to prevail ſo far, as to induce them to refuſe him admittance.</p>
               <p>THE meſſengers who had been ſent on this buſineſs returned, and gave an account of the inhoſpitable treatment they had received; which ſo exceedingly offended the diſciples, that they prevailed on James and John, to propoſe to their Maſter the calling
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029927_0141_0FE3374F78618090"/>
down fire from heaven to deſtroy them, pleading the example of the prophet Elijah for ſuch precipitate and violent proceedings: <hi>Lord, wilt thou,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>that we command fire to come down from heaven, and conſume them, even as Elias did?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the bleſſed JESUS, whoſe meekneſs on all occaſions was beyond example, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them for entertaining ſo haſty and unbecoming a reſentment: <hi>Ye know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what manner of ſpirit ye are of</hi>: ye are ignorant of the ſinfulneſs of the diſpoſition which ye have now expreſſed, nor do ye conſider the difference between the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law and the goſpel: the ſeverity of the prophet Elijah was a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a wicked and cruel, as well as idolatrous king, and a people who had conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his crimes, and had forſaken the worſhip of the God of their fathers; it was a puniſhment very proper for the times, and what the nature of the offence required; it was conſiſtent with the character of the prophet, and not unſuitable to the Moſaic diſpenſation: but the goſpel breathed a very different ſpirit; the deſign of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's coming into the world, not being to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</p>
               <p>BEHOLD here, ye deſpiſers of the goſpel diſpenſation! Ye advocates for the purity and dignity of human nature, and deſpiſers of the croſs of CHRIST! Behold here an inſtance of patience under an unprovoked injury, which cannot be matched amongſt all the boaſted heroes of antiquity; an inſtance of patience which expreſſed infinite ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition, worthy to be imitated by all the human race, eſpecially by thoſe who call themſelves the diſciples of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>ENTERTAINMENT and reception being denied by the inhoſpitable inhabitants of this Samaritan village, our great Redeemer, with his diſciples, directed their way towards another; and as they were on the way, he was met by a ſtranger, and accoſted with this language, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt.</hi> The bleſſed JESUS, to whom the hearts of all mankind were open, well knowing that it was only the riches and honours, of the Meſſiah's expected temporal kingdom, which excited this perſon to make the declaration; he thought proper at firſt to undeceive him: <hi>Foxes have holes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and the birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> alluding to the conduct of the inhoſpitable Samaritans, and foretelling what they muſt expect to ſuffer, who eſpouſed the cauſe, and joined the train of our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>SOON after, our bleſſed Saviour met with one who had formerly been his diſciple, and commanded him to diſengage himſelf from worldly concerns, and to join in his train; but this perſon excuſed himſelf, under pretence of filial piety, and a deſire to attend on, and adminiſter relief, to his aged parents: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my Father:</hi> but our great Redeemer replied, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</hi> Let thoſe who are immerſed in worldly affairs, follow the concerns of the world, but let thoſe who have received the great truths of the goſpel, and made a profeſſion of our Redeemer's name, do every thing in their power to ſpread the glad-tidings of ſalvation over the whole earth.</p>
               <p>A third perſon propoſed to follow our Lord, but deſired liberty to return to his houſe, and take his leave of the family: but, though our Lord would not by any means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage prudent care in the domeſtic affairs of life, yet he gave this perſon to underſtand, that the ſalvation of the ſoul was the principal concern, and required our firſt, and chief regard; and we ſhould by no means, let the concerns of time, and ſenſe, have ſuch an influence on our minds, as to make us loſe ſight of this great object. Great is the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029927_0142_0FE33751030A7910"/>
danger of coldneſs and declenſion in our ſpiritual affairs; for our Lord himſelf declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in anſwer to this perſon's objection: 'No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.'</p>
               <p>AS our bleſſed Saviour's miniſtry was from this time till its final period, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Judea, and the countries beyond Jordan, it was neceſſary that ſome meſſengers ſhould be ſent to every town and village, to prepare his way: accordingly, he called his ſeventy diſciples, and gave them proper inſtructions concerning their behaviour, and the doctrines they were to preach. Having laid before them the particular duties of their miſſion, he ſent them into different parts of the country, and ordered them to viſit thoſe particular cities, towns, or villages, where he intended himſelf to follow them, and preach the doctrine of the everlaſting goſpel to the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>THE reaſon which our great Redeemer aſſigned for ſending theſe ſeventy diſciples on this important meſſage, was the ſame which he had before advanced for the miſſion of the twelve: <hi>The harveſt truly is great, but the labourers are few.</hi> And being never more to preach in Chorazin, Bethſaida, and Capernaum, the cities wherein he uſually reſided, and where he had ſo often delivered his heavenly diſcourſes, and diſplayed his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power, and divine benevolence, in many wonderous works, he was naturally led to reflect on the reception which himſelf and his doctrines had met with, from thoſe wicked, impenitent cities. He was ſenſible of the terrible evils which would flow from rejecting the Son of God, and perſiſting in the obſtinacy of unbelief, notwithſtanding the mighty works, which they had ſeen, and all the opportunities which they had for inſtruction and improvement; and though he was grieved for their obſtinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, he pronounced the following ſentence againſt them: <hi>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethſaida! For, if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented; ſitting in ſackcloth and aſhes. But it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, ſhalt be thruſt down to hell.</hi> To this our exalted Redeemer added, as a conſideration which ought to adminiſter comfort, and give encouragement to his diſciples: <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS kind and encouraging declaration, was particularly calculated to comfort and ſupport the diſciples he was now ſending out, under the contempt and ill-uſage they would meet with in executing the duties of their miſſion: they could not be ignorant, that the preaching of CHRIST himſelf had often been unſucceſsful, and that he had been oppoſed, reviled, and deſpiſed; and therefore, they had no reaſon to conclude, that they ſhould find a welcome reception, and be received, honoured, and eſteemed: but it would, at the worſt of times, afford them great conſolation to reflect, that the eternal God was on their ſide, and, however they might be deſpiſed and rejected by men, they were ſure to be received, honoured, and eſteemed by their maker.</p>
               <p>THE ſeventy diſciples, having received their commiſſion, and inſtructions, and being by their Maſter inveſted with the power of working miracles, they departed and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the tenor of their commiſſion, in the cities and villages of Judea and Petrea; and after viſiting ſeveral places, publiſhing the glad-tidings of ſalvation, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many miracles in confirmation of the truth, they returned to their Maſter with great joy, ſaying, <hi>Lord, even the devils are ſubject unto us, through thy name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM theſe expreſſions, it ſeems reaſonable to conclude, that the diſciples, when they ſet out on this journey, did not know that their power extended ſo far as to caſt out
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029927_0143_0FE3375B15332790"/>
devils, and they were, no doubt, pleaſingly ſurpriſed, to find that the apoſtate ſpirits trembled at their Maſter's name. To this our great Redeemer replied, <hi>I beheld Satan, as lightning, fall from heaven:</hi> as much as to ſay, you need not be aſtoniſhed at the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and diſmay of the apoſtate ſpirits, their prince is fallen, I ſaw him fall as ſwift as lightning from heaven: I have triumphed over him, I came down from heaven, and was manifeſted in the fleſh to deſtroy his works, and he knows I ſhall finally conquer him and all his legions, and put them down for ever.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord then, for the further encouragement of his diſciples, informed them, that he would enlarge their power, and increaſe their authority, not only over evil ſpirits, but over whatever in this world, had power to hurt or annoy them: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I give unto your power to tread on ſerpents, and ſcorpions, and over all the powers of the enemy; and nothing ſhall by any means hurt you.</hi> At the ſame time, our Lord was pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, that theſe miraculous powers were the leaſt part of their privilege, and the conſequences attending them, not ſo much to be rejoiced in, as their title to the eternal reward, which he would beſtow on all his faithful followers: <hi>Notwithſtanding,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in this rejoice not, that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you; but rather rejoice, that your names are written in the book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR could the bleſſed JESUS reflect on the wiſdom, and goodneſs of the divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and the particular care and tenderneſs, which the ſupreme Governor of the univerſe, manifeſts to the objects of his love, however mean and deſpiſed they may be in the eyes of the world, without feeling extraordinary joy; ſo that his benevolent heart overflowed with ſtreams of gratitude and praiſe; 'I thank thee' ſaid he, 'O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes: even ſo Father; for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.'</p>
               <p>THE diſciples being returned from their tour, JESUS left Samaria, and journeying into Judea, he was met on the road by a certain lawyer, who, in the language of the New Teſtament, is a perſon whoſe employment is the expounding, and explaining the law of Moſes. This perſon was deſirous to know whether the doctrine which JESUS advanced, were the ſame as the precepts of the law; and with this view, he aſked our Redeemer what he muſt do to inherit eternal life. Such was the pride of this teacher of Iſrael, that it ſeems by the ſequel, that he aſked this important queſtion, to tempt, and not to be inſtructed: but, though our Lord well knew the ſecrets of his heart, he did not anſwer him with ſuch a rebuke as he deſerved, but in ſuch a manner as to turn his baſe deſign, and ſophiſtical evaſions againſt himſelf: <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is written in the law? how readeſt thou?</hi> The Scribe anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS reply our Lord received with approbation, and ſaid to the lawyer, <hi>Thou haſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered right; this do, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> if thou art able to fulfil theſe great precepts of the law, thou mayeſt claim an intereſt in the divine favour, on the footing of the eternal rules of righteouſneſs; and as a right to that happineſs which is aſſigned to the keepers of the law: for on theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
               <p>THE lawyer now perceived himſelf taken in his own ſnare: his conſcience could not acquit him of violating theſe great duties; he was at a loſs and confounded, and knew
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029927_0144_0FE3375D886F12A8"/>
not what to reply: but, yet being willing to ſay ſomething to juſtify himſelf, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and who is my neighbour? A queſtion very natural to be aſked, by a bigoted Jew, whoſe narrow, ſelfiſh conceptions led him to deſpiſe all who were not the children of Abraham.</p>
               <p>TO correct the low littleneſs of ſuch a private party ſpirit, to open and enlarge the heart to a more generous and noble way of thinking, to ſhew them the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true love, and the extenſive relation which they and all mankind ſtood in to each other, our Lord delivered the following moſt beautiful and inſtructive parable.</p>
               <p>A certain man went down from Jeruſalem to Jericho, and fell amongſt thieves, which ſtripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain prieſt that way; and when he ſaw him, he paſſed by on the other ſide. And likewiſe a Levite, when he was at that place, came and looked on him, and paſſed by on the other ſide. But a certain Samaritan, as he journied, came where he was: and when he ſaw him, he had compaſſion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and ſet him on his own beaſt, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, he took out two pence, and gave them to the hoſt, and ſaid unto him, take care of him; and whatſoever thou ſpendeſt more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
               <p>BY this well-choſen, and moſt elegant and affecting parable, our exalted Saviour beautifully inculcated an open and generous diſpoſition, and greatneſs of mind, which lays aſide all ſelfiſh views, and diligently exerts itſelf in the great work of doing good to mankind, readily relieving all objects of diſtreſs, let their national quarrels and religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes be what they will. No perſons were more hated by the Samaritans than the Jews; for which reaſon, our Lord repreſents a Samaritan relieving and ſuccouring a diſtreſſed Jew, when a Prieſt and Levite, of his own nation and religion, had forſaken him. And this affecting parable our Lord laid down as an anſwer to the queſtion propoſed by the lawyer, <hi>Who is my neighbour?</hi> and then put it to his own feelings to determine the matter: <hi>Which now of theſe three, thinkeſt thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>was neighbour unto him that fell amongst the thieves?</hi> The caſe was ſo plain, that the lawyer could but reply, <hi>He that ſhewed mercy on him.</hi> To which our Redeemer immediately returned, with a look which gave the lawyer to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he knew he was ſilenced, <hi>Go and do thou likewiſe.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER our bleſſed Lord had effectually ſilenced the cavilling lawyer, he continued his journey towards Jeruſalem, to be preſent at the feaſt of dedication. In the evening he retired to Bethany, a ſmall village about two miles from Jeruſalem. In this
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029927_0145_0FE3375F0E403D38"/>
village dwelt Martha and Mary, two pious ſiſters, who dwelt together in the ſame houſe with their brother Lazarus. In this little family, our great Redeemer took up his abode, and was joyfully received by the religious young man and his virtuous ſiſters. Whether any former acquaintance had ſubſiſted between this family and our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the evangeliſts have not informed us; but it ſeems they were not unacquainted with his character, for he was kindly received and generouſly entertained. JESUS, as his cuſtom was, wherever he went, took the opportunity of diſpenſing his divine inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and teaching his hoſpitable friends thoſe things which concerned their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace. Martha was deſirous of expreſſing her regard to her noble gueſt, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a grand entertainment; but Mary, being of a contemplative diſpoſition, was taken with his divine diſcourſes, and ſitting at the feet of our great Redeemer, ſhe liſtened to his words with the moſt earneſt and ſteady attention: Martha, being greatly fatigued with the burthen of the ſervice, was offended at her ſiſter, becauſe ſhe did not help her, and complained to our Lord of her omiſſion: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve you alone? Bid her therefore that ſhe help me.</hi>

               <p>BUT JESUS, by his anſwer to this diſcontented ſiſter, gave her to underſtand, that it was more pleaſing to him, when perſons attended on his inſtructions, and liſtened to his words, than all their endeavours to provide ſumptuous entertainments for himſelf and his diſciples: he was not inſenſible of any regard which perſons had for him, nor unthankful for their kindneſs, in what way ſoever it was expreſſed; but as the good of mankind was his conſtant endeavour and care, he always approved thoſe expreſſions of kindneſs beſt, which were moſt conducive to that end: nor could he eſteem himſelf being fed with the food which periſheth, of equal conſequence with his beſtowing on others, that which endureth to everlaſting life: <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful: and Mary hath choſen that good part, which ſhall not be taken from her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM this little village JESUS departed to Jeruſalem, and attended at the feaſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. Being in the temple, and ſtanding in Solomon's porch, he was accoſted by the Jews, who deſired him to tell them plainly, whether he were the Meſſiah or not? Well knowing, that they did not aſk this queſtion for information, but to gain an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of accuſing him to the Romans as a ſeditious perſon, who pretended to be the great ſon of David, promiſed by the prophets, and by this means, deſigning to ſtir up the people to rebellion, and ſeize on the kingdom; our great Redeemer told them, that they muſt form a judgment of him from his actions: <hi>I told you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ye believed not: the works I do in my Father's name, they bear witneſs of me. But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you.</hi> It is in vain to diſpute, or lay down reaſons, and arguments to perſons of your temper and ſpirit; you are under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of your headſtrong paſſions and wicked hearts, and your inveterate prejudices will not be overcome; you are not of the number of thoſe whom my Father, by his powerful grace, will bring unto me, and cauſe to believe in my name; theſe happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are aſſiſted by the power from on high, they carefully and candidly examine the proofs I have given of my miſſion, and they believe in me, and receive me, with all their hearts: nor will theſe my followers and friends loſe their rewards; for I will willingly receive them, and make them partakers of eternal life and glory: theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I will ſupport and defend; I look upon them as my own, and however induſtrious, or aſſiduous the wicked of this world, or the powers of darkneſs, may be to deceive and deſtroy them, they ſhall never effect their purpoſe; for I ſtand determined to bring them ſafe to my heavenly kingdom, and all their enemies may rage in vain: my Father
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029927_0146_0FE337609271B5D0"/>
hath given them to me: all power, both in heaven and earth, is in his hand, and his omnipotence is engaged in their defence: none is able to contend with him, to prevent the accompliſhment of his will, or to hurt the perſons whom he defends: none is able to contend with me, or wreſt my people from me; for I and the great eternal Father of the univerſe are one: <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. A ſtranger they will not follow: for they know not the voice of ſtrangers. And I give unto them eternal life; they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE words highly provoked the Jews, they conſidered them a blaſphemous, and were ſo enraged, that they took up ſtones to ſtone the exalted Saviour of ſinners; they thought they acted in conformity to the law, which commands, that all blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſhall be ſtoned; but JESUS aſked them, which of the benevolent miracles he had wrought amongſt them, deſerved ſuch treatment: <hi>Many good works,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>have I ſhewed you from my Father: for which of theſe works do ye ſtone me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have fed the hungry in the deſert, I have reſtored ſtrength to the lame, I have cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lepers, I have healed the ſick, I have caſt out devils, I have raiſed the dead; for which of theſe works are ye going to ſtone me? Do ſuch miracles as theſe admit of the ſuppoſition, that the author of them is an impoſter? Can you be ſo ſtupid as to imagine, that the all-powerful and all-wiſe Governor of the world, would permit any perſon to perform ſuch works: with no other intention than to deceive mankind, and to propagate falſhood and error? The Jews replied, we do not ſuppoſe, that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt puniſhment for any good work which thou haſt performed; puniſhment which we are preparing, is diſigned to chaſtiſe thee for thy blaſphemous ſpeeches; for thou though, a weak mortal like ourſelves, arrogantly aſſumeſt the power and majeſty of the moſt High, and, by claiming the incommunicable attributes of deity, makeſt thyſelf God: <hi>For a good work,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>we ſtone thee not; but for blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou, being a man, makeſt thyſelf God.</hi> JESUS replied, Has not the Scripture expreſsly called thoſe <hi>gods,</hi> and the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> who were commiſſioned to govern God's people, and who by the communication of his Holy Spirit, were qualified for the important office with which they were inveſted; can you, therefore, impute to that perſon whom the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, on the moſt important buſineſs that ever any perſon was ſent into the world to execute, no leſs than the ſalvation of loſt ſinners; can you, I ſay, impute blaſphemy to this perſon, for taking on himſelf the title of the Son of God? If my own declaration be not ſufficient to induce you to believe, conſider the works which I have performed, and let them ſpeak for me: is it not abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they muſt be the works of the moſt High, as only omnipotence could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them? Is it not then fully manifeſt, that I and the eternal God are ſo united, that whatever I ſay or do, is approved by him? <hi>Is it not written in your law,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>I ſaid, Ye are gods. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the ſcripture cannot be broken; ſay ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know, and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS argument, however plain and concluſive, was far from ſatisfying the Jews; their wicked hearts were hardened againſt the truth, and their deep rooted prejudices were not to be overcome: ſo that what might have convinced an honeſt, impartial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer after truth, had no tendency but to enrage them the more; and our Lord well
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029927_0147_0FE3376CC3845078"/>
knowing that it would be to no purpoſe to reaſon with ſo obſtinate and envious a race, he, either by rendering himſelf inviſible, or caſting confuſion on their minds, departed imperceptibly from amongſt them, and ſo eſcaped their evil deſigns.</p>
               <p>THE feaſt of dedication being over, our Redeemer departed from Jeruſalem, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the country beyond Jordan, where he was received in a far different manner than he had been at Jeruſalem. The people in theſe parts had attended on the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of John the Baptiſt, and no doubt remembered the character he gave of the Meſſiah, who was ſhortly to appear; and finding the predictions of the Baptiſt fully anſwered, and fulfilled in JESUS, great numbers were excited to believe.</p>
               <p>How long our exalted Saviour, with his train, continued in this country, cannot be clearly determined; but we have no account of his leaving theſe parts till he was ſent for to Bethany, to raiſe Lazarus from the dead: perhaps, the inhabitants of this country en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the unſpeakable bleſſing of the preſence of the Son of God for a conſiderable time; and we are informed by the evangeliſts, that while he continued in this country, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch fervency, that one of his diſciples, who was exceedingly affected both with the matter and manner of his addreſs, begged he would teach them to pray. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable this diſciple was not with JESUS in the beginning of his miniſtry, when he gave his directions to his diſciples concerning their devotions: our Lord, however, gave them the ſame form of words as he had done before, and gave them ſome directions reſpecting their conduct, and exhorted them to conſtancy and fervency in their prayers: <hi>And I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh receiveth: and he that ſeeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND, for their encouragement in the great duty of prayer, he referred to their own feelings with reſpect to their children, and called upon them to judge by theſe, of the readineſs of their heavenly Father, to hear and grant their petitions: 'If, ſaid he, a ſon ſhall aſk bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a ſtone? Or if he aſk a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent? Or if he ſhall aſk an egg, will he offer him a ſcorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him?'</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe things, our great Redeemer was applied to by the friends of one who was poſſeſſed with a devil; he graciouſly condeſcended to grant the requeſt, and caſt out the evil ſpirit, reſtoring the diſordered perſon to perfect tranquility of mind: but ſome of the envious and unbelieving Jews were preſent, and, as the Phariſees had formerly done, aſcribed this ſtupendous work to the power of the devil. The evangeliſt informs us, that he was caſting out a devil, and it was dumb; and it came to paſs, when the devil was gone out the dumb ſpake; and the people wondered. But ſome of them ſaid, 'He caſteth out devils through Belzebub, the chief of the devils.'</p>
               <p>HOWEVER weak and frivolous this argument may ſeem, and however inconſiſtent and abſurd it may appear to impartial judges, it had conſiderable influence and effect on the ignorant and illiterate, eſpecially on ſuch whoſe prejudices and intereſts it favoured. The Phariſees were exaſperated at our great Redeemer's conduct, in expoſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their fooliſh traditions, and they indulged a fixed and habitual hatred againſt him: theſe traditions were conſidered, by the learned men and teachers of the age, as the very eſſentials of religion; and by his oppoſing theſe, and expoſing them to ridicule and contempt, they concluded, that he muſt be a very wicked perſon. They had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the common people with the higheſt veneration and reverence for theſe external
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029927_0148_0FE3376E47FAA5F8"/>
ceremonious performances, and, therefore, it is no wonder that they were ready to join them in their reſentment, and oppoſe and perſecute a perſon who had ſpoken lightly of things which they eſteemed ſo ſacred: the great men and leaders of the Jews, had alſo a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otion, that a falſe prophet had the power of working ſigns and wonders, and received this power from, and exerted it by, the aſſiſtance of wicked ſpirits; and, therefore, they were very ready to believe that our Saviour was in league with hell, and performed his miracles by the aſſiſtance of the prince of darkneſs, with deſign to ſeduce the people with lying wonders, and turn them from the worſhip of the true God.</p>
               <p>AND wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nduced them the more readily to embrace this opinion, was the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the devils themſelves, who, when they were caſt out, very frequently and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, confeſſed that JESUS was the Son of God; which the Phariſees ſuppoſed they would not have done, except it was to carry on the deception: the blinded rulers of Iſrael, not perceiving that the devils were forced to confeſs the Meſſiah, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuperior power. How abſurd and ridiculous ſoever this argument appears to the judicious and impartial, yet as it coincided with the prejudice of the Jews, it had great influence on their minds, and tended to fix them in final unbelief: and however we may be ſurpriſed that ſuch weak reaſons ſhould have any effect, conſidering what multitudes were witneſſes to the many miracles which the bleſſed JESUS performed, and conſidering the nature of thoſe miracles was ſuch, as it is not eaſy to ſuppoſe the Devil would have any hand in performing; yet experience hath abundantly convinced us, that ſuch kind of argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, joined with their own prejudices, and ſuperſtitious opinions, had a great influence in fixing that obſtinate people in their infidelity.</p>
               <p>BUT though ſome amongſt the multitude of ſpectators, were content to aſcribe this miracle to the power of the Devil, others were not willing ſo haſtily and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to form ſo baſe a concluſion, but deſired to ſuſpend their opinion till other proofs might be produced, or our Redeemer might have an opportunity to eſtabliſh his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by a different kind of evidence; and therefore, they deſired him to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Meſſiah, by given them a ſign from heaven. But JESUS knowing their thoughts, and being privy to the rancour, and wickedneſs of their hearts, refuſed to grant their requeſt: but told them that they were a wicked race of mortals, and diſcovered a very obſtinate and perverſe diſpoſition, by ſeeking a ſign from heaven, after ſuch a number of miracles had been performed, as were ſufficient to convince any impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind. He therefore informed them that no ſign ſhould be given them, but that of the prophet Jonas, <hi>This,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is an evil generation: they ſeek a ſign; and there ſhall no ſign be given it, but the ſign of Jonas the prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN JESUS had ended his diſcourſe, one of the Phariſees preſent invited him to dine with him; our Lord accepted the invitation, though probably it was not love and good-will which excited the Phariſee to make it; he accompanied the inviter to his houſe, and ſat down at the table without performing the ceremony of waſhing, ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved by the other gueſts: an omiſſion of this kind could not fail of ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Phariſee, as JESUS thereby ſhewed an open contempt of their traditions. Our Lord, who well knew the thoughts of this bigoted, ſelf-conceited Phariſee, ſaid unto him, you Phariſees are remarkably careful to keep every thing clean which touches your food, leſt, by eating it, your bodies ſhould be polluted; but you take no care to cleanſe your minds from the pollution of wickedneſs. You cannot be ignorant that he who created the body, alſo formed and inſpired the ſoul; and can you imagine that the Almighty, who approves of purity of body, becauſe it is the work of his hands, and becauſe it conduces to the health thereof, will not alſo inſiſt on a greater

purity of the ſoul, which is doubtleſs the far nobleſt part poſſeſſed by man. Inſtead therefore, of that ſcrupulous care and exactneſs in waſhing your hands when you ſit down to meat, ye ſhould be careful to cleanſe your hearts from all pollution, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently pray to the God of Iſrael to purify your minds; this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>SUCH was the language of the Son of God, but the proud ſelf-conceited Phariſees would not hear; however clear and convincing, however mild and perſuaſive, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of our great Redeemer were, the inveterate prejudices and rooted unbelief of theſe men, prevented theſe excellent diſcourſes from having their proper effect. Our bleſſed Saviour therefore treated them with more ſeverity, and denounced againſt them the moſt heavy woes for their hypocriſy, which was manifeſt in their ſcrupulous exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the performance of the minuteſt part of the ceremonial obſervances, contained in their traditions, while they were moſt ſcandalouſly careleſs and negligent in the weightier matters of the law: <hi>Woe unto you, Phariſees! ſaid he, for ye tithe mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and paſs over judgment, and the love of God: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Woe unto you, Phariſees! for ye love the uppermoſt ſeats in the ſynagogues, and greeting in the markets. Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH this diſcourſe was principally aſſigned to affect the Scribes and Phariſees, a certain lawyer, who ſat at the table, thinking that this rebuke a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>cted perſons of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, was very much offended; but our great Redeemer, who regarded not the perſons nor profeſſions of men, plainly told him what was his real character: <hi>Woe unto you alſo, ye lawyers,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourſelves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS alſo blamed the conduct of the Scribes and Phariſees, for building the ſepulchres of the prophets, whom their fathers had murdered; becauſe they did not erect theſe edifices ſo much out of reſpect to the memory of the deceaſed worthies, as to exhibit the utmoſt oſtentation of piety, and make themſelves admired for their noble ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; while, by their conſtant line of conduct, they gave reaſon to conclude, that they ſecretly entertained the ſame hatred to reproof, and unconquerable obſtinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, which excited their fathers to the moſt unreaſonable and cruel of their actions: 'Woe unto you,' ſaid he, 'for ye build the ſepulchre of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witneſs that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build them ſepulchres. Therefore alſo ſaid the wiſdom of God, I will ſend them prophets and apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall ſlay and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute: that the blood of all the prophets, which was ſhed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation: from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which periſhed between the altar and the temple: verily, I ſay unto you, it ſhall be required of this generation.' As our Redeemer well knew that this hardened and unbelieving generation, would ſpill the blood of the Son of God, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be guilty of the blackeſt, and moſt impious and horrid martyrdom, which could be committed: he might juſtly repreſent them, as the moſt black, horrid, and hateful race of murderers, as guilty in themſelves, as much to be abhorred, and equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029927_0150_0FE33771536E8C60"/>
peculiar and diſtinguiſhed vengeance, as if they had ſhed all the innocent blood which ever had been ſpilt in the world.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer, after pronouncing theſe woes, turned his diſcourſe againſt the lawyers, and condemned them for filling the minds of the people with wrong notions, ariſing from forced interpretations of the ſcriptures; by which means the minds of the people were prejudiced againſt the goſpel, and prevented from receiving the truth: <hi>Woe unto you lawyers!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye enter not in yourſelves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER juſt and reaſonable theſe diſcourſes were, the ſeverity of the rebukes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, was highly provoking to thoſe Scribes and Phariſees; they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of being guilty of the crimes laid to their charge, but their pride could not bear the thoughts of being ſunk in the opinion of the people, who heard theſe remarks; their minds were agitated with conflicting paſſions, but pride and envy urged them to the moſt baſe and deſpicable actions; their riſing reſentment ſtudied revenge, and they were ſo mean as to urge our exalted Redeemer to diſcourſe on various ſubjects, with no other view than to enſnare him, and by that means render him obnoxious, either to the Roman government, or to the common people amongſt the Jews, the evangeliſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that, as he ſaid theſe things unto them, the Scribes and Phariſees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to ſpeak of many things, laying in wait for him, and ſeeking to catch ſomething out of his mouth, that they might accuſe him.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer baffled all their attempts, and leaving the houſe of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, he went amongſt the multitude, which was waiting at the door; ſo great were the numbers, and ſo hard did they preſs to get near the exalted perſon of our Saviour, that they trod one upon another. The firſt diſcourſe he held with the multitude, after he had left the Phariſee's houſe, was to warn them againſt the pernicious poiſon of the Phariſee's example, who appeared in diſguiſe, and pretended to be the moſt ſtrict in the obſervance of the law, the moſt ſimple in their manners, and pure and ſpotleſs in their converſation, when, at the ſame time, they were privately guilty of the moſt groſs and ſcandalous vices: our Lord, therefore, exhorted the multitude to be very careful not to do any thing which would not bear the light, but let the whole of their behaviour be honeſt, open, and upright; for the time would come, when all ſecrets will be revealed, and all the works of darkneſs brought to light: 'Beware ye,' ſaid he, 'of the leaven of the Phariſees, which is hypocriſy. For there is nothing covered, which ſhall not be revealed; neither hid, that ſhall not be known. Therefore, whatever ye have ſpoken in darkneſs, ſhall be heard in the light, and that which ye have ſpoken in the ear in cloſets, ſhall be proclaimed upon the houſe tops.'</p>
               <p>OUR Redeemer proceeded to obſerve, that an open, honeſt courſe of conduct, above hypocriſy, and diſdaining all diſguiſe, would enable them to put their truſt in their Maker; while the contrary conduct tended to fill the mind with that fear of man, which is ſo prejudicial to the welfare of the ſoul: he therefore exhorted them, not to fear the malice or power of any of the ſons of men; theſe can extend no further than the death of the body, but cannot touch the immortal ſoul, which may bid defiance to the impotent rage of the gloomy tyrant, and never tremble at the fury of the oppreſſor: ſuch weak and feeble creatures as men, are not to be feared, but the wrath of the eternal God ought rather to be dreaded; he is able, after he hath deſtroyed the body, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the ſoul in eternal torments. How happy are the perſons who are under his holy protection: all things are in his power, nothing can eſcape his notice, nor any thing
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029927_0151_0FE33778EC381950"/>
happen without his permiſſion: <hi>And I ſay unto you, my friends,</hi> ſaid our great Redeemer, <hi>be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye ſhall fear: fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you fear him. Are not five ſparrows ſold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of your head are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many ſparrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS thought fit to add, that the fear of man would be a ſnare to great numbers, and prevent them from confeſſing the truth; but whoever were overcome by this prevailing principle, and were aſhamed to acknowledge our Saviour, would be finally rejected at the awful day, when he would ſit in judgment, and own and reward all his faithful followers: and whoever were induced to ſpeak evil of the Spirit of God, the grand agent in carrying on the Meſſiah's kingdom in the hearts of men, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer informed them, ſhould be puniſhed with peculiar and diſtinguiſhed vengeance, by a juſtly provoked, ſin avenging God: <hi>Alſo I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man alſo confeſs before the angels of God. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but unto him that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING ſhewn the neceſſity of boldly confeſſing him before men, he proceeded to encourage his diſciples with the promiſe of immediate aſſiſtance, when they were brought before princes, and the great men of the earth; which divine aſſiſtance would deliver them from all embarraſſment, reſpecting what they ſhould anſwer, when they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined concerning their faith: <hi>And when they bring you unto the ſynagogues, and unto magiſtrates, and powers, take ye no thought how, or what ye ſhall anſwer, or what ye ſhall ſay; for the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in the ſame hour, what ye ought to ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE the bleſſed JESUS was delivering theſe exhortations to his diſciples, a perſon amongſt the ſurrounding multitude, begged that he would interpoſe his authority with his brother, in order to oblige him to divide the paternal inheritance with him; but, as this deciſion properly belonged to the magiſtrate, our bleſſed Saviour, who did not come into the world to ſettle worldly affairs, but to attend to thoſe things which concerned the immortal ſoul, declined the taſk, with this reply, <hi>Man, who made me a judge or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider over you?</hi> He took occaſion, however, from hence, in the moſt ſolemn manner, to caution his hearers againſt covetouſneſs: for he obſerved that neither the length nor the happineſs of life depended on the largeneſs of poſſeſſions: 'Take heed,' ſaid he, 'and beware of covetouſneſs; for a man's life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.'</p>
               <p>AND to enforce this important exhortation, he placed before them, in the ſtrongeſt, and moſt alarming point of light, an example of the bewitching influence of wealth in the parable of the rich glutton, who was ſuddenly cut off in the midſt of his projects, and became a dreadful example of the folly of amaſſing the riches of this world, and depending on the goods of this life, without any regard to the government of God, or the intereſts of the immortal ſoul. This wretched man, forgetting his mortality, made preparations for a long and luxurious life, pleaſing himſelf with the thoughts of a long ſucceſſion of ſenſual enjoyments: but, alas! whilſt he was providing repoſitories for his vaſt riches, he was arreſted by the king of terrors, and hurried, without time for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, into the eternal world. The parable which our great Redeemer put forth on this occaſion, is contained in theſe words: 'The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himſelf, ſaying, What ſhall I do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029927_0152_0FE3377B4C2256A8"/>
I have no room where to beſtow my fruits? And he ſaid, this will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I beſtow all my fruits, and my goods. And I will ſay to my ſoul, ſoul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry. But God ſaid unto him, thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?'</p>
               <p>WHAT an awful ſummons was this! How unexpected, how alarming, how dreadful! The man lying on his bed, full of anxiety, care, and ſolicitude, not to acquire wealth, but how to make room to lodge it, and how to enjoy it: doubtleſs he thought, that riches gave him a title to every gratification and enjoyment which the world can afford, or the ſenſe and appetite of man partake of: his reſtleſs thought ranges though the wide fields of diſſipation and pleaſure, and ſuch numerous ſcenes of imaginary delight preſs on his raviſhed ſenſes, he knows not where to fix. In the midſt of this pleaſing perplexity, a ſtrange meſſenger ſtrikes at his breaſt. Who is it that thus alarms him? It is the great king of terrors, he comes commiſſioned to deſtroy; the caſe admits of no refuſal or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. Is there no refuge! is there no deliverer! Call the phyſicians: they inſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but with looks ſolemn and ſad. What! is there no hope? So often as you have partook of my bounty, and ſuch obligations as you are under to me. They all, with grief, declare the caſe beyond their art.—Then ſay, how long I have to live.—The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the night concludes your earthly race.—How ſhort the warning, and with what haſty ſteps the dread deſtroyer advances to ſtop my breath! But is there no way to appeaſe him, and engage him to hold his hand? Will he not be perſuaded? He makes no agreement nor league with any. Will not pity excite him, or petitions move him? He knows no pity, and he hears no prayers. Will not my riches bribe him? Riches are unavailable in the hour of death; nor will mountains of gold delay the awful ſtroke one moment. But how many wretched creatures are there, who would be glad of his friendly aid to deſtroy a loathed exiſtence? Why then ſhould he attack one who had ſuch vaſt proſpects of pleaſure and delight before him, and gloried in the expectation of many happy years to come? He acts according to his commiſſion from above, and the awful ſtroke no mortal can eſcape or evade a moment. Then all is over! let me think who ſhall be my heir. But reaſon failed; and, before that important point could be ſettled, the poor deluded mortal expired. And now, inſtead of a long ſucceſſion of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual delights, an awful eternity preſents itſelf to view, and the poor ſoul is terrified and plunged into the depths of deſpair and horror, at the proſpect of judgment to come. A dark night of horror in an inſtant overwhelms that ſoul, which had promiſed itſelf ſo much eaſe and pleaſure; and, inſtead of eating, drinking, and making merry; inſtead of gay ſcenes of diſſipation, and a variety of ſenſual delights; eternal tortures, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirſt, weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, muſt be the portion of this miſerable being to all eternity.</p>

                  <hi>So is he,</hi> added our great Redeemer, <hi>that layeth up treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God.</hi> Thus ſhall he be taken away from all that his ſoul deſireth; thus ſhall he be torn from all his temporal proſpects and pleaſures; none of his beloved enjoyments ſhall follow him; naked as he came ſhall he depart out of the world; nor could all his riches, could he take them with him, be able to procure him the leaſt comfort or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite in this world of horrors. How ſhould this reflection awaken us from our pleaſing dreams of comfort and happineſs, in this world of miſery, this vale of tears: how ſhould it convince us of the uncertainty of all ſublunary good, and the utter impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the things of this world to ſatisfy the ſoul, or made us truly happy: how ſhould
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029927_0153_0FE3377CD1746DF8"/>
it alarm us, when, planning fancied ſchemes of worldly pleaſure or advantage, without the leaſt conſideration of the great Diſpoſer of all events: how ſhould it reconcile us to the diſpoſal of infinite Wiſdom, when our portion of temporal things is ſmall and ſcanty; and we are ſurrounded with difficulties and troubles, without the aſſiſtance of the great King of the univerſe, all our promiſes of ſecurity are vain and fooliſh; he can render all our labours abortive; and the richeſt and moſt opulent perſon, when they think themſelves ſecure, and are planning ſchemes of pleaſure and gratification, may, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be ſtripped of all their poſſeſſions, and torn from all their comforts; when the ſoul, naked and defenceleſs, and clothed in all its guilt, will enter into an awful eternity, and be brought, trembling and aſtoniſhed, to the throne of its offended Maker.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, having delivered this awakening parable, proceeded to apply it to his diſciples; and from hence took occaſion to warn them of an over ſolicitous care, concern, and deſire after the things of this world. He rather adviſed them to truſt in God, whoſe fatherly care extends itſelf over all his creatures: the fowls of heaven are fed by his bounty, and the lilies are clothed in brighter hues, and more glorious raiment than the greateſt monarch. If, therefore, argued the bleſſed JESUS, the great Governor of all things ſo carefully provides for the inferior part of his creation; if he feeds the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and clothes the lilies; ſurely the children of men have the higheſt reaſon to depend on his all-preſerving, and all-ſupporting goodneſs; eſpecially thoſe who have the well-grounded hopes, that the great Eternal Maker and ſupporter of all things, has appointed them to happineſs in a future ſtate, have little reaſon to doubt that he will not provide them all that is neceſſary for their comfort and ſupport in this: <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>little flock: for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom.</hi> At the ſame time, he gave his diſciples another precept, particularly calculated for thoſe times in which the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the goſpel expoſed men to the loſs of their ſubſtance: ſell that ye have, ſaid he, and give alms; provide yourſelves bags, which wax not old, a treaſure in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth: for where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus exhorted them to the diſengagement of their affections from the things of this world, he adviſed them to be at all times ready for the diſcharge of their duty: <hi>Let,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourſelves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS was ſpoken in alluſion to the cuſtoms of the eaſtern countries, where anciently great entertainments were made in the evening; and on theſe occaſions, ſervants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated their diligence, by watching, and keeping their loins girded that they might be ready to open the door on the firſt knock of their maſter: nor was it uncommon for the maſter, in order to reward ſuch a ſervant, to order him a repaſt, and ſometimes even to give it him with his own hand. In alluſion to which cuſtom, our bleſſed Saviour added, 'Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: verily, I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.'</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>JESUS</hi> remarks the Ignorance and Stupidity of the Jews, in not diſcerning the Times; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Danger of neglecting the Means of Reconciliation offered them: He ſheweth, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Calamities are no ſure Signs of Sinfulneſs, but that others ſhould take warning by them, and repent: He delivers the Parable of the Fig-Tree, that was ordered to be cut down for being fruitleſs: He healeth a Woman that had been long bowed together, and putteth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Ruler of the Synagogue to ſilence. <hi>CHRIST</hi> being aſked of the number of the Saved, he exhorteth to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate: He is warned to leave the Dominions of Herod, but will not be diverted from his Courſe through Fear; and lamenteth over the approaching Deſolation of Jeruſalem: He healeth the Dropſy on the Sabbath, and juſtifieth his doing ſo: He recommendeth Humility, and Hoſpitality towards the Poor: And delivers the Parable of the Marriage-Supper, and of the Gueſts, who making excuſes, were excluded, and their Rooms filled by others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAVING concluded his inſtructions to his diſciples, our Lord then addreſſed the multitude, and remarked the prevailing infidelity of the Jewiſh nation, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the evidences of his being the Meſſiah, were clearer and ſtronger than thoſe marks in the ſky, which denominated fair o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> rainy weather to be approaching: and though the people were very accute and ſegacious in the one, they were unaccountably blind and undiſcerning in the other: 'When ye ſee a cloud riſe out of the weſt, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ye ſay, There cometh a ſhower; and ſo it is. And when ye ſee the ſouth wind blow, ye ſay, There will be heat; and it cometh to paſs. Ye hypocrites, ye can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the face of the ſky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not diſcern this time?'</p>
               <p>BUT he proceeded to let them know, that their blindneſs, obſtinacy, and rebellion, ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed, and that he would come in as unexpected a manner, as a thief cometh in the night: he therefore exhorted them to a ſpeedy reformation, telling them that they ought to conſider well what way their peace was to be expected, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend to thoſe things which would preſerve them from the conſequences of their rebellion. 'When thou goeſt with thine adverſary to the magiſtrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayeſt be delivered from him; leſt he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer caſt thee into priſon: I tell thee thou ſhalt not depart thence, till thou haſt paid the very laſt mite.'</p>
               <p>SOME of his hearers thought proper to confirm this doctrine, by giving what they thought an example of it: There were preſent at that ſeaſon, ſome that told him of the Galileans, whoſe blood Pilate had mingled with their ſacrifices; thinking that theſe perſons had been guilty of ſome extraordinary crime for which providence had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this dreadful puniſhment to befal them: but our bleſſed Saviour expreſsly told them, that they were much miſtaken in this concluſion, for this deplorable calami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y was no indication that theſe Galileans were greater ſinners than their countrymen. At the ſame time, he exhorted them to improve ſuch inſtances of calamity and miſery, as incitements to their own repentance, aſſuring them that if they neglected ſo juſt and neceſſary a work, they ſhould all periſh: <hi>And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto them, Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you, Nay: but, except you repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE further illuſtrated this doctrine, by remarking, that this way of interpreting the diſpenſations of providence, would lead them to erroneous concluſions, whenever they
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029927_0155_0FE3378AB6ECCE68"/>
heard of unexpected and dreadful evils falling on the ſons of men; and inſtanced the caſe of the eighteen perſons on whom the tower of Siloam fell, and cruſhed them to pieces: <hi>Or,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thoſe eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and ſlew them, think ye that they were ſinner above all men that dwelt in Jeruſalem? I tell you, Nay: but, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord alſo endeavoured to rouſe them to the conſideration of their ſtate, by the parable of the fig-tree, which the maſter of the vineyard, after finding it three years barren, ordered to be deſtroyed, but at the earneſt requeſt of the dreſſer of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, it was ſpared one year longer: <hi>A certain man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and ſought fruit thereon, and found none. Then ſaid he unto the dreſſer of his vineyard, Behold, theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground? And he anſwering, ſaid unto him, lord, let it alone this year alſo, till I dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY this parable, our Lord repreſented the goodneſs, and forbearance of his Almighty Father, manifeſted towards the Jewiſh nation, where his Son had now been about three years, preaching the kingdom of God; and though they might be juſtly deſtroyed for their obſtinacy and perverſeneſs, yet the awful ſtroke was delayed, and ſpace was given them for repentance; but he gave them a ſtrong intimation, in this parable, that if they perſiſted, they muſt expect that vengeance will not always ſleep, but, after all the divine forbearance had been abuſed, would awake to their ſudden and dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>WHEN our Lord was teaching in one of the ſynagogues in Perea, on the Sabbath-day, he obſerved a woman, who, for the ſpace of eighteen years, had not been able to ſtand upright: a perſon labouring under ſo dreadful a diſorder, could not fail of excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the compaſſion of the benevolent Saviour of ſinners, he beheld this affecting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with pity, and he removed her complaint; ſhe who came to the ſynagogue bowed down to the ground with an infirmity, returned to her houſe upright, being by the all-powerful Son of God, reſtored to perfect health.</p>
               <p>THIS benevolent action, which ſurely deſerved the thanks of the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo highly offended the maſter of the ſynagogue, that he openly teſtified his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and reproved the people, and repreſented them as Sabbath-breakers, becauſe they came that day to be healed: <hi>There are ſix days,</hi> ſaid this ſurly, ſelf-conceited ruler to the people, <hi>in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT our Lord ſoon ſilenced this ſelf-conceited Phariſee, by obſerving that he had not deviated from their own avowed practice: they made no ſcruple of looſing their cattle, and leading them to the water on the Sabbath-day, becauſe the mercy of the action ſufficiently juſtified them for performing it; and ſurely his action of looſing, by a ſingle word, a woman, a rational creature, a daughter of Abraham, who had been bound by an incurable diſtemper, the tedious ſpace of eighteen years, was abundantly juſtified: nor could this bigoted ruler have thought otherwiſe, had not his reaſon been blinded by his ſuperſtition. Such was the ſentiment of the Son of God, who anſwered him with this ſevere rebuke, 'Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the Sabbath, looſe his ox or his aſs from the ſtall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029927_0156_0FE3378C53C7B498"/>
lo, theſe eighteen years, be looſed from this bond on the Sabbath-day?' And when he had ſaid theſe things, all his adverſaries were aſhamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>
               <p>FROM this inſtance we may remark the evil effects of ſuperſtition and a bigoted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to cuſtoms and ceremonies, which have no foundation in reaſon nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God; theſe pernicious principles oppoſe the uſe of the faculties, root compaſſion out of the heart, and deſtroy the feelings of humanity.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having ſilenced the proud ruler of the ſynagogue, and received the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and applauſes of the people, he reflected with pleaſure on the truth, reaſon, and divine power from above, which ſupport his kingdom; and, on this occaſion, he repeated the parables of the grain of muſtard-ſeed, and the leaven, to ſhew the future ſucceſs of the goſpel, and the power and influence of his religion on the hearts and lives of men, and its rapid progreſs through the world, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the great men of the earth, and the fury of the unthinking multitude.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having thus ſown the ſeeds of the goſpel in the country of Perea, he croſſed Jordan, and proceeded by ſlow and ſhort ſtages towards Jeruſalem, preaching the goſpel in every village, and publiſhing the glad-tidings of ſalvation to the inhabitants of the countries he paſſed through.</p>
               <p>WHILE he was thus proſecuting the great work of inſtructing mankind, one of the perſons who accompanied him, inquired, 'Lord, are there few that be ſaved.' Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the perſon who propoſed this queſtion, had heard our Lord deſcribe the ſucceſs of the goſpel, by the parables of the muſtard-ſeed, and the leaven; and had no further views of the kingdom of the Meſſiah, than the ſetting up a temporal dominion. Theſe notions were entertained by the Jews in general, and induced them to conclude, that CHRIST hereby meant no more than a temporal ſalvation. JESUS, to convince this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inquirer, and the reſt of the Jews, that he had no intention to erect a ſecular kingdom, anſwered his queſtion in a ſpiritual manner, by which he gave the Jews to underſtand, that very few of them would be partakers of the honour and happineſs of his kingdom; and he exhorted them to uſe their utmoſt efforts to know the truth, and become members of the church, and heirs of glory, by improving the means which were afforded them; for the time would ſoon come, he aſſured them, when the means which they now enjoyed would be taken away, and they would perceive their ſtate to be finally and irrevocably determined, and then, however earneſtly they might deſire ſuch opportunities as they now enjoyed, they ſhould not be able to attain them: <hi>Strive,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to enter in at the ſtraight gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and be ſhall anſwer, and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are.</hi> This ſentence our Lord informed them would be final, and not to be altered by their moſt earneſt peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and expoſtulations: <hi>Then,</hi> added our great Redeemer, <hi>ſhall ye begin to ſay, We have eaten and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourſelves thruſt out. And they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are laſt which ſhall be firſt, and there are firſt which ſhall be laſt.</hi>

                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:029927_0157_0FE3378DDA42A800"/>SOON after our bleſſed Saviour had delivered theſe ſentiments, ſome of the Phariſees thinking to intimidate him, and cauſe him to depart out of the country, came to him and pretended that Herod had a deſign againſt his life. It is not likely that Herod, who had ſuffered ſo much remorſe on account of his having put John the Baptiſt to death, ſhould ſo ſoon attempt the life of one whoſe works declared him to be a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; perhaps, that prince might wiſh JESUS to depart out of his territories, though he durſt not uſe force againſt him: nor is it unlikely that the Phariſees were deſirous of his departure out of the country, becauſe his diſcourſes tended to expoſe their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and leſſen them in the opinion of the people. The anſwer which our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer made to this meſſage, is contained in the following words: 'Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I caſt out devils, and I do cures to-day, and to-morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected. Nevertheleſs, I muſt walk to-day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be, that a prophet periſh out of Jeruſalem.'</p>
               <p>HAVING returned this anſwer to the Phariſees, and conſidering the treatment which the prophets had met with from the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and well knowing the wickedneſs of that unbelieving city, and their deſigns againſt his life, he pathetically lamented their obſtinacy and perverſeneſs, and the terrible deſolation which would ſoon overtake them for their ſins; <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate; and verily I ſay unto you, Ye ſhall not ſee me, until the time come, when ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONE of the chief of the Phariſees, ſoon after our Lord had made this pathetic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, invited him to his houſe, to take a repaſt: JESUS well knew, that this invitation did not proceed from hearty good-will: but, as he never ſhunned an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good, even to his moſt implacable enemies, he thought fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. It was the Sabbath-day, and when he had entered the Phariſee's houſe, a man was brought before him who was diſeaſed with a dropſy. The Phariſees well knew the benevolent diſpoſition of our great Redeemer, and they thought ſo miſerable an object would not fail of exciting his compaſſion, and cauſe him to work a miracle on that day, which would give them the opportunity of accuſing him as a prophaner of the Sabbath. JESUS, who knew the ſecret thoughts of their hearts, aſked the Phariſees, and lawyers, whether it was <hi>lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day?</hi> But they refuſing to give any anſwer to the queſtion, our Lord laid his hand on the diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and immediately his body was reduced to its former dimenſions, and his health and ſtrength returned. So kind, ſo ſalutary and benevolent, as well as wonderful an action, ought to have convinced the Phariſees, that the perſon who wrought it, muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with power from on high, as no leſs than the mighty power of God could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch events; or if they could ſuppoſe that wicked agents had the power, that is not the way in which they might be expected to exert it; but theſe hypocritical wretches, inſtead of being perſuaded that JESUS was ſent from God, and exerted his miraculous powers for the good of mankind, were labouring to turn this miracle to his diſadvantage. But our Lord ſoon put an end to their wicked deſigns, by proving, that according to their own allowed practice, he had done nothing but what was lawful: <hi>Which of you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall have an aſs, or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pull him out on the Sabbath day?</hi> Our Lord's argument ſtood thus, If a misfortune happens to one of your beaſts, you make no ſcruple of aſſiſting it on the Sabbath, though the action be attended with conſiderable labour: and ſurely, I may relieve a

This reaſoning was ſo ſtrong, forcible, and concluſive, and, at the ſame time, ſo ſimple and eaſy, that the moſt illiterate of mankind, muſt ſee its propriety and feel its force, and the moſt prejudiced could not contradict it. This was manifeſt from the profound ſilence with which theſe remarks of our Lord were heard, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued after he had done ſpeaking. None of his adverſaries, however inveterate their malice, or hot their reſentment, durſt at this time appear againſt him, for they could not anſwer again to theſe things.</p>
               <p>BEFORE they ſat down to meat, our bleſſed Saviour had an opportunity of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pride of the Phariſees, which manifeſted itſelf by an anxious and eager deſire to obtain the moſt honourable place at the table; nor did he fail, on this occaſion, to give them ſuch a rebuke, as their ridiculous behaviour deſerved. To make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their folly, our Lord called upon them to conſider, that pride generally expoſes the perſon to frequent mortifications, and many affronts, while an humble deportment is a ſure way to honour and reſpect: 'When thou art bidden of any man to a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,' ſaid he, 'ſit not down in the higheſt room; for leſt a more honourable man than thou be bidden, of him; and he that bade thee and him, come and ſay to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with ſhame to take the loweſt room. But when thou art bidden go and ſit down in the loweſt room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may ſay unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then ſhalt thou have worſhip in the preſence of them that ſit at meat with thee. For whoſoever exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed; and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.'</p>
               <p>HAVING directed this diſcourſe to the Phariſees in general, our Lord turned to the maſter of the houſe, and ſaid unto him, 'When thou makeſt a dinner, or a ſupper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinſmen, nor thy rich neighbours. But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind:' limit not thy hoſpitality to the rich an great, but let the poor and needy be partakers of thy bounty: and thou ſhalt be bleſſed, added our Lord, for they cannot recompenſe thee; but thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurrection of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Our Lord, in anſwer to this, took occaſion to deliver to the company at the table, the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the marriage-ſupper: 'A certain man,' ſaid he, 'made a great ſupper, and bade many; and ſent his ſervant at ſupper-time, to ſay to them that were bidden, Come: for all things are now ready. And they all with one conſent began to make excuſes. The firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it: I pray thee have me excuſed.

And the ſervant ſaid, lord, it is done as thou haſt commanded, and yet there is room. And the lord ſaid unto the ſervant, go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be filled: for I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe men which were bidden, ſhall taſte of my ſupper.'</p>

perſons of infamous lives, and abandoned characters, came amongſt the crowds which preſſed to hear him. Theſe perſons, conſcious of their unworthineſs, approached our great Redeemer with the higheſt reverence, and heard him with the moſt reſpectful and ſteady attention. This opportunity was readily embraced by the great Saviour of ſinners, who, far from upbraiding them with their former wickedneſs, or ſpurning them from him with contempt, kindly condeſcended to inſtruct them in thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their everlaſting peace, and not only taught them in the fields, but went with them to their houſes, and kindly condeſcended to teach them the nature of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and lead them in the way of eternal life and happineſs.</p>
               <p>THIS condeſcending goodneſs in our great Redeemer, was highly offenſive to the proud, ſelf-conceited, ſelf-righteous Phariſees; they wanted to be accepted on the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own unworthineſs, and could not bear the thoughts of the infinite mercy of God, manifeſted to the greateſt of ſinners; and, therefore, with hearts full of envious pride, they advanced it as a ground of reproach againſt our great Redeemer, that this man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with them. Their pride could not bear the thought, that theſe perſons whom they ſo much deſpiſed, ſhould be looked upon by our Saviour with more kindneſs than themſelves; and they thought his condeſcention unworthy the character of a prophet. They had no other views of divine acceptance, than ſuch as had an immediate reference to the law; and the infinite mercy of God to ſinners, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the goſpel of his Son, was what they could not underſtand; our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer therefore, to convince them of their ignorance, to check their abominable pride and ſelf-ſufficiency, to diſplay the extenſive and abundant mercy of God to ſinful man, and to vindicate his own conduct, in converſing with the meaneſt and moſt contemptible perſons, propoſed three parables to their conſideration.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe parables was that of the loſt ſheep, which the Divine Inſtructor delivered in the following words: 'What man of you, having an hundred ſheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderneſs, and go after that which is loſt, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his ſhoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, ſaying unto them, rejoice with me; for I have found my ſheep which was loſt:' Thus, by the natural turn of the human mind, which is reſtleſs and uneaſy under the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of loſing part of its property, and fixes with ſuch eager attention on that which it has loſt, that it overlooks thoſe valuable objects which it has in poſſeſſion, our great Redeemer deſcribes the regard which God has to his people while they wander from him in a loſt, periſhing condition; and by the joy which expands the human heart, when that which had long been given up for loſt, is recovered; our Lord diſplays the kind reception which the worſt of ſinners will find, when they are made ſenſible of their evil ways, and are enabled to believe in the Son of God for life and ſalvation. And in this elegant, well-choſen parable, he further deſcribes the joy of the heavenly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, when any of the ſheep of Chriſt, who have long wandered from his fold, are convinced of their deſperate condition, humbled under a ſenſe of their unworthineſs and wickedneſs, and are enabled to return: <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that likewiſe joy ſhall be in heaven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons, that need no repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is no perſon on earth ſo juſt and holy, and whoſe conduct hath been ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and uniformly correct, as to need no repentance; but the proud Phariſees, to whom our Lord directed theſe parables, would fain have been eſteemed by the world as ſuch perſons; and theſe are particularly referred to in this repreſentation, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029927_0162_0FE3379EC037E0B0"/>
to diſplay the amazing and infinite extent of divine forgivneſs. A ſecond para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which our great Redeemer publiſhed with the ſame view, was that of the loſt piece of ſilver: 'Either,' ſaid the divine inſtructor, 'what woman having ten pieces of ſilver, if ſhe loſe one piece, doth not light a candle, and ſweep the houſe, and ſearch diligently till ſhe find it? and when ſhe hath found it, ſhe calleth her friends and neighbours together, ſaying, rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I have loſt: Likewiſe, I ſay unto you, there is joy in the preſence of the angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth.'</p>
               <p>THIS parable is founded on the ſame principles, and publiſhed with the ſame deſign as the former, only the caſe and circumſtances are varied; and our great Redeemer condeſcends in various forms and methods of addreſs to inculcate the ſame truth. The infinite mercy of God to ſinners, and the kind reception they will find, when they are enabled to repent and return, is the great doctrine which runs through his goſpel, and this is the great deſign of all his undertakings; to accompliſh this, to remove every difficulty which attended it, to overcome and ſubdue every power which oppoſed it, and to publiſh the glad-tidings to a ſinful world, he left the glories of the heavenly regions, he laid aſide the dignity and glory of his heavenly nature, and condeſcended to become man; he was a partaker of the evils conſequent on ſin, that ſinful men might be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them; he was <hi>a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief,</hi> that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſubſtantial and eternal joy; and he died that we might live. To publiſh this great truth, and to prevail on the world to receive it, was the whole deſign of his miniſtry; every doctrine he advanced, every miracle which he wrought, had a natural tendency to promote this benevolent deſign; and this great end, in various forms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and various methods of addreſs, he invariably purſued during the time of his abode on earth. And that no method of addreſs, no form of inſtruction, might be omitted, which would powerfully operate on the mind and prepare it for the reception of a truth, ſo worthy of God, ſo friendly to man, our Lord condeſcended to appeal to the feelings of humanity; and from the natural affection which an offended father feels for a repenting ſon, he urged the certainty and the extent of divine forgivneſs.</p>
               <p>THE parable which our great Redeemer propoſed with this view, is the fineſt picture of nature; it contains all the beauties of juſt deſcription, and particularly calculated to engage the attention and affect the heart; the evangeliſt Luke hath given it in the following words: <hi>A certain man had two ſons: And the younger of them ſaid to his Father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after, the younger ſon gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there waſted his ſubſtance with riotous living. And when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himſelf to a citizen of that country; and he ſent him into his fields to feed ſwine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the huſks that the ſwine did eat; and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himſelf, he ſaid, how many hired ſervants of my father's have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger! I will ariſe and go to my father, and I will ſay unto him, father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy ſon: make me as one of thy hired ſervants. And he aroſe, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him. And the ſon ſaid unto him, father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be called thy ſon. But the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid to his ſervants, bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and ſhoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my ſon was dead, and is alive again; he was loſt, and is found. And they
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029927_0163_0FE337AC248C9140"/>
began to be merry. Now his eldeſt ſon was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the houſe, he heard muſic and dancing. And he called one of the ſervants, and aſked what theſe things meant. And he ſaid unto him, thy brother is come: and thy father hath killed the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted calf, becauſe he hath received him ſafe and ſound. And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore came his father out, and entreated him. And he anſwering ſaid to his father, Lo, theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy commandment, and yet thou never gaveſt me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as ſoon as this thy ſon was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou haſt killed for him the fatted calf. And he ſaid unto him, ſon, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we ſhould make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was loſt, and is found.</hi> Luke xv.11. to the end.</p>
               <p>THE deſign of this parable is manifeſted at firſt ſight, and ſtands a beautiful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading memorial of the fullneſs, the freeneſs, and extent of divine mercy to the greateſt of ſinners; it not only declares that it is the fixed determination of heaven to forgive, and that mercy is an eſſential attribute of deity, the brighteſt ſtar in the eternal crown; but it ſhews that this glorious diſpoſition of heaven to forgive, entirely coincides with the feelings of humanity; for the eternal God condeſcends to appeal to that paternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which he hath planted in the human breaſt, in vindication of his own conduct in pardoning ſinners, and in explanation of the nature and extent of his mercy.</p>
               <p>IF this parable be applied to the particular caſe with which it ſtands-connected, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a reproof which the bleſſed JESUS directed to the Phariſees for their murmuring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his condeſcending kindneſs to publicans and ſinners; and hereby they are taught that if they would reſemble the holy and happy inhabitants of the celeſtial regions, they would not murmur and complain, and look down with envious pride, and ſullen contempt while he converſed with thoſe who were noted for being habitually and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly wicked, but would rejoice to ſee ſuch perſons purſue thoſe methods which might tend to their reformation and final ſalvation; nor would the gladneſs of heart they might expreſs on this occaſion, be any reproach to that ſtrictneſs and purity which they value themſelves upon; 'for there is joy in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons which need no repentance.'</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having thus vindicated his own conduct, in his condeſcending kindneſs to publicans and ſinners, by ſhewing the vaſt extent of divine mercy, and the pleaſure which the happy inhabitants of the heavenly regions, take in the pardon of the worſt of ſinners, and their reſtoration to divine favour; he then delivered a parable to impreſs on the minds of his hearers the neceſſity of attending to the concerns of futurity. This he exemplified in the caſe of the unjuſt ſteward, who being warned by his lord to give up his ſtewardſhip, took ſuch meaſures as were likely to procure him a ſubſiſtence when he had loſt his preſent employment: 'There was,' ſaid our great Redeemer, 'a certain rich man, which had a ſteward; and the ſame was accuſed unto him, that he had waſted his goods. And he called him, and ſaid unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy ſtewardſhip; for thou mayeſt be no longer ſteward. Then the ſteward ſaid within himſelf, What ſhall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the ſtewardſhip; I cannot dig; to beg I am aſhamed. I am reſolved what to do, that when I am put out of the ſtewardſhip, they may receive me into their houſes. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and ſaid unto the firſt, how much oweſt thou unto my lord? And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſaid, an hundred meaſures of oil. And he ſaid unto him, take thy bill, and ſit down quickly, and write fifty. Then ſaid he to another, and how much oweſt thou? And he ſaid, an hundred meaſures of wheat. And he ſaid
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029927_0164_0FE337ADF479CAC8"/>
unto him, take thy bill, and write fourſcore. And the lord commended the unjuſt ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, becauſe he had done wiſely: for the children of this world are wiſer in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than the children of light.' The ſcope of our Lord's argument in this paſſage, is apparently this: as a prudent thought for futurity, and a ſteady purſuit of thoſe means which tend to prevent apprehended evils, though thoſe means may not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as lawful in themſelves, are ſufficient to denominate a perſon wiſe: with what earneſt attention, and unremitting application, ought thoſe who have eternity in view, to purſue the precepts of heavenly wiſdom, and to make all leſſer events ſubſervient to the greater end of obtaining eternal happineſs: 'And I ſay unto you,' added our great Redeemer, 'make to yourſelves friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.'</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees, whoſe hearts were ſet upon the things of this world, and who had but very feeble and contracted views of eternal things, derided this doctrine of our great Redeemer; but he after giving them a ſeaſonable reproof, produced by a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moſt remarkable parable, to ſhew the vanity of riches, and the vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of eternal things: 'There was,' ſaid he, 'a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of ſores, and deſiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his ſores. And it came to paſs, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's boſom: the rich man alſo died, and was buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom. And he cried, and ſaid, father Abraham, have mercy on me, and ſend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham ſaid, ſon, remember that thou, in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented. And beſides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulph ſixed: ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you cannot: neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence. Then he ſaid, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou wouldeſt ſend him to my father's houſe; for I have five brethren; that he may teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify unto them, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment. Abraham ſaith unto him, they have Moſes and the prophets; let them hear them. And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.'</p>
               <p>THIS parable is the moſt awful and alarming, and the moſt fully demonſtrative of the immortality of the ſoul, and it's exiſtence in a ſeparate ſtate, of any we meet with in the ſacred volume: the imagery is ſo beautiful and it is drawn in ſuch lively colours, that it has rather been looked upon as an hiſtory than a parable in all ages of the church; many of the moſt affecting, the moſt awful and important leſſons may be learned from it, and ſuch ſentiments are here diſplayed, as are not to be found in any other part of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt place, we learn the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of this preſent ſtate, and how little the attainment of vaſt poſſeſſions, in this world, conduces to the beſt intereſt of mankind. We have here held up to our view, a rich man, in all the grandeur, glory, and profuſion of oppulence, ſurrounded with all the honours, and partaking of all the pleaſures which earth can give: <hi>The rich man's wealth,</hi> the wiſeſt of men informs us, <hi>is his ſtrong city: and as an high wall in his own conceit.</hi> The rich man thinks that his

riches entitle him to every honour, and to the participation of every thing which can be enjoyed: but how is he pained to find himſelf moſt deplorably miſtaken, when the mind, ſatiated with enjoyment, and ſurfeited with pleaſure, grows ſick of delight; amidſt the abundance of riches, the ſoul ſtarves, it finds nothing that is conſiſtent with its ſpiritual nature, and would pine for want of ſolid enjoyment in the poſſeſſion of a whole material world.</p>
               <p>BUT how ſhort and uncertain are thoſe ſickly joys, thoſe ſurfeiting pleaſures which the rich man is able to partake of: <hi>The rich man,</hi> we are informed, <hi>died, and was buried.</hi> The pomp and pageantry, the luxury and all the conſequence in the world which riches give their poſſeſſor, will not enable him to face the great king of terrors, Death: and as the utmoſt profuſion of riches, cannot enable their poſſeſſor to face the pale tyrant with compoſure, neither can they bribe him to one moment's delay: <hi>No man hath power to retain the ſpirit in the day of death:</hi> the ſoul, all black and horrid with guilt, trembles at the approach of the eternal world, and with vaſt amazement and terror, ſtrives to evade the awful ſtroke, but all in vain: <hi>there is no diſcharge in that war:</hi> the caſe admits of no refuſal or delay: the unhappy mortal falls, and all that his riches can do, is only to carry him with prodigious pomp and ſplendour to the grave.</p>
               <p>FROM this awful and affecting parable, we likewiſe learn the ſtate of the dead, and the capacity of the ſeparated ſoul, to receive happineſs or miſery before the reſurrection of the body; <hi>The rich man died and was buried,</hi> we are informed, and what then? Did he enter into reſt, or did he remain in a ſtate of inſenſibility until the day of reſurrection? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe; but <hi>in hell he lifted up his eyes.</hi> The unhappy mortal's pleaſures and ſenſual gratifications are all paſt; and now, all naked, defenceleſs, and forlorn, he falls headlong into the depths of miſery and woe: the black regions of horror and deſpair are now his portion: he lies in inexpreſſible torment, and, amidſt theſe fiery regions, ſees nothing but what tends to increaſe and aggravate his woes: <hi>He lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom.</hi> The poor beggar that lay at his gate, all covered with ſores, died and was buried, and in the duſt loſt all his meanneſs, and was equal to the richeſt man on earth: there is no pre-eminence in the grave; <hi>for the ſmall and great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter.</hi> But how great the difference between the pooreſt ſaint and richeſt ſinner; Lazarus, at his death, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by angels into Abraham's boſom, while the rich man deſcended into hell, and lift up his eyes in torment.</p>
               <p>THUS having reprimanded the Phariſees, he took occaſion to ſpeak of affronts and offences, deſcribed their evil nature, and their dreadful puniſhment: 'It is impoſſible, ſaid he, but that offence will come: but woe unto him through whom they come. It were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the ſea, than that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord ſpake alſo againſt a quarrelſome temper in his ſervants, eſpecially in the miniſters and teachers of religion, preſcribed a ſeaſonable and prudent reprehenſion of the fault, accompanied with forgivneſs on the perſon injured, as the beſt means of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming the temptations that may ariſe from thence: 'Take heed to yourſelves: if thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn to thee, ſaying, I repent; thou ſhall forgive him.'</p>
               <p>THIS diſcourſe on forgivneſs, uttered at a time when the Phariſees had juſt upbraided him, by called him a falſe teacher, ſufficiently proves how truly he forgave them all the

perſonal injuries they had committed againſt him; and ſhould be a powerful recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that amiable virtue, the forgivneſs of injuries.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER beautiful theſe diſcourſes of our Saviour appear, when examined with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, they ſeem to have ſtaggered the faith of his diſciples and followers; perhaps they ſtill imagined, that he would ſhortly erect a temporal kingdom, and diſtribute among them the rewards they expected for their ſervices. If ſo, they might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their Maſter to <hi>increaſe their faith:</hi> as diſcourſes like theſe had a very different tendency from what might naturally have been expected from one who was going to eſtabliſh the throne of David, and extend his ſceptre over all the kindoms of the earth; but however this be, our Saviour told them, that if they had the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true faith, it would be ſufficient for overcoming all temptations, even thoſe which ſeems as difficult to be conquered, as the plucking up trees and planting them in the ocean: <hi>If ye had faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, ye might ſay unto this ſycamine-tree, be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the ſea, and it ſhould obey you.</hi> Luke xvii.6.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Sickneſs and Death of Lazarus: <hi>JESUS</hi> receives an Account thereof; and, in his Way to Bethany, he heals ten Lepers in a Village of Samaria: He arrives at Bethany, and raiſeth Lazarus to Life, after he had been dead four Days: Many Jews believe: The Phariſees hold a Council againſt <hi>JESUS</hi>: Caiphas propheſieth: <hi>JESUS</hi> retireth to Ephraim, a City on the Borders of the Wilderneſs, where he ſheweth the ſpiritual Nature of the Kingdom of God, foretelleth the Deſtruction of the Jewiſh State, and inſtructeth his Diſciples concerning the Coming of the Son of Man. <hi>JESUS</hi> delivers the Parable of the unjuſt Judge, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Widow, and that of the Phariſee and the Publican: He anſwereth the Queſtion of the Phariſees concerning Divorces: He receiveth the little Children with Tenderneſs, that were brought unto him, and bleſſeth them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SHORTLY after our bleſſed Saviour had finiſhed theſe diſcourſes, one of his friends, named Lazarus, fell ſick at Bethany, a village two miles from Jeruſalem, but at a great diſtance from the countries beyond Jordon, where JESUS was now preaching the goſpel. The ſiſters of Lazarus, finding his ſickneſs was of a dangerous kind, thought proper to ſend an account of it to JESUS; being firmly purſuaded, that he who had cured ſo many ſtrangers, would readily come and give health to one whom he loved in ſo tender a manner; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>behold he whom thou loveſt is ſick:</hi> they did not add, come down and heal him, make haſte and ſave him from the grave; it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them to propoſe their neceſſities to their Lord, who was both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to help them in their diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHEN Jeſus heard that, he ſaid, this ſickneſs is not unto death;</hi> words which were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs carried to Martha and Mary, and muſt ſtrangely ſurpriſe them, and exerciſe both their's and his diſciples faith; ſince it is probable, that before the meſſenger arrived at Bethany, Lazarus had expired. Soon after, JESUS poſitively aſſured his diſciples, that Lazarus was dead.</p>
               <p>ST. LUKE, in the beginning of his account, tells us, that JESUS loved Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus; and that after he had received the meſſage, he abode two days
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029927_0168_0FE337BDD79356E0"/>
in the ſame place where he was. His deſign in this might be to inſinuate, that his lingering ſo long after the meſſage came, did not proceed from a want of concern for his friends, but happened according to the counſels of his own wiſdom: for the length of time which Lazarus lay in the grave, put his death beyond all poſſibility of doubt, removed every ſuſpicion of fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and conſequently afforded JESUS a fit opportunity of diſplaying the love he bore to Lazarus, as well as his own almighty power, in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reſurrection from the dead. His ſiſters, indeed, were by this means kept a while in painful anxiety, on account of their brother's life, and at laſt were pierced by the ſorrow of ſeeing him die: yet they muſt ſurely think themſelves abundantly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the evidence accruing to the goſpel from this aſtoniſhing miracle, as well as by the inexpreſſible ſurpriſe of joy they felt, when they again had their brother reſtored from the dead.</p>
               <p>AT the expiration of two days, JESUS ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>Let us go into Judea again,</hi> John xi.7. His diſciples were aſtoniſhed at this propoſal, and the recollection of his late danger in that country alarmed them: <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>the Jews of late thought to ſtone thee; and goeſt though thither again?</hi> Wilt thou hazard thy life amongſt thoſe who deſired nothing more than to find an opportunity of killing thee? <hi>Jeſus anſwered, are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth the light of this world: but if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS he intended to inform his diſciples, that they had no reaſon to fear, ſeeing his day was appointed, and the light of the Almighty was in him; that he could not ſtumble nor fall, before the night of his paſſion approached, but that night was coming when no man could work. JESUS having thus removed their groundleſs apprehenſions, and ſtrengthened their faith, that he might clearly explain to them the cauſe of his going into Judea again, told them, <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi> The diſciples underſtanding his diſcourſe in a literal ſenſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Lord, if he ſleep, he ſhall do well;</hi> his diſtemper is abated, and he in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is recovering. It would be, therefore, highly unreaſonable in us to take two days journey only to awake him out of his ſleep. Thus they covered their fears, and hinted to their Maſter, that it would be far ſafer to continue where they were, than to take a hazardous journey into Judea. They were, however miſtaken: for the evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt informs us, that he <hi>ſpake of his death, but they thought, that he had ſpoken of taking reſt in ſleep.</hi> JESUS, therefore, to remove any doubts, ſaid plainly to them, <hi>Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your ſakes, that I was not there to the intent that you might believe:</hi> I am glad for your ſakes, that I was not in Judea before he died; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>JESUS CHRIST having thus given his diſciples a proof of his divine knowledge, and of the deſigns of providence in the death of Lazarus, added, <hi>Nevertheleſs let us go unto him.</hi> Thus JESUS, who could have raiſed Lazarus without opening his lips, or riſing from his ſeat, leaves his place of retirement beyond Jordan, and takes a long Journey into Judea, where the Jews lately attempted to kill him; becauſe his being preſent in perſon, and raiſing Lazarus again to life, before ſo many witneſſes at Bethany, where he died, and was ſo well known, would be the means of bringing the men of that, and of future ages, to believe in his doctrine, ſo well fitted to prepare them for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to eternal life; an admirable proof, as an emblem of which, he gave them in this miracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:029927_0169_0FE337BF5E76A908"/>OUR Lord having thus declared his reſolution of returning into Judea, and Thomas conceiving nothing leſs than deſtruction from ſuch a journey, yet unwilling to forſake his Maſter, ſaid, <hi>Let us alſo go that we may die with him.</hi> Let us not forſake our Maſter in this dangerous journey, but accompany him into Judea, that if the Jews, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteracy we are well acquainted with, ſhould take away his life, we may alſo die with him.</p>
               <p>THIS journey being thus reſolved on, JESUS departed with his diſciples, and in his way to Bethany, paſſed through Samaria and Galilee: 'And as he entered into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which ſtood afar off: and they lifted up their voices, and ſaid, JESUS Maſter, have mercy on us. And when he ſaw them, he ſaid unto them, go ſhew yourſelves unto the prieſts. And it came to paſs, that as they went, they were cleanſed.' Luke xvii.12. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>ONE of theſe miſerable objects, was a native of the country, who perceiving that his cure was completed, came back praiſing God for the great mercy he had received; he had before kept at a diſtance from our Saviour, but being now ſenſible that he was entirely clean, approached his benefactor, that all might have an opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the miracle, and fell on his face at his feet, thanking him in the moſt humble manner, for his condeſcenſion in healing him of ſo terrible a diſeaſe. JESUS, in order to intimate, that thoſe who were enlightened with the knowledge of the truth, ought at leaſt, to have ſhewn as great a ſenſe of piety and gratitude as this Samaritan, aſked, 'were there not ten cleanſed, but where are the nine? There are not found that have returned to give glory to God, ſave this ſtranger.'</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour and his diſciples now continued their journey towards Bethany, where he was informed by ſome of the inhabitants of that village, that Lazarus was not only dead, as he had foretold, but had now lain in the grave four days. The afflicted ſiſters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> overwhelmed with ſorrow: ſo that many of the Jews from Jeruſalem, came to comfort them on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>IT appears, the news of our Lord's coming, had reached Bethany before he arrived at that village; for Martha, the ſiſter of Lazarus, being informed of his approach, went out and met him, but Mary, who was of a more ſedate and contemplative diſpoſition, fat ſtill in the houſe. No ſooner was ſhe come into the preſence of JESUS, than, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of grief ſhe poured forth her complaint: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> If thou hadſt complied with the meſſage we ſent thee, I well know that thy intereſt from heaven had prevailed, my brother had been cured of his diſeaſe, and delivere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from the dark chambers of death.</p>
               <p>MARTHA entertained a high opinion of our Saviour's power; ſhe believed that death did not dare to approach his preſence; and conſequently, if JESUS had arrived at Bethany before her brother's diſſolution, he had not fallen a victim to the king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: but imagined, that it was not in his power to heal the ſick, at a diſtance, though, at the ſame time, ſhe ſeemed to have ſome dark and imperfect hopes, that our bleſſed Lord would ſtill do ſomething for her; <hi>But I know,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that even now, whatſoever thou wilt aſk of God, God, will give it thee.</hi> She thought that JESUS could obtain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he deſired by prayer, and therefore, did not found her hopes on his power, but on the power of God, through his interceſſion. She doubtleſs knew, that the great Redeemer of mankind had raiſed the daughter of Jarius, and the widow's ſon of Nain, from the dead; but ſeems to have conſidered her brother's reſurrection as much more difficult, becauſe he had been longer dead.</p>

And here ſhe ſeems to have terminated all her hopes, not thinking that the Son of God would now call her brother from the ſleep of death. JESUS, therefore, to inſtruct her in this great truth, replied, <hi>I am the reſurrection, and the life.</hi> I am the author of the reſurrection, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and giver of that life they ſhall then receive; and therefore can, with the ſame eaſe, raiſe the dead now as at the laſt day: <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live: and whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, ſhall never die. Believeth thou this?</hi> To which Martha anſwered, <hi>Yea Lord: I believe that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God, which ſhould come into the world.</hi> I believe that thou art the true Meſſiah, ſo long promiſed by the prophets, and therefore believe thou art capable of performing, by thy power, every thing thou art pleaſed to undertake.</p>
               <p>SHE now ſeemed to entertain ſome confuſed expectations of her brother's immediate reſurrection; and leaving JESUS in the field, ran and called her ſiſter, according to his order, being willing that both Mary and her companions ſhould be witneſſes of this great miracle.</p>
               <p>MARY accordingly, no ſooner heard that JESUS was come, than ſhe immediately left her Jewiſh comforters, who only increaſed the weight of her grief, and flew to her Saviour: and the Jews, who ſuſpected ſhe was going to weep over the grave of her brother, followed her to that great prophet, who was going to remove all her ſorrows. Thus the Jews, who came from Jeruſalem to comfort the two mournful ſiſters, were brought to the grave of Lazarus, and made witneſſes of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>MARY having approached the great Redeemer of mankind, fell proſtrate at his ſect, and in a flood of tears poured out her complaint, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> No wonder the compaſſionate JESUS was moved at ſo affecting a ſcene: on this ſide ſtood Martha pouring forth a flood of tears; at his feet lay the affectionate Mary weeping and lamenting her dear departed brother; while the Jews, who came to comfort the afflicted ſiſters, unable to confine their grief, joined the ſolemn mourning, and mixed their friendly tears in witneſs of their love for the departed Lazarus, and in teſtimony to the juſtice of the ſiſters grief, for the loſs of ſo amiable, ſo deſerving a brother. JESUS could not behold the affliction of the two ſiſters and their friends, without having a ſhare in it himſelf; his heart was melted at the mournful ſcene, <hi>he groaned in ſpirit, and was troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER, to keep them no longer in ſuſpenſe, he aſked them, where they had buried Lazarus; not that he was ignorant where the body of the deceaſed was laid: he who knew that he was dead, when ſo far diſtant from him, and could raiſe him up by a ſingle word, muſt know where his remains were depoſited: to which they anſwered, <hi>Lord, come and ſee.</hi> The Son of God, now to prove that he was not only God, but a moſt compaſſionate man, and to ſhew us that the tender affections of a human heart, when kept in due bounds; that friendly ſorrow, when not immoderate, and directed to proper ends, is conſiſtent with the higheſt ſanctity of the ſoul, joined in the general mourning: he wept, even at the time that he was going to give the moſt ample proofs of his almighty power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:029927_0172_0FE337C8D6A06B60"/>THUS the Jews were convinced that he loved Lazarus exceedingly; but ſome of them interpreted this circumſtance to his diſadvantage: for, according to their mean way of judging, they fancied that he had ſuffered him to fall by the ſtroke of death, for no other reaſon in the world, but for want of power to reſcue him. And thinking the miracle, ſaid to have been wrought on the blind man, at the feaſt of tabernacles, at leaſt as difficult as the curing an accute diſtemper, they called the former in queſtion, becauſe the latter had been neglected: <hi>Could not this man,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>which opened the eyes of the blind, have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have died?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT JESUS took no notice of theſe queſtions; but grieving at the hardneſs of their hearts, and blindneſs of their infidelity, groaned again within himſelf, as he walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſepulchre of the dead. At his coming to the grave, he ſaid, <hi>Take ye away the ſtone.</hi> To which Martha anſwered, <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh; for he hath been dead four days:</hi> or, as the paſſage may be better rendered, hath lain in the grave four days. She meant to inſinuate that her brother's reſurrection was not to be expected. But JESUS gave her a ſolemn reproof, to teach her that there was nothing impoſſible with God; and that the power of the Almighty is not to be circumſcribed within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of human reaſon, <hi>Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Martha's objections being thus obviated, ſhe with the reſt, waited the great event in ſilence; and in purſuance of the command of the Son of God, took away the ſtone from the place where the dead was laid. JESUS had, on many occaſions, publicly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to his own miracles, as the proofs of his miſſion, though he did not generally make a formal addreſs to the Father before he worked this miracle; but being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>w to raiſe Lazarus from the dead, he prayed for his reſurrection, to convince the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pectators that it could not be effected, without an immediate interpoſition of the divine power: 'Father,' ſaid he, 'I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me; and I knew that thou heareſt me always: but becauſe of the people which ſtand by, I ſaid it, that they may believe that thou haſt ſent me: I entertained no doubt of thy empowering me to do this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and therefore, did not pray for my own ſake; I well knew that thou heareſt me always: I prayed for the ſake of the people, to convince them that thou loveſt me, haſt ſent me, and art continually owning the work I am come to do.</p>
               <p>HAVING returned thanks to his Father, for this opportunity of diſplaying his glory, <hi>He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</hi> This loud and efficacious call of the Son of God, awakened the dead; the breathleſs clay was inſtantly re-animated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he who had lain four days in the chambers of the tomb, obeyed immediately the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound: 'And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin: JESUS ſaith unto them, looſe him and let him go.' It would have been the leaſt part of the miracle, had JESUS, by his powerful word, unlooſed the napkins wherewith Lazarus was bound; but he brought him out in the ſame manner he was lying, and ordered the ſpectators to looſe him, that they might be better convinced of the miracle: for, in taking off the grave-clothes, they had the fulleſt evidence both of his death, and reſurrection. As on the one hand, the manner which he was ſwathed, muſt ſoon have killed him, had he been alive when buried; and conſequently demonſtrated, beyond all exception, that Lazarus had been dead ſeveral days, before JESUS called him again to life. Beſides, in ſtripping him, the linen offered, both to their eyes and ſmell, abundant proofs of his putrifaction; and, by that means, convinced them that he had not been in a trance, but was really dead; on the other hand, by his lively countenance appearing, when the napkin was removed,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029927_0173_0FE337CA5D006870"/>
his freſh colour, and his active vigour, they who came near and handled him, muſt be convinced, that he was in perfect health, and had an opportunity of proving the truth of the miracle, by the cloſeſt examination. There is ſomething extremely beautiful in our Lord's behaviour on this occaſion; he did not utter one upbraiding word, either to the doubting ſiſters, or the malicious Jews, nor did he let fall one word of triumph or exultation: <hi>Looſe him, and let him go,</hi> were the only words we have recorded: he was in this, as on all other occaſions, conſiſtent with himſelf, a pattern of perfect humility and ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the bleſſed work wrought by the Son of God at Bethany. And in the reſurrection of Lazarus, thus corrupted, and thus raiſed by the powerful call of JESUS, we have a ſtriking emblem, and a glorious earneſt of the reſurrection of our bodies from the grave at the laſt day; when the ſame powerful mandate, which ſpoke Lazarus again into being, ſhall collect the ſcattered particles of our bodies, and raiſe them to life.</p>
               <p>SO aſtoniſhing a miracle performed in the neighbourhood of Jeruſalem, before a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſpectators, many of them his enemies, could not fail of being the common topic of converſation, and of producing different effects upon different perſons. Many believed that JESUS could be no other than the great Meſſiah ſo long promiſed; while others, who ſtill expected a temporal prince, and therefore unwilling to acknowledge him for their Saviour, were filled with indignation, particularly the chief prieſts and elders. But this miracle, as well as all the reſt he had wrought in confirmation of his miſſion, was too evident to be denied; and, therefore, they pretended that his whole intention was to eſtabliſh a new ſect in religion, which would endanger both their church and nation: <hi>Then gathered the chief prieſts and the Phariſees a council,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>What do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE common people, aſtoniſhed at his miracles, will, if we do not take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, certainly ſet him up for the Meſſiah; and the Romans, under pretence of a rebellion, will deprive us both of our liberty and religion. Accordingly, they came to a reſolution to put him to death: this reſolution was not, however, unanimous; for Nicodemus, Joſeph of Arimathea, and other diſciples of our Saviour, then members of the council, urged the injuſtice of what they propoſed to do, from the conſideration of his miracles and innocence: but Caiaphas the high prieſt, from a principle of human policy, told them, that the nature of government often required certain acts of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in order to procure the ſafety of the ſtate: <hi>Ye know nothing at all, nor conſider that it is expedient for us, that one man ſhould die for the people, and that the whole nation periſh not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE council now having determined to put JESUS to death, deliberated, for the future, only upon the beſt methods of effecting it; and, in all likelihood, agreed to iſſue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, promiſing a reward to any perſon who would deliver him into their hands. For this reaſon, our bleſſed Saviour did not now go up to Jeruſalem, though he was within two miles of it; but returned to Ephraim, a city on the borders of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where he abode with his diſciples, being unwilling to go too far into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe the paſſover, at which he was to ſuffer, was at hand.</p>
               <p>WHILE our Lord abode in Ephraim, the Phariſees aſked him, when the kingdom of the Meſſiah was to begin. We have more than once obſerved, that the Jews had very
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029927_0174_0FE337CBE29B96B0"/>
grand ideas of the kingdom they expected this great Son of David would eſtabliſh, the number of his ſubjects, the ſtrength of his armies, and the pomp and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his court. It is therefore no wonder, that they were very deſirous of having that empire ſpeedily erected: but our Saviour, to correct this miſtaken notion, told them, that the Meſſiah's kingdom did not conſiſt in any external pomp of government, erected in ſome particular country, by the terror of arms, and deſolation of war; but in the ſubjection of the minds of men, and in rendering them conformable to the laws of the Almighty, which was to be effected by a new diſpenſation of religion, and this diſpenſation was already begun. It was therefore needleſs for them to ſeek in this or that place for the kingdom of God, as it had been already preached among them by CHRIST and his apoſtles, and confirmed by innumerable miracles: <hi>The kingdom of God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>cometh not with obſervation: neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here! or, Lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke xvii.20. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>SOON after ſpeaking theſe words to the Phariſees, he addreſſed himſelf to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and, in the hearing of the people, propheſied the deſtruction of the Jewiſh ſtate: whoſe conſtitution, both religious and civil, was the chief difficulty that oppoſed the erection of his kingdom: but becauſe love and compaſſion were eminent parts of our Saviour's temper, he mentioned that dreadful cataſtrophe in ſuch a manner, as might tend to the reformation and profit of his hearers. He informed them, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to this final deſtruction would be an univerſal diſtreſs; when they ſhould paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wiſh for the perſonal preſence of the Meſſiah to comfort them, but would be denied their requeſt: 'The days will come, when ye ſhall deſire to ſee one of the days of the Son of man, and ye ſhall not ſee it.' He next cautioned them againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, which in this time of affliction, would endeavour to draw the people after them, in order to ſupport their own power: <hi>And they ſhall ſay to you, ſee here: or, ſee there: go not after them, nor follow them. For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, ſhineth unto the other part under heaven; ſo ſhall alſo the Son of man be in his day. But firſt muſt he ſuffer many things, and be rejected of this generation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the coming of the Son of man ſhall be ſudden and unexpected: he will come in his own ſtrength, and with great power; he will throw down all oppoſition, deſtroy his enemies with ſwift deſtruction, and eſtabliſh his religion and government in a great part of the world, as ſuddenly as lightening darts from one part of the heaven to the other: <hi>but before theſe things come to paſs, he muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND, notwithſtanding this ſudden deſtruction and calamity that was to overwhelm the Jews, he told them their ſtupidity would be like that of the old world, at the time of the deluge, or that of Sodom before the city was deſtroyed: <hi>And as it was in the days of Noe, ſo ſhall it be alſo in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives; they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all. Likewiſe alſo as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded: but the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all. Even thus ſhall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he which ſhall be upon the houſe-top, and his ſtuff in the houſe, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewiſe not return back. Remember Lot's wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A better example than that of Lot's wife could not have been produced: for if any of his hearers, through an immoderate love of the world, ſhould be prevailed on,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029927_0175_0FE337D6F31FB908"/>
in order to ſave their goods, after they were admoniſhed from heaven of their danger, by the ſigns which prognoſticated the deſtruction of Jeruſalem; or if any of them, through want of faith, ſhould think, that the calamities predicted to fall on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would not be either ſo great or ſudden as he had declared, and did not uſe the precaution of a ſpeedy flight; they might behold in Lot's wife an example both of their ſin, and of their puniſhment: he added, that thoſe who endeavoured to ſave their lives, by flying into the city, ſhould meet the deſtruction they were endeavouring to avoid; whereas, thoſe who retired into the open towns and defenceleſs villages, ſhould be ſafe: 'Whoſoever ſhall ſeek to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever loſe his life ſhall preſerve it.'</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Lord, after making theſe predictions, ſpake the following parable, in order to excite them to a conſtant perſeverance in prayer, and not to be ſo weary and faint in their minds, as to neglect this neceſſary duty.</p>
               <p>THERE was in a city, ſaid our Lord, a judge, who, being governed by atheiſtical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, had no regard to the precepts of religion; and, being very powerful, did not regard what was ſaid of him by man: ſo that all his deciſions were influenced merely by paſſion or intereſt. In the ſame city was alſo a widow, who having no friends to aſſiſt her, was abſolutely unable to defend herſelf from injuries, or procure redreſs for any ſhe had received. In this deplorable ſituation, ſhe had recourſe to the unjuſt judge, in order to obtain ſatisfaction for ſome oppreſſive wrong ſhe had lately received: but the judge was ſo abandoned to pleaſure, that he refuſed, for a time, to liſten to her requeſt; he would not give himſelf the trouble to examine her caſe, though the crying injuſtice pleaded ſo powerfully for this diſtreſſed widow. She was not however, intimidated by his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal: ſhe inceſſantly importuned him, till, by repeated repreſentations of her diſtreſs, ſhe filled his mind with ſuch diſpleaſing ideas, that he was obliged to do her juſtice, merely to free himſelf from her importunity: <hi>Though,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>I fear not God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard man; yet, becauſe this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her; leſt, by her continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe weary me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſentiment, conveyed by our bleſſed Lord in this parable, is very beautiful: we hence learn, that the cries of the afflicted will, by being inceſſantly repeated, make an impreſſion, even on the ſtony hearts of wicked men, who glory in ther impiety and laugh at all the precepts of juſtice, virtue, and religion; and, therefore, cannot fail of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the benevolent Father of the univerſe, who will liſten to the petitions of his faithful ſervants, and pour on them the choiceſt of his bleſſings. <hi>Hear,</hi> ſaid our gracious Lord, <hi>what the unjuſt judge ſaith. And ſhall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi> Arguments of this kind, taken from the feeble goodneſs, or even from the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, to illuſtrate the ſuperior and infinite perfections of the Almighty were often made uſe of by the bleſſed JESUS, and with great ſucceſs in working the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſigned. It was indeed hardly poſſible to withſtand ſuch powerful appeals; they force their way directly into mens' hearts, bear down all oppoſition, and make a laſting impreſſion on mens' minds.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Lord having thus enforced the duty of prayer, in this expreſſive para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, aſked the following oppoſite queſtion, <hi>Nevertheleſs, when the Son of man cometh, ſhall he find faith on the earth?</hi> As if he had ſaid, notwithſtanding all the miracles I have wrought, and the excellent doctrines I have delivered, ſhall I find at my ſecond coming,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029927_0176_0FE337D8842D1B68"/>
the faith among the children of men, there is reaſon to expect? Will not moſt of them be found to have abandoned the faith, and wantonly aſk, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having delivered theſe diſcourſes to the Phariſees, who were righteous in their own conceit, and deſpiſed others: but as theſe particulars are better illuſtrated by their oppoſites, he placed the character of this ſpecies of men, in oppoſition to thoſe of the humble, deſcribing the reception each claſs met with from the Almighty, in the parable of the Phariſee and publican, who went up together to the temple at the time when the ſacrifice was offered, to direct their petitions to the God of their fathers.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſee, having a great opinion of his own righteouſneſs, went far into the court of the temple, that he might be as near the place of the divine reſidence as poſſible: here he offered his prayer, giving God the praiſe of his ſuppoſed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and had he been poſſeſſed of any, he would have acted properly: 'God,' ſaid he, 'I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this publican. I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.' Having thus commended himſelf to God, he wrapped himſelf up in his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and giving the poor publican a ſcornful look, walked away, perhaps to tranſgreſs ſome of the weightier matters of the law, judgment, juſtice, and truth, and to devour the houſes of diſtreſſed widows and helpleſs orphans. But how different was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the humble publican! Impreſſed with a deep ſenſe of his own unworthineſs, he would not even enter the courts of the temple, but ſtanding afar off, he ſmote upon his breaſt, and in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, earneſtly implored the mercy of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: 'And the publican, ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God, be merciful to me a ſinner.'</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Lord added, I tell you, however ye may judge from external appearances, and whatever preference ye may give to this haughty Phariſee; I, who know and ſee the heart, declare unto you, that the publican retired from the temple accepted by his God, and bleſſed with the mercy which he im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ored, while the proud Phariſee was diſregarded.</p>
               <p>THE preſent parable ſufficiently indicates, that all the ſons of men ſtand in need of mercy; both the ſtrict Phariſee and the deſpiſed publican, with the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are ſinners; and conſequently all muſt inplore pardon of their benevolent Creator: we muſt all aſcend to the temple, and there pour forth our prayers before the throne of grace; for there he has promiſed ever to be preſent, to grant the petitions of all who aſk with ſincerity and truth.</p>
               <p>THESE parables were ſpoken in the town of Ephraim; and during our Lord's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in that city, the Phariſees aſked him, Whether he thought it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cauſe? Our Saviour had twice before declared his opinion of this particular, once in Galilee, and once in Perea: it is therefore probable, that the Phariſees were not ignorant of his ſentiments, and that they aſked the queſtion then, to find an opportunity of increaſing the people againſt him, well knowing that the Iſraelites held the liberty which the law gave them of divorcing their wives as one of their chief privileges: but however that be, JESUS was far from fearing the popular reſentment, and accordingly declared the third time againſt arbitrary divorces. The Phariſees then aſked him why they were commanded by Moſes to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? Inſinuating, that Moſes was ſo tender of their happineſs, that he gave them
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029927_0177_0FE337DA0B6ED588"/>
liberty of putting away their wives, when they ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> occaſion. To which JESUS anſwered, <hi>Becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts, Moſes ſuffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not ſo:</hi> as unlimited divorces were not permitted in the ſtate of innocence, ſo neither ſhall they be under the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND I ſay unto you, Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and ſhall marry another, comitteth adultery: and whoſe marrieth her which is put away, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT which deciſion the diſciples were greatly ſurpriſed; and though they held their peace while the Phariſees were preſent, yet they did not fail to aſk our Lord the reaſon on which he founded his determination, when they were returned home: And in the houſe his diſciples aſked him again of the ſame matter. And he ſaith unto them, 'Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery againſt her. And if a woman ſhall put away her huſband, and be married to another, ſhe committeth adultery.'</p>
               <p>UNLIMITED divorces being prevalent among the Jews, gave great encouragement to family quarrels, were very deſtructive of happineſs, and hindered the education of their tender offspring; beſides, it greatly tended to make their children loſe that reverence for them which is due to parents, as it was hardly poſſible for the children to avoid engaging in the quarrel. Our Saviour's prohibition, therefore, of theſe divorces is founded on the ſtrongeſt reaſons, and greatly tends to promote the welfare of ſociety.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having, in the courſe of his miniſtry, performed innumerable cures in different parts of the country, ſeveral perſons thinking, perhaps, that his power would be as great in preventing as in removing diſtempers, brought their children to him, deſiring that he would put his hands upon them and bleſs them. The diſciples, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, miſtaking the intention, were angry with the perſons, and rebuked them, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to give this trouble to their Maſter. But JESUS no ſooner ſaw it, than he was greatly diſpleaſed with his diſciples and ordered them not to hinder parents from bringing their chlidren to him: 'S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.' That is, the church militant on earth, and that triumphant in heaven, are compoſed of perſons who reſemble little children in humility and meekneſs. Accordingly, taking them up in his arms, he bleſſed them with his uſual benevolence.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE time of our dear Lord's paſſion drawing near, he departed from Ephraim, and repaired by the way of Jericho, towards Jeruſalem: but before he arrived at Jericho, a ruler of the ſynagogue came running to him, and kneeling down before him,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029927_0178_0FE337DB90DBE330"/>
aſked him, 'Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have eternal life? Mat. xix.16. Though this young ruler pretended to pay great honour to our dear Redeemer, yet the whole was no more than a piece of hypocriſy: for though he ſtyled him good, yet he did not believe that he was ſent from God, as ſufficiently appears from his refuſing to obſerve the counſel given him by JESUS; nor could his artful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations eſcape the piercing eye of the great Saviour of the world; he well knew his ſecret intentions, and beheld the inmoſt receſſes of his ſoul; and accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him for his hypocritical addreſs, before he anſwered his queſtion: <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</hi> But as he had deſired the advice of our bleſſed Saviour, who never refuſed it to any of the ſons of men, he readily anſwered his queſtion, by telling him, that he muſt obſerve all the moral precepts of the law; there being a neceſſary connection between the duties of piety towards the Almighty, and of juſtice and temperance towards men, the latter of which, were much more difficult to counterfeit than the former; 'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He ſaith unto him, Which? JESUS ſaid, Thou ſhalt do no murder, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. The young man ſaith unto him, All theſe things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?'</p>
               <p>THESE commandments were, doubtleſs, underſtood by the young ruler, in the vague ſenſe put upon them by the doctors and interpreters of the law; and, therefore, the character he here gave of himſelf might be very juſt: for, though he was far from being a perſon of true probity and virtue, he might have appeared, in the ſight of men, as a perſon of a very fair character: and having maintained that character, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great riches, he certainly deſerved commendation; and therefore, might be loved by that benevolent perſon who left the boſom of his Father, to redeem loſt mankind: but he was, at the ſame time, very faulty with regard to his love of ſenſual pleaſures, a ſin which might have eſcaped even his own obſervation, though it could not eſcape the all-ſeeing eye of the Son of God. Our bleſſed Saviour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, willing to make him ſenſible of this ſecret deſire of poſſeſſing the riches of this world, told him, that if he aimed at perfection, he ſhould diſtribute his poſſeſſions among the poor and indigent, and become his diſciple: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven: and come and follow me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE young man did not expect this condition, he was aſtoniſhed at it, and without making the leaſt reply, retired, filled with ſorrow, being very unwilling to part with his large eſtates: <hi>But when the young man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE pernicious influence of riches over the minds of the children of men, being thus melancholy inſtanced, our bleſſed Saviour cautioned his diſciples againſt fixing their minds on things of ſuch dangerous tendency, by ſhewing how very difficult it was for a rich man to procure an habitation in the region of eternal happineſs: 'Verily I ſay unto you, That a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his diſciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, ſaying, who then can be ſaved? But JESUS beheld them, and ſaid unto them, with men this is impoſſible; but with God all things are poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="unknown:029927_0179_0FE337E61A87EE60"/>BY this it appears, that if man be not aſſiſted by the grace of God, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to obtain the happy rewards of the kingdom of heaven; but, by the aſſiſtance of grace, which the Almighty never refuſes to thoſe who ſeek it with their whole heart, it is very poſſible.</p>
               <p>BUT the diſciples of our bleſſed Lord were far from being ſatisfied with this anſwer, as they had doubtleſs, often reflected with pleaſure on the high poſts they were to enjoy in their Maſter's kingdom. Peter ſeems particularly to have been diſappointed; and therefore addreſſed his Maſter in the name of the reſt, begging him to remember, that his apoſtles had actually done what the young man had refuſed: they had abandoned their relations, their friends, their poſſeſſions, and their employments, on his account: and, therefore, deſired to know what reward they were to expect, for theſe inſtances of their obedience. To which JESUS replied, that they ſhould not fail of a reward, even in this life: for immediately after his reſurrection, when he aſcended to his Father, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on his mediatorial office, they ſhould be advanced to the honour of judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael; that is, of ruling the church of CHRIST, which they were to plant in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the earth; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord having given this anſwer to Peter, he next mentioned the rewards his other diſciples ſhould receive, both in this world, and in that which is to come: they, ſaid he, who have forſaken all for my ſake, ſhall be no looſers in the end; their benevolent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who intends to give them poſſeſſions in the heavenly Canaan, will not fail to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, during their long and painful journey to that happy country, and raiſe them up friends who ſhall aſſiſt them with thoſe neceſſaries they might have expected from their relations, had they not left them for my ſake. Divine Providence will take care that they have every thing valuable that can be given them by their relations, or they could deſire from large poſſeſſions: they ſhall, indeed, be fed with the bread of ſorrow, but this ſhall produce joys, to which all the earthly pleaſures bear no proportion; and, in the end, obtain everlaſting life: they ſhall leave this vale of tears, with all its pains and ſorrows, behind them, and fly to the boſom of their Almighty Father, the fountain of life and joy, where, for all the ſufferings they have undergone in this world, they ſhall be infinitely rewarded.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to this, many who are by their fellow-mortals, conſidered as the laſt of mankind, becauſe of their ſufferings, ſelf-denials, and mortifications, ſhall be really firſt, not only in point of future reward, but even with regard to preſent ſatisfaction: <hi>But many that are firſt ſhall be laſt; and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeems theſe words were ſpoken to keep the diſciples humble, as, in all probability, they at firſt underſtood the promiſe of their ſitting on twelve thrones in a natural ſenſe; ſo they were ready to conſtrue every expreſſion to a temporal kingdom, which they ſtill expected their Maſter would erect upon earth. Our bleſſed Lord, therefore, to remove all thoughts they might entertain of this kind, told them, that though he had deſcribed the rewards they were to expect for the ready obedience they had ſhewn to his commands, and the pains they were to take in propagating the goſpel amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; yet theſe rewards were ſpiritual, and not confined to the Jews alone, but extended alſo to the Gentiles, who, in point of time, ſhould excel the Jews, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally embrace the goſpel before that nation was converted.</p>
               <p>OUR great Redeemer illuſtrated this doctrine with the parable of the houſe-holder, who at different hours of the day, hired labourers to work in his vineyard: 'The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029927_0180_0FE337E79DAF7108"/>
of heaven, ſays our bleſſed Saviour, is like unto a man that is an houſe-holder, which went out early in the morning, to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he ſent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and ſaw others ſtanding idle in the market place, and ſaid unto them, go ye alſo into the vineyard, and whatſoever is right, I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the ſixth and ninth hour, and did likewiſe. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others ſtanding, ſaith unto them, why ſtand ye here all the day idle? They ſay unto him, becauſe no man hath hired us. He ſaid unto them, Go ye alſo into the vineyard; and whatſoever is right, that ſhall ye receive. So, when even was come, the lord of the vineyard ſaid unto his ſteward, call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the laſt unto the firſt. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every man a penny. But when the firſt came, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould have received more; and they likewiſe received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured againſt the good man of houſe, ſaying, theſe laſt have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he anſwered one of them, and ſaid, Friend, I do the no wrong; didſt not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this laſt, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good? So the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt: for many be called, but few choſen,' Matt. xx.1—16.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour delivered the parable of the houſe-holder in ſuch a manner, as, from the application he has made of it, it would not be difficult to interpret it. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of religion, which God gave to mankind in different parts of the world, are repreſented by the vineyard: the Jews, who were early members of the true church, and obliged to obey the law of Moſes, are the labourers which the houſe-holder hired early in the morning; the Gentiles, who were converted at ſeveral times, by the various inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Providence, to the knowledge and worſhip of the true God, are the labourers hired at the third, ſixth, and ninth hour: and the invitation given at the eleventh hour, implies the calling of the Gentiles in every country, to live piouſly and virtuouſly. The law of Moſes was a heavy yoke; and therefore, the obedience to its precepts was very elegantly repreſented, by bearing the heat and burden of the whole day: but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted Gentiles paid obedience only to ſome particular precepts of the law, bore but part of its weight, and were, therefore, repreſented by thoſe who were hired, at the third, ſixth, and ninth hours; while thoſe Heathens, who regulated their conduct by the law of nature only, and eſteemed the works of juſtice, piety, temperance and charity, as their whole duty, are beautifully repreſented as labouring in the cool of the evening, only one hour.</p>
               <p>THE time being come when each labourer was to receive his wages, they were all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on an equal footing; theſe rewards being the privileges and advantages of the goſpel. The Jews who had borne the grievous yoke of the Moſaic ceremonies, murmured when they found the Gentiles were admitted to its privileges, without being ſubject to their ceremonial worſhip: but we muſt not urge the circumſtance of the reward, ſo far as to fancy that either Jews or Gentiles merited the bleſſings of the goſpel, by their having laboured faithfully in the vineyard, or having behaved well under their ſeveral diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The goſpel, with its bleſſings, was beſtowed entirely by the free grace of God, and without any thing in men to merit it; beſides, it was offered promiſcuouſly to all, whether good or bad, and was embraced by perſons of all character. The concluſion of the parable deſerves our utmoſt attention; we ſhall often meditate upon it, and take care to make our calling and election ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="unknown:029927_0181_0FE337E92B3B2B50"/>OUR Lord having finiſhed theſe diſcourſes, he continued his journey towards Jeruſalem, where the chief prieſts and elders, ſoon after the reſurrection of Lazarus, iſſued a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, promiſing a reward to any one who ſhould apprehend him. In all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this was the reaſon why the diſciples were aſtoniſhed at the alacrity of our Lord during this journey, while they themſelves followed him trembling, JESUS, therefore, thought proper to repeat the prophecies concerning his ſufferings, in order to ſhew his diſciples that they were entirely voluntary, adding that though the Jews ſhould put him to death, yet inſtead of weakening, it ſhould increaſe their faith, eſpecially as he would riſe again the third day from the dead: <hi>Behold, we go up to Jeruſalem; and all things that are written by the prophets, concerning the Son of man, ſhall be accompliſhed: for he ſhall be delivered to the Gentiles, and ſhall be mocked, and ſpitefully entreated, and ſpitted on: and they ſhall ſcourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he ſhall riſe again,</hi> Luke xviii.31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>IT muſt have given the greateſt encouragement to out Lord's diſciples, had they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and applied this prediction which was built upon the ancient prophecies, in a proper manner; but they were ſo ignorant in the ſcriptures, that they had no idea of what he meant: <hi>And they underſtood none of theſe things: and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the ſons of Zebedee were ſo ignorant, that they thought their Maſter, by his telling them he would riſe again from the dead, meant that he would then erect his empire; and, accordingly, begged that he would confer on them the chief poſts in his kingdom, which they expreſſed, by deſiring to be ſeated, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, in alluſion to his placing the twelve apoſtles upon twelve thrones, judging the tribes of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>EVER ſince our Saviour's transfiguration, the ſons of Zebedee had conceived very high notions of his kingdom, and poſſibly of their own merit alſo, becauſe they had been admitted to behold that miracle; but JESUS told them, they were ignorant of the nature of the honour they requeſted; and ſince they deſired to ſhare with him in his glory, aſked them, if they were willing to ſhare with him alſo in his ſufferings: 'Ye know not what ye aſk. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptiſm that I am baptized with?' Matt. xx.22. The two diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, raviſhed with the proſpect of the dignity they were aſpiring after, replied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, that they were both able and willing to ſhare any hardſhip their Maſter might meet with in the way to his kingdom. To which he anſwered, that they ſhould certainly ſhare with him his troubles and afflictions; but that they had aſked a favour which was not his to give: 'Ye ſhall drink, indeed, of my cup, and be baptized with the baptiſm that I am baptized with: but to ſit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.'</p>
               <p>THE indignation of the reſt of the diſciples being raiſed by this ambitious requeſt of the two brothers, they thinking themſelves equally deſerving the principal poſts in the Meſſiah's kingdom, were highly offended at the arrogance of the ſons of Zebedee. JESUS, therefore, in order to reſtore harmony amongſt his diſciples, told them, that his kingdom was very different from thoſe of the preſent world; and that the greatneſs of his diſciples did not, like that of ſecular princes, conſiſt in reigning over others in an abſolute and deſpotic manner: 'Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerciſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe authority upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you let him be your miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant; even as the Son of man came not to be adminiſtered unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>JESUS,</hi> being arrived at Jericho, giveth ſight to two blind men near that Place: He viſiteth Zaccheus the Publican, and delivers the Parable of a Nobleman who left Money with his Servants to trade with in his Abſence: The Rulers give Orders to apprehend him: Being arrived at Bethany, Mary anointeth his Feet: Judas murmureth at the Coſt. <hi>CHRIST</hi> rideth into Jeruſalem upon an Aſs, amidſt the Acclamations of the multitude, and weepeth over the City.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR Lord with his diſciples, and the multitude that accompanied him, being now arrived at Jericho, in their way to Jeruſalem, a famous city of Paleſtine, and the ſecond in the kingdom. Near this town JESUS cured two blind men, who ſat by the road begging, and expreſſed their belief in him, as the Meſſiah: 'And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And, behold, two blind men ſitting by the way ſide, when they heard that JESUS paſſed by, cried out, ſaying, have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. And the multitude rebuked them, becauſe they ſhould hold their peace: but they cried the more, ſaying, Have mercy on us, O Lord thou Son of David,' Matt. xx.29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p>THE Son of God ſtood ſtill at this importunate requeſt of the two men, and called them to him, that, by their manner of walking, ſpectators might be convinced that they were really blind. As ſoon as they approached him, he aſked them, what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted with ſuch earneſtneſs? To which the beggars anſwered, that they might receive their ſight: <hi>What will ye, that I ſhall do unto you? They ſay, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</hi> This requeſt was not made in vain: their compaſſionate Saviour touched their eyes, and immediately they received ſight, and followed him, glorifying and praiſing God. After conferring ſight on theſe beggars, Zaccheus, chief of the publicans, having often heard the ſame of our Lord's miracles, was deſirous of ſeeing his perſon; but the lowneſs of his ſtature prevented him from ſatisfying his curioſity, <hi>he ran before, and climbed up a ſycamore tree to ſee him; for he was to paſs that way.</hi> As JESUS approached the place where he was, <hi>he looked up, and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zaccheus, make haſte and come down; for to-day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</hi> Luke xix.5.</p>
               <p>AT which condeſcenſion of our Lord, the publican expreſſed his joy, carried him to his houſe, and ſhewed him all the marks of civility in his power. But the people when they ſaw he was going to the houſe of a publican, condemned his conduct, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the character of a prophet. Zaccheus ſeems to have heard theſe unjuſt reflections; and, therefore, was willing to juſtify himſelf before JESUS and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: 'And Zaccheus ſtood, and ſaid unto the Lord, Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four fold. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe, foraſmuch as he alſo is a ſon of Abraham.'</p>
               <p>FURTHER to convince the people that he acted agreeable to his character, in keeping company with publicans and ſinners, our Lord told them, that the true intention of his coming was to recover thoſe who had wandered from the paths of virtue, and reſtore them to the rightful owner: <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> While JESUS continued in the houſe of Zaccheus the publican, he ſpake a parable to his followers, who ſuppoſed, at his arrival in the royal city, he would erect the long-expected

kingdom of the Meſſiah: 'A certain nobleman,' ſaid he, 'went into a far country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for himſelf a kingdom, and to return. And he called his ten ſervants, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them ten pounds, and ſaid unto them, Occupy till I come. But his citizens hated him, and ſent a meſſage after him, ſaying, We will not have this man to reign over us. And it came to paſs, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded theſe ſervants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. Then came the firſt, ſaying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. And he ſaid unto him, Well, thou good ſervant; becauſe thou haſt been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. And the ſecond came, ſaying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. And he ſaid likewiſe to him, be thou alſo over five cities. And another came ſaying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, becauſe thou art an auſtere man: thou takeſt up that thou layeſt not down, and reapeſt that thou didſt not ſow. And he ſaith unto him, out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked ſervant. Thou kneweſt that I was an auſtere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not ſow: wherefore then gaveſt not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with uſury? And he ſaid unto them that ſtood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. (And they ſaid unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) For I ſay unto you, That unto every one which hath ſhall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath ſhall be taken away from him. But thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.'</p>
               <p>WE have the characters of three ſorts of men in this parable delineated by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour himſelf; namely, the true diſciples of the Meſſiah, the hypocrites, and the openly prophane: and the treatment theſe ſervants met with, repreſents the final ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that will be paſſed upon them by the awful Judge of the whole earth. The true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhall be rewarded with the honours and pleaſures of immortality, the hypocrites ſtripped of all the advantages they ſo often boaſted, and loaded with eternal infamy, and the open enemies of CHRIST, in proportion to the degree of their guilt, ſhall ſuffer ſevere puniſhment.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH this be the general ſenſe of the parable, yet it has alſo a particular relation to the time when it was ſpoken; and was intended to teach the diſciples, that though they might imagine that the Meſſiah's kingdom was ſpeedily to be erected, and they were ſoon to partake of its happineſs, yet this was not to happen before the death of their Maſter; that they themſelves muſt perform a long and laborious courſe of ſervices, before they received their eternal reward. That after his reſurrection, when he had obtained the kingdom, he would return from his ſeat of majeſty, and reckon with all his ſervants, and reward every one according to the improvements he had made in the truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care; and that he would execute, in an exemplary manner, his vengeance on thoſe who refuſed to let him reign over them, and did all in their power to hinder the erection of his kingdom among others. After ſpeaking this parable JESUS left the houſe of Zaccheus the publican, and continued his journey towards Jeruſalem, where he propoſed to celebrate the paſſover; and was earneſtly expected by the people, who came up to purify themſelves, and who began to doubt whether he would venture to come to the feaſt. This delay, however, was occaſioned by the proclamation iſſued by the chief prieſts, promiſing a reward to any one who would diſcover the place of his retirement; <hi>Now both the chief prieſts and the Phariſees had given a commandment, that if any knew where he were, he ſhould ſhew it, that they might take him.</hi> John xi.57</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="unknown:029927_0184_0FE337F62DDC0550"/>JESUS arrived at Bethany, ſix days before the paſſover, and repaired to the houſe of Lazarus, whom he had raiſed from the dead: 'there they made him a ſupper; and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha ſerved: but Lazarus was one of them that ſat at the table with him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of ſpikenard, very coſtly, and anointed the feet of JESUS, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the houſe was filled with the odour of the ointment. Then ſaith one of his diſciples, Judas Iſcariot, Simon's ſon, which ſhould betray him, Why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor; but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Then ſaid JESUS, Let her alone: againſt the day of my burying hath ſhe kept this. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.'</p>
               <p>BETHANY being not above two miles from Jeruſalem, the news of our Lord's arrival was ſoon ſpread through the capital, and great numbers of the citizens came to ſee Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, who had been raiſed from the dead, together with the great prophet who had wrought ſo ſtupendous a miracle; and many of them were convinced both of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the former, and the divinity of the latter: but the news of their converſion, together with the reaſon of it, being currently reported in Jeruſalem, the chief prieſts were ſoon ſenſible of the weight ſo great a miracle muſt have on the minds of the people; and therefore determined to put both Lazarus and JESUS to death, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord was not ignorant of what the chief prieſts and elders had determined againſt him, but was ſo far from declining to viſit Jeruſalem, that he even entered it in a public manner. When they 'were come to Bethpage, unto the mount of Olives, then ſent JESUS two diſciples, ſaying unto them, Go into the village over againſt you, and ſtraightway ye ſhall find an aſs tied, and a colt with her: looſe them, and bring them unto me. And if any man ſay ought unto you, ye ſhall ſay, the Lord hath need of them; and ſtraightway he will ſend them. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken by the prophet, ſaying, tell the daughter of Sion, behold thy king cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, meek, and ſitting upon an aſs, and a colt the foal of an aſs. And the diſcipels went, and did as JESUS commanded them, and brought the aſs, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they ſet him thereon. And a very great multitude ſpread their garments in the way, others cut down branches from the trees, and ſtrewed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried ſaying, Hoſanna to the Son of David: Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hoſanna in the higheſt. And when he was come into Jeruſalem, all the city was moved ſaying, Who is this? And the multitude ſaid, This is JESUS, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.' Matt. xxi.1—11.</p>
               <p>THIS circumſtance of our Lord has given more occaſion for profane wit and ridicule, than any before: we reckon an aſs to be a contemptible creature, and a man, eſpecially a man of character, riding upon an aſs, a ridiculous figure. Theſe are prejedices of our own times and country. And when they, who look no further than the manners and cuſtoms before them, examine this part of the ſacred ſtory by the ſtandard of modern prejudices, they ſee, or think they ſee, ſomething quite inconſiſtent with the gravity and dignity of the perſon, pretending to be the king of the Jews, when Chriſt is repreſented, entering in triumph into Jeruſalem, ſitting on an aſs. But however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible an aſs, or a man riding on that creature, may be at preſent, it was not ſo from the beginning. In many countries, and particularly in Judea, perſons of the higheſt diſtinction uſually rode upon aſſes. The governors of Iſrael are deſcribed in
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029927_0185_0FE30EB102FFF1C0"/>
the ſong of Deborah, as riding on white aſſes, Judg. v.10. And the thirty ſons of Jair, who was judge and prince over Iſrael twenty-two years, are ſaid to ride on thirty aſſes, ch. x.4. And another judge is recorded to have had forty ſons, and thirty nephews, that rode on ſeventy aſs colts,—ch. xii.14.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, it may be aſked, that ſuppoſing it was an uſual thing to ride on an aſs, why ſhould this common practice be mentioned in relation to the Meſſiah, as a mark of diſtinction? Might not the prophet, upon this ſuppoſition, as well have ſaid, he ſhall come walking on foot? And would he not have been as well known by one character as by the other? Beſides, if we turn to the book of Zachariah, where this prophecy is to be found, we ſhall ſee the perſon, there deſcribed, to be a king, a juſt king, and one having ſalvation: and what is there in this character, of riding on the foal of an aſs, that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a king, to a juſt king, and to one who was to bring ſalvation and deliverance to his people?</p>
               <p>HOWEVER difficult theſe queſtions may at firſt ſight appear, they are eaſily anſwered; not by conſidering the ſtate and condition of kings in general, but that peculiar to a king of Iſrael, on which is founded the propriety of this character.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall generally find, if we look into the hiſtory of the riſe and fall of nations, that their proſperity and ſucceſs were proportionable to their force and power, and to the conduct and ability of their leaders. But with the Jews, who from ſlaves in Egypt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a powerful people, the caſe was very different. The beſt and greateſt of their kings, and he who carried their empire to its greateſt height, has left us another account of their affairs: <hi>The people,</hi> ſays he, <hi>got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſword, neither did their own arm ſave them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour unto them,</hi> Pſalm xliv.3.</p>
               <p>WE are apt to aſcribe theſe and other ſimilar paſſages, to the piety and devotion of the Pſalmiſt; to conſider them only as acknowledgments of God's general providence in the affairs of the world; and hence are apt to overlook, or not ſufficiently conſider, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical truths they contain. It is true, indeed, that all ſucceſs, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, may be aſcribed to God; that it is he who giveth victory unto kings; but he generally maketh uſe of natural means, and it is no offence to his providence that kings liſt their thouſands of horſe and foot to ſecure themſelves and their dominions. But with the Jews it was very different: they were never ſo weak as when they made themſelves ſtrong; never ſo certainly ruined as when their force was great enough to create a confidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For God had taken the defence of Iſrael upon himſelf: and, the people were ſure to be undone whenever they took it out of his hands, to place it in their own.</p>
               <p>GOD was ſo tender of his honour in this reſpect, and ſo concerned to juſtify his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to protect Iſrael in the eyes of the world, that he would not always permit natural cauſes to interfere in their deliverance, leſt the people ſhould grow doubtful to whom they ought to aſcribe their victories. And for the ſame reaſon it was, that he commanded the people to have neither horſes nor chariots of war for their defence: not becauſe they were thought uſeleſs in war; for it is well known that they were the ſtrength of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kingdoms; but becauſe God himſelf had undertaken their defence, and he wanted neither horſe nor foot to fight their battles.</p>
               <p>IT is evident from the Jewiſh hiſtory, that this law was obſerved for near four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; namely, till about the middle of Solomon's reign. And when David ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſceptre of Iſrael, when the kingdom was carried to its utmoſt height, he himſelf
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:029927_0186_0FE337F95D4DE460"/>
rode on a mule, and provided no better equipage for his ſon, on the day of his corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Cauſe Solomon my ſon,</hi> ſaid David, <hi>to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon; and let Zadock the prieſt and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Iſrael,</hi> 1 Kings i.33, 34. And when that pious prince looked back, and contemplated this ſtate of things, he might well ſay, <hi>Some truſt in chariots and ſome in horſes; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God,</hi> Pſalm xx.7.</p>
               <p>BUT things quickly changed their aſpect in the reign of Solomon: he married the daughter of the king of Egypt, and opened a commerce between that country and his own; by which means he ſoon acquired an immenſe number of horſes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots; and all his ſucceſſors when they had it in their power, followed his example. But what did the kingdom gain by his change? They were before a rich and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, but after breaking this law of the Moſt High, their wealth and power gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually declined, till at laſt, their habitations were laid waſte, their temple and cities burnt with fire, and they themſelves carried captive into a ſtrange land.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it may be aſked, wherein the guilt of having a country full of horſes conſiſted? There is certainly no moral crime in purchaſing or keeping theſe creatures; but the kings of Iſrael were exalted to the throne, on condition that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the aſſiſtance of chariots and horſes, and depend upon God for ſucceſs in the day of battle.</p>
               <p>THUS having conſidered this law and the conſequences that reſulted from the breach of it, let us now look back to the prophecy relating to the Meſſiah: <hi>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; ſhout O daughter of Jeruſalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is juſt, and having ſalvation; lowly, and riding upon an aſs, and upon a colt the foal of an aſs. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horſe from Jeruſalem,</hi> Zach. ix.9.10.</p>
               <p>THE deſcendants of Jacob were to be ſaved by ſuch a king: and what ſort of a king could be expected? Is it poſſible to imagine that God would ſend a king to ſave them who ſhould be like the kings which had undone them? Is it not more reaſonable to think, that he would reſemble thoſe who had been deliverers of their country? Kings who feared God, and therefore feared no enemy; who, though mounted on aſſes, and colts the foals of aſſes, were able to put to flight the thouſands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of chariots and horſes that came againſt them.</p>
               <p>THE king, foretold by the prophet, was alſo to be juſt, meek, and lowly; but how could he have deſerved that character, had he appeared in the pride and pomp of war, ſurrounded with horſes and chariots, in direct oppoſition to the law of God? Or, as he was to bring ſalvation to the people, could he make uſe of thoſe means which God never had proſpered, and which he declared he never would?</p>
               <p>BY this it appears, that it was eſſential to the character of a king of Iſrael, who was to be juſt and lowly, and to bring ſalvation with him, that he ſhould come riding on an aſs, and a colt the foal of an aſs; but if any doubt can yet remain, let the prophet himſelf explain it, and immediately after the deſcription of the promiſed kings, adds, <hi>and I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horſe from Jeruſalem:</hi> plainly intimating, that the character given of the Meſſiah, that he ſhould ride on an aſs, was in oppoſition to the pride of their warlike kings, who had ruined themſelves and their people, by their great ſtrength in chariots and horſes.</p>
               <p>WE have thus undeniably ſhewn the intention of the prophet, when he foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould ride on an aſs; and from hence it appears, that the enemies of
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029927_0187_0FE33803886E37E8"/>
revelation have not the leaſt reaſon for turning this tranſaction into ridicule. Was it any reproach to CHRIST to ride into Jeruſalem on the foal of an aſs, when David, the greateſt of his anceſtors, and Solomon the wiſeſt, as long as he was wiſe, rode in the ſame manner? Can the Jews object to this circumſtance, and yet talk of the glories of David, and the magnificence of Solomon, who in the midſt of all that glory and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence did the very ſame thing? Or can they ſtumble at this character of the Meſſiah, without forgetting by what princes their anceſtors were ſaved, and by what undone?</p>
               <p>BUT to return. The prodigious multitude that now accompanied JESUS, filled the Phariſees and great men with malice and envy, becauſe every method they had taken to hinder the people from following JESUS, had proved ineffectual: <hi>The Phariſees therefore ſaid among themſelves, perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him.</hi> John xii.19.</p>
               <p>AS our bleſſed Redeemer drew near the city of Jeruſalem, ſurrounded by the rejoicing multitude, notwithſtanding the many affronts he had there received, he beheld the city; and with a divine generoſity and benevolence, which nothing can equal, wept over it; and, in the moſt pathetic manner, lamented the calamities which he foreſaw were coming upon it, becauſe its inhabitants were ignorant of the time of their viſitation: 'If,' ſaid he, 'thou hadſt known, even that thou, at leaſt, in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes, for the days ſhall come upon thee, that thine enemies ſhall caſt a trench about thee, and compaſs thee round, and keep thee in on every ſide, and ſhall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they ſhall not leave in thee one ſtone upon another; becauſe thou knoweſt not the time of thy viſitation.' Luke xix.42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>YE wandering mortals, behold here an example and generoſity infinitely ſuperior to any furniſhed by the heathen world; an example highly worthy for them to imitate and admire!</p>
               <p>WHEN our Lord entered Jeruſalem, ſurrounded by the multitude, the whole city was moved on account of the prodigious concourſe of people that accompanied him, and by their continual acclamations, JESUS rode immediately to the temple; but it being even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſoon left the city, to the great diſcouragement of the people, who expected he was immediately to have taken into his hands the reins of government: <hi>And Jeſus entered into Jeruſalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the even tide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</hi> Mark xi.11.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>EARLY the next morning our dear Lord left Bethany, to viſit again the capital of Judea: and, as he purſued his journey, he ſaw at a diſtance a fig-tree, which from its fulneſs of leaves promiſed abundance of fruit. This inviting object induced him to approach it, in expectation of finding figs; for he was hungry, and the ſeaſon for gathering them was not yet arrived: but, on his coming to the tree, he found it to be really barren; upon which our bleſſed Lord ſaid to it, <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee for ever,</hi> Matt. xxi.19.</p>
               <p>THIS tranſaction of our Lord, which was purely emblematical, and prefigured the ſpeedy ruin of the Jewiſh nation, on account of its unfruitfulneſs, under all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages it then enjoyed, has, by the enemies of revelation, been repreſented as an action unbecoming the Redeemer of mankind: but, if they had fully conſidered its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they would have been convinced, that, like the reſt of his miracles, it was done with a gracious intention; namely, to awaken his countrymen from their lethargy, and prevent the total ruin of their church and nation, by repentance.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, being diſappointed in finding fruit on this fig-tree, purſued his journey to Jeruſalem; and, on his arrival, went ſtraightway to the temple, the outer court of which he found full of merchandiſe. A ſight like this, vexed his meek and righteous ſoul: ſo that having made a ſmall ſcourge of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the ſeats of them that ſold doves, and would not ſuffer any veſſel to be carried through the temple: ſaying unto them, <hi>Is it not written, my houſe ſhall be called of all nations, a houſe of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is conſidered by St. Jerom as one of the greateſt of all our Saviour's miracles, and it muſt be owned that the circumſtances are very extraordinary, that one man ſhould undertake ſo bold, and execute ſo hazardous a taſk; one man, without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Caeſar, without any countenance from the Jewiſh rulers, without any arms, either to terrify the multitude, or defend himſelf; that he ſhould caſt out the whole tribe of mercenary trafficers, wreſt from thoſe worſhipers of wealth their darling idol, and trample under foot their great Diana; and all this without tumult or oppoſition: not one of the ſacrilegious rabble daring to move the hand or open the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:029927_0189_0FE33806C3094090"/>ACCORDING to tradition, a certain bright and dazzling luſtre flaſhed from his eyes, which the people were unable to bear, as they formerly could not behold the face of Moſes, for the glory that ſurrounded him: but as the ſcriptures take no notice of this tranſcendent luſtre, we muſt only adore the greatneſs of the fact, and, at the ſame time, ſo improve this miracle to our ſpiritual advantage, as to ſecure by accepting his grace, the power of this mighty Reformer on our ſide, that when he ſhall come in glory, we may be ſafe under the ſhadow of his almighty wings, while he takes fearful vengeance on thoſe who have defiled his holy temple, and made it a den of thieves; and thoſe who have robbed Omnipotence of his due, will then find their ſouls deprived of their everlaſting rewards in the happy manſions of a bleſſed eternity.</p>
               <p>THE temple being thus cleared by our bleſſed Lord, of this avaricious tribe of dealers, the people brought unto htm the blind, the lame, and the diſeaſed, who were all healed by the Son of God; ſo that the very children proclaimed him to be the great Son of David, the long expected Meſſiah, when they ſaw the many miraculous cures he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>THE Phariſees were highly provoked at theſe tranſactions, but they feared the people, and therefore only aſked him, if he heard what the children ſaid? inſinuating that he ought to rebuke them, and not ſuffer them thus to load him with the higheſt praiſes. But JESUS, inſtead of giving a direct anſwer to their queſtion, repeated a paſſage out of the eighth Pſalm: <hi>Have ye never read,</hi> ſaid the bleſſed JESUS, <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings, thou haſt perfected praiſe?</hi> Giving them to underſtand, that the meaneſt of God's works are ſo formed, as to declare the greatneſs of his protection; and that if the Father does not refuſe the praiſe which ariſes from the leaſt of his creatures, ſo the Son did not diſdain that offered him by children. In the preſent juncture, praiſe was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acceptable, as it implied, that his miracles were ſo exceedingly illuſtrious, that they led the tender minds of children, illuminated only with the dawnings of reaſon, to acknowledge him for the Meſſiah ſo earneſtly deſired, and ſo long expected, by all the deſcendants of Jacob.</p>
               <p>IN the evening, our Lord with his diſciples, left the city and retired to Bethany, where his benevolent miracle, in raiſing Lazarus from the dead had procured him many friends, among whom he was always in ſafety. The next morning, as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Jeruſalem, the diſciples were aſtoniſhed at beholding the fig-tree that had been but the morning before declared barren, <hi>dried up from the roots:</hi> they had, in all probability, forgotten what our Saviour had ſaid to this fig-tree, till its dry and withered aſpect brought it again to their memory. Peter, on ſeeing this aſtoniſhing phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ſaid unto JESUS, <hi>Maſter, behold the fig-tree which thou curſedſt is withered away!</hi> To which JESUS anſwered, that whoever had faith in the Almighty, or thoroughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his miracles, ſhould be able to do much greater things than the withering of the fig-tree: 'And JESUS anſwering, ſaith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I ſay unto you, that whoſoever ſhall ſay unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou caſt into the ſea; and ſhall not doubt in his heart, but ſhall believe, that thoſe things which he ſeeth ſhall come to paſs; he ſhall have whatſoever he ſaith,' Mark xi.22, 23.</p>
               <p>HE alſo added, that whatſoever they ſhould aſk by faith, they ſhould receive; and concluded, by giving them directions concerning prayer, which was neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the faith he mentioned: 'And when ye ſtand praying, forgive, if ye have ought
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029927_0190_0FE338084FCE91E0"/>
againſt any: that your Father alſo which is in heaven, may forgive you your treſpaſſes. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven, forgive your treſpaſſes.'</p>
               <p>DURING our dear Redeemer's continuance in the temple, certain proſelyted Greeks, who came up to worſhip at Jeruſalem, deſired to ſee him, having long cheriſhed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of beholding the promiſed Meſſiah. Accordingly, they applied to Philip, a native of Bethſaida, who mentioned it to Andrew, and he told it to JESUS. Upon which our bleſſed Saviour told his diſciples, that he ſhould ſoon be honoured with the converſion of the Gentiles: <hi>The hour is come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that the Son of man ſhould be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> But declared, that before this glorious event happened, he muſt ſuffer death; illuſtrating the neceſſity there was of his dying, by the ſimilitude of caſting grain into the earth: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit,</hi> John xii.24. Adding, that ſince it was abſolutely neceſſary for him, their Lord and Maſter, to ſuffer the pains of death before he aſcended the throne of his glory; ſo they, as his followers, muſt alſo expect, to be perſecuted and ſpitefully uſed for his name ſake; but if they perſevered, and even reſolved to loſe their lives in his ſervice, he would reward their conſtancy with a crown of glory. And at the ſame time he tacitly inſinuated, that the ſtrangers, if their deſire of converſing with him proceeded from an expectation of obtaining temporal preferments, would find themſelves greatly diſappointed: 'If any man ſerve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be: if any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour.'</p>
               <p>THUS having ſurveyed his own ſufferings, and propoſed them as an example to his diſciples, the melancholy proſpect ſo greatly moved him, that he uttered in a very pathetic manner his grief, and addreſſed his heavenly Father for ſuccour in his diſtreſs: <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled; and what ſhall I ſay? Father, ſave me from this hour: but for this cauſe came I unto this hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE ſhould learn by this example of our Lord, that prayer is the only method of eaſing the mind overwhelmed with diſtreſs; but at the ſame time, to be always reſigned to the divine will: for though the weakneſs of human nature may ſhrink when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions or ſufferings of any kind appear in all their hideous forms; yet, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the wiſdom, goodneſs, and power of God to deliver us, we ought to ſupport every trial, however ſevere, with patience, as he doubtleſs propoſes ſome happy end by theſe afflictions.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Redeemer, having given vent to his melancholy reflections, and made a ſhort prayer to his heavenly Father, begged of God to demonſtrate the truth of his miſſion, by ſome token which could not be reſiſted: <hi>Father, glorify thy name.</hi> Nor had the great Saviour of mankind hardly uttered theſe words, before he was anſwered by an audible voice from heaven, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</hi> The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles thou haſt already performed have glorified my name; and, by other miracles, to be wrought before the ſons of men, I will ſtill continue to glorify it.</p>
               <p>THIS voice was evidently preternatural, reſembling thunder in loudneſs, but ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently articulate to be underſtood by thoſe who heard our bleſſed Saviour pray to his heavenly Father. And JESUS told his diſciples, that it was not given for his ſake but to confirm them in their faith of his miſſion: <hi>This voice,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>came not becauſe of me, but for your ſakes.</hi> It came to confirm what I have told you relating to my ſufferings, death, reſurrection, and the converſion of the whole Gentile world to the Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:029927_0191_0FE3381264950550"/>A proſpect like this, could not fail of being agreeable to that compaſſionate Being, who came down from heaven to redeem loſt and undone mankind, and of removing the melancholy thoughts that afflicted his ſpotleſs ſoul: and, acccordingly, he communicated this comfortable reflection to his diſciples, telling them that the time was at hand when the kingdom of Satan ſhould be deſtroyed, and the ſons of men exalted with himſelf into the happy regions of the heavenly Canaan: <hi>Now is the judgment of this world: now ſhall the prince of this world be caſt out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the people on hearing our bleſſed Redeemer affirm, that he was to ſuffer death on the croſs, or as he termed it, <hi>be lifted up from the earth,</hi> could not reconcile what he ſaid with the prophecies made concerning the Meſſiah, whom they ſuppoſed was never to taſte of death: <hi>We have heard,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>out of the law, that Chriſt abideth forever: and how ſayeſt thou, The Son of man muſt be lifted up?</hi> To which our bleſſed Lord replied, that they ſhould ſoon be deprived of his preſence and miracles, and therefore they would do well to liſten attentively to his precepts, firmly believe the doctrines he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and wiſely improve them to their eternal advantage; for otherwiſe, they would be ſoon overtaken with ſpiritual blindneſs, and rendered incapable of inheriting the promiſes of the goſpel: that while they enjoyed the benefit of his preaching and miracles, which ſufficiently proved the truth of his miſſion from the Moſt High, they ſhould believe on him, for by that means alone they could become the children of God: 'Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, leſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come upon you: for he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſpoken theſe words to the people, our dear Lord retired privately from Jeruſalem, probably to Bethany: but, notwithſtanding the many miracles our great Redeemer had wrought in the preſence of this perverſe and ſtiff-necked people, the generality of them refuſed to own him for the Meſſiah; being filled with the vain expectations of a temporal prince, who was to rule over all the kingdoms of the earth, and place his throne in Jeruſalem. Some, indeed, even of the rulers, believed on him, though, valuing the good opinion of men above the approbation of the Almighty, they thought it prudent to conceal their faith, leſt they ſhould, like the blind man, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, or put out of the ſynagogue.</p>
               <p>BUT our Redeemer being willing to cheriſh the leaſt glimmerings of faith, wherever it appeared, he ſoon returned to Jeruſalem; and to inſpire ſuch as believed on him with courage, he cried in the temple, <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, the doctrine I preach to the children of men, is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from God, that he who believeth on me, believeth more properly on the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who ſent me into the world, and by whoſe authority alone I preach the goſpel: adding, he that ſeeth the miracles I perform, ſeeth the operations of that omnipotent power by which I act; I am the Sun of Righteouſneſs, whoſe beams diſpel the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ignorance in which the ſons of men are involved, and am come to deliver all who believe on me, out of that palpable darkneſs. You muſt not however expect, that I will at preſent execute my judgments upon thoſe who refuſe to embrace the doctrines of the goſpel; for I am not come to condemn and puniſh, but to ſave the world, and conſequently to try every gentle and winning method to reclaim the wicked from the error of their ways, and turn their feet into the paths of virtue, which lead to the happy manſions of my Father's kingdom: they ſhall not, however eſcape unpuniſhed who neglect the inſtructions and offers of ſalvation now made to them; for the doctrine I
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029927_0192_0FE30EB5AF88E260"/>
have preached, ſhall bear witneſs againſt them at the awful tribunal of the laſt day; and as it has aggravated their ſin, ſo it ſhall then heighten their puniſhment. I well know, that the doctrines and precepts which the Father hath commanded me to preach, are the only conditions of eternal life; and, therefore, I have promiſed them with the greateſt faithfulneſs, perſpicuity, and confidence; conſequently I am worthy of credit, both with regard to my miſſion, and the faithfulneſs with which I have executed the commands of the Moſt High.</p>
               <p>A deputation of prieſts and elders was ſent from the ſupreme council, while our Lord was thus preaching in the temple, to aſk him concerning the nature of the authority by which he acted, whether it was as prophet, prieſt, or king, as no other perſon had a right to make any alterations either in church or ſtate; and, if he laid claim to either of thoſe characters, from whom he received it; But our bleſſed Saviour, inſtead of giving a direct anſwer to the queſtion of the Phariſees, aſked them another; promiſing, if they reſolved his queſtion, he would alſo anſwer theirs: <hi>I alſo will aſk you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like manner will tell you by what authority I do theſe things. The baptiſm of John, whence was it? from heaven or of men?</hi> Matt. xxi.14, 25.</p>
               <p>THE prieſts were reduced, by this queſtion, to an inextricable dilemma: they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, on the one hand, that if they ſaid it was from God, it would oblige them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the authority of JESUS, John having more than once publicly declared him to be the Meſſiah; and, on the other, if they peremptorily denied the authority of John, they would be in danger of being ſtoned by the people, who, in general, conſidered him as a prophet: they therefore thought it the moſt eligible method to anſwer, that they could not tell from whence John's baptiſm was. Thus, by declining to anſwer the queſtion aſked them by JESUS, they left him at liberty to decline giving the council the ſatisfaction they had ſent to demand: and, at the ſame time, they plainly confeſſed, that they were unable to paſs any ſentence on John the Baptiſt, notwithſtanding he claimed the character of a meſſenger from God, and they had ſent to examine his pretenſions. This was, in effect, to acknowledge, that they were incapable of judging of any prophet whatſoever; well, therefore, might the bleſſed JESUS ſay, <hi>Neither tell I you by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I do theſe things.</hi> You have no right to aſk, ſince you have confeſſed you are unable to judge; and, for that reaſon, I ſhall not ſatisfy your inquiry.</p>
               <p>THIS deputation of the elders having ſaid, that they were ignorant from whence the baptiſm of John was, our bleſſed Saviour ſharply rebuked them, conveying his reproof in the parable of the two ſons commanded to work in their father's vineyard; and made them condemn themſelves, by aſking their opinion of the two. <hi>A certain man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>had two ſons; and he came to the firſt, and ſaid, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</hi> But this ungracious youth very roughly anſwered the kind command of his father, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt preface, or appellation of reſpect, anſwered, <hi>I will not</hi>: but, after reflecting on the impropriety and indecency of ſuch behaviour to this kind and indulgent father, he repented of what he had done, and went to work in the vineyard. The father having met with ſo harſh a reply from the former ſon, had recourſe to the other, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ordered him to work that day in his vineyard. This ſon was very different from the former, and in a very dutiful manner ſaid, <hi>I go Sir.</hi> But notwithſtanding this ſeeming obedience, he delayed to do as his father deſired; he did not go to work in the vineyard. The temper and behaviour of this ſecond ſon were exactly conformable to that of the Phariſees: they gave the Almighty the moſt honourable titles, and profeſſed the utmoſt zeal for his ſervice, in their prayers and praiſes; but at the ſame time refuſed to do any part of the work that he enjoined them. In the character of the other ſon, the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029927_0193_0FE33813E8D0BB00"/>
of the publicans and harlots is well deſcribed. They neither profeſſed or promiſed to do the will of their Creator; but when they came to reflect ſeriouſly, on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the offers of mercy which were ſo kindly made them, they ſubmitted to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and amended their lives in conſequence of their faith.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having thus finiſhed the parable, aſked the Phariſees, <hi>Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? They ſay unto him, the firſt.</hi> They did not immediately perceive, that by this anſwer they condemned themſelves, till our Saviour made a juſt application to the parable, in this ſharp, but juſt rebuke: 'Verily I ſay unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not,' nor entered into your father's vineyard, though like the ſecond ſon, you promiſe in the moſt fair and candid manner; <hi>but the publicans and the harlots believed him,</hi> repented of their former diſobedience, and entered into the vineyard.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Lord did not reſt ſatisfied with ſhewing the Phariſees the heniouſneſs of their ſin in rejecting the Baptiſt, but he thought proper alſo to repreſent the crime of the nation in rejecting all the prophets which had been ſent ſince they became a nation, and among the reſt, the only begotten Son of the Moſt High; warning them, at the ſame time, of their danger, and the puniſhment that would inevitably enſue, if they continued in their rebellion. The outward economy of religion, in which they gloried, would be taken from them; their relation to God, as his people, cancelled; and the national conſtitution deſtroyed: but becauſe theſe topics were extremely diſagreeable, he delivered them under the veil of the following parable: <hi>There was,</hi> ſaid he <hi>a certain houſeholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine preſs in it, and built a tower, and let it out to huſbandmen, and went into a far country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE frequently find in the ſacred ſcriptures, the compariſon of the church to a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; but this particular parable, for the fuller conviction of the Jews, is expreſsly taken from the fifth chapter of the prophet Iſaiah, with which they could not fail of being well acquainted, nor ignorant of its meaning, as the prophet at the end of it adds: <hi>The vineyard of the Lord of hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant: and he looked for judgment, but beheld oppreſſion; for righteouſneſs, but behold a cry.</hi> Our Saviour, therefore, continued the metaphor, telling them; <hi>That when the time of the fruit drew near, he ſent his ſervants to the huſbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the huſbandmen took his ſervants, and beat one, and killed another, and ſtoned another.</hi> The Almighty ſent the prophets to exhort the Jews to entertain juſt ſentiments of religion, and tread the paths of virtue; but the Jews, extremely irritated at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for the freedom they uſed in reproving their ſins, perſecuted and ſlew them with unrelenting fury. Their wickedneſs, however, in killing theſe meſſengers, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly provoke the Almighty to pour down his vengeance upon them; he ſent more prophets to exhort and reclaim them, but they met with no better fate than the former. His mercy however, ſtill continued; and that no means might be left untried, he ſent unto them his own ſon, whoſe authority, being clearly eſtabliſhed by undeniable mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ought to have been acknowledged cheerfully by theſe wicked men: but how different was the conſequences? 'When the huſbandmen ſaw the ſon, they ſaid among themſelves, this is the heir; come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance. When the Lord, therefore, of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto thoſe huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? they ſay unto him. He will miſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other huſbandmen, which ſhall render him the fruits in their ſeaſon.'</p>

                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:029927_0194_0FE338156C978318"/>ON hearing this anſwer made by the Phariſees, the people ſaid, <hi>God forbid;</hi> ſurely theſe huſbandmen will not proceed to ſuch deſperate iniquity; ſurely the vineyard will not thus be taken from them. But, to confirm the truth of this, our Saviour added a remarkable prophecy of himſelf, and of his rejection, from the 118th Pſalm: <hi>Did ye never,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>read in the Scriptures, The ſtone which the builders rejected, the ſame is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE rejection of the Meſſiah by the Jews, and the reception he met with among the Gentiles, all brought to paſs by the providence of God, are wonderful events: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto you, the kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>THE chief prieſts, perceiving the drift of our Saviour's parable, were highly incenſed, and would gladly have apprehended him; but they feared the people, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him as the Meſſiah while they ſurrounded him in the temple.</p>
               <p>BUT as the rulers were afraid to apprehend JESUS, he was at liberty to proceed in the offices of his miniſtry; accordingly he delivered another parable, wherein he deſcribed on the one hand, the bad ſucceſs which the preaching of the goſpel was to meet with amongſt the Jews; and, on the other, the cheerful reception given it among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. This gracious deſign of the Almighty, in giving the goſpel to the children of men, our bleſſed Saviour illuſtrated by the behaviour of a certain king, who, in honour of his ſon, made a great feaſt, to which he invited many gueſts: The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king; which made a marriage for his ſon. This marriage-ſupper, or great feaſt, ſignifies the joys of heaven, which are properly compared to an elegant entertainment, on account of their exquiſiteneſs and duration; and are here ſaid to be prepared in honour of the Son of God, being beſtowed on men as a reward for their obedience.</p>
               <p>BUT before the ſupper was ready, the ſervants were ſent forth to call the gueſts to the wedding; that is, when the fulneſs of time approached, the Jews, as being the peculiar people of God, were firſt called to the great feaſt of heaven by John the Baptiſt, and afterwards by CHRIST himſelf; but they refuſed all theſe benevolent calls of mercy, and rejected the kind invitations of the goſpel, though preſſed by the preaching of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and his forerunner. After our Saviour's reſurrection and aſcenſion, the apoſtles were ſent forth to inform the Jews, that the goſpel-covenant was eſtabliſhed; that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in heaven was prepared; and that nothing was wanting but their cheerful acceptance of the honour deſigned them: <hi>Again, he ſent forth other ſervants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</hi> But theſe meſſengers were as unſucceſsful as the former. The Jews undervaluing the favour offered them, mocked at the meſſage; and ſome of them, more rude than the reſt, inſulted, beat and ſlew the ſervants, that had been ſent to call them to the marriage-ſupper of the lamb: But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth; and ſent forth his armies, and deſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their city. This branch of the parable, plainly predicted the deſtruction of the Jews by the Roman armies, called here the armies of the Almighty, becauſe they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him to execute vengeance on that once favourite, but now rebellious people.</p>
               <p>THE benevolent calls of the goſpel being thus rejected by the Jews, the king again ſent forth his ſervants into the countries of the Gentiles, with orders to compel all that they met with to come into the marriage. This was immediately done, and the wedding was furniſhed with gueſts: but when the king came into the apartment, <hi>he ſaw there a

               <argument>
                  <p>Our Saviour anſwers the inſidious Queſtion of the Phariſees concerning paying tribute to Caeſar: He confuteth the Sadducees who queſtioned him touching the Reſurrection: He ſheweth which are the two great Commandments of the Law: He propoſeth to the Phariſees a Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf: He exhorteth to obſerve the Doctrine, but not to follow the evil Example of the Scribes and Phariſees; and particularly not to imitate their ambition: He pronounceth divers Woes againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, for their Blindneſs and Hypocriſy: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Deſtruction of Jeruſalem.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE parable of the marriage-ſupper incenſed the Phariſees in ſuch a manner, that they immediately concerted with the Herodians or Sadducees on the moſt proper method of putting our Lord to death. It is ſufficiently evident, that their hatred was now carried to the higheſt pitch; becauſe the moſt violent enmity which had ſo long ſubſiſted between the two ſects, was on this occaſion ſuſpended, and they joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to execute this cruel determination on the Son of God: they, however, thought it moſt eligible to act very cautiouſly, and endeavour if poſſible, to catch ſome haſty expreſſion from him, that they might render him odious to the people, and procure ſomething againſt him, that might ſerve as a baſis for a proſecution. Accordingly, they ſent ſome of their diſciples to him, with orders to ſeign themſelves juſt men, who maintained the greateſt veneration for the divine law, and dreaded nothing more than the doing any thing inconſiſtent with its precepts; and, under this ſpecious cloak of hypocriſy, to beg his determination of an affair that had long lain heavy on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; namely, the paying tribute to Caeſar, which they thought inconſiſtent with their zeal for religion. This queſtion was, it ſeems, furiouſly debated in our Saviour's time; one Judas, a native of Galilee, having inſpired the people with a notion, that taxes to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:029927_0197_0FE3382135A1A510"/>
a foreign power were abſolutely unlawful. A doctrine ſo pleaſing to the worldly-minded Jews, could not fail of friends, eſpecially among the lower claſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt have many partizans amongſt the multitude that then ſurrounded the Son of God. The prieſts, therefore imagined, that it was not in his power to decide the point, without rendering himſelf obnoxious to ſome of the parties: if he ſhould ſay it was lawful to pay the taxes they believed, that the people in whoſe hearing the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was propoſed, would be incenſed againſt him, not only as a baſe pretender, who, on being attacked, publicly renounced the character of the Meſſiah, which he had aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among his friends, but alſo as a flatterer of princes, and a betrayer of the liberties of his country; one who taught doctrines inconſiſtent with the known privileges of the people of God: but if he ſhould affirm, that it was unlawful to pay tribute, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to inform the governor, who they hoped, would puniſh him as a fomenter of ſedition. Highly elated with their project, they accordingly came; and, after paſſing an encomium on the truth of his miſſion, his courage, and his impartiality, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this famous queſtion: 'Maſter,' ſaid they, 'we know that thou art true and careſt for no man; for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men, but teacheſt the way of God in truth. Tell us therefore, what thinkeſt thou, is it lawful to give tribute unto Caeſar or not?'</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, though they had artfully laid the ſcheme, they could not deceive our bleſſed Lord, who beheld the inmoſt receſſes of their hearts: he ſaw their ſecret inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and accordingly called them hypocrites, to ſignify, that though they made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a regard for the divine will, their pretence for propoſing this queſtion, he ſaw their deſign, and knew that their intention was only to enſnare him.</p>
               <p>NEVERTHELESS, our bleſſed Saviour did not decline anſwering their queſtion, but previouſly deſired to ſee a piece of the tribute money. The piece was accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and proved to be coined by the Romans. Upon which our dear Lord anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, ſince this money bears the image of Caeſar, it is his; and by making uſe of it, you acknowledge his authority: if ſo, I leave it to yourſelves, to judge whether tribute ought not to be paid towards the ſupport of that government, which ye have acknowledged, which ye cannot ſhake off, and by which your tranquility is preſerved: but, at the ſame time that, you diſcharge your duty to the civil magiſtrate, you ſhould never forget the duty you owe to you God; but remember that as you bear the image of the great, the omnipotent King, you are his ſubjects, and ought to pay him the tribute of yourſelves, ſerving him to the very utmoſt of your power.</p>
               <p>UNDER a pretence of religion, the Phariſees and their followers often juſtified ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Herodians, in order to ingratiate themſelves with the reigning powers, made them a compliment of their conſciences, complying with whatever they enjoined, however oppoſite their commands might be to the divine law. Our Lord therefore adapted his anſwer to them both, exhorting them in their regards to God and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to give each his due; as, when their rights only are inſiſted on, there can be no inconſiſtency between them.</p>
               <p>JESUS, by ſo unexpected an anſwer, confuted them on their own principles, and ſhewed, that the rights of God, and thoſe of the magiſtrate, do not in the leaſt interfere; becauſe magiſtrates are God's deputies, and rule by his authority: this quite diſconcerted and ſilenced theſe crafty enemies; they were aſtoniſhed both at his having diſcovered their deſign, and his wiſdom in avoiding the ſnare they had ſo artfully laid for him: <hi>When they heard theſe words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way,</hi> Matt. xxii.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:029927_0198_0FE33822BA81EBA8"/>BUT the miſcarriage of this ſcheme did not intimidate others from renewing the attack; enemies came againſt him from every quarter. The Sadducees, who denied the doctrine of a future ſtate, together with the exiſtence of angels and ſpirits, firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the charge; propoſing to him their ſtrongeſt argument againſt the reſurrection which they deduced from the law given by Moſes, with regard to marriage: <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>Moſes wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that his brother ſhould take his wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his brother. There were therefore, ſeven brethren; and the firſt took a wife, and died without children. And the ſecond took her to wife, and he died childleſs. And the third took her; and in like manner the ſeven alſo: and they left no children and died. Laſt of all the woman died alſo. Therefore, in the reſurrection, whoſe wife of them is ſhe? for ſeven had her to wife.</hi> Luke xx.28—33.</p>
               <p>BUT the Sadducees, believing the ſoul to be nothing more than a refined matter, were perſuaded, that if there was any future ſtate, it muſt reſemble the preſent; and the being in that ſtate material and mortal, the human race could not be continued, nor the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals rendered happy without the pleaſures and conveniencies of marriage: and hence conſidered that every man's wife ſhould be reſtored to him, as a neceſſary conſequence of the doctrine of the reſurrection, or a future ſtate.</p>
               <p>BUT our bleſſed Saviour ſoon confuted this argument, by telling the Phariſees they were ignorant of the power of God, who had created ſpirit as well as matter, and who can render man completely happy in the enjoyment of himſelf. He alſo obſerved, that the nature of the life obtained in a future ſtate, made marriage altogether ſuperfluous, becauſe in the world to come, men being ſpiritual and immortal, like the angels, there was no need of natural means to propagate or continue the kind: <hi>Ye do err,</hi> ſaid our dear Lord, <hi>not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the reſurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</hi> Matt. xxii.29. <hi>Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Luke xx.36. Hence we may obſerve, that good men are called the children of the Moſt High, from their inheritance at the reſurrection, and particularly on account of their being adorned with immortality.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus ſhewn their ignorance of the true nature of a future ſtate, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between corporeal and ſpiritual beings, our dear Lord proceeded to ſhew that they were alſo ignorant of the ſcriptures, and particularly of the writings of Moſes, from whence they had drawn their objection: for he demonſtrated, from the very law itſelf, the certainty of a reſurrection, at leaſt, that of juſt men, and conſequently quite demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the opinion of the Sadducees, who by believing the materiality of the ſoul, affirmed that men were annihilated at their death, and that their opinion was founded on the writings of Moſes: <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid our Saviour, <hi>that the dead are raiſed, even Moſes ſhewed at the buſh, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</hi> Luke xx.37, 38. As if he had ſaid, The Almighty cannot properly be called God, unleſs he has his people, and be Lord of the living. Since, therefore, Moſes called him the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, long after theſe vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patriarchs were dead, the relation denoted by the word <hi>God,</hi> ſtill ſubſiſted between them: conſequently they were not annihilated as you pretend, but are ſtill in being, and continue to be the ſervants of the Moſt High. This argument was concluſive; it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſilenced the Sadducees, and agreeably ſurpriſed the people, to ſee the objection, hitherto thought impregnable, totally aboliſhed, and the ſect they had long abominated, fully confuted: <hi>And when the multitude heard this, they were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine.</hi> Matt. xxii.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:029927_0199_0FE3382444689DC8"/>THOUGH the Phariſees had joined with the Sadducees, in order to put our bleſſed Saviour to death, they could not fail of being pleaſed to ſee their inveterate enemies put to ſilence, and the famous argument they had ſo often propoſed with oſtentations, as unanſwerable, fully confuted. Nor could they refrain from giving the Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the praiſe due to his ſuperlative wiſdom; for one of the Scribes deſired him to give his opinion, on a queſtion often debated among their teachers; namely, which was the great commandment of the law. The true reaſon for their propoſing this queſtion, was to try whether he was as well acquainted with the ſacred law, and the debates that had ariſen on different parts of it, as he was in deriving arguments from the inſpired writers to deſtroy the tenets of thoſe who denied a future ſtate.</p>
               <p>IN order to underſtand the queſtion propoſed to our bleſſed Saviour by the Scribe, it muſt be remembered, that ſome of the moſt learned Rabbins had declared, that the law of ſacrifices was the great commandment; ſome, that it was the law of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and others, that the law of meats and waſhings had merited that title. Our bleſſed Saviour, however, ſhewed that they were all miſtaken: and that the great commandment of the law is the duty of piety; and particularly mentioned that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſummary of it, given by Moſes, <hi>Hear, O Iſrael; the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength: this is the firſt and great commandment.</hi> Mark xiii.29, 30.</p>
               <p>HERE I cannot help obſerving, that this ſummary of piety begins with an emphatical aſſertion of there being only one God, the maker of heaven and earth, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of all perfection, in order to induce us to uſe the utmoſt diligence in obeying his precepts; the firſt and chief of which is, to give him our hearts. The Divine Being is ſo tranſcendently amiable in himſelf, and hath by the innumerable benefits conferred upon us, ſuch a title to our utmoſt affection, that no obligation bears any proportion to that of loving him. The honour aſſigned to this precept, proves that piety is the nobleſt act of the human mind, and that the chief ingredient in piety is love, founded on a clear and extenſive view of the divine perfections, a permanent ſenſe of his benefits, and a deep conviction of his being the ſovereign good—our portion—our happineſs: but it is eſſential to love, that there be a delight in contemplating the beauty of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject beloved, whether that beauty be matter of ſenſation or reflection; that we frequently, and with pleaſure, reflect on the benefits conferred on us by the object of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that we have a ſtrong deſire of pleaſing him, great fear of doing any thing to offend him, and a ſenſible joy in thinking we are beloved in return. Hence the duties of devotion, prayer, and praiſe, are the moſt natural and genuine exerciſes of the love of God: nor is this virtue ſo much any ſingle affection, as the continual bent of all the affections and powers of the ſoul; conſequently to love God is as much as poſſible to direct the whole ſoul towards him, and to exerciſe all its faculties on him as its chief object. Accordingly, the love of God is deſcribed in ſcripture, by the ſeveral ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mind, <hi>a following hard after God,</hi> namely, by intenſe contemplation; a ſenſe of his perfection, gratitude for his benefits, truſt in his goodneſs, attachment to his ſervice, reſignation to his providence, the obeying of his commandments, admiration, hope, fear, joy, &amp;c. not becauſe it conſiſts in any of thoſe ſingly, but in them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for to content ourſelves with partial regards to the Supreme Being, is not to be affected towards him in the manner we ought to be, and which his perfections claim. Hence the words of the precept are, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> that is with the joint force of all thy faculties; and therefore, no idol whatſoever muſt partake of the love and worſhip that is due to him alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:029927_0200_0FE3382C8AEFF128"/>BUT the beauty and excellency of this ſtate of mind is beſt ſeen in its effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the worſhip and obedience flowing from ſuch an univerſal bent of the ſoul towards God, is as much ſuperior to the worſhip and obedience ariſing from partial conſiderations, as the brightneſs of the ſun is to any picture that can be drawn of that luminary. Thus, for example, if we look upon God, only as a ſtern law-giver, who can and will puniſh our rebellion, it may, indeed, force an awe and dread of him, and as much obedience to his law as we think will ſatisfy him, but can never produce that conſtancy in our duty, that delight in it, and that earneſtneſs to perform it in its utmoſt extent, which are produced and maintained in the mind, by the ſacred fire of divine love, or by the bent of the whole ſoul turned towards God: a frame that conſtitutes the higheſt perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the creature, and, therefore, the moſt excellent that can be conceived and the moſt to be deſired.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould always earneſtly deſire to be bleſſed with the preſence of the Moſt High, our ſouls ſhould pant after him, as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, and even thirſt for the Living God. Again, this commandment requires us to fear God; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we cannot love the Lord our God, unleſs we fear and reverence him: for as the love, ſo the fear of God, is the ſum of all the commandments, and indeed, the ſubſtance of all religion. If we acknowledge there is a God, it is but reaſonable we ſhould fear his eſſential greatneſs and glory; for you open a paſſſage for a deluge of villainy and wickedneſs, if you take away the fear of a Deity, and that of a Supreme. Power, that can reward and puniſh the actions of men.</p>
               <p>IT is not enough that we love and fear the Moſt High, we muſt alſo call upon the name of God in our prayers and praiſes; love and fear, reſpect the inward worſhip of God in our hearts, and by this act of outward worſhip, we give an expreſs teſtimony that we love and fear him: prayer and praiſes are the tribute and homage of religion, by the one we acknowledge our dependance upon God, by the other we confeſs, that all our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and comforts are from him. Such, therefore, as neither pray to God nor praiſe him, cannot be ſaid to have a God, for they acknowledged none, but are gods to themſelves; and as the love and fear of God are often uſed in ſcripture for his whole worſhip and ſervice, ſo is this calling upon his name; <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that knows thee not, and upon the families that have not called upon thy name,</hi> Jer. x.25.</p>
               <p>But to return—Our bleſſed Saviour having thus anſwered the queſtion put to him by the Scribe, added, that the ſecond commandment was that which enjoined the love of our neighbour. This had, indeed, no relation to the lawyer's queſtion concerning the firſt commandment; yet our bleſſed Lord thought proper to ſhew him which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, probably becauſe the men of his ſect did not acknowledge the importance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of love to their neighbours, or becauſe they were remarkably deficient in the practice of it, as JESUS himſelf had often found in their attempts to kill him: <hi>And the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR natures muſt be brought to a temper that is all love and goodneſs, if we would become like God, who is love; and if our ſouls dwell in love, then we dwell in God and God in us. This principle will be alſo fruitful in every good work; it will make us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily perform the duties of all relations in which we ſtand: and becauſe love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore it is the fulfilling of the law; for it will prompt us to a cheerful and ready performance of every office, whether of juſtice or charity, that we owe to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> neighbour: all the beſt things we can do, if deſtitute of this principle, will appear to be either the effect of hypocriſy, or done to procure the eſteem of men: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, a narrowneſs of ſoul will ſhut us up within ourſelves, and make all we do to
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029927_0201_0FE3382ED99C1378"/>
others only as a ſort of merchandize, trading for our own advantage: it is love only that opens our hearts to conſider other perſons, and to love them on their own account, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on account of God, who is love.</p>
               <p>THOSE who poſſeſs the effects of this excellent temper well deſerve our conſideration: they have a conſtant calm within, and are not diſturbed with paſſion, jealouſy, envy, or ill-nature: they obſerve and rejoice in the happineſs of others, they are glad to ſee them eaſy, and ſhare with them in their joy and felicity, not fretting or complaining, though they enjoy leſs than their neighbours. It is true, love has a very different effect; for the ſame temper will render many ſo conſiderate of the misfortunes of others, as to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with them in their diſtreſs and be greatly affected with ſuch objects of compaſſion as it is not in their power to aſſiſt: but there is a real pleaſure even in this compaſſion, as it melts us into the greateſt tenderneſs, and proves us to be men and Chriſtians. The good man, by the overflowings of his love, is ſure that he is a favourite with his Maker, becauſe he loves his neighbour: his ſoul, therefore dwells at eaſe; there is a ſweetneſs in all his thoughts and wiſhes: this makes him clear in his views of things; no vapours, no clouds darken him, but an inward ſerenity reigns in his mind, and ſuch a livelineſs in all his thoughts, as ſpreads a cheerfulneſs in his looks, and renders him grateful to all about him.</p>
               <p>A conſtant diſpoſition for prayer, is alſo maintained in him who has this charitable temper: a calm mind is eaſily recollected; but nothing diſſipates the thoughts more, and renders them leſs fixed and attentive than paſſion. A charitable man, who has had occaſions to forbear and forgive others, and to return good for evil, dares, with an humble aſſurance to lay claim to mercy and pardon: for though he is ready to acknowledge, he is many talents indebted to his Maker; yet being of a forgiving tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he has an argument to plead for mercy and forgivneſs, and to conclude that <hi>much will be forgiven him becauſe he loveth much.</hi> There is ſuch a likeneſs and ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpirit of love, and the ſpirit of true devotion, that they have a ſenſible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon each other, and the one will riſe or fall in proportion to the other.</p>
               <p>BUT to return from this digreſſion, which we flatter ourſelves has not been diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the reader, we ſhall go back to the Scribe who was aſtoniſhed at the juſtneſs of our Saviour's deciſions, and anſwered, that he had determined rightly ſince there is but one Supreme God, whom we muſt all adore; and if we love him as much as we are able, and without a rival, and our neighbour as ourſelves, we worſhip him more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably than if we ſacrifice to him all the cattle upon a thouſand hills. And our Lord declared, that the perſon who made this reflection, was not far from the kingdom of God, and highly applauded the piety and wiſdom of it.</p>
               <p>DURING the courſe of our Saviour's miniſtry, the Phariſees having propoſed to him many difficult queſtions with an intention to prove his prophetical gifts, he now, in his turn, thought proper to make a trial of their ſkill in the ſacred writings. For this purpoſe, he aſked their opinion of a difficulty concerning the Meſſiah's pedigree: <hi>What think ye of Chriſt? Whoſe ſon is he? They ſay unto him, the ſon of David,</hi> Matt. xxii.42. I know, anſwered JESUS, you ſay, CHRIST is the ſon of David; but how can you ſupport that opinion, or render it conſiſtent with the words of David, who himſelf calls him Lord; and <hi>how is he his ſon?</hi> It ſeems, that the Jewiſh doctors did not imagine that their Meſſiah would be endued with any perfections greater than thoſe that might be enjoyed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; for though they called him the Son of God, they had no notion that he was God, and therefore could not pretend to ſolve the difficulty. The latter queſtion
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029927_0202_0FE338305DFF1F78"/>
however, might have convinced them of their error; for if the Meſſiah was only to be a ſecular prince as they ſuppoſed, and to rule over the men of his own time, he never could have been called <hi>Lord,</hi> by perſons who died before he was born; far leſs would ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a prince as David, who was alſo his progenitor, have conferred on him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itle. Since, therefore, he not only rules over the vulgar dead of former ages, but even over the kings from whom he was himſelf deſcended, and his kingdom comprehends the men of all countries and times, paſt, preſent, and to come; the doctors, if they had thought accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately upon the ſubject, ſhould have expected in their Meſſiah a king different from all other kings whatever: beſides, he is to ſit at God's right hand, <hi>till all his enemies are made his footſtool.</hi> Numbers of CHRIST's enemies are ſubject to him in this life: and they who will not bow to him willingly, ſhall be reduced by puniſhment, like the rebellious ſubjects of other kingdoms.</p>
               <p>HE returned ſuch clear and ſolid anſwers to the enſnaring queſtions of his adverſaries, that they gave the people an high opinion of his wiſdom; and ſhewed them, how far ſuperior he was to their moſt renowned Rabbins, whoſe argument to prove their opinions, and anſwers to the objections which were raiſed againſt him, were, in general, very weak and trifling: nay, his foes themſelves, from the repeated proofs they had received from the prodigious depth of his underſtanding, were impreſſed with ſuch an opinion of his wiſdom, that they judged it impoſſible to entangle him in his talk. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they left off attempting it, and troubled him no more with their inſidious queſtions from that day.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour ſilenced his moſt virulent oppoſers by this means; but having mentioned the final conqueſt and deſtruction of his enemies, who were to be made his footſtool, agreeable to the prediction of the royal Pſalmiſt, he turned towards his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and in the hearing of the multitude, ſolemnly cautioned them to beware of the Scribes and Phariſees; inſinuating thereby, who the enemies were whoſe deſtruction he had mentioned: <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſit in Moſes's ſeat: all therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their works: for they ſay and do not.</hi> Matt. xxiii.2, 3. While they teach the doctrines before delivered by Moſes, obſerve all they ſay, but by no means imitate their practices; for they impoſe many precepts on their diſciples, which they never perform themſelves: <hi>For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's ſhoulders; but they themſelves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be ſeen of men.</hi> The difficult precepts they impoſe on others are never regarded by theſe hypocrites, and any good action they may happen to perform, is vitiated by the principle from whence it proceeds: they do it only with a view to popular applauſe, and not from a regard to God, far leſs from a love of goodneſs: they are proud and arrogant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as is plain from their affected gravity in their clothes, from the anxiety they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, leſt they ſhould not obtain the principal ſeats in the public aſſemblies, and from their affecting to be ſaluted in the ſtreets, with the ſounding titles of Rabbi and Father: 'They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts, and the chief ſeats in the ſynagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.'</p>
               <p>THE proper meaning of the word Rabbi is great, and it was given to thoſe men who had rendered themſelves remarkable for the extent of their learning; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder that the proud and ſupercilious Phariſees were ſo fond of a title, which gave them great authority with their diſciples, and highly complimented their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="unknown:029927_0203_0FE33831E57FF9C0"/>BUT our Lord's followers were to decline this title, becauſe the thing ſignified by it belonged ſolely to their Maſter, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and becauſe they owed no part of their knowledge to themſelves, but derived it entirely from him who came down from heaven: 'But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Maſter, even CHRIST; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven,' Matt. xiii.8, 9. Life, with all its bleſſings, comes from God, and men wholly depend upon him; all praiſe and thankfulneſs, therefore, ſhould ultimately be referred to him; ſo that if any one teacheth rightly, not the teacher, but the wiſdom of the Almighty is to be praiſed, which exerts and communicates itſelf by him.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples of our bleſſed Saviour were likewiſe enjoined not to accept of the title of maſter or leader, which the Jewiſh doctors alſo courted; becauſe in point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and inſpiration, they were all equal, neither had they any title to rule the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, except by virtue of the inſpiration which they had received from their Maſter, to whom alone the prerogative of infallibility belonged: <hi>Neither be ye called maſters: for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER, our bleſſed Saviour did not intend by this to inſinuate, that it was ſinful to call men by the ſtations they held in the world; he only intended to reprove the ſimplicity of the common people, who loaded their teachers with praiſes, and forgot to aſcribe any thing to God; and to root out of the minds of his apoſtles, the Phariſaical vanity, which decked itſelf with honours belonging ſolely to the Creator of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Accordingly, that he might inſtil into their hearts humility, to diſpoſe them to do good offices to one another, as occaſion offered, he aſſured them, it was the only road to true greatneſs: for, by aſſuming what did not properly belong to them, they ſhould be deſpiſed both by God and men; whereas, they ſhould enjoy a high degree of the divine favour, who did not diſdain to perform the meaneſt offices of love to their brethren.</p>
               <p>THE Scribes and Phariſees were greatly incenſed at the above diſcourſes; and, as they were pronounced in the hearing of many of that order, it is therefore no wonder that they watched every opportunity to deſtroy him: but this was not a time to put their bloody deſigns in execution; the people ſet too high a value on his doctrine to ſuffer any violence to be offered to his perſon; and, as this was the laſt ſermon he was ever to preach in public, and as all his mild perſuaſions had hitherto proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, it was neceſſary, that he ſhould now uſe ſome ſeverity.</p>
               <p>HE accordingly denounced in the moſt ſolemn manner, dreadful woes againſt them, not on account of the perſonal injuries he had received from them, but on account of their exceſſive wickedneſs. They were public teachers of religion; and therefore ſhould have uſed every method in their power to recommend its precepts to the people, and to have been themſelves ſhining examples of every duty it enjoined: but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they abuſed every mark and character of goodneſs for all the purpoſes of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy; and, under the cloak of a ſevere and ſanctified aſpect, they were malicious, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, lewd, covetous, and rapacious: in a word, inſtead of being reformers, they were the corrupters of the people, and conſequently their wickedneſs deſerved the greateſt reproof that could be given by the great Redeemer of mankind: <hi>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men; for ye neither go in yourſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers;
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029927_0204_0FE3383BE8C71A28"/>
therefore ye ſhall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye compaſs ſea and land to make one proſelyte, and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell than yourſelves,</hi> Matt. xxiii.13, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>YOU ſhall ſuffer puniſhment that will be terribly ſevere, becauſe ye have given a wrong interpretation of the ancient prophecies concerning the Meſſiah, and done all that is in your power to hinder the people from repenting of their ſins, and believing the goſpel; becauſe you have committed the groſſeſt iniquities, and under the cloak of religion, have devoured the ſubſtance of widows and orphans, hoping to hide your villanies by long prayers: bacauſe ye have expreſſed the greateſt zeal imaginable in making proſelytes, not with a view to render the Gentiles more wiſe and virtuous, but to acquire their riches, and a command over their conſciences; and inſtead of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the precepts of virtue and the moral duties of religion, you confine their duties to ſuperſtitious and ceremonial inſtitutions, and hence they often relapſe into their old ſtate of heatheniſm, and become more wicked than before their converſion, and conſequently liable to a more ſevere ſentence.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord alſo mentioned, in a particular manner, their doctrine concerning oaths; and declared in oppoſition to their abominable tenets, that every oath, if the matter of it be lawful, is obligatory; becauſe when men ſwear by any part of the creation, it is an appeal to the Creator himſelf; for, in any other light, an oath of this kind is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ridiculous, the object having neither knowledge of the fact, nor power to puniſh the perjury: 'Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which ſay, whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind, whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that ſanctifieth the gold? And, whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoſoever ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty! Ye fools and blind, for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that ſanctifieth the gift? Whoſo therefore ſhall ſwear by the altar, ſweareth by it, and by all things thereon. And whoſo ſhall ſwear by heaven, ſweareth by the throne of God, and by him that ſitteth thereon.'</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour alſo upbraided them with their ſuperſtitious practices, in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minuteſt parts of the ceremonial precepts of the law, and at the ſame time utterly neglecting the eternal and indiſpenſable rules of righteouſneſs: <hi>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye pay tythe of mint, and aniſe and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Son of God alſo took notice of their hypocriſy; for they ſpared no pains to appear virtuous in the eyes of the world, and maintain an external conduct that ſhould require the praiſes of men; but, at the ſame time neglected to adorn their ſouls with the robe of righteouſneſs, which is the only ornament that can render them dear in the ſight of their Maker: Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outſide of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſs. Thou blind Phariſee, cleanſe firſt that which is within the cup and platter, that the outſide of them may be clean alſo.' Cleanſe firſt thy mind, thy inward man, from evil diſpoſitions and affections, and thy outward behaviour will of courſe be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and praiſe-worthy.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord alſo animadverted upon the ſucceſs of their hypocriſy: they deceived the ſimple and unthinking part of mankind, with their pretended ſanctity, appearing like whited ſepulchres, beautiful on the outſide, while their internal parts were full of
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029927_0205_0FE3383D6E00DB00"/>
uncleanneſs: 'Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited ſepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens' bones, and of all uncleanneſs. Even ſo ye alſo outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocriſy and iniquity.'</p>
               <p>HE alſo cenſured them for the pains they had taken in adorning the ſepulchres of the prophets, becauſe they pretended a great veneration for their memory, and even condemned their fathers who killed them, ſaying, that if they had lived in the days of their fathers, they would have oppoſed ſuch monſtrous wickedneſs, while, at the ſame time, all their actions abundantly proved, that they ſtill cheriſhed the ſame ſpirit they condemned in their fathers, perſecuting the meſſengers of the Moſt High, particularly his only begotten Son, whom they were determined to deſtroy: <hi>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites! becauſe ye build the tombs of the prophets, and gerniſh the ſepulchres of the righteous, and ſay, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witneſſes unto yourſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour added, that the Divine Being was deſirous of trying every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for their converſion, though all theſe inſtances of mercy were ſlighted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they muſt expect ſuch terrible vengeance, as ſhould be a ſtanding monument of the divine diſpleaſure againſt all the murders committed by the ſons of men, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</p>
               <p>THUS having laid before them their heinous guilt and dreadful puniſhment; he was at the thought of the calamities which were ſoon to fall upon them, exceedingly moved, and his breaſt filled with ſenſations of pity to ſuch a degree, that unable to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he broke forth into tears, bewailing the hard lot of the city of Jeruſalem; for as its inhabitants had more deeply imbrued their hands in the blood of the prophets they were to drink more deeply of the puniſhment due to ſuch crimes: <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee; how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS exclamation of the benevolent Redeemer of mankind, is ſuch as can hardly be read without a tear, and conveys a ſtrong idea of his love for that ungreatful nation. How often had the Almighty called upon them to return from their evil way, before he ſent his only begotten Son into the world! How often, how emphatically did the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate JESUS entreat them to embrace the merciful terms now offered them by the Almighty! And with what unconquerable obſtinacy did they refuſe the benevolent offers, and reſiſt the moſt winning expreſſions of the divine love! By the word <hi>houſe,</hi> our bleſſed Saviour meant the temple, which was from that time to be left unto them deſolate; the glory of the Lord, which Haggai had propheſied ſhould fill the ſecond houſe, was now departing from it: adding, 'I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. As if he had ſaid, As ye have killed the prophets, and ſtoned them whom the Father hath ſent from the courts of heaven, and will ſhortly put me, who am the Lord of the temple, to death; your holy houſe ſhall be left deſolate, and your nation totally deſerted by me; nor ſhall you ſee me any more till the whole nation is converted to Chriſtianity, when all the deſcendants of Jacob ſhall, with one voice, cry out, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi> as the multitude lately did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:029927_0206_0FE3383EF20148E8"/>IN this manner, the bleſſed JESUS ſtripped the Scribes and Phariſees of their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical maſk. He treated them with ſeverity, becauſe their crimes were of the blackeſt dye; and hence we ſhould learn to be really good, and not flatter ourſelves that we can cover our crimes from that piercing eye to which nothing is concealed with the cloak of hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>AT theſe diſcourſes, the people could not fail of being aſtoniſhed, as they had always conſidered their teachers as the moſt righteous among the ſons of men; nay the perſons themſelves, againſt whom they were levelled, were confounded, becauſe their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences convinced them of the truth of every thing laid to their charge. They therefore knew not what courſe to purſue; and they let JESUS depart without making any attempt to ſeize him, or inflict on him any kind of puniſhment, being prevented from putting their wicked purpoſes into practice until the work was finiſhed for which he was ſent of his Father into the world to do.</p>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> valueth the poor Widow's two Mites above all the gifts of the Rich: He foretelleth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Temple; ſheweth what Signs and Calamities ſhould go before, and what ſhould happen at the Time of his Coming: He delivers the Parable of the ten Virgins; and of the Talents, which a King diſtributed among his Servants, to be improved by them: and in a third Parable, delivered at the ſame Time, he gives a Deſcription of the laſt Judgment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER our dear Lord had expoſed the ſecret practices of the Scribes and Phariſees, he repaired with his diſciples unto the court of the woman, called the treaſury, from ſeveral cheſts being fixed to the pillars of the portico ſurrounding the court for receiving the offerings of thoſe who came to worſhip in the temple. While he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this court 'He beheld how the people caſt money into the treaſury: and many that were rich caſt in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and ſhe threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his diſciples, and ſaith unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that this poor widow hath caſt more in, than all they which have caſt into the treaſury; for all they did caſt in of their abundance; but ſhe of her want did caſt in all that ſhe had, even all her living.' Mark xii.41, 42, 43, 44.</p>
               <p>THIS poor widow's offering was, in itſelf, very ſmall, yet, in proportion to the goods ſhe enjoyed, it was remarkably large; for it was all ſhe had, even all her living. In order, therefore, to encourage charity, and ſhew that it is the diſpoſition of the mind, not the magnificence of the offering, that attracted the regard of the Almighty, the Son of God applauded this poor widow, as having given more in proportion than any of the rich. Their offerings, though great in reſpect of her's, were but a ſmall part of their eſtates, whereas, her offering was her whole ſtock. And from this paſſage of the goſpel, we ſhould learn, that the poor, who in appearance are denied the means of doing charitable offices, are encouraged to do all they can; for how ſmall ſoever the gift may be, the Almighty who beholds the heart, values it, not according to what it is in itſelf, but according to the diſpoſition with which it is given. On the other hand, we ſhould learn from hence, that it is not enough for the rich, that they exceed the poor in their gifts of charity, they ſhould beſtow in proportion to their fortune; and they
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029927_0207_0FE3384075B972D0"/>
would do well to remember, that a little given, where a little only is poſſeſſed, appears a much nobler offering in the ſight of the Almighty, and diſcovers a more benevolent and humane temper of mind, than a greater ſum out of the abundance of the rich.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord having declared, at the concluſion of his pathetic lamentation over Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that the temple ſhould not any more be favoured with his preſence, till they ſhould ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</hi> which declaration greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed his diſciples; and therefore, as he was departing from that ſacred ſtructure, they deſired him to obſerve the beauty of the building, inſinuating, that they thought it ſtrange he ſhould intimate an intention of leaving it deſolate; that ſo glorious a fabric, celebrated in every corner of the earth, was not to be deſerted raſhly; and that they ſhould think themſelves ſupremely happy, when he, as the Meſſiah, and deſcendent of David, ſhould take poſſeſſion of it, and erect his throne in the midſt of Jeruſalem: <hi>And as he went out of the temple, one of his diſciples ſaith unto him, Maſter, ſee what manner of ſtones, and what buildings are here!</hi> The eaſtern wall of the temple, which fronted the Mount of Olives, whither the diſciples, with their maſter, were then retiring, was built from the bottom of the valley to a prodigious height, with ſtones of an incredible bulk, firmly compacted together, and, therefore, made a very grand appearance at a diſtance. This eaſtern wall is ſuppoſed to have been the only remains of Solomon's temple, and had eſcaped when the Chaldeans burnt it: but this building, however coſtly or ſtrange it appeared, our Saviour told them ſhould be totally deſtroyed: 'Seeſt thou', ſaid he, 'theſe great buildings? There ſhall not be left one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down.' Mark xiii.2.</p>
               <p>THIS venerable ſtructure, which you behold with wonder, adorned with huge ſtones of amazing beauty, ſhall be razed to the very foundation. The diſciples, therefore, when they heard their Maſter affirm, that not ſo much as one of theſe enormous ſtones, which had mocked the fury of of Nebuchadnezzar's army, and ſurvived the deſtructive hand of time, was to be left one upon another, they perceived that the whole temple was to be demoliſhed, but did not ſuſpect that the ſacrifices were to be taken away, and a new religion introduced, which rendered the temple unneceſſary. They therefore, flattered themſelves, that the fabric then ſtanding, however glorious it might appear, was too ſmall for the numerous worſhippers who would frequent it, when all the nations of the world were ſubject to the Meſſiah's kingdom, and was, therefore, to be pulled down, in order to be erected on a more magnificent plan, ſuitable to the idea they had conceived of his future empire. Filled with theſe pleaſing imaginations, they received the news with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, meditating as they walked to the mountain, on the glorious things which were ſhortly to come to paſs.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as they arrived at the Mount of Olives, and their maſter had taken his ſeat on ſome eminence, from whence they had a proſpect of the temple and part of the city, his diſciples drew near, to know when the demolition of the old ſtructure was to happen, and what were to be the ſigns of his coming, and of the end of the world: <hi>And as he ſat upon the mount of Olives, the diſciples came unto him privately, ſaying, tell us when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> Matt. xxiv.3.</p>
               <p>IT is probable the diſciples meant what ſigns ſhould precede the erection of that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive empire, over which they ſuppoſed the Meſſiah was to reign; for they ſtill expected he would govern a ſecular kingdom. They therefore, connected the demolition of the temple with their Maſter's coming, though they had not the leaſt notion that he was to
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029927_0208_0FE3384B5B32E7E8"/>
deſtroy the nation; and change from the religious worſhip. They, therefore, meant by <hi>the end of the world,</hi> or, as the words ſhould have been tranſlated, <hi>the end of the age,</hi> the period of the political government then executed by Heathen procurators, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Maſter's coming to deſtroy the conſtitution then ſubſiſting, as a very deſirable event: they alſo thought the demolition of the temple proper, as they expected a larger and more ſuperb building would be erected in its ſtead, in proportion to the number of the Meſſiah's ſubjects.</p>
               <p>IT will ſufficiently appear, that this is the real ſenſe of the diſciples queſtion, if we conſider, that they were delighted with the proſpect; whereas, if they had meant by the end of the world, the final period of all things, the deſtruction of the temple would have exhibited to them a melancholy proſpect, which they could not have beheld, without a deep concern, in their preſent temper of mind.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, our bleſſed Lord was careful to convince them of their miſtake, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that he was not come to rule a ſecular empire, as they ſuppoſed, but to puniſh the Jews for their perfidy and rebellion, by deſtroying both their temple and nation: <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that no man deceive you. For many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> many.</hi> This caution was far from being unneceſſary, becauſe, though the diſciples were to ſee their Maſter aſcend into heaven, they might take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the prophecy, to think that he would appear again on earth, and, therefore, be in danger of ſeduction by the falſe Chriſts that ſhould ariſe: And when ye ſhall hear of wars and rumours of wars, ſee that ye be not troubled; for all theſe things muſt come to paſs; but the end is not yet. Before this nation and temple are deſtroyed, terrible wars will happen in the land: 'For nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom; and there ſhall be famines, and peſtilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.'</p>
               <p>THESE things are but the beginning of a long ſeries of calamities: which ſhall fall upon this nation: at the ſame time you ſhall meet with hot perſecutions; walk, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, circumſpectly, and arm yourſelves both with patience and fortitude, that ye may be able to perform your duty through the whole courſe of theſe perſecutions: for you ſhall be brought before the great men of the earth for my ſake: 'But when they ſhall lead you and deliver you up, take no thought before hand what ye ſhall ſpeak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatſoever ſhall be given you in that hour, that ſpeak ye; for it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt.' Mark. xiii.11.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord told them, during this time of trouble and confuſion, the perfidy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhall be ſo great towards one another, <hi>that brother ſhall betray the brother to death, and the father the ſon; and children ſhall riſe up againſt their parents, and ſhall cauſe them to be put to death.</hi> The unbelieving Jews and apoſtate Chriſtians, ſhall commit ſuch crimes, that the very idea of which, ſhall excite horror in the moſt barbarous nations. It is, therefore, no wonder that the perfidy and wickedneſs of ſuch pretended Chriſtians, ſhall diſcourage many diſciples and greatly hinder the propagation of the goſpel: but he who ſupports his faith during theſe perſecutions, and is not led aſtray by the ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſe Chriſtians, ſhall eſcape that terrible deſtruction which will overflow the land like a deluge.</p>
               <p>MY diſciples ſhall be ſcattered by theſe perſecutions and tribulations, and ſhall preach the goſpel in all parts of the Roman empire; and then ſhall the period you now inquire after arrive: then ſhall the Almighty ariſe to vengeance, and conſume, in his anger, this ſtiff-necked generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:029927_0209_0FE3384CEC7512B0"/>AT the time when Jeruſalem ſhall be ſurrounded with armies, Pagan armies bearing in their ſtandards the images of their gods, the <hi>abomination of deſolation,</hi> mentioned by the prophet Daniel; then let him who readeth the predictions of that prophet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the end of the city and ſanctuary, together with the ceaſing of the ſacrifice and oblation there predicted, is come, and, of courſe, the final period of the Jewiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEN let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midſt of it depart out;</hi> Luke xxi.21. <hi>Let him which is on the the houſe-top, not come down to take any thing out of his houſe: neither let him which is in the field, return back to take his clothes,</hi> Matt. xxiv.17, 18. For the Almighty will now puniſh this nation for its ſin: theſe are the days of his vengeance, when all the threatenings of the prophets, eſpecially thoſe of Daniel, ſhall be inflicted on this obſtinate and rebellious people.</p>
               <p>THE women who are with child, and they who have infants hanging at their breaſts, ſhall be particularly unhappy in thoſe days of vengeance, becauſe they cannot flee from the impending deſtruction: <hi>But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,</hi> when the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the roads and the rigour of the ſeaſon, will render ſpeedy travelling very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if not impoſſible; <hi>neither on the Sabbath-day,</hi> when you ſhall think it unlawful, <hi>for then ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever ſhall be.</hi> This is confirmed by what Joſephus tells us: for he ſays. 'that no leſs than eleven hundred thouſand periſhed in the ſiege.'</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord added, that except the days of tribulation ſhould be ſhortened, none of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem and Judea, of whom he was then ſpeaking, ſhould eſcape de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And accordingly Joſephus tells us, that the quarrels which raged during the ſiege, were ſo fierce and obſtinate, both within the walls of Jeruſalem, and without in the neighbouring country, that the whole land was one continued ſcene of horror and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and had the ſiege continued much longer, the whole nation of the Jews had been totally deſtroyed, according to our Lord's prediction: <hi>But,</hi> added our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>for the elect's ſake, whom he hath choſen, he hath ſhortened the days.</hi> By the elect are meant, ſuch of the Jews as had embraced the doctrines of the goſpel, and thoſe who were brought in with the fullneſs of the Gentiles particularly.</p>
               <p>DURING this time of univerſal confuſion, it was natural to think, that the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the whole nation would be turned towards their Meſſiah; for if he was ever to appear, it muſt be then, to deliver them from impending deſtruction. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour therefore cautioned his diſciples not to liſten to any pretences of that kind, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Chriſts would ariſe, and deceive great numbers of the people. A prediction that was fully accompliſhed during the terrible ſiege of Jeruſalm by the Romans: for Joſephus tells us, that many aroſe, pretending to be the Meſſiah, boaſting that they would deliver the nation from all its enemies. And the multitude, always too prone to liſten to deceivers who promiſe temporal advantages, gave credit to thoſe deceivers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more obſtinate in their oppoſition to the Romans, and thereby rendered their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction more ſevere and more inevitable. And what ſtill increaſed the infatuation of the people, was their performing wonderful things during the war; and accordingly Joſephus calls them magicians and ſorcerers. Hence we ſee the propriety of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by the Son of God, who foretold that, <hi>they ſhould ſhew great ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; inſomuch that, if it were poſſible, they would deceive the very elect. But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:029927_0210_0FE3384E72D1B078"/>BUT as it was likely the partizans of the falſe Chriſts would pretend that the Meſſiah was concealed a while for fear of the Romans, and the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this warning, might have imagined, that Chriſt was actually returned, to deliver the nation in its extremity, and to puniſh their enemies, who now ſo cruelly oppreſſed them, and that he would ſhew himſelf as ſoon as it is proper, our bleſſed Saviour thought it needful to caution them againſt this particular: <hi>Wherefore, if they ſhould ſay unto you, Behold, he is in the deſert; go not forth: behold, he is in the ſecret chambers: believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> Matt. xxiv.26, 27.</p>
               <p>AS lightning is ſwift and deſtructive, ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of man be. But he will not come perſonally, his ſervants only ſhall come, the Roman armies, who ſhall deſtroy this nation, as eagles devour their prey, by his command.</p>
               <p>THUS having given them a particular account of the various circumſtances which ſhould precede the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, he next deſcribed that cataſtrophe itſelf, in all the pomp of language and imagery made uſe of by the ancient prophets, when they foretold the deſtruction of cities and kingdoms: <hi>But in thoſe days, after that tribulation, the ſun ſhall be darkened, and the moon ſhall not give her light, and the ſtars of heaven ſhall fall, and the powers that are in heaven ſhall be ſhaken. And upon the earth diſtreſs of nations, with perplexity; the ſea and the waves roaring; mens' hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE expreſſions are figurative and lofty, and ſignify the decaying of all the glory, excellency, and proſperity of the nation, and the introduction of univerſal ſadneſs, miſery, and confuſion. The roaring of the ſea, and the waves, may juſtly be conſidered as metaphorical, as the ſigns in the ſun, in the moon, and in the ſtars are plainly ſo. And by the powers of heaven are meant the whole Jewiſh polity, government, laws, and religion, which were the work of heaven; theſe, our bleſſed Saviour tells us, ſhould be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>AS the diſciples, in conformity to the repeated queſtions of the Phariſees during his miniſtry, had aſked what would be the ſigns of his coming. Our bleſſed Saviour told them, that after the tribulation of thoſe days, when the ſun ſhould be darkened, and all the enemies of the Meſſiah ſhould mourn, they ſhould ſee the accompliſhment of what Daniel foretold, by the figurative expreſſion of <hi>the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven;</hi> for they ſhould behold the ſignal puniſhments executed on the Jewiſh nation, by the Roman armies, ſent for that end by the Son of man, who ſhall thus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly demonſtrate the greatneſs of his power, and the extent of his dominion: <hi>Then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man in heaven: and then ſhall all the tribes of the earth mourn. And they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE diſciples were to conſider the time of their redemption, from the oppreſſion under which they then groaned, as near at hand when theſe things came to paſs: and that they might be certain this prophecy would not long wait for its accompliſhment, he told them that the preſent generation ſhould not all be laid in the chambers of the duſt, before theſe terrible calamities ſhould fall upon Jeruſalem. Adding, that his diſciples might ſooner expect the diſſolution of the whole frame of nature, than that one ſingle circumſtance of this prophecy ſhould fail of its accompliſhment: 'Verily I ſay unto you, This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall not paſs, till all theſe things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:029927_0211_0FE3384FFA282348"/>IF we take the pains to campare the prediction of our Saviour with the hiſtory Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus wrote of the war, we cannot fail of being ſtruck with the wiſdom of CHRIST, and acknowledge that his prediction was truly divine. For as the Jewiſh nation was at this time in the moſt flouriſhing ſtate, the event here told was altogether improbable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the circumſtances of the deſtruction are very numerous, and ſurpriſingly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and the whole delivered without any ambiguity. It is therefore a prophecy of ſuch a kind, as could never have been uttered by any impoſter, and conſequently the perſon who delivered it, was truly divine, and acquainted with the ſecret counſels of heaven.</p>
               <p>BUT it has been demanded with ſome aſſurance, by the enemies to revelation, why ſhould CHRIST order his diſciples not to flee from Jeruſalem, till they ſaw it encompaſſed with the Roman army, when it would then be impoſſible for them to make their eſcape? But perſons, before they propoſe ſuch queſtions, would do well to read attentively the hiſtory Joſephus has given us of theſe terrible calamities: becauſe they would there find a ſolution of that difficulty. That hiſtorian tells us, "That Ceſtius Gallus, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the city with his army; and at the time when he could eaſily have taken the city, ſuddenly withdrew his forces, without any apparent reaſon." He adds, "that as ſoon as the ſiege was raiſed, many eminent Jews fled from it, as from a ſinking ſhip." In all probability, many of theſe were Chriſtians, who being warned by this prophecy of their great Maſter, ſaved themſelves by flight, as he had directed. Thus we ſee what frivolous objections are made by the free-thinkers of our age, againſt the truth of the ſacred writings, and how eaſily they are anſwered. And I cannot help obſerving, that this conduct of the Roman general, ſo contrary to all the rules of prudence, muſt have been brought to paſs by the providence of God, who interpoſed for the deliverance of the diſciples in this manner.</p>
               <p>HAVING given this deſcription of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, our bleſſed Saviour enumerated a great variety of particulars that were to precede or accompany it, aſſuring his diſciples, that it would be very unexpected, and thence urged the neceſſity of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vigilance, leſt they ſhould be ſurpriſed, and have a ſhare in thoſe terrible calamities: <hi>But as the days of Noe were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> Matt. xxiv.37. <hi>Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the maſter of the houſe cometh; at even, or at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; leſt coming ſuddenly, he find you ſleeping.</hi> Mark xiii.35, 36.</p>
               <p>AS men were to undergo, at the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, nearly the ſame miſeries, and as the paſſions which its approach would raiſe in their minds, were ſimilar to thoſe which will happen at the deſtruction of the world, and the general judgment; it was natural for our bleſſed Saviour, on this occaſion, to put his diſciples in mind of that judgment, and to exhort them to the faithful diſcharge of their duty, from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſuddenneſs of his coming to call every individual to account after death: <hi>Therefore, be ye alſo ready; for in ſuch an hour, as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wiſe ſervant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his houſehold, to give them meat in due ſeaſon? Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall make him ruler over all his goods.</hi> As if he had ſaid, you who are the miniſters of religion, ought to be particularly careful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the important truſt committed to your care: you are the ſtewards to whoſe care the whole houſehold of the church is committed; and you would do well to remember, that your example will have a great effect upon the minds of thoſe employed under you. It is your duty to be well acquainted with the ſtores of the everlaſting truths, and to
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029927_0212_0FE33859BAC10400"/>
underſtand how they may be applied to the beſt advantage: you ſhould alſo be careful to know the characters of the different perſons under your direction, that you may be able to give every one of them his portion of meat in due ſeaſon: and if I find you thus employed at my coming, I will reward you with the joys of my kingdom, even as an earthly maſter beſtows particular marks of reſpect on ſuch ſervants as have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably faithful in any important truſt. But, on the other hand, if you behave like unjuſt ſtewards, who, becauſe their Lord delayeth his coming, abuſe their fellow ſervants, and riot in exceſs; if you tyranize over the conſciences of your brethren, neglect the duties of your function, and give yourſelves up to ſenſual pleaſures, I will come upon you unexpectedly, and make you dreadful examples of mine anger, by the ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I will inflict upon you: 'But if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming; and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervant, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus mentioned the rewards and puniſhments of a future ſtate, it was eaſy and elegant for our Lord to paſs from that ſubject to the conſideration of the general judgment, when thoſe rewards and puniſhments ſhould be deſtributed in their utmoſt extent. This could not fail of animating his diſciples to a vigorous diſcharge of their duty; and, by the ſtriking repreſentation of the laſt judgment here given, muſt greatly tend to rouſe the conſciences of men from their lethargy, and conſider, before it be too late, <hi>the things which belong to their peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEN ſhall the kingdom of heaven,</hi> the goſpel-kingdom, in the laſt diſpenſation of it, when the kingdom of grace is going to be ſwallowed up in the kingdom of glory, <hi>be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh; they that were fooliſh,</hi> as a proof of their ſtupidity, took indeed their lamps, but put no oil in their veſſels, while the wiſe, as an inſtance of their prudence and foreſight, took both their lamps and oil in their veſſels, knowing that it was uncertain when the bridegroom would arrive, and that they might, in all probability wait long for his coming. Nor were they miſtaken, for the bridegroom did not come ſo ſoon as they expected: <hi>And while he tarried they all ſtumbered and ſtept, and at midnight there was a cry made, Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. Then all thoſe virgins aroſe, and trimmed their lamps. And the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. But the wiſe anſwered, ſaying, Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for yourſelves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was ſhut. Afterward came alſo the other virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us. But he anſwered, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore; for ye know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To underſtand this parable aright, we muſt remember that it alludes to the cuſtoms of marriages among the eaſtern people. It was uſual with them for the bridegroom to bring his bride home in the evening, ſooner or later, as circumſtances might happen; and, that ſhe might be received properly at his houſe, his female acquaintance, eſpecially thoſe of the younger ſort, were invited to come and wait with lamps, till ſome of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, diſpatched before the reſt, informed them that he was near at hand; upon which they trimmed their lamps, went forth to welcome him and conduct him with his bride into the houſe, for which they were honored as gueſts at the marriage feaſts, and ſhare in the feſtivities.</p>

                  <pb n="204" facs="unknown:029927_0213_0FE3385C4AA82640"/>OUR bleſſed Saviour compares the candidates for the kingdom of heaven, to ten ſuch virgins; he mentions ten, becauſe this was the general number appointed to wait on the bridegroom; and to theſe, all Chriſtian profeſſors may be likened, who taking the lamp of Chriſtian profeſſion, go forth to meet the bridegroom; that is, prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as candidates for the kingdom of heaven, and deſire to be admitted into the happy manſions of immortality, with CHRIST, the celeſtial Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>THE caſe of Chriſtians is repreſented to us by this of the virgins, half of whom only were wiſe, the other half being fooliſh. And we muſt remember, that there always was, and always will be, a mixture of good and bad in the church, till the great day of ſeparation arrives. The weakneſs of the fooliſh is repreſented by their taking no oil in their veſſels with their lamps; that is, the fooliſh Chriſtians content themſelves with the bare lamp of a profeſſion, and never think of furniſhing it with the oil of divine grace, the fruit of which is a life of holineſs. Whereas, the wiſe, well knowing that a lamp, without the ſupply of oil, would be ſpeedily extinguiſhed; that faith, without love and holineſs, will be of no conſequence, take care to ſupply themſelves with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the divine grace, and to diſplay in their lives, the works of love and charity. While all thoſe virgins, though differently ſupplied, waited the coming of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, they all ſlumbered and ſlept; that is, all Chriſtians, both good and bad, the ſincere and the hypocrite, all lie down together in the ſleep of death; and, while the bridegroom delayeth his coming, ſlumber in the chambers of the duſt.</p>
               <p>THERE is a tradition among the Jews, that CHRIST's coming to judgment will be at midnight, which agrees with that part of the parable, <hi>at midnight there was a cry made, Go ye out to meet him.</hi> But however this be, whether he will come at midnight, or in the morning, it will be awfully ſudden and alarming; the great cry will be heard to the ends of the earth; the trumpet ſhall ſound and the mighty archangel's voice pierce even to the bowels of the earth, and the depths of the ocean: <hi>Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.</hi> All that are in the graves muſt then awake, and come forth; and all will then begin to think how they may prepare themſelves to find admittance to the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb: <hi>Then all thoſe virgins aroſe, and trimmed their lamps.</hi> But the fooliſh ſoon perceived their folly; their lamps were gone out, totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and they had no oil to ſupport the flame: in like manner, the hypocrite's hope ſhall periſh. But the wiſe were in a much happier condition; they had oil in their veſſels ſufficient for themſelves, but none to ſpare: for, when the fooliſh virgins would have procured ſome from them, they denied their requeſt, fearing there would not be enough for both.</p>
               <p>WE have here a repreſentation of nominal and ſincere Chriſtians; the former having only the bare lamp of a profeſſion, have neglected to live agreeably to the precepts and examples of their Maſter, and have not been ſolicitous to gain the oil of divine grace, by a conſtant uſe of the means aſſigned; thoſe who have been contented with a mere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative righteouſneſs, with ſuch a juſtice and honeſty as heathens boaſted of, to whoſe charge no henious crimes can be laid, while, at the ſame time, no good can be ſpoken of, as an effect of their faith; and ſuch will fare like the fooliſh virgins: while the latter, whoſe wiſe conduct and zealous endeavours to ſtock their lamps with divine oil, will, like the wiſe virgins, enter into the joy of their Lord.</p>
               <p>THOSE that were fooliſh, going to purchaſe oil, miſſed the bridegroom, and behold <hi>the door was ſhut.</hi> They at laſt, however, reached the gate, and with great importunity cried, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us.</hi> But he anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, I know
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029927_0214_0FE3385DCF12A098"/>
you not.</hi> You are ſtrangers to me; you did not attend me at my coming, and now the door is ſhut, and entrance forever denied; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, how juſtly did our bleſſed Saviour bid us all <hi>watch,</hi> that we may be found ready whenever he cometh, or commands, by the king of terrors, our attendance before his judgment-ſeat. Let us not refuſe this kind invitation of being conſtantly prepared to meet the heavenly Bridegroom: let us fill our lamps with oil, that we may be ready to follow our great Maſter into the happy manſions of the heavenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, as this duty was of the utmoſt importance, our bleſſed Saviour, to ſhew us more clearly the nature and uſe of Chriſtian watchfulneſs to which he exhorts us at the concluſion of the parable of the ten virgins, he added another, wherein he repreſented the different characters of a faithful and ſlothful ſervant, and the difference of their future acceptance. This parable, like the former, is intended to ſtir us up to a zealous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the coming of our Lord, by diligence in the diſcharge of our duty, and by a careful improvement of our ſouls in holineſs; and at the ſame time, to expoſe the vain pretences of hypocrites, and to demonſtrate, that fair ſpeeches, and outward form, without the power of godlineſs, will be of no ſervice in the laſt great day of account.</p>
               <p>THE Son of man, with reſpect to his final coming to judge the world, may be likened unto <hi>a man travelling into a far country, who called his own ſervants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his ſeveral abilities; and ſtraightway took his journey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE that had received the five talents, loſt no time, but went immediately on his maſter's departure, and traded with the ſame, and his increaſe was equal to his induſtry and application; he made them other five talents. He that had received two talents, did the ſame, and had equal ſucceſs. But he that received one, very unlike the conduct of his fellow-ſervants, went his way, digged in the earth, and hid his Lord's money, idle, uſeleſs, unemployed, and unimproved.</p>
               <p>BUT after a long time, and at an hour when they did not expect it, the Lord of thoſe ſervants returned, called them before him, and ordered them to give an account of their ſeveral truſts. Upon which, he that had received five talents, as a proof of his fidelity, produced other five talents, ſaying, <hi>Lord, thou deliveredſt unto me five talents: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have gained beſide them, five talents more.</hi> His Lord, highly applauding his induſtry and fidelity, ſaid unto him, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make the ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> In like manner alſo, he that had received two talents, declared he had gained two others: upon which he was honoured with the ſame applauſe, and admitted into the ſame joy with his fellow-ſervant; their maſter having regard to the induſtry and fidelity of his ſervants, not to the number of the talents only, and the greatneſs of their increaſe.</p>
               <p>THEN he that had received the one talent came, and with a ſhameful falſehood, to excuſe his vile indolence ſaid, 'Lord, I knew thee, that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou haſt that is thine.' This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable notion, which the ſervant entertained of his Lord, greatly aggravated his crime; and accordingly his Lord was wroth, and anſwered, 'Thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gathereſt where I have not ſtrawed: thou oughteſt, therefore, to have put my money to the exchangers, and then
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029927_0215_0FE3385F5321B480"/>
at my coming I ſhould have received mine own with uſury. Take therefore, the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance; but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath. And caſt ye the unprofitable ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>vant into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>THIS was the parable of the talents, as delivered by our bleſſed Saviour; a parable, containing the meaſures of our duty to God, and the motives that enforce it, all delivered in the plaineſt and ſimpleſt alluſion: but its views are ſo extenſive and affecting, that while it inſtructs the meaneſt capacity, it engages reverence and attention from the greateſt, and ſtrikes an impreſſion on the moſt improved underſtanding. We are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God as our Lord and Maſter, the author and giver of every good gift, and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as his ſervants or ſtewards, who, in various inſtances and meaſures, have received from his goodneſs, ſuch bleſſings and abilities, as may fit us for the ſeveral ſtations and offices of life to which his providence appoints us: but then we are to obſerve, that theſe are committed to us as a truſt or loan, for whoſe due management we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the doner. If we faithfully acquit ourſelves of this probationary charge, we ſhall receive far greater inſtances of God's confidence and favour; but if we are remiſs and negligent, we muſt expect to feel his reſentment and diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>A time will come, and how near it may be, none of us can tell, when our great Maſter will demand a particular account of every talent he hath committed to our care. This time may, indeed, be at a diſtance, for it is uncertain when the king of terrors will receive the awful warrant to terminate our exiſtence here below; yet it will certainly come, and our eternal happineſs or miſery depends upon it; ſo that we ſhould have it continually in our thoughts, and engrave it, as with the point of a diamond, on the tables of our hearts. But this is not all we are to learn from this inſtructive parable; the Divine Author has adapted every incident of the relation, to convey ſome ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. We hence learn, that Infinite Wiſdom hath intruſted men with different ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and adjuſted them to the various purpoſes of human life. But though the gifts of men are unequal, none can with juſtice complain, ſince whatever is beſtowed, be it more or leſs, is a favour entirely unmerited. Each then, ſhould be thankful, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his portion; and inſtead of envying the more liberal endowments of others, apply himſelf to the improvement of his own. And it ſhould be attentively obſerved, that the difficulty of the taſk is in proportion to the number of talents committed to each. He who had received five, was to gain other five; and he who had received two, was to account for other two. Surely then, we have no reaſon to complain, if our Maſter has laid on us a lighter burden, a more eaſy and leſs ſervice than what he has on others; eſpecially as our intereſt, in the favour of the Almighty, does not depend on the number of our talents, but on application in the management of them: ſo that the moral deſign of this parable is to engage our utmoſt attention, to improve ſuch talents as our heavenly Father has thought proper to beſtow upon us. By theſe talents, are principally meant, the communications and graces of the Holy Spirit, which God beſtows in different meaſures, <hi>dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi> And ſubordinate to theſe, are all the means, opportunities, and abilities to exerciſe or improve theſe graces: all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſtation, fortune, education, and whatever may enable us to do good; for we, having received all we enjoy from God, are ſtrictly obliged to promote the wiſe ends for which he beſtows his favours. And here let us take a ſhort and imperfect view of what God has done for us: he has given us reaſon and underſtanding, to diſcern good from evil, and conſequences of things, to collect from them proper rules of judgment
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029927_0216_0FE33868AC79D188"/>
and action. Indeed, ſince the fall, this faculty has been much obſcured; but ſtill it remains an univerſal gift of God to men; and though not equal to all, yet it is given to every man in ſuch meaſure, as is ſufficient for their direction. In the knowledge of our duty, and the purſuit of our happineſs, God has, by the goſpel, ſo graciouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the defects of reaſon, that the meaneſt underſtanding may know how to be happy: ſuch aſſiſtances of divine grace attend every Chriſtian, if he will apply to God for it, as may enable him to direct his inclinations, govern his paſſions, and ſubdue his corrupt affections. Theſe talents are, in ſome degree, common to all men; and, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of that grace which is conferred upon every one, all have ſufficient to conduct them through the ſeveral ſtages of life, if they will uſe but proper diligence and application.</p>
               <p>BUT regard muſt be had to all the means for cultivating thoſe gifts of nature and grace, ſuch as all opportunities of inſtruction, the miniſtry, and ordinances of religion, the reproofs and examples of good men, the occaſions offered, and the abilities give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the exerciſe of virtue: all theſe are talents, or gifts of God, depoſited with us, to be diligently made uſe of, and for which we are accountable to him. I ſhall, therefore, proceed to ſhew what duty is required from us, in the improvement of theſe talents. It is here ſuppoſed, that theſe talents are improveable, or otherwiſe they would be of no uſe or value; and, indeed, we are bound by the command of God, to improve them, who has threatened to inflict ſevere penalties if we neglect it: and, if they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, they will not continue long with us, but be loſt; the fineſt parts and capacities, without proper culture, will make but a mean and contemptible figure. No knowledge can be preſerved without uſe and exerciſe, and the ſame holds with regard to moral accompliſhments. It requires great care and attention to form a virtuous habit, and much more to preſerve it in its vigour: unleſs we co-operate with the goodneſs of God's grace, and cultivate it by uſe and application, its impreſſions will gradually wear out and be loſt: <hi>The Spirit of God will not always ſtrive with man.</hi> He gives us a ſtock to manage, equal to the ſervice he expects from us; but if we are ſlothful and negligent, and will not apply it to the purpoſes for which it was given, he will recal the uſeleſs gift: <hi>Take from him,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the talent, and give it to him that hath ten talents.</hi> Let us, therefore, diligently improve every talent committed to us, becauſe this will be required of us in the day of account; and, if not improved, will be immediately taken from us: what this improvement implies, and how we may diſcharge this duty, is an inquiry of the neareſt concern to us. The proper improvement of all God's gifts, is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them, ſo as may beſt promote his glory: this is the end the Almighty has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in our creation, in all the powers he has endowed us with, and in all the aids of grace he has vouchſafed to us. Whatever other improvements we make of them, they will not profit us, nor be admitted as any proof of our fidelity in the day of reckoning: we may cultivate our underſtanding by learning and ſtudy, and extend our knowledge through all the ſubjects of human inquiry; but if our end be only to gratify our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or our vanity, we are not ſerving God, but ourſelves; we may increaſe our portion of God's outward gifts, but if we only apply them to enlarge our own conveniences, we are not making the improvements our maſter expects: we may take pleaſure in our knowledge and fortune, rejoice in them as our portion and inſtruments in our preſent poſſeſſion; but we muſt ſtill remember, that in our reckoning with God, all theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of our capacities and abilities, will be added to our account: and the only uſe God will admit us to ſet in balance of our debt to him, is to employ them as means of increaſing and multiplying our virtues, or as inſtruments of exerciſing them in the works of religion and piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:029927_0217_0FE3386A43091598"/>FROM this parable we may learn, that the divine juſtice, in this ſcrutiny, will eſtimate and reward every one's fidelity in proportion to the improvements and returns they have made. An account will be demanded of every talent; nor will it be ſufficient, that we have made ſome improvement, it muſt be proportioned to the number and value of our gifts. Let us therefore, live and act under ſerious habitual regard to that day, when our great Maſter ſhall come and reckon with us; remembering that ſuch as have been idle, and made no uſe of the talents given them by the Almighty, will be <hi>caſt into outer darkneſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> A proſpect ſurely ſufficient to awaken ſuch from their ſlumber, quicken them to an immediate and vigorous applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to duty; that by a double improvement of the time yet remaining, they may redeem what their indolence has loſt. But far worſe, and more difficult to be retrieved, is his caſe, who has ſquandered away the ſtock itſelf, ſuffered his gifts to periſh for want of uſe; or, by abuſing them to the ſervice of ſin, has provoked the Almighty to take them from him.</p>
               <p>HOW ſhall the prodigal recal the fortune he has ſpent, and appeaſe the anger of his Judge? The terrors of the Lord may juſtly terrify him; but it ſhould not extinguiſh his endeavours in deſpair: he has loſt many excellent talents, but he who gave can reſtore. Indeed, the moſt circumſpect perſon will, in the great day of account, want much to be forgiven: and muſt expect his reward from the mercy of his Judge, not from the merit of his ſervice. Let us then do all in our power to bring forth fruits, meat for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for though the awful day of the Lord may be at a great diſtance, yet the time allotted us to prepare for it, is limited by the ſhort ſpace of human life: the night of death cometh, when no man can work: to-day, therefore, while it is called to-day, let us be diligent in the work of the Lord, correct our errors, and finiſh what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that we may obtain his approbation, and make our calling and election ſure, before we go hence, and are ſeen of men no more.</p>
               <p>WE have endeavoured to explain the parable of the talents after this manner, and ſhall now return to the third parable delivered at the ſame time by the bleſſed JESUS, namely, that of the laſt judgment: <hi>When the Son of man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory: and before him ſhall be gathered all nations: and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats: and he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</hi> Matt. xxv.31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>IT is common in the Old Teſtament, to compare good men to ſheep, on account of their innocence and uſefulneſs; and wicked men to goats, for their exorbitant luſts. Our bleſſed Saviour, however, does not purſue the allegory further, but deſcribes the remaining, and indeed the greateſt part of this awful ſcene, in terms perfectly ſimple; ſo that though the ſenſe be profound, it is obvious. Here the judgment of all nations, Gentiles as well as Chriſtians, is exhibited; and the particulars on which theſe awful trials are to proceed, diſplayed by the great Judge himſelf. Here we learn, that we ſhall be condemned or acquitted, accordingly as we have neglected or performed works of charity; works which flow from the great principles of faith and piety, and which the very Heathens are, by the light of nature, invited to perform. But we muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that ſuch works merited this favour from the Judge; not all who are acquitted at that day, ſhall be acquitted ſolely on account of the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, the true, the only meritorious cauſe, as well Heathens as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>WHO can read the following ſentence paſſed upon the righteous, without feeling the warmeſt love and gratitude to the great Author of all good; and what a noble motive
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029927_0218_0FE3386BC7F6B240"/>
to perſeverance in well-doing does it afford: <hi>Come, ye bleſſed children of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> Good men, can at beſt, but conſider their preſent ſtate as a baniſhment from their native country. A ſtate in which they are often expoſed to innumerable temptations, to perſecutions, to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to reproach, to contempt. But the conſideration that they are travelling towards the heavenly Jeruſalem, a city prepared for them, when the foundations of the world were laid, will be abundantly ſufficient to ſupport their ſpirits, and render them <hi>more than conquerors.</hi> The glory laid up for them in the manſions of eternity, and which the great Judge will, at the awful day of account, confer upon them, will animate them to bear the violence of their oppreſſors, and even defy the malice of men and devils. Nay, they will behold with contempt the flouriſhing proſperity of the wicked, and look forward to that glorious and immortal crown which will be given them by their great Redeemer. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on the right hand, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> Matt xxv.34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>BEING aſtoniſhed to hear the great Judge declare, that all the good offices they have ever done to their brethren in affliction, was done to him, they aſk with great reverence and humility, when they performed theſe ſervices? as they never ſaw him in want, and therefore could never aſſiſt him: <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee? And the king ſhall anſwer and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> This is truly aſtoniſhing! The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſdom of men and angels could never have diſcovered a more proper method to convey an idea of the warmth and force of the divine benevolence to the ſons of men, or offer a more forcible motive to charity, than that the Son of God himſelf, ſhould from his ſeat of judgment, in the preſence of the whole race of mankind, and all the hoſts of bleſſed ſpirits from the courts of heaven, declare that all good offices done to the afflicted, are done to himſelf. During the time of his dwelling with human nature in this vale of tears, he ſuffered unſpeakable injuries and afflictions; and therefore he conſiders all the diſtreſſed virtuous, as members of his body, loves them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tenderneſs, and is ſo greatly intereſted in their welfare, that he grieves when they are diſtreſſed, and rejoices when they are happy.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS in this repreſentation of the laſt judgment, it may ſeem ſtrange that the inquiry ſhould ſolely turn on the performance of duties, without any regard to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of crimes. Perhaps the true reaſon is, that men, generally ſpeaking, conſider the neglect of duties as a matter of no great conſequence, but dread the commiſſion of crimes. And hence it happens, that while they keep themſelves free from the latter, they eaſily find excuſes for the former. And as there is not a more pernicious error with regard to religion and morality than this, the bleſſed JESUS thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give ſuch an account of the judgment, as ſhould prove the moſt ſolemn caution againſt it. But as the inquiry turns wholly on the performance of duties, it has been aſked why the offices of charity only are mentioned, and no notice taken of the duties of piety, though the Judge himſelf, upon another occaſion, declared theſe to be of more importance than the duties of charity, ſo highly applauded in this parable? But thoſe who aſk this queſtion would do well to remember, that charity cannot ſubſiſt ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: piety and its origin, faith, always producing charity; and charity, wherever it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, neceſſarily preſuppoſing piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029927_0219_0FE3386D4D7B10A8"/>THERE is ſuch a connection between piety and charity, as it will evidently appear, if it be rightly conſidered, that no man can be truly benevolent and merciful, without loving thoſe diſpoſitions: conſequently, he muſt love benevolence in God, that is, he muſt love God; for piety, or the love of God, is nothing elſe but the regard we cheriſh towards God, on account of his perfections. Piety and charity being thus eſſentially connected together, it was abundantly ſufficient to examine the conduct of men with regard to either of thoſe graces. In the parable, the inquiry is repreſented as turning upon the duties of charity, perhaps, becauſe in this branch of goodneſs, there is leſs room for ſelf-deceit than in the other. It is common for hypocrites, by a pretended zeal in the externals of religion to make ſpecious pretences to extraordinary piety, and at the ſame time are totally deficient in charity; are covetous, unjuſt, rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and proud, and, conſequently, deſtitute of all love for their Creator. But none can aſſume the appearance of charity, but by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, relieving the diſtreſſed, and performing other benevolent offices to their brethren. The works of charity may indeed, in ſome particular caſes, flow from other principles than thoſe of a pious and benevolent diſpoſition, as from vanity, or even views of intereſt; but then it ſhould be remembered, that a common degree of hypocriſy will hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men to undertake them: they are by far too weighty duties to be ſuſtained by thoſe falſe principles, and therefore are ſeldom counterfeited. Conſequently, we may conclude, that the love of God, reigns in perfection wherever a genuine, extenſive, and permanent charity is found.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, this parable teaches us in the plaineſt manner, that however loud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions we may make to piety, they will ſtand us in no ſtead at the awful tribunal of the Son of God, if we are deficient in works of charity. At the ſame time, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in its true light, it will give us no reaſon to hope well of ourſelves, if we are wanting in our duty to God; and will ſhew us, that we ſhould not only be charitable, but grateful; alſo, juſt, temperate, and blameleſs in all our dealings with mankind, for we ſhould remember, that the duty we owe to the Almighty is no other than what is due from all men in all circumſtances, and which it would be unjuſt in us to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. It conſiſts in diſpoſitions and actions, the ſame in kind, but different in degree, proportionate to the perfection of the object. He who loves and admires holineſs, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and truth in men, cannot but love theſe perfections in God, that is, he muſt love God: ſo likewiſe, he that is truly greatful to an earthly benefactor, cannot be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to one from whoſe bounty he receives all the good things he enjoys: and ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in men is nothing more than forgetting the benefit received, and the benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor who conferred the favour; how can we acquit ourſelves from the charge of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to God, if we forget the obligations we lie under to him, and are at no pains to return him thanks; that is, if we wholly neglect the eternal and internal exerciſes of devotion. Since therefore, the duty we owe to God is the fame in kind with that we owe to man, it will undeniably follow, that true morality can never exiſt where piety is wanting; and that a perſon renders himſelf ridiculous, who pretends to morality and is diſtitute of piety.</p>
               <p>THUS having endeavoured to ſhew that juſtice and piety cannot ſubſiſt ſeparately from each other, I ſhall now return to the remaining part of the parable, which exhibits a ſcene, enough to terrify the moſt hardened ſinner. The awful judge himſelf has told us, that after he has paſſed the happy ſentence on the righteous, he will pronounce the following ſentence of condemnation upon the wicked: <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye game me no drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in:
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029927_0220_0FE33875ED013998"/>
naked, and ye clothed me not: ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not. Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungered, or athirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee? Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi> Matt. xxv.41—46.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour has told us, that the fire of hell was prepared for the Devil and his angels, as well as for the wicked; and that the kingdom of heaven was prepared for the righteous. Perhaps he intended to teach us, that the original deſign of omnipotence was to render man happy; not miſerable: a ſtate of conſummate felicity was formed for the human race, at the time they were created: but the fire of hell was prepared for the Devil and his angels immediately after their fall. And as wicked men join with devils in their ſin of rebellion againſt the Almighty, they are doomed to ſhare with them in their puniſhments; a puniſhment of the heavieſt kind, a puniſhment of devils.</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour having repreſented the ſentences that are to be paſſed on the righteous and the wicked, he cloſed the parable in the following manner: <hi>And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> An expreſſion ſhort indeed, but awful beyond expreſſion! And were it fully underſtood, it muſt ſurely make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the moſt hardened ſinner; as it indicates, that, when the ſentence is paſſed, the ſcene is cloſed forever, and everlaſting puniſhment, or life eternal, muſt be the lot of every individual of the human race.</p>

                     <hi>CHRIST</hi> again foretelleth his own Death: The Rulers conſpire againſt him: A Woman poureth precious Ointment upon his Head: Judas covenanteth with the Council to betray his Maſter for thirty Pieces of Silver: Peter and John ſent to prepare the Paſſover: <hi>CHRIST</hi> eateth it with them, and waſheth his Diſciples' Feet: He comforteth them with the Promiſe of a heavenly Manſion: He profeſſeth himſelf the Way, the Truth, and the Life: He foretelleth the Treachery of Judas, and pointeth him out to John by a Token.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER our bleſſed Saviour had finiſhed the before-mentioned parables, he added a ſhort account of his own death, in order to fortify the diſciples againſt the greateſt trial they had yet met with; namely, the ſufferings of their Maſter; <hi>And it came to paſs, when Jeſus had finiſhed all theſe ſayings, he ſaid unto his diſciples, Ye know that after two days is the feaſt of the paſſover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Then aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the chief prieſts, and the ſcribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high prieſt, who was called Caiaphas, and conſulted that they might take Jeſus by ſubtilty, and kill him. But they ſaid, Not on the feaſt-day, leſt there be an uproar among the people.</hi> Matt. xxvi.1—5.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, with his diſciples, repaired to Bethany in the evening, and entered the houſe of Simon the leper, probably one who had experienced the healing efficacy of his power. But while he ſat at meat, a woman who had alſo doubtleſs been an object of his mercy, poured a box of precious ointment upon his head. This action diſpleaſed the diſciples, who knew their Maſter was not delighted with luxuries of any kind; and therefore they rebuked the woman, imagining it would have been more acceptable to the Son of God, if the ointment had been ſold, and the money diſtributed
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029927_0221_0FE33879818CE190"/>
amongſt the ſons and daughters of poverty and affliction. But their benevolent Maſter ſaid, that it had pleaſed the Divine Providence to order, that there ſhould always be perſons in neceſſitous circumſtances, that the virtuous might never want occaſions for exerciſing their charity; but thoſe who did not now teſtify their love to him, would never more have an opportunity of doing it, as the time of his miniſtry was near its period, when the king of terrors ſhould enjoy a ſhort triumph over his body; and therefore this woman had ſeaſonably anointed him for his burial. And to make them ſenſible of their folly, in blaming the woman for this her token of love to him, he aſſured them, that her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſhould live to the lateſt period of time, and that ſhe ſhould be highly celebrated for this action in every part of the world.</p>
               <p>BUT Judas Iſcariot, one of the twelve, having been more forward than the reſt, in condemning the woman, thought the rebuke was peculiarly directed to him. Stung with the guilt of his own conſcience, he roſe from table, went immediately into the city, to the high-prieſt's palace, where he found the whole council aſſembled. His paſſion would not ſuffer him to reflect on the horrid deed he was going to commit: he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately promiſed to betray into their hands, his Lord and Maſter, for the paltry reward of thirty pieces of ſilver.</p>
               <p>THUS having engaged with the rulers of Iſrael, to put into their hands, a perſon who had been long labouring for their ſalvation, and had often invited them in the moſt pathetic manner, to embrace the benevolent terms of the goſpel offered by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he ſought an opportunity to betray him in the abſence of the multitude. Ye monſters in the human form, how could you plot ſo deteſtable a crime? Surely you have forgot how mercy, with her charming voice, ſpake in all he uttered! How did benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence pour her choiceſt ſtores in all his actions! Ye rulers of Iſrael, did ever compaſſion look ſo amiably ſoft, as in thoſe melting tears which ſwelled his eyes, and poured down his cheeks, to ſoften your hard and ſtony hearts? Was it poſſible for patience to aſſume a form ſo lovely, as that ſweetly winning conduct, that endured the contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners; which beſought the guilty not to die, and entreated the obſtinate to be reconciled.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtate Judus was thus bargaining with the chief prieſts and elders to betray his Maſter, while the benevolent JESUS was preparing to celebrate the paſſover before he ſuffered, with his diſciples. He was now going to finiſh the mighty work for which he came into the world; and therefore, would not neglect to fulfil the ſmalleſt part of the law of Moſes. He therefore, ſent two of his diſciples into the city, to prepare a lamp, and make it ready for eating the paſſover; telling them that they ſhould meet a man, bearing a pitcher of water, who would conduct them to his houſe, and ſhew them a large upper room furniſhed, where they were to make ready for him. He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in this laſt tranſaction, to convince his diſciples, that he knew every thing which ſhould befal him, that his ſufferings were all premeditated by the Almighty; and that they were all ſubmitted unto voluntarily on his own account.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as night approached, JESUS left Bethany; and every thing being ready for him, at the time he entered into the city, he ſat down at the appointed hour. But knowing that his ſufferings was now near, he told his diſciples in the moſt affectionate manner, that he had greatly longed to eat the paſſover with them before he ſuffered, in order to ſhew them the ſtrongeſt proofs of his love. Theſe proofs were to give them a pattern of humility and charity, by waſhing their feet: inſtructing them in the nature of his death, as a propitiatory ſacrifice; inſtituting the ſacrament in commemoration of
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029927_0222_0FE3387B076BCF90"/>
his ſufferings; comforting them by the tender diſcourſes recorded in John xiv, xv, xvi. in which he gave them a variety of excellent directions, together with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, and recommending them to the kind protection of his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>With deſire I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you before I ſuffer; for I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</hi> Luke xxii.15, 16.</p>
               <p>AFTER our Lord had thus ſpoken, he aroſe from the table, laid aſide his garments like a ſervant, and, with all the circumſtances of an humble miniſter, waſhed the feet of his diſciples without diſtinction, though one of them, Judas Iſcariot, was a monſter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, that they might at once behold a conjunction of charity and humility, of ſelf-denial and indifference, repreſented by a perſon glorious beyond expreſſion, in their great Lord and Maſter. He choſe to waſh their feet rather than their head, that he might have an opportunity of diſplaying a more humble poſture, and a more ſtriking inſtance of his charity. The omnipotent Son of the Father lays every thing aſide, that he may ſerve his followers; heaven ſtoops to earth; one abyſs calls upon another; and the miſeries of man, which were almoſt infinite, are exceeded by a mercy equal to the immenſity of the Almighty. He deferred this ceremony, which was a cuſtomary civility paid to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſtrangers, at the beginning of their feaſts, that it might be preparatory to the ſecond, which he intended ſhould be a feaſt to the whole world, when all the followers of the bleſſed JESUS ſhould have an opportunity of feeding on his fleſh, and drinking his blood in a ſpiritual manner.</p>
               <p>PETER modeſtly declined it when our bleſſed Saviour came unto him; but his Maſter told him, that if he refuſed to ſubmit implicitly to all his orders, he could have no part with him. On which Peter cried out, <hi>Lord, not my feet only, but alſo my hands and my head.</hi> But JESUS told him, that the perſon who had bathed himſelf, had no reaſon to waſh any part of his body except his feet, which he might have dirtied by walking from the bath. In order to teach us, that perſons converted do not ſtand in need of a total change of mind, but only to cleanſe themſelves from the particular ſins they conſtantly commit through infirmity; for it is abundantly evident that our bleſſed Saviour ſpake of a ſpiritual waſhing, becauſe he added, <hi>ye are clean, but not all.</hi> Ye are men of virtuous and holy diſpoſitions; but not all: I well know that one of you will betray me.</p>
               <p>AFTER our bleſſed Saviour had finiſhed this menial ſervice, he aſked his diſciples if they knew the meaning of what he had done, as the action was purely emblematical? You truly, added he, ſtyle me Maſter and Lord, for I am the Son of God, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world: but if I, your Maſter and your Lord, have condeſcended to waſh your feet, you ſurely ought to perform, with the utmoſt pleaſure, the humbleſt offices of charity to one another. I have ſet you a pattern of humility, and I recommend it to you.</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY nothing can more effectually ſhew us the neceſſity of this heavenly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, than its being recommended to us by ſo great an example: a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, in the preſent circumſtances, was particularly ſeaſonable; for the diſciples having heard their great Maſter declare, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, their minds were filled with ambitious thoughts. Upon which our bleſſed Saviour added, 'Ye need not be aſhamed to follow my example in this particular; for no ſervant can thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k it beneath him, to condeſcend to perform thoſe actions his Lord has done before him: and, therefore, if he knows his duty, he will be happy if he practiſes it.' Our bleſſed Saviour added, that though he had called them to the apoſtleſhip, and well knew the ſecret diſpoſitions of every heart, before he choſe them, they need not be ſurpriſed
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029927_0223_0FE3387C8DED00A0"/>
that any one among them ſhould prove a traitor, as it was done, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled: <hi>He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel againſt me.</hi> John xiii.18.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord being now to be but a ſhort time with his diſciples, he thought proper to take his farewell of them, which he did in the moſt affectionate manner. Theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tidings greatly troubled them. They were very unwilling to part with ſo kind a friend, ſo dear a maſter, ſo wiſe a guide, and ſo profitable a teacher; eſpecially as they thought they ſhould be left in a forlorn condition, a poor and helpleſs prey to the rage and hatred of a blind and malicious generation. They ſeemed willing to die with their Lord, if that might be accepted: <hi>Why cannot I follow thee? I will lay down my life for thy ſake,</hi> was the language of one, and even all of them: but the thoughts of a diſconſolate ſeparation they could not ſupport.</p>
               <p>THEIR dear Lord and Maſter ſeeing them thus dejected, endeavoured to cheer their drooping ſpirits: <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> Liſten attentively to what I am going to deliver for your conſolation: <hi>I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myſelf; that where I am, there you may be alſo.</hi> A reviving admonition! They were one day to meet again their dear, their affectionate Maſter, in a place where they ſhould live together to all eternity. But death makes ſo vaſt a diſtance between friends, and the diſciples then knew ſo little of a future ſtate, that they ſeemed to doubt whether they ſhould ever after parting, meet their great Redeemer. They neither knew the place where he was going, nor the way that led to his kingdom. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>we know not whither thou goeſt, and how can we know the way?</hi> In anſwer to this queſtion, he told them, that he was <hi>the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> as if he had ſaid, the only way of following me to the regions of happineſs, is by duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving my doctrines and precepts which I have delivered to you from the Almighty. He added, that by his removing to heaven, he would there intercede for them with his heavenly Father, and ſend the Holy Ghoſt to comfort them from thence.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, leſt all theſe arguments ſhould not be ſufficient to quiet their minds, he had ſtill another, which could not fail of ſucceſs: <hi>If ye loved me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye would rejoice, becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the father:</hi> intimating that he would conſider it as a proof of their love to him, if they ceaſed to mourn. They doubtleſs thought, that by grieving for his death, they expreſſed their love for their Maſter; and it ſhould ſeem ſtrange, that our Saviour ſhould put ſo contrary an interpretation on their friendly ſorrow, or require ſo unnatural a thing of them, as to rejoice at his departure. What! (might they think) ſhall we rejoice at ſo amiable a friend's removal from us; or can we be glad that he retires and leaves us in this vale of miſery? No, it is impoſſible? the human heart, on ſo melancholy an occaſion, has no diſpoſition to rejoice. Our bleſſed Saviour, therefore, adds this reaſon to ſolve the ſeeming paradox, becauſe he was going to the Father; that is, he was going to aſcend to the right hand of infinite power, from whence he would ſend them all the aſſiſtance they could deſire. It muſt not, however, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that our Saviour meant by theſe words, that his diſciples ſhould not be concerned at his death, or that they could not love him unleſs they expreſſed a viſible joy on this occaſion: that would, indeed, have been a hard interpretation of their grief; he well knew their grief flowed from love, and that if their love had not been ſtrong, their ſorrow had been much leſs. Indeed, their Maſter was fully convinced, that love was the occaſion of their ſorrow; and, for that reaſon, he uſed theſe arguments to mitigate it.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord did not intend to intimate, that all ſorrow for ſo worthy a friend, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, or an unbecoming expreſſion of their love; doubtleſs, he was not diſpleaſed to
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:029927_0224_0FE33883E9756B28"/>
ſee his diſciples ſo tenderly affected at his removal from them: he who ſhed tears at the grave of Lazarus, blended with ſighs and groans, cannot be thought to forbid them wholly at his own; he, therefore, did not chide his diſciples with angry reproaches, as though they had been entirely in the wrong, but gently reaſoned with them by kind perſuaſion, <hi>Let not your heart be troubled,</hi> as rather pitying than condemning their ſorrow. Soon after JESUS had ſpoken theſe things, his heart was greatly troubled, to think that one of his diſciples ſhould prove his enemy: he complained of it at the table, declaring that one of them ſhould betray him. This moving declaration greatly affected the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and they began every one of them to ſay to their Maſter, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> But JESUS giving them no deciſive anſwer, John, the beloved diſciple, whoſe ſweet diſpoſition and other amiable qualities, is perpetuated in the peculiar love his great Maſter bore him, and was now reclining on his boſom, aſked him, who among the diſciples could be guilty of ſo deteſtable a crime? JESUS told him, that the perſon to whom he ſhould give the ſop, when he had dipped it, was he who ſhould betray him: accordingly, as ſoon as he had dipped the ſop in the diſh, he gave it to Judas Iſcariot, ſaying to him at the ſame time, <hi>That thou doeſt, do quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JUDAS received the ſop, without knowing any thing of what his Maſter had told the beloved diſciple, nor did any of the diſciples, except St. John, entertain the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that Judas was the perſon who would betray their Maſter. They were, indeed, ſo deeply affected with his declaration, that one of them ſhould betray him, that they did not remark the words of JESUS to his apoſtate diſciple; but continued to aſk him, who was the perſon that ſhould be guilty of ſo unnatural a crime? Willing at laſt, to ſatisfy their importunity, the bleſſed JESUS declared, that the perſon who dipped his hand with him in the diſh, ſhould betray him. This, to the eleven, was a joyful declaration, but confounding in the higheſt degree, to Judas: impudent as he was, it ſtruck him ſpeechleſs, diſplaying the ſoulneſs of his heart, and pointing him out plainly.</p>
               <p>JUDAS continued mute with confuſion, while the bleſſed JESUS declared, that his death ſhould be brought about according to the decrees of heaven, though that would not in the leaſt mitigate the crime of the perſon who betrayed him; adding, <hi>it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</hi> Judas having now recovered himſelf a little, aſſerted his innocence, by a queſtion which implied a negation of the charge. But his Maſter poſitively affirming that he was the perſon, he was ſoon ſilenced.</p>
               <p>JUDAS Iſcariot's treachery in betraying his Maſter, muſt raiſe the aſtoniſhment of every reader, who has any notion of the character of our great, our merciful Redeemer. It will not therefore, we hope, be diſagreeable to the reader, to explain the motives that induced him to be guilty of this atrocious crime, and conſider particularly the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that attended ſo inhuman an action. Some are of opinion, that he was induced to commit this villainy by the reſentment of the rebuke given him by his Maſter, for blaming the woman who came with the precious ointment, and anointed the head of JESUS, as he ſat at meat in the houſe of Simon the leper—but though this had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs its weight with the traitor: yet it could not, I think, be the only motive, becauſe the rebuke was given in general, to all the diſciples, who had, perhaps, been equally forward with him, in cenſuring the woman; nor can we imagine, even if he had been rebuked alone, that ſo mild a reproof could provoke any perſon, however wicked, to the horrid act of murdering his friend, much leſs Judas, whoſe covetous diſpoſition, muſt have diſpoſed him to bear every thing from his Maſter, from whom he expected the higheſt preferment when he openly declared himſelf the Meſſiah, and took the reins of government into his own hands. If it ſhould be anſwered, that his reſentment was ſo
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029927_0225_0FE33887D8FF3B20"/>
great as to hinder him from exerciſing his reaſon, I deſire it may be remembered, that though he actually agreed with the chief prieſts, a few hours after the rebuke was given, yet he did not commit the henious crime till two days after: beſides, to impute his treachery to the ſudden impulſes of a ſtrong reſentment, is ſo great an alleviation of his crime, as ſeems abſolutely inconſiſtent with the character given of it in the ſcripture, where it is ſaid to merit the heavieſt puniſhment, and repreſented in the blackeſt colours.</p>
               <p>THERE are others that think Judas betrayed his Maſter through covetouſneſs: but if we underſtand by covetouſneſs, the reward given by the prieſts, this opinion is equally defective; for the ſum was too ſmall for the moſt covetous wretch to think equivalent to the life of a friend, eſpecially when he expected from him the higheſt poſts and advantages. The reader will be convinced of the force of this remark, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, that all the diſciples believed the Meſſiah's kingdom was inſtantly to be erected; and that according to the notion they entertained of it, each of them, eſpecially the apoſtles, expected, in a very ſhort time, to be poſſeſſed of immenſe riches; beſides the ſcripture tells us, that the predominate paſſion of Judas was covetouſneſs; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, could not be ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf, as when juſt on the point of receiving an immenſe reward for his ſervice, to exchange every thing for ſo trifling a ſum.</p>
               <p>BUT there are others that attribute the perfidy of Judas, to his doubting whether his Maſter was the Meſſiah, and that he betrayed him in a fit of deſpair: but of all the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this is the worſt founded; for, if Judas believed his Maſter to be an impoſtor, he muſt have obſerved ſomething in his behaviour, which led him to form ſuch an opinion of him, and, in that caſe, he would doubtleſs, have mentioned it to the chief prieſts and elders, when he made the contract with them, which it is plain he did not, as they would have reminded him of it, when he came back and expreſſed his remorſe for what he had done. It ſhould alſo be obſerved, that had Judas given them any intimations of this kind, they would doubtleſs have urged them againſt our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, in the courſe of his trial, when they were at ſo great a loſs for witneſſes to ſupport their accuſations; and againſt the apoſtles afterwards, when they reproved them for ſpeaking in the name of JESUS: beſides, had Judas thought his Maſter an impoſtor, and propoſed nothing by his treachery, but the price he put upon his life, how came he to ſell him for ſuch a trifle, when he well knew, that the chief prieſts and rulers would have given him any ſum, rather than not have gotten him into their hands? In fine, the ſuppoſition that Judas believed his Maſter to be an impoſtor, is directly confuted by the ſolemn declaration he made to the prieſts, when he declared the deepeſt conviction of the innocence of our great Redeemer: <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in betraying the innocent blood.</hi> And it muſt be remembered, that the remorſe he felt for his crime, was too bitter to be endured; ſo that he fled even to the king of terrors for relief, after he ſaw his Maſter condemned.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, ſince the treachery of Judas did not proceed from any of theſe motives, it may be aſked, what other motive can be aſſigned for his conduct? The evangeliſt St. John tells us, that he was of ſo covetous a diſpoſition, as to ſteal money out of our Lord's bag; and hence we have ſufficient reaſon to believe, that he firſt followed JESUS, with a view of obtaining riches, and other temporal advantages, which he expected the Meſſiah's friends would enjoy: it likewiſe authoriſes us to think, that as he had hitherto reaped none of theſe advantages, he might grow impatient under the delay, and the rather, as JESUS had lately diſcouraged all ambitious views amongſt his diſciples, and neglected to embrace the opportunity of erecting his kingdom, which was offered him by the multitude who accompanied him into Jeruſalem with ſhouts, and crying, <hi>Hoſanna
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029927_0226_0FE338895CB9BE98"/>
to the Son of David,</hi> His impatience, therefore becoming exceſſive, inſpired him with the thought of delivering his Maſter into the hands of the council, firmly perſuaded, that he would then be obliged to aſſume the dignity of the Meſſiah, and conſequently able to reward his followers: for, as this court was compoſed of the chief prieſts, elders and ſcribes, that is, the principal perſons of the ſacredotal order, the repreſentatives of the great families, and the doctors of the law; the traitor did not doubt that his Maſter, when brought before ſo auguſt an aſſembly, would aſſert his pretenſions to the title of the Meſſiah, prove his claim to their full conviction, gain them over to his intereſt, and immediately enter on his regal dignity. And though he muſt be ſenſible, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he took to compaſs this intention, were very offenſive to his Maſter; yet he might think the ſucceſs of it would procure his pardon from ſo compaſſionate a Maſter, and even recommend him to favour. In the mean time, his project, however plauſible it might appear to one of his turn, was far from being free from difficulty; and therefore, while he revolved it in his own mind, many things might occur to ſtagger his reſolution. At length, thinking himſelf affronted by the rebuke of JESUS, at the time when the woman anointed the head of his Maſter, he was provoked to execute the reſolution he had formed of obliging him to alter his meaſures. Riſing, therefore, directly from the table, he went immediately into the city, to the palace of the high prieſt, where he found the council aſſembled, conſulting how they might take JESUS by ſubtilty, in the abſence of the multitude. To them he made known his intention of delivering his Maſter into their hands; and undertook, for a ſmall ſum of money, to conduct a band of armed men to the place where the Saviour of the world uſually ſpent the night with his diſciples, where they might apprehend him without the leaſt danger of tumult. Thus the great deceiver of mankind tempted him to commit the horrid action, by laying hold of the various paſſions that now agitated the traitor's breaſt.</p>
               <p>IT may be gathered from the nature of the contract, that theſe were really the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which induced Judas to betray his Maſter: <hi>What will ye give me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and I will deliver him unto you?</hi> He did not mean that he would deliver him up to be put to death; for though the prieſts had conſulted among themſelves, how they might deſtroy JESUS, they had not been ſo abominably wicked as to declare their intention publicly: they only propoſed to bring him to trial for aſſuming the character of the Meſſiah, and to treat him as it ſhould appear he deſerved. The offer, therefore, which Judas made them of delivering him up, was in conformity to their public reſolutions; nor did they underſtand it in any other light: for, had the prieſts thought that his deſign in this was to get his Maſter puniſhed with death, they muſt alſo have thought he believed him to be an impoſtor; in which caſe, they would doubtleſs have produced him as one of their principal evidences, no perſon being more proper to bear witneſs againſt any criminal than his companion. Or, ſuppoſing Judas repented before the trial came on, and had withdrawn himſelf, the prieſts might have argued with great plauſibility, both in their own court, and before the governor, that for a man's diſciple to require the judges to bring him to condign puniſhment, branded him with ſuch a ſuſpicion of guilt, as was almoſt equal to a full proof: alſo, when Judas returned to them with the money, declaring that he had ſinned in betraying the innocent blood, inſtead of replying, <hi>What is that to us, ſee thou to that?</hi> it was the moſt natural thing in the world to have upbraided him with the ſtain he had put upon his Maſter's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by the contract they had made with him. It is true, they called the money they gave him, <hi>the price of blood;</hi> but they did not mean this in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as they had neither hired Judas to aſſaſſinate his Maſter, nor can they be ſuppoſed to have charged themſelves with the guilt of murdering him: it was only the price of blood in
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:029927_0227_0FE3388AE43D1598"/>
conſequence of its being the reward they had given to the traitor for putting it in their power to take away the life of CHRIST, under the colour and form of public juſtice; nay, it may be even doubted, whether Judas aſked the money, as a reward or his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: he covetouſly, indeed, kept it, and the prieſts, for that reaſon, called it the price of blood.</p>
               <p>JUDAS, in ſhort, knew that the rulers could not take away the life of any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the Romans having deprived them of that power; and, therefore, could have no deſign of this kind in delivering him up; not to mention that it was a common opinion among the Jews, that the Meſſiah could never die, an opinion which Judas might eaſily embrace, having ſeen his Maſter raiſe ſeveral perſons, and among the reſt, one who had been in the grave no leſs than four days.</p>
               <p>IT is probable that the traitor's intention in betraying his Maſter, was that mentioned above, from his hanging himſelf when he found him condemned, not by the governor, but by the council, whoſe prerogative it was, to judge prophets. Had Judas propoſed to take away the life of his Maſter, the ſentence of condemnation paſſed upon him, inſtead of filling him with deſpair, muſt have gratified him, being the accompliſhment of his project: whereas, this circumſtance is ſhewn to have been perfectly natural, by the light wherein we have endeavoured to place his conduct.</p>
               <p>HAVING been witneſs to the greateſt part of our Lord's miracles, and having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the certain truth of them, in the powers that had been conferred upon himſelf, Judas could never think that the council would have condemned him as an impoſtor, far leſs, as a blaſphemer; he knew him to be perfectly innocent, and expected that he would have wrought ſuch miracles before the council, as ſhould have conſtrained them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: therefore, when he found nothing of this kind was done, and that the prieſts had paſſed the ſentence of condemnation upon him, and were carrying him to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to get it executed, he repented of his raſh and covetous project, came to the chief prieſts and elders, the perſons to whom he had betrayed him, offered them their money again, and ſolemnly declared the deepeſt conviction of his Maſter's innocence, hoping that they would have deſiſted from the proſecution; but they were obſtinate, and would not relent: upon which his remorſe aroſe to ſuch a pitch, that, unable to ſupport the torments of his conſcience, he went and hanged himſelf. Thus I think it probable, that the traitor's intention in delivering up his Maſter, was not to get him puniſhed with death, but only to lay him under a neceſſity of proving his pretenſions before the grandees, whom he had hitherto ſhunned; thinking that the whole nation would immediately have ſubmitted, and the diſciples have been raiſed forthwith to the ſummit of their expectations, if they had yielded.</p>
               <p>BUT this account of Judas's conduct, is by no means calculated to leſſen the foulneſs of his crime, which was the blackeſt imaginable: for, even in the light above mentioned, it implied both an inſatiable avarice, and a wilful oppoſition to the counſels of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and rendered the actor of it a diſgrace to human nature: but it is calculated to ſet the credibility of the traitor's action in a proper light, and to ſhew that he was not moved to it by any thing ſuſpicious in the character of his Maſter; becauſe, according to this view of it, his perfidy, inſtead of implying that he entertained ſuſpicions of his Maſter's integrity, plainly proved that he had the fulleſt conviction of his being the Meſſiah: and to ſay the truth, it was not poſſible for any one intimately acquainted with our Lord, as Judas was, to judge otherwiſe of him; having ſeen his miracles, which were great and true beyond exception, and having experienced his power, in the ability of working miracles, which he had received from him, and, no doubt, exerciſed with extraordinary pleaſure, together with the reſt of the apoſtles.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Our Saviour inſtitutes the Sacrament of his Supper: He checketh the ambitious Strife of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and promiſeth them a Share in his Kingdom: He telleth Peter of Satan's deſire to ſift him, but that his Faith ſhould be ſupported; and yet he ſhould thrice deny him: He adviſeth his Diſciples to provide Neceſſaries, and to arm themſelves againſt the Day of Trial: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth them Power to do greater Works than his own, and the Grant of all that they ſhould aſk in his Name: He requireth their Obedience, as a Proof of their Love, and giveth them a Promiſe of the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt. Under the Parable of the Vine, <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſetteth forth God's Government of his Church, and exhorteth his Diſciples to abide in his Faith and Doctrine: He commandeth them to love one another, according to the great Love he had ſhewn for them; and warneth them of their Sufferings for his Sake: He comforteth them by a Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt: He intimateth his Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion: His Diſciples confeſs their Faith in him; he foretelleth their Deſertion of him, and promiſeth them Peace in him amidſt their Tribulation in the World: He prayeth to his Father to glorify him: and to preſerve his Apoſtles in Unity of Faith, and from all Evil; and to ſanctify them with the Word of Truth; and for the perfect Union of all Believers, and their Admiſſion to a Share of his Glory in Heaven.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT does not appear that our Saviour was in the leaſt diſturbed at the conſideration of the treachery of Judas; for, in order to render his love to mankind more effectual, he inſtituted the ſacrament of his ſupper, to perpetuate the memory of it throughout all ages. Accordingly, as they were eating the paſchal-ſupper, <hi>Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me,</hi> obſerve this rite no longer in remembrance of your deliverance from Egypt, but in remembrance of me; who by dying, for you, will bring you out of the ſpiritual bondage, a bonage far worſe than the Egyptian, under which your fathers groaned, and will eſtabliſh you in the glorious liberty of the children of God: do it in remembrance of me, who, by laying down my life, will ranſom you from ſin, from death, from hell, and, that you may enter immortality in triumph, will ſet open the gates of heaven to you.</p>
               <p>AFTER having given the bread to his diſciples, he alſo took the cup and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> All of you, and all of my diſciples in all ages, muſt drink of this cup, becauſe it repreſents my blood ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of mankind; my blood, by which the new covenant between God and man is ratified: it is therefore my blood of the new covenant, ſo that this inſtitution exhibits to your joyful meditation, the grand baſis of the hopes of the children of men, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the memory of it to the end of the world. He added, <hi>I will not drink hence forth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</hi> Matt. xxvi.29.</p>
               <p>THE moſt illuſtrious, the moſt momentous event that is poſſible to engage the meditations of mankind, in the manifeſtation of the Son of God: to his life and death, his reſurrection and aſcenſion into glory, we are indebted for our hopes and aſſurances of pardon, for our peace, for our happineſs: to procure our benefit, he made the moſt amazing condeſcenſion from the dignity he enjoyed with his Father by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029927_0229_0FE33894ED191310"/>
on the veil of fleſh; he poured divine inſtruction from his lips, and ſhone forth with an all-perfect and all-lovely example: for our benefit, he ſubmitted to a courſe of the moſt cruel treatment of his bitter enemies, to the agonies of the croſs and to the ſtroke of the king of terrors: for our benefit, he aroſe again with power and luſtre, aſcended into the manſions of eternal happineſs, intercedes for us with the Almighty, and holdeth the reins of government. And ſhall the amiable, the excellent, the benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial actions of this Saviour, be buried in oblivion? Forbid it gratitude, duty, intereſt! Forbid it, every conſideration that can affect the human mind! With the greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs this benificient JESUS inſtituted a rite that ſhould recal his love to our memories, and awake each pious paſſion in our breaſts; a rite which, by the breaking of bread, and the pouring out of wine ſhould repreſent to us, in a ſtriking manner, that moſt ſignal proof of the affection, both of him and his heavenly Father, when his tender frame was expoſed to wounds and bruiſes, when ſtreams of the moſt precious blood iſſued from his ſacred veins. And the more we reflect on this inſtance of divine love, the more we ſhall perceive that there was a peculiar propriety in point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, by a particular ordinance, a fact of ſuch immenſe importance in the ſyſtem of revelation! Nay, we may even venture to aſſert, that in ſome dark and corrupt ages, when the Scriptures were little known by the common people, and hardly ſtudied by the prieſts, the death of our Saviour, had not the remembrance of it been renewed by the celebration of this ſacred ordinance, would have been almoſt forgotten.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould alſo remember, that the vanities of the world, the allurements of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure, the charms of ambition, the ſplendour of riches; in ſhort, temptations from preſent objects of every kind, have often too fatal an influence on our temper and conduct; they have a melancholy aptitude to draw the ſoul aſide to folly, and to obliterate the impreſſions of things divine. It was, therefore, a wiſe, a kind intention of our great Redeemer, by a frequent repetition of the ſacramental feaſt to call back the wandering heart of man to a ſenſe of his duty and obligations as a Chriſtian. Beſides, though the religion of the immaculate JESUS is altogether gentle, generous, and beneficient; though its whole tendency is to correct the paſſions, ſweeten the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> poſitions, and enlarge the affection of men; and though it enforces all this upon us by motives ſurpriſingly powerful and affecting; yet ſuch is the perverſeneſs of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, that jealouſies and contentions, envy, wrath, and malice, too often find admittance there. Was it not then an inſtance of our Saviour's wiſdom and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by uniting us together at the ſacrament of his body and blood, to inſpire us with condeſcenſion, compaſſion, and love, and to urge the putting away all bitterneſs, anger, evil-ſpeaking, and revenge.</p>
               <p>WE ought, therefore, to be very careful how we perform this duty appointed by our dying Saviour? We ſhould, in order to receive it worthily, employ our meditation on the deſign and excellency of the goſpel; on the noble ſyſtem of doctrines and duties it contains; on the illuſtrious, divine, and complete example of the bleſſed JESUS; on the important privileges, the valuable promiſes, and the raviſhing proſpects his revelation affords; and on the bright and convincing evidence with which it is attended. We ſhould contemplate that eſſential and unparelleled benevolence of the Deity, in forming the way for our redemption, on the readineſs manifeſted by the Son of God, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking our cauſe; and on his wonderful tranſactions in the proſecution of this grand, this amazing work: above all, we ſhould impreſs upon our ſouls a ſtrong ſenſe of the ſpecial and immediate purpoſes for which this ſacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:029927_0230_0FE33896737AF868"/>TO have our hearts fixed upon the vanities, the profits, and the cares of this world, is a direct violation of the ordinance; and therefore we ſhould be extremely careful to maintain a right temper and behaviour at that time. We ſhould ſtudy to abſtract our thoughts as much as poſſible, from every foreign, every terreſtial conſideration, and to have our paſſion fervently employed in the ſolemn ſervice. 'Retire, O my ſoul,' each of us ſhould ſay, 'from this inferior ſcene of things, from all its pleaſures and all its purſuits, and hold communion with the Almighty and his Son, the immaculate JESUS. Meditate upon that infinite grace of omnipotence, which contrived the amazing plan, that diſplayeth pardon, peace, and endleſs happineſs to ſo undeſerving a creature as thou art. Recollect that ſurpriſing condeſcenſion and tenderneſs of thy compaſſionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, which induced him to bring down from heaven, ſalvation to the ſons of men. Call to mind the admirable inſtructions he offered, the charming pattern he exhibited, the hard labours and ſufferings he endured in the courſe of his miniſtry; eſpecially call to mind the ignominy, the reproaches, the agonies he endured when he hung upon the croſs, and purchaſed for thee eternal mercy. Think upon theſe affecting ſubjects, till thine heart is filled with ſorrow for thine iniquities; till thy faith becomes lively, active, and fruitful; till thy gratitude and love are elevated to the higheſt pitch; till thy obedience is rendered uniform, ſteady and complete. Haſt thou, O my God, and Parent of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal nature! haſt thou ſo illuſtriouſly manifeſted thy compaſſion for ſinners, as not to ſpare thine own Son? Haſt thou ſent the Saviour into this lower world, in order to raiſe the children of men to immortality, perfection, and glory? And am I now in thy preſence, on purpoſe to celebrate this inſtitution, which requireth me to commemorate the death of the great Meſſiah; to declare my public acceptance of his excellent reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and my regard to my Chriſtian brethren? May then the remembrance of his benificence, dwell upon my mind, and upon my tongue for ever and ever! May I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and comply with the intention of his goſpel; and may the ſentiments of kindneſs and charity towards my fellow-mortals, and fellow-diſciples, with increaſing purity, with increaſing zeal, reign in my breaſt.'</p>
               <p>WHEN we partake of this ſacred ordinance, ſuch are the views that ſhould poſſeſs our ſouls: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut it will ſignify little to entertain theſe views at that time, unleſs the effects of them are apparent in our future conduct and converſation; for a tranſient flow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or ſallies of immediate delight, were not principally intended in this inſtitution. The bleſſed JESUS did not ordain it as a ceremony or charm, but as a proper method of eſtabliſhing our hearts in virtuous and pious diſpoſitions. Though ye have, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Chriſtians, obeyed the Redeemer's command in this appointment, and found your paſſions greatly moved, yet this is not the whole required at your hands; it will juſtly be expected, that ye ſhould live to the honour of your divine Maſter. As you have ſolemnly profeſſed your faith in him, and your love towards him, the reality of your faith and love ſhould be demonſtrated by walking more ſtrictly in the way of his precepts, and by abounding in that heavenly character and temper, which his ſpotleſs example ſo engagingly recommends: thus only will the ſacrament become ſubſervient to the moſt beneficial purpoſes; thus only will it be inſtrumental in qualifying us for ſharing in the dignity and felicity poſſeſſed by our exalted Saviour. May, therefore, all the followers of the immaculate JESUS, advance from holineſs to holineſs, till they arrive at the regions of eternal felicity, by uniting together at his ſacred table.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus inſtituted his laſt ſupper, our bleſſed Saviour was deeply affected with his own thoughts: and after delivering the ſacramental cup, telling them that his blood was ſhed for them, he mentioned the treachery of Judas a ſecond time: <hi>But, behold, the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029927_0231_0FE33897F81D43D0"/>
hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table.</hi> This ſecond declaration was made very properly after the inſtitution of the ſacrament, which exhibits the higheſt inſtance of our great Redeemer's love to mankind, his dying to obtain the remiſſion of their ſins; for it abundantly proves, that the perſon who could deliberately be guilty of ſuch an injury to ſo kind a friend, muſt have been a monſter, the foulneſs of whoſe ingratitude, cannot be reached by the force of language. Some of the diſciples, particularly ſtruck with horror at the thought of Judas's treachery, rebuked him, by aſking him with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, how he could betray his Maſter? This accuſation, Judas, no doubt, repelled, by impudently denying the fact; but conſciouſneſs of guilt, giving edge to the reproaches of his brethren, and to every circumſtance of the affair, he, thinking himſelf affronted, immediately left the company, exceedingly diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour's ſufferings were now at hand: the traitor Judas was gone to the chief prieſts and elders, for a band of ſoldiers to apprehend him; but this did not diſcompoſe the Redeemer of mankind; he took occaſion to meditate on the glory that would accrue both to himſelf and to the Almighty, from thoſe ſufferings, and ſpake of it to his diſciples: <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is the Son of man Glorified, and God is glorified in him.</hi> He alſo told them, that having already done honour to his Father, by the paſt actions of his life, and being about to honour him yet further by his ſufferings and death, which would diſplay his perfections, particularly his infinite love to the human race, in the moſt aſtoniſhing and amiable light, he was in his turn to receive honour from the Almighty; intimating that his human nature was to be exalted to the right hand of Omnipotence, and that his miſſion from God was to be ſupported by irrefragable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. But his diſciples, imagining that he ſpake of the glory of a temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their ambition was again revived, and they began to diſpute with as much keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ever, which of them ſhould be the greateſt in that kingdom. This contention, JESUS compoſed by the arguments he had formerly uſed for the ſame purpoſe. Amongſt the Gentiles, ſaid he, they are reckoned the greateſt, who have the greateſt power, and have exerciſed it in the moſt abſolute manner: but your greatneſs ſhall be very different from theirs; it ſhall not conſiſt in being unlimited with regard to tyrannical power, even though it ſhould be joined with an affection of titles, which denote qualities truly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but whoſoever deſires to be great, or chief among you, let him be ſo by his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the ſervice he renders to the reſt, in imitation of me your Maſter, whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in this, that I am become the ſervant of you: adding, as they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with him in this temptation, he would beſtow upon them ſuch a kingdom, as his Father had appointed for them. At the ſame time, to check their ambition, and lead them to form a juſt notion of his kingdom, he told them, that he was ſoon to leave them, and that whither he was going, they could not at that time, follow him; for which reaſon, inſtead of contending with one another, which of them ſhould be the greateſt, they would do well to be united among themſelves, in the happy bond of love: for, by loving one another ſincerely and fervently, they would prove themſelves his diſciples, to the conviction of mankind, who could not be ignorant, that the diſtinguiſhing part of his character was love.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord called this a new commandment, not becauſe mutual love had never been enjoined to mankind before, but becauſe it was a precept of peculiar excellency: for the word <hi>new</hi> in the Hebrew language, denotes excellency and truth: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this idiom ſeems to have been, that novelty oftentimes has the ſame effect upon the mind as excellency, rendering an object acceptable, and raiſing admiration: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo called this a new commandment, becauſe they were to exerciſe it under a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029927_0232_0FE338A4F72B1F88"/>
according to a new meaſure, and from new motives: they were to love one another in the relation of his diſciples, and in that degree of love which he had ſhewed to them; for they were to lay down their lives for the brethren. This excellent morality, however, did not make ſuch an impreſſion on Peter, as the words which JESUS had ſpoken concerning a place whither his diſciples could not come: he therefore replied, by aſking where he was going? To which JESUS anſwered, <hi>Whither I go, thou canſt not follow me now; but thou ſhalt follow me afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN order to make his diſciples humble, watchful, and kindly-affectionate one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, he aſſured them, that Satan was ſeeking to ruin them all by his tempa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, Behold, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> Peter was greatly offended that his Maſter ſhould have ſingled him out as the weakeſt; for ſo he interpreted his praying for him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly: and ſuppoſing that he mentioned Satan's ſeeking to ſift him, as a thing which would hinder him from following his Maſter, replied, Why cannot I follow thee now? Is there any road more terrible than the dark valley of the ſhadow of death? Yet, I am willing this moment to accompany thee through theſe black and gloomy ſhades.</p>
               <p>BUT JESUS knowing his weak, though ſincere reſolution, anſwered, art thou ſo very confident of thine own ſtrength? <hi>I tell thee, Peter, the cock ſhall not crow this day, before that thou ſhalt thrice deny that thou knoweſt me,</hi> Luke xxii.34.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord having finiſhed what he had to ſay to Peter in particular, turned himſelf to his other diſciples, and put them in mind, how that, when they were firſt ſent out, he directed them to rely wholly upon the Almighty for aſſiſtance. 'When I ſent you formerly,' ſaid he, 'to preach the goſpel, you may remember, I ordered you to go without any proviſion either for your ſuſtenance or defence, aſſuring you, that though you would indeed meet with great oppoſition, yet Providence would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome men in all places to be your friends, and to furniſh you with all neceſſaries; and, accordingly, you found that you wanted for nothing, but were wonderfully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without any care or proviſion of your own in the whole journey, and finiſhed your work with ſucceſs. But now the caſe is very different; the time of that greateſt trial and diſtreſs, whereof I have often forewarned you, is juſt at hand; and you may now make all the proviſion in your power, and arm yourſelves againſt it as much as you are able: the time, I ſay, of the greateſt trial and diſtreſs that ever yet befel you, is now at hand; for I am juſt going to be betrayed into the hands of my inveterate enemies. I have finiſhed the work for which I was ſent into the world; and nothing now remains for me, but to undergo thoſe ſufferings which the prophets have foretold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, and, by ſubmitting at laſt to a moſt cruel and ignominious death, to complete this whole diſpenſation of Providence.' The diſciples thinking that their great Maſter meant, that they ſhould arm themſelves in a literal ſenſe, and endeavour to oppoſe the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults that would ſhortly be made upon them by the Jews, anſwered, <hi>Lord here are two ſwords:</hi> but the bleſſed JESUS, who only intended to convey an idea of their approaching diſtreſs and temptations, and to arm them againſt the ſurpriſe, replied. <hi>It is enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour having thus forewarned his diſciples of the great trial that was coming upon them, and commanded them to arm themſelves againſt it, proceeded to animate them to ſuſtain the trial manfully, and to comfort them under the diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions it might cauſe in their minds. Be not terrified and diſconſolate, ſaid the compaſſionate Redeemer of mankind, becauſe I have told you that I muſt undergo

               <p>I ſay, the Father ſhall ſend you another advocate and comforter, even his Holy Spirit, the author and teacher of truth, who ſhall guide and direct, aſſiſt and comfort you in all caſes. This Spirit, the ſenſual and corrupt world cannot receive, having no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, nor diſpoſition to be governed by him; but ye know him, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to entertain him: he is already in you, by his ſecret and inviſible efficacy; and ſhall hereafter appear in you openly, by great and viſible manifeſtations of himſelf. Thus, though I muſt depart from you, yet I do by no means leave you comfortleſs: I leave with you a promiſe of the Holy Spirit, and I leave you in expectation alſo of my own return: for though, after a very little while, I ſhall appear no more to the world; yet, as I ſhall live again, and ye alſo ſhall live with me, to you I will appear.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, when I have conquered and triumphed over death, ye ſhall underſtand more fully, and it ſhall apppear more viſible by great and manifeſt effects, that I act, in all things, agreeable to my Father's will, and am perfectly inveſted with his power; and that ye in like manner, have my power and commiſſion communicated to you: ſo that there is a perfect unity and community between us; only ye muſt remember, that the one neceſſary condition, on which all depends, is, that ye continue ſteadfaſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable in your faith in me, and in your obedience to my commands. He, and he only, who embraces my doctrine, and obeys and practiſes it, ſhall be judged to be ſincere in his love towards me: <hi>And he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt myſelf to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JUDAS Thaddeus here interrupted his Maſter, ſaying, <hi>Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thyſelf unto us, and not unto the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO which JESUS replied, I have already told you the reaſon of my acting in this manner; becauſe the generality of the world are not diſpoſed to obey my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the neceſſary condition of maintaining communion with me: but ye are diſpoſed to embrace my doctrine, and to obey it; and, therefore, I manifeſt myſelf to you. And whoever elſe will ſo love me as to keep my commandments, him alſo will I and my Father love, and will maintain communion with him, and all ſpiritual bleſſings ſhall be poured down upon him, and he ſhall be made partaker of happineſs and eternal life. On the contrary, whoever loves me not, that is, obeys not my commandments, ſhall have no intercourſe or communion with me; neither will my Father love or honor him, or make any manifeſtations of himſelf to him: for as my commandments are not my own, but the Father's commandments, therefore, whoever diſhonours me, my Father will look upon him as diſhonouring himſelf.</p>
               <p>I have briefly ſpoken theſe things unto you now, according to the ſhortneſs of the time I am to continue with you, and to comfort you for the preſent, againſt my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But when the comforter whom I promiſed you is come, even the Holy Spirit, whom my Father ſhall ſend you on my account, ſhall inſtruct you more fully, recalling to your remembrance what you have forgotten, explaining what is yet obſcure, and

ſupplying what is further neceſſary to be taught you, and to be underſtood by you. In the mean time I take my leave of you, and my bleſſing I leave with you; not formally, and after the common faſhion of the world, but affectionately and ſincerely, retaining a careful remembrance of you, and with an earneſt deſire and intention of returning again ſpeedily to you. Wherefore, be not overmuch grieved for me and my departure, nor fearful of what may then befal yourſelves: I go away from you, but it is with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have now told you theſe things before they come to paſs, that when ye ſee them happen, your faith in me, and your expectation of the performance of all my promiſes, may be confirmed and ſtrengthened; the time will not allow me to ſay much more to you at preſent; my end draweth near; the ruler of this world, the prince of the power of darkneſs, is at this inſtant employing all his wicked inſtruments to apprehend and deſtroy me: not that either the power of the Devil, or the malice of man, can at all prevail over me, but becauſe the time of my ſuffering, according to the appointment of Divine Wiſdom, is arrived; and that I may demonſtrate to the world my love and obedience to my Father, I willingly ſubmit myſelf to be put to death by the hands of ſinful and cruel men. Riſe up, let us be going, that I may enter on my ſufferings. See John, chap. xiv. ver. 1, to the end.</p>
               <p>THUS having ſpoken, they finiſhed the paſſover with ſinging a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. The hymn which they ſung was probably that which the Jews call the <hi>Hallem,</hi> or great hymn, which conſiſted of the hundred and thirteenth and five ſubſequent Pſalms; part of which was ſung at the beginning of the ſolemnity, and part at the end.</p>
               <p>WHEN they arrived at the place which was to be the ſcene of his ſufferings, he deſired them to fortify themſelves by prayer, and forewarned them of the terrible effects his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings would have upon them; they would make them all ſtumble that very night, agreeable to the prophecy of Zechariah: <hi>I will ſmile the ſhepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> Therefore, he not only mentioned his own reſurrection, but told them they ſhould ſee him in Galilee, after he was riſen from the dead, in order to ſtrengthen their faith.</p>
               <p>PETER, on our bleſſed Saviour's mentioning the offence that his diſciples would take at his ſufferings, recollected what had been ſaid to him in particular, before they left the houſe. Grieving therefore afreſh, to find his Maſter entertain ſuch thoughts of him, and being now armed with a ſword, the vehemence of his temper urged him to boaſt a ſecond time of his courageous and cloſe attachment to his Maſter: <hi>Though all men,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhould be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended.</hi> But JESUS, knowing that confidence and ſecurity are great enemies to virtue, thought proper to forewarn him againſt his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and told him, that the cock ſhould not crow before he had denied him. Peter, however, ſtill continued to repeat his confidence, I will die with thee, but never deny thee. The diſciples all joined with Peter in profeſſing their fixed reſolution of ſuffering death, rather than they would deny their Maſter; but the event fully confirmed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of our Saviour. From whence we may learn, how ignorant men are of themſelves.</p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord, not willing to loſe one ſingle moment of the ſhort time of his miniſtry that yet remained, continued to inſtruct his diſciples in the great truths he came into the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:029927_0237_0FE338B56374ACE8"/>
world to explain; and from the vines, which were growing round him on the Mount of Olives, he began his excellent diſcourſe, with the parable of the vine, which we ſhall endeavour to explain in the following manner.</p>
               <p>HITHERTO, ſaid the compaſſionate Redeemer of mankind, the Jewiſh church and nation have been the peculiar care of Providence; as a choice and a goodly vine, likely to bring forth much fruit, is the eſpecial care of the huſbandmen: but from henceforth, my church, my diſciples, and the profeſſors of my religion, of whatſoever country or nation they be, ſhall become the people of God, and the peculiar care of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will be to them as the root and ſtock of a vine, of which my Father is the huſbandman and vine-dreſſer, and they are the branches.</p>
               <p>AS the ſkilful vine-dreſſer, in the management of a choice vine, cuts off all barren and ſuperfluous branches, that they may not burden nor exhauſt the tree and prunes, and dreſſes the fruitful branches, that they may grow continually, and bear more fruit: ſo in the government of my church, all uſeleſs, wicked, and incorrigible members, my Father, by his juſt judgment, cuts off and deſtroys; but thoſe who are ſincerely pious and good, he, by the various and merciful diſpenſations of his providence towards them, tries, purifies, and amends, that they may daily improve and be more and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in all good works. Now ye, my apoſtles, are ſuch members as theſe, being purified in heart and mind, and prepared for every good work, by your lively faith in me, and ſincere reſolutions to obey my commands. Continue ſteadfaſtly in this ſtate, and then you may be ſure of deriving all ſpiritual bleſſings from me, as the branches receive ſap and nouriſhment from the vine: but as a branch, without continuing in the vine, cannot bear any fruit, but preſently dries up and periſhes; ſo ye, unleſs ye continue ſteadfaſt in your communion with me, by a lively faith and ſincere obedience, ſo as to receive grace and ſpiritual bleſſings, can never bring forth any good fruit of true holineſs and right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eouſneſs, but will fall into vanity, ſuperſtition, and wickedneſs, and will utterly periſh at laſt. I ſay, I am, as it were, the root and ſtock of the vine, whereof ye are the branches: he that continues to adhere to me, by conſtant faith in me, by imitating my example, and by obeying my commands, ſhall bring forth much fruit, of true virtue and holineſs, unto everlaſting life; even as a branch which continues to grow in a vine, and receives ſap and nouriſhment from it: but he that does not continue his relation to me in this manner, is a falſe and uſeleſs profeſſor of my religion, and ſhall be caſt out from me, and periſh for ever; even as a fruitleſs branch is cut off from the vine, and left to whither and dry, and is at laſt burnt in the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if ye continue in me, by believing my words, and holding faſt what ye believe, and obeying and practiſing it, no power, or malice, either of men or of devils, ſhall be able to hurt you, or oppoſe your doctrines: for though I be abſent from you in the body, yet I will hear your prayers, and my Father himſelf alſo will hear you; and whatſoever ye ſhall aſk, for the glory of the Almighty, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of my true religion in the world, ſhall certainly be granted you: but, above all things, carefully remember to demonſtrate your continuance in me, by abounding in all good works of holineſs, righteouſneſs, and charity. This is the honour which my Father deſires and expects from you, even as it is the glory and deſire of a vine-dreſſer, that his vine ſhould bring forth much fruit; and this is the honour that I myſelf expect from you, that ye ſhould prove yourſelves to be really and indeed my diſciples, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating my example, and obeying my commands: this ye are bound to do, not only in duty, but in gratitude alſo; for as my Father hath loved me, ſo have I alſo loved you, and ye in like manner ought to love me again, that you may continue to be loved by me: but the way to expreſs your love towards me, and to continue to be loved by me, is to keep my commandments; even as I, by keeping my Father's commandments, have expreſſed my love towards him, and continue to be loved by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:029927_0238_0FE338B711BFE648"/>I have ſpoken to you theſe things before my departure, that the comfort ye have taken in my preſence, may be continued in my abſence, and even increaſed at the coming of the Holy Spirit, as it will be upon this condition, which I have ſo often repeated to you, that you keep my commandments: and the principal of theſe commandments is, that ye love one another, not after the common faſhion of the world, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I have loved you; nor can you be ignorant what ſort of love that is, when I tell you that I am now going to lay down my life for you: this is the higheſt inſtance, in which it is poſſible for man to expreſs his love towards his greateſt friends and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and this I am now going to do for you, and for all mankind: I do not conſider you as my benefactors, but as my friends, upon this eaſy condition only, that ye keep my commandments. I might, indeed, juſtly call you ſervants, conſidering the infinite diſtance between me and you, and the obligation ye have to obey my commandments: but I have not treated you as ſervants, who are not admitted into their maſter's councils, but as friends, revealing to you with all freedom and plainneſs, the whole will of my Father.</p>
               <p>I ſay, I have behaved myſelf to you, as to the neareſt friends; not that you firſt obliged me, or did any acts of kindneſs for me, but I have freely, and of my own good pleaſure, choſen you to be my apoſtles, and the preachers of my goſpel, that you may go and declare the will of God to the world, and bring forth much and laſting fruit, in the converſion of men to the knowledge of the truth, and to the profeſſion and practice of true religion and virtue. In the performance of this work, whatſoever ye ſhall aſk of my Father in my name, it ſhall certainly be granted you, in order to enable you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it effectually, and with full ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>IN all theſe things which I have ſpoken unto you, concerning the greatneſs of my love towards you, in chooſing you to be my apoſtles, in revealing unto you the whole will of my Father, and in laying down my life for you; I have urged and inculcated upon you this reaſon chiefly, as I at firſt told you, that ye may learn, after my example, to <hi>love one another.</hi> The world, indeed, you muſt expect, will hate and perſecute you upon my account; but this you ought not to be ſurpriſed or terrified at, knowing that I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have met with the ſame treatment before you.</p>
               <p>BUT the reaſon why the generality of the world have oppoſed and perſecuted me, is becauſe my doctrine is inconſiſtent with their luſts and paſſions, their covetouſneſs and unjuſt ambition; and, for the ſame reaſon, there is no doubt but they will oppoſe and perſecute you alſo. If ye were of the ſpirit of the world, flattering men in their ſins, and teaching doctrines conſiſtent with their luſts and paſſions, the world, doubtleſs, would love and honour you: but ſince I have choſen you out of the world, to reprove its vices, and to preach the neceſſity of reformation, and of men amending their lives, if the world hate and perſecute you, wonder not.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, be not ſurpriſed, when ye meet with oppoſition; nor think to find better treatment in the world, than I myſelf have done. Remember what I have already told you, that the diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor is he that is ſent, greater than he that ſent him. If men had generally and readily embraced my doctrine, you might, indeed, have had ſome reaſon to expect, that they would willingly have received yours alſo: but ſince I myſelf have ſuffered great indignities and perſecutions from wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, from obſtinate and incorrigible men, only for oppoſing their vices, it is highly reaſonable that you ſhould expect to undergo the like treatment upon the like account: in all which ſufferings you will moreover have this comfortable conſideration to ſupport

you, that the juſtice of your own cauſe, and the injuſtice of your perſecutors, will by that very means moſt evidently appear: ſeeing ye are perſecuted only for profeſſing and preaching in my name, the doctrine of true religion and virtue; and they perſecute you only, becauſe they know not God, and out of mere malice will not bear to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his command. Indeed, had not I appeared to the world with all poſſible demonſtrations of authority and truth, teaching men, a moſt holy and undeniable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſufficient to reform their manners and amend their lives, and moreover demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating my divine commiſſion, by ſuch proofs as ought to ſatisfy and convince the moſt doubting and ſuſpicious minds; they might have had ſome plea and excuſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for their unbelief; but now, ſince all reaſonable evidence has been offered them, and proper methods uſed for their converſion and ſalvation, and yet they wilfully and obſtinately reject theſe means of grace, it is plain they have no excuſe for their ſin; but they oppoſe and perſecute you only becauſe they will not forſake their worldly luſts, and out of mere malice will not bear to be inſtructed in the commands of the Almighty: ſo that they who oppoſe and perſecute you, as they have before perſecuted me, ſhew plainly that they are haters of God, and of his moſt holy commandments; which is, as I have already told you, a plain evidence of the injuſtice of your perſecutors, and of the juſtice of your own caſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay, if I had not done ſuch works amongſt them as no man ever did, they might, indeed, have had ſome appearance of excuſe for their ſin: but now, having ſeen abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant proofs of my authority, and undeniable evidence of the truth, of my doctrine, and yet wilfully and obſtinately perſiſting to oppoſe it, becauſe inconſiſtent with their luſts; it is plain that their diſhonouring me, is a diſhonour done to God himſelf, and a direct contempt of his commands; ſo that they are utterly inexcuſable. But it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when men have given themſelves wholly up to be governed by worldly affections, paſſions, and vices, they ſhould act contrary to all the reaſon and evidence in the world: for this is but the natural conſequence of obſtinate and habitual wickedneſs; and hereby is only fulfilled in me, what holy Daivd long ſince prophetically complained of, that they hated him without a cauſe.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that wicked and incorrigible men will make againſt my doctrine, there will not be wanting powerful promoters of it, who ſhall effectually overcome all oppoſition; for the comforter, whom I ſaid I will ſend you from heaven, even that <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> which cometh forth, and is ſent from the Father, ſhall, when he cometh, with wonderful efficacy bear teſtimony to the truth of my doctrine, and cauſe it to ſpread through the world with incredible ſucceſs; nay, and ye yourſelves alſo, though now ſo weak, fearful, and doubting, ſhall then very powerfully bear teſtimony to the truth of all the things whereof ye have been eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from the beginnig, having been all along preſent with me.</p>
               <p>I have thus warned you beforehand, of the oppoſition and perſecution ye muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with in the world, that when it cometh ye may not be ſurpriſed and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſo as to be diſcouraged thereby from perſiſting in the performance of your duty. Ye muſt expect particularly, that the chief prieſts and rulers of the Jews, men of great hypocriſy and ſuperſtition, zealous for their ceremonies and ritual traditions, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to know and obey the will of Omnipotence in matters of great and eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and invincibly prejudiced againſt the ſpiritual holineſs and purity of my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; theſe, I ſay, you muſt expect will excommunicate you as apoſtates, and caſt you out of all their ſocieties, as the vileſt of malefactors; nay, to ſuch an abſurd height of malice will their ſuperſtition carry them, that they will even fancy they promote

the ſervice of God, and the cauſe of religion, when they moſt barbarouſtly murder and deſtroy you: but I have warned you of all this beforehand, that ye may prepare and fortify yourſelves againſt it, that ye may remember I fortold it to you, and that your faith in me may thereby be ſtrengthened, when it cometh to paſs.</p>
               <p>INDEED, I did not tell you particularly of theſe things at the beginning, when you firſt followed me and became my diſciples, becauſe then I was to continue with you in perſon, and ſupport you in all things by my immediate preſence: but now, being about to leave you, I think it neceſſary to acquaint you what things are likely to come upon you after my departure, and alſo what comfort you may expect to ſupport you under them, at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>I muſt now mention the melancholy part, namely, that I am going from you, and that great temptations will befall you in my abſence; this, indeed, ye readily apprehend, and ſuffer your hearts to be overwhelmed with grief at the thoughts of it: but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable part of my diſcourſe, namely, that my departure is only in order to return to him that ſent me, and that I will ſoon after ſend you the Holy Spirit, and the other advantages that will thence reſult to you, are neither conſidered nor are you ſolicitous about them. Nevertheleſs, if ye will liſten, I will plainly tell you the truth: ye are ſo far from having reaſon to be dejected at the thoughts of my departure, that on the contrary, it is really profitable and expedient for you, that I ſhould now depart; for ſuch is the order and diſpenſation of Providence towards you, and the appointment of my Father's eternal and all-wiſe council, that before I go and take poſſeſſion of my kingdom, the comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, cannot be ſent unto you; but when I am departed from you, and have all power in heaven and earth committed unto me, then I will ſend him unto you: and when he cometh he ſhall abundantly ſupport and comfort you under all your troubles; ſhall powerfully plead your cauſe againſt your adverſaries; and ſhall, with wonderful efficacy, cauſe the doctrine of the goſpel to ſpread and prevail in the world againſt all oppoſition: he ſhall particularly, and in a moſt extraordinary and convincing manner, make the world ſenſible of the greatneſs and heinouſneſs of a ſin of which they were not aware; of the righteouſneſs and juſtice of a diſpenſation they did not underſtand, and of the execution of a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgment they did not expect. Firſt, by wonderfully atteſting and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of my doctrine, by the gift of tongues, and other wonderful ſigns, he ſhall convince the world of the greatneſs and heinouſneſs of their ſins, in diſbelieving and rejecting me. Secondly, by demonſtrating, that my departure out of the world, was not periſhing and dying, but only a returning to my Father in order to be inveſted with all power both in heaven and earth, he ſhall convince the world of the righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice of my cauſe, and of the excellency of that diſpenſation which I preached and declared to mankind. Laſtly, he ſhall convince men of my power and authority to execute judgment upon mine enemies, for eſtabliſhment of my kingdom upon earth, by mightily deſtroying the power of the Devil, and the dominion of ſin, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the doctrine of true religion in the world, with wonderful efficacy and ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>MANY other things are yet hereafter to be done in relation to the ſettling and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of my church, which, if it were proper, I would now acquaint you with, but ye are not yet prepared to underſtand and receive them.

by your miniſtry; for the Spirit is not to begin any new work, or to found any new doctrine of himſelf: but as I have taught and will teach you only in my Father's name, ſo the Spirit ſhall inſtruct you only in mine and my Father's will, and in things neceſſary to promote and carry on the ſame deſign. Every thing that he does ſhall be only in order to manifeſt my glory, and eſtabliſh my religion in the world; even as every thing that I have done, has been only to manifeſt my Father's glory, and reveal his will to mankind: for as all that I have taught is only what I received from my Father, ſo all that the Spirit ſhall teach you, is only what he receives from me. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I ſay, the Spirit ſhall teach you, is only what he receives from me; for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my Father, I call receiving from me, and teaching his will, is teaching mine; ſeeing all things that the Father hath, are common to me, and all power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is committed to me by him.</p>
               <p>BE careful now to remember what matter for comfort I have given you, and ſupport yourſelves with it, under the approaching diſtreſs. It is now, indeed, but a very little while before I ſhall be taken away from you; nevertheleſs, let not this cauſe you to deſpair: for, after I am departed, it will be alſo but a little while before I appear to you again; inaſmuch as my being taken away from you, is not periſhing, but only returning to my Father. At theſe laſt words of JESUS, the diſciples were greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed and troubled, not underſtanding his true meaning, that in a very ſhort time he ſhould be taken from them by death; and that, after having overcome death by a glorious reſurrection, he would appear to them again before his aſcenſion into heaven. Not underſtanding this, they inquired, one of another, what can he mean by telling us, that in a very little time he ſhall be taken out of our ſight; and that in a very little time more, we ſhall ſee him again, and this becauſe he goeth to the Father? The meaning of all this we cannot underſtand.</p>

               <p>HOWEVER, though I ſhall return to you again, and your hearts will thereupon be filled with inexpreſſible joy, and which never ſhall be taken from you any more; yet there will be no neceſſity that I ſhould then continue long with you in perſon, to inſtruct you upon every occaſion, as I have now done with my own mouth: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Holy Spirit will be ſent to inſtruct you in all things neceſſary, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf alſo will hear your petitions and be ready to grant you whatſoever you ſhall deſire of him in my name, as being my diſciples.

                  </gap> have told you, at preſent, imperfect and obſcurely, according as your capacities are able to bear them; but the time is coming, when your prejudices being removed, I will ſpeak to you with more openneſs, freedom and plainneſs the whole will of my Father, concerning the nature and eſtabliſhment of my kingdom and what things ye ought to pray unto him for, and in what manner.</p>
               <p>YE ſhall, at that time, with firm aſſurance pray to my Father in my name, for what ye want; and I need not tell you, that I will intercede with the Father on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: for beſides the love he has for me, and the power and authority my prayers have with him, he has moreover, of himſelf, a great love for you, and a ready diſpoſition to grant your prayers, becauſe ye are become grateful and acceptable to him, by your love towards me, which ye have ſhewn, in embracing willingly that holy doctrine which I have revealed to you from him.</p>
               <p>NOW to conclude: the ſum of what I have told you, is briefly and plainly this: I came down from heaven from God my Father, and have lived upon earth in the ſtate of frail and mortal man, that I might reveal to mankind the will of my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the way to attain eternal life and happineſs: and now having finiſhed this great work, I am about to leave this world, and return again to my Father from whence I at firſt came. Theſe laſt words of JESUS, being ſomewhat more plain and expreſs, than any he had before ſpoken, ſo that now the diſciples clearly perceived that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he had ſo often mentioned, was no other than his actual going out of this world, they replied, Now, Lord thou ſpeakeſt plainly, and without any figure; ſo that we apprehend fully what thou means; And now that our curioſity is ſatisfied, thou haſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe greatly comfirmed our faith; having given us a certain token, whereby we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that thou knows all things, even the hearts and ſecret thoughts of men, ſince thou has anſwered us a queſtion which gave us great perplexity, and were deſirous to aſk thy opinion of, but were afraid: but now we are convinced, that thou art endued with a truly divine power and did indeed come from God. To which JESUS anſwered, and do you now at length firmly believe in me? Are you reſolved to continue ſteadfaſt in this faith? Do you think yourſelves able to perſevere immovably in the poſſeſſion of it? Be not confident of your own ſtrength but pray that ye may be delivered from temptation in time of diſtreſs, ſuch as will come upon you much ſooner than ye expect: for I tell you, that ye will all of you within a few hours utterly forſake me, and fly, in hopes to ſecure yourſelves, leaving me alone; and yet I ſhould not ſtay alone ſince my Father is with me, who is more than all: I have therefore acquainted you with theſe things beforehand, that your minds may be furniſhed with ſufficient matter of comfort and ſtrength to bear up under all temptations, from the conſideration of my having foretold both what diſtreſſes will befall you, and how ye ſhall terminate your victory over all your enemies! <hi>Theſe things I have ſpoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye ſhall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world,</hi> John xvi.33.</p>
               <p>THUS having finiſhed his diſcourſe, JESUS lift up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, ſaying, O Almighty Father! now the time of my ſufferings, for which I was ſent into the world, is arrived; I entreat thee ſupport me under it, and make me triumph over death, by a
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029927_0243_0FE338C4A3A1F2C0"/>
glorious reſurrection and aſcenſion into heaven; that by this means the glory may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to thee; and cauſe thy will to be believed and obeyed through all the world, to the ſalvation of mankind; according to the full intent of that office and power with which thou didſt originally inveſt me to receive all fitly diſpoſed perſons into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of ſalvation, and to aſſiſt and preſerve them in it unto everlaſting happineſs: the condition of this covenant is, that they firmly believe and obey thee, as the only true God, and JESUS CHRIST, as the true Meſſiah, whom thou haſt ſent. In order to the bringing about this great deſign of ſalvation, I have declared thy will to mankind; I have publiſhed thy precepts, and diſcharged the great miſſion entruſted to me; I have preached the doctrine of repentance to ſalvation, and have finiſhed the work which thou ſenteſt me to do, to the glory of thy name upon earth; and now to complete the great deſign, do thou, O Almighty Father! likewiſe glorify me with thine own ſelf; ſupport me under my ſufferings; let me prevail and triumph over death, by a glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and exalt me again to the ſame glory in heaven which I had with thee before the creation of the univerſe. I have manifeſted thy will to my diſciples, the men that thou gaveſt me out of the world, and to all ſuch as were fitted and diſpoſed to receive it; to ſuch as by a pious habit, and teachable diſpoſition. were prepared to embrace whatever doctrine ſhould appear to come from thee. To thoſe perſons thou didſt in thine infinite wiſdom appoint, that thy truth ſhould be made known, and not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and vicious world: therefore, to them I have revealed the myſteries of thy kingdom, the precepts of thy goſpel, and the doctrine of thy ſalvation; and this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they have willingly embraced ſteadfaſtly, adhered to, and ſincerely obeyed; as they are fully ſatisfied and convinced, that what I taught them as from thee, was really a divine doctrine taught by thine immediate appointment and command; and that I did not preach any human invention or inſtitution of men, but was really ſent by thy divine authority and commiſſion. For theſe perſons, therefore I now pray, that as thou haſt begun the work of their ſalvation by my preaching and revealing to them thy will, while I have been preſent with them here upon earth; ſo alſo that thou wouldeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them when I am departed from this world, and complete the work of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by my reſurrection and aſcenſion into heaven after my death. I do not pray for the unbelieving impenitent world, but for thoſe who have embraced that moſt holy doctrine, which thou haſt taught them through me by my preaching; for thoſe who have glorified and will glorify my name by their miniſtry, and who conſequently are to be eſteemed as thine own, in common with me. I am now about to leave the world in order to return to thee, but theſe my diſciples, who continue after me, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thy divine protection, when I am gone; endue them with powers to perſevere in preaching and practiſing the truth, and to deliver the ſame holy doctrines which I have given to them, that ſo they may remain inſeparably united to me, as I am to thee: ſo long as I have been with them, in the world, I have watched over them, and kept them from falling away, both by example, preaching, and continual admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the power and authority which thou didſt commit to me; nor has one of my apoſtles miſcarried under my care, except that perſidious traitor who, as the Scripture foretold, has ungratefully conſpired with my enemies to deſtroy me, and will periſh according to his deſerts. While I have continued with my diſciples, I have watched over them and preſerved them under mine own eye: but now, as I am going to leave the world I beſeech thee to keep and aſſiſt them by thy good Spirit; and let the expectation of their continuing under thy ſpecial care and protection, be their comfort and ſupport in my abſence. The world, indeed, will perſecute and hate them on this account, as my doctrine is repugnant to the luſts and affections, the paſſions,

               <p>ACCORDING to the example of purity which I have ſet before them, they are of a temper and ſpirit very different from the current affections and common diſpoſitions of the world. Do thou preſerve and increaſe in them that moderation and candour of mind; cauſe them to be thoroughly affected and impreſſed with that true doctrine ſo frequently recommended to them from my mouth, ſo as to expreſs it viſibly in their lives and practice, and to promote it zealouſly in their preaching, that they may become worthy and ſucceſsful miniſters of my goſpel, both by word and good example.</p>
               <p>AS thou haſt ſent me into the world to reveal thy will to mankind, ſo ſend I theſe my apoſtles to continue preaching the ſame doctrine begun by me; and the principal deſign of my exemplary life, conſtant teaching, and now voluntarily offering myſelf to death for it, is to ſanctify and enable them to preach with ſucceſs and efficacy for the ſalvation of me. Neither pray I for theſe my apoſtles only, but for all others, who ſhall, by their preaching and practice, promote thy true religion; and being converted from the world, may, by their ſincere endeavours, go on to reform others, convincing the world of the excellency of their religion, and conſequently enforcing men to acknowledge the truth and divine authority thereof: for promoting which great end, I have communicated to my apoſtles the ſame power and authority of doing mighty works for the conformation of their doctrine, and the evidence of thy truth, as thou didſt communicate to me; that ſo I working in them as thou haſt done in me, and thus confirming with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ALMIGHTY and Holy Father, all thoſe whom thou haſt thus given me, who have wiſely embraced my doctrine, and ſincerely obeyed it, I deſire that thou wouldeſt make them partakers of the ſame happineſs with myſelf, and exalt them to behold the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible glory wherewith thou didſt originally inveſt me in thy eternal love, before the foundation of the world. The generality of mortals, O righteous Father! the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and ambitious, the crafty and deſigning men of this world have not known thee, nor been willing to embrace and obey the revelation of thy will; but I have known thy will, and have made it known to my diſciples, men of ſimplicity and honeſty; and they have embraced and obeyed it: and I will continually make it known to them more and more, that they may grow up and improve in faith, in holineſs, and in all good works, ſo as finally to arrive, and cauſe others to arrive, at that eternal happineſs, which is the effect of thy infinite love and mercy towards me and them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE prayer of our great Interceſſor being ended, he, with his diſciples, came down from the Mount of Olives into the field below, called Gathſemane, through which the brook Cedron ran, and in it, on the other ſide of the brook, was a garden, called the garden of Gethſemane. Here he deſired his diſciples to ſit down, perhaps at the garden-door within, till he ſhould retire to pray, taking with him, Peter, James, and John, thoſe three ſelect diſciples whom he had before choſen to be witneſſes of his transfiguration, and now to be eye-witneſſes of his paſſion, leaving the other diſciples it the garden-door, to watch the approach of Judas and his band. The ſufferings he was on the point of undergoing were ſo great, that the very proſpect of them terrified him, and made him expreſs himſelf in this doleful exclamation, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</hi> On this great occaſion he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoſe grievous ſorrows in his ſoul, by which, as well as by dying on the croſs, he became a ſin-offering, and accompliſhed the redemption of mankind, He now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from about a ſtone's caſt, and his human nature being now overburdened beyond meaſure he found it neceſſary to retire and pray, that if it was poſſible, or conſiſtent with the ſalvation of the world, he might be delivered from the ſufferings which were then lying on him: it was not the fear of dying on the croſs which made him ſpeak or pray in ſuch a manner: to ſuppoſe this, would infinitly degrade his character make his ſufferings as terrible as poſſible, and clothe them with all the aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of diſtreſs: yet the bleſſed JESUS, whoſe human nature was ſtrengthened by being connected with the divine, could not ſhrink at the proſpect of ſufferings, or betray a weakneſs which many of his followers, who, though mere men, were ſtrangers to; having encountered more terrible deaths without the leaſt emotions. He addreſſes his Divine Father with a ſigh of fervent wiſhes, that the cup might if poſſible, be removed from him: in the Greek, it is, 'O that thou wouldſt remove this cup from me.' And having firſt kneeled and prayed, he fell proſtrate on his face, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his addreſs with due expreſſions of reſignation, adding immediately, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Having prayed, he returned to his diſciples, and finding them aſleep, he ſaid to Peter. <hi>Simon, ſleepeſt thou? Couldeſt not thou watch one hour?</hi> Canſt thou ſo ſoon forget thy Maſter? Thou who ſo lately boaſted of thy courage and conſtancy in my ſervice.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, in his greateſt diſtreſs, he never loſt ſight of that kind concern he had for his diſciples: <hi>Watch ye,</hi> he ſays, <hi>and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation.</hi> Neither was he on thoſe extraordinary occaſions, in the leaſt moved with the offences which they had committed through frailty and human weakneſs: on the contrary, was always willing to make excuſes for them; alledging in their defence, <hi>that the ſpirit truly was ready, but the fleſh was weak.</hi> It ſeems from theſe particulars, that he ſpent ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time in his addreſſes, becauſe the diſciples fell aſleep in his abſence, and he himſelf retired again to pray; for the ſorrows of our Lord continuing to increaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, affected him to ſuch a degree, that he retired a ſecond time, and prayed to the ſame purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>O my Father, if this cup may not paſs away from me, except I

At length he obtained relief, being heard on account of his perfect and entire ſubmiſſion to the will of his heavenly Father: <hi>And when he roſe up from prayer, and was come to his diſciples, be found them ſleeping for ſorrow.</hi> This circumſtance ſhews how much the diſciples were affected with their Maſter's ſufferings: the ſenſations of grief which they felt on ſeeing his unſpeakable diſtreſs, ſo overpowered them, that they ſunk into ſleep. Our bleſſed Saviour for the laſt time came to his diſciples, and ſeeing them aſleep, he ſaid, <hi>Sleep on now, and take your reſt: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

               <p>THE owner of the garden, it ſeems where he now was, had been our Lord's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, perhaps his diſciple, who believing on him, conſidered himſelf as highly honoured in JESUS's frequenting it, for the ſake of retirement or devotion, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had given him the free uſe of it whenever he pleaſed. We are told that Judas knew the place; for <hi>Jeſus oftimes reſorted thither, with his diſciples.</hi> The chief prieſts and elders being informed by Judas, that the proper time for apprehending JESUS was now come, ſent a band of ſoldiers with him, and ſervants carrying lanterns and torches, to ſhew them the way; becauſe, though it was always full moon at the poſſover, the ſky might be dark with clouds, and the place wither they were going was ſhaded with trees: at the ſame time, a deputation of their number accompanied the band, to ſee that every one did his duty. Judas having thus received a band of men and officers from the chief prieſts and Phariſees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches, and weapons; for they were exceeding anxious to ſecure and get him into their hands, and the ſoldiers having perhaps never ſeen JESUS before, found it neceſſary that Judas ſhould diſtinguiſh him, and point him out to them by ſome particular ſign. St. Luke ſeems to ſay, that Judas went before them at a little diſtance, to prepare them for the readier execution of their office, by kiſſing his Maſter, the token they had agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they might not miſtake him and ſeize a wrong perſon: <hi>And he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jeſus to kiſs him.</hi> Nor can the account which St. John has given us, be underſtood on any other ſuppoſition, who ſays, that after Judas was come up with the ſoldiers, JESUS went out of the garden, and aſked them, who it was they were ſeeking? To which they replied <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> It therefore follows, that they were at a loſs to know him, which they could not have been, had they ſeen Judas kiſs him: the kiſs, therefore, muſt have been given in the garden before the band came up; nor is their agreement about the ſign inconſiſtent with this ſuppoſition; becauſe that confuſion which commonly attends the commiſſion

of an evil action, might prevent Judas from giving the ſign at the proper ſeaſon. He went before the ſoldiers, on pretence that he would lead them to the place, and ſhew them the man by kiſſing him: however, to conceal his villainy from his Maſter and the diſciples, he walked haſtily, and without waiting for the band, went up directly and ſaluted him; feigning, perhaps, to apprize him of his danger. But JESUS did not fail to convince him that he knew the meaning and intent of his ſalutation, ſaying, <hi>Betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</hi> Judas certainly concealed his treachery ſo well, that Peter did not ſuſpect him, as it is probable, he would have ſtruck at him rather than at Malchus, the high-prieſt's ſervant, if he had.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord's appointed time for ſuffering being now come, he did not, as formerly, avoid his enemies; but, on the contrary, on their telling him they faught JESUS of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he replied, <hi>I am he:</hi> thereby inſinuating to them, that he was willing to put himſelf into their hands: at the ſame time to ſhew them that they could not apprehend him without this own conſent, he in an extraordinary manner, exerted his divine power, he made the whole band fall back, and threw them to the ground: <hi>Jeſus, therefore, knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth, and ſaid unto them, Whom ſeek ye? They anſwered him, Jeſus of Nazareth. Jeſus ſaith unto them, I am he. And Judas alſo, which betrayed him, ſtood with them. As ſoon then as he had ſaid unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</hi> But the ſoldiers and the Jews imagining, perhaps, that they had been thrown down by ſome daemon or evil ſpirit, with whom the Jews ſaid he was in confederacy, advanced towards him a ſecond time: <hi>Then aſked he them again, Whom ſeek ye? And they ſaid, Jeſus of Nazareth. Jeſus anſwered, I have told you, that I am he;</hi> expreſſing again his willingneſs to fall into their hands: <hi>If therefore ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way.</hi> If your buſineſs be with me alone, ſuffer my diſciples to paſs: for the party had ſurrounded them alſo. He ſeems to have made this requeſt to the ſoldiers, <hi>that the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake, Of them which thou gaveſt me have I loſt none.</hi> For as he always proportions the trials of his people to their ſtrength; ſo here he took care that the diſciples ſhould eſcape the ſtorm, which none but himſelf could bear.</p>
               <p>SOME of the ſoldiers, more daring than the reſt, at length rudely caught JESUS, and bound him: upon which Peter drew his ſword, and ſmote off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> Matt. xxvi. 53, 54.</p>
               <p>LEGION was a Roman military term, being the name which they gave to a body of five or ſix thouſand men: wherefore, in regard that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

could ſummon to his aſſiſtance; more than twelve legions, not of ſoldiers, but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. He yet was tenderly inclined to prevent any bad conſequences, which might have flowed from Peter's raſhneſs, by healing the ſervant, and adding, in his rebuke to him, a declaration of his willingneſs to ſuffer: <hi>The cup which my Father has given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Lord's healing the ear of Malchus, by touching it, ſeems to imply, that he created a new one in the place of that which was cut off; but though he performed the cure ſome other way, it equally demonſtrates both his goodneſs and his power. No wound or diſtemper was incurable in the hand of JESUS; neither was any injury ſo great that he could not forgive. It ſeems ſomewhat ſurpriſing that this evident miracle did not make an impreſſion upon the chief prieſts, eſpecially as our Lord put them in mind, at the ſame time, of his other miracles; for having firſt ſaid, <hi>Suffer ye thus far; and he touched his ear, and healed him;</hi> he added, <hi>Be ye come out, as againſt a thief, with ſwords and ſtaves? When I was daily with you in the temple, ye ſtretched forth no hands againſt me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs.</hi> Luke xxii.51, 52, 53. They had kept at a diſtance during the attack, but drew near, when they underſtood that JESUS, was in their power; for they were proof againſt all conviction, being obſtinately bent on putting him to death. And the diſciples, when they ſaw their Maſter in the hands of his enemies, forſook him and fled, according to his prediction; notwithſtanding they might have followed him without any danger, as the prieſts had no deſign againſt them: <hi>Then all the diſciples forſook him, and fled. Then the band, and the captain and officers of the Jews, took Jeſus, and bound him.</hi> But it was not the cord which held him; his immenſe charity was by far a ſtronger band: he could, with more eaſe than Sampſon, have broken thoſe weak ties, and exerted his divinity in a more wonderful manner; he could have ſtricken them all dead, with as much eaſe as he had before thrown them on the ground: but he patiently ſubmitted to this, as to every other indignity which they pleaſed to offer him; ſo meek was he under the greateſt injuries. Having thus ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, they led him away: <hi>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth caſt about his naked body; and the young man laid hold on him: and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</hi> This, perhaps, was the proprietor of the garden; who, being awakened with the noiſe, came out with the linen cloth, in which he had been lying, caſt around his naked body; and forgetting the dreſs he was in, and having a reſpect for JESUS, followed him.</p>
               <p>HE was firſt led to Annas, father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high-prieſt that year. Annas having himſelf diſcharged the office of high-prieſt, was conſequently a perſon of diſtinguiſhed character, which, together with his relation to the high-prieſt, made him worthy of the reſpect they now paid him: but he refuſed ſingly to meddle in the affair; they, therefore, carried JESUS to Caiaphas himſelf, at whoſe palace the chief prieſts, elders, and Scribes were aſſembled, having ſtaid there all night to ſee the iſſue of their ſtratagem. This Caiaphas was he that adviſed the council to put JESUS to death, even admitting he was innocent, for the ſafety of the whole Jewiſh nation. He was advanced to the ſacerdotal dignity by Valerius Gratus, Pilate's predeceſſor, and was diveſted of it by Vitellius, governor of Syria, after he had depoſed Pilate from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatorſhip; and therefore ſeems to have enjoyed it during the whole courſe of Pilate's government.</p>

                  <p>Peter thrice denies his having any Knowledge of <hi>JESUS</hi>; but on his <hi>LORD's</hi> turning and looking on him, he repenteth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE trial of our bleſſed Lord in the high-prieſt's palace, and Peter's denying him, being co-temporary events, might be repeated by the evangelical hiſtorians accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their pleaſure. The evangeliſts Matthew and Mark deſcribe the trial firſt, as it is the principal fact; but Luke after the denials of Peter. John has preſerved the natural order here; for he begins with the firſt denial, becauſe it happened immediately after Peter entered the palace, then gives the hiſtory of the trial as the principal fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with the ſubſequent denials. But though this be the natural order, we ſhall view the denials together, previous to the trial, in order to form a better idea of them.</p>
               <p>WHEN JESUS was apprehended, the apoſtles, in great conſternation, forſook him, and fled, according to the prediction concerning them: ſome of them, however, recovering out of the panic that had ſeized them, followed the band at a diſtance, to ſee what the iſſue would be. Of this number was Peter, and another diſciple, whom John has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, without giving his name, and who, therefore, is ſuppoſed to have been John himſelf. This diſciple being acquainted at the high-prieſt's, got admittance for himſelf firſt, and ſoon after for Peter, who had come with him: <hi>And Simon Peter followed Jeſus, and ſo did another diſciple: that diſciple was known unto the high-prieſt, and went in with Jeſus into the palace of the high-prieſt. But Peter ſtood at the door without. Then went out that other diſciple, and ſpake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. And when they had kindled a fire in the midſt of the hall, and were ſet down together, Peter ſat down among them.</hi> The maid ſervant who kept the door concluding Peter to be a diſciple alſo, followed after him to the fire, and looking earneſtly at him, charged him with the ſuppoſed crime: <hi>Then ſaith the damſel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou alſo one of this man's diſciples?</hi> This blunt attack threw Peter into ſuch confuſion, that he flatly denied his having any connection with JESUS, replying, <hi>I am not,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>I know not, neither underſtand I what thou ſayeſt.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand there is any reaſon for your aſking me ſuch a queſtion. Thus, the very apoſtle who had before acknowledged his Maſter to be the Meſſiah, the Son of the Living God, who was honoured with the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and had ſo confidently boaſted of fortitude, and firm attachment to him in the greateſt dangers, proved an arrent deſerter of his cauſe upon trial. His ſhameful fears were altogether inexcuſable, as the enemy who attacked him was one of the weaker ſex, and the terror of the charge was, in a great meaſure, taken off by the inſinuation made in it, that John was likewiſe known to be CHRIST's diſciple; for, as he was known at the high-prieſt's, he was conſequently known in that character: <hi>Art thou not alſo one of this man's diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?</hi> Art thou not one of them as well as he who is ſitting with you? Equivocation, mental reſervation, and ſuch like baſe arts, are below the dignity and courage of reaſonable creatures; but downright lying, and that in the preſence of John his fellow-diſciple, is abominable, and can only be accounted for, by the confuſion and panic which had ſeized him on this occaſion. As Peter's inward perturbation muſt have appeared in his countenance and geſture, he did not chooſe to ſtay long with the ſervants at the fire; he went out, therefore, into the porch, where he was a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed: <hi>And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew,</hi> namely, for the firſt time. <hi>And

the maid ſaw him again, and began to ſay to them that ſtood by, This is one of them; and he again denied it with an oath, I know not the man:</hi> thus aggravating his former crime by that of perjury.</p>
               <p>PETER having been thus attacked without doors, thought proper to return and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had ſaid unto him, Before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> St. Luke is the only evangeliſt who has preſerved this beautiful circumſtance of CHRIST's turning and looking on Peter. The members of the council who ſat on JESUS, were placed at the upper end of the hall; in the other, were the ſervants with Peter at the fire: ſo that JESUS being probably placed on ſome eminence, that his judges, who were numerous, might ſee and hear him, could eaſily look over towards Peter, and obſerve him denying him, and in paſſionate terms, loud enough to be heard, perhaps, over all the place. The look pierced him, and, with the crowing of the cock, brought his Maſter's prediction freſh into his mind. He was ſtung with deep remorſe; and, being unable to contain himſelf, he covered his face with his garment to conceal the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion he was in, and going out into the porch wept very bitterly. All this paſſed while the prieſts examined JESUS with many taunts and revilings; and while the moſt zealous of CHRIST's diſciples was denying him with oaths and imprecations, the others inſulted him in the moſt inhuman manner. Thus a complication of injuries, inſults, and indignities, was at one time heaped upon the bleſſed Redeemer, the meek and mild JESUS, the ſuffering and wonderfully patient Son of the adorable Majeſty of heaven.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Trial of <hi>JESUS</hi> before the Sanhedrim, or grand Council of the Jews.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE band of ſoldiers having ſeized JESUS, led him to the high-prieſt's houſe, where all the chief prieſts, the Scribes, and the elders were aſſembled: <hi>And as ſoon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief prieſts, and the Scribes, came together, and led him into their council.</hi> Probably the trial did not begin immediately on our Lord's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; for though many of the judges were at the high-prieſt's before him, ſome perſons of diſtinction might be abſent, whoſe coming, the reſt were, out of reſpect, inclined to wait for: but, as the paſſover was at hand, they had no time to loſe; ſo that as ſoon as the council was fully met, the trial was begun: <hi>And the high-prieſt aſked Jeſus of his diſciples, and of his doctrine.</hi> He enquired of him what his diſciples were, for what end he had gathered them, whether it was to make himſelf a king, and what the doctrine was which he taught them? In theſe queſtions there was a great deal of art; for as the crime laid to our Saviour's charge was, that he had ſet up for the Meſſiah, and deluded the people, they expected he would claim that dignity in their preſence, and ſo would, on his own confeſſion have condemned him, without any further proceſs. This was unfair, as it was artful and enſnaring: to oblige a priſoner on his trial to confeſs what might take away his life, was a very inequitable method of proceeding; and JESUS expreſſed his opinion thereof with very good reaſon, and complained of it, bidding them prove what they had laid to his charge by witneſſes: <hi>Jeſus anſwered him, I ſpake openly to the world; I ever taught in the ſynagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always reſort; and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. Why aſkeſt thou me? Aſk them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them: behold they know what I ſaid.</hi> It was greatly to the honour of our bleſſed Redeemer, that all his actions were done in public, under the eye even of his enemies; becauſe, had he been carrying on any impoſture, the lovers of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth had thus abundant opportunities of detecting him with propriety: he therefore, in his defence, appealed to that part of his character; yet his anſwer was conſtrued diſreſpectful: for, <hi>when he had thus ſpoken, one of the officers which ſtood by, ſtruck Jeſus with the palm of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high-prieſt ſo?</hi> To which he meekly replied with the greateſt ſerenity. <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> Shew me, prove before this court, wherein my crime conſiſts, or record it in the evidence on the face of my trial; which if thou cannot, how can thou anſwer this inhuman treatment to a defenceleſs priſoner, ſtanding on his trial before the world, and in open court, and ſtrike me undeſervedly?</p>
               <p>IN this inſtance JESUS became an example of his own precept; and if a man ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo. Matt. v.39. bearing the greateſt injuries with an unprovoked patience, worthy of the meek Lamb of God.</p>
               <p>JESUS having declined anſwering the queſtions, whereby the council expected to have drawn from him an anknowledgment of his being the Meſſiah, they proceeded to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine many witneſſes to prove his having aſſumed that character; as they conſidered ſuch a pretenſion as blaſphemy in his mouth, who being only a man, according to their opinion, could not, without the higheſt affront to the Divine Majeſty, pretend to the title of the Son of God, as it belonged only to the Meſſiah. But in this examination they acted like intereſted and enraged perſecutors, rather than impartial judges, forming their queſtions in the moſt artful manner, in order, if poſſible, to draw expreſſions from them, which they might pervert into ſuſpicions of guilt, as ſome foundation for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

JESUS, who had ſo long and faithfully laboured for their ſalvation. Their witneſſes, however, diſappointed them, ſome of them diſagreeing in their ſtory, and others mentioning things of no manner of importance.</p>
               <p>AT laſt, two perſons agreed in their depoſitions, namely, in hearing him ſay, that he was able to deſtroy the temple of God, and to raiſe it in three days. But this teſtimo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> was abſolutely falſe; for our great Redeemer never ſaid he could deſtroy and build the temple of Jeruſalem in three days, as they affirmed. It is true, that after baniſhing the traders from the temple, when the Jews deſired to know by what authority he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make ſuch a reformation, he referred them to the miracle of his reſurrection! ſaying, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (pointing probably to his body) <hi>and in three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> The witneſſes, therefore, either through malice or ignorance, perverted his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer into an affirmation, that he was able to deſtroy, and build the magnificent temple of Jeruſalem in three days: and the judges conſidering that ſuch an act could only be performed by Divine Power, interpreted his aſſertion as blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>OUR Saviour, during the whole time, made no reply to the evidences that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt him, which greatly provoked the high-prieſt, who, ſuppoſing that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his ſilence, to put an affront on true council, roſe from his ſeat, and with great perturbation, demanded the reaſon for ſo remarkable a conduct: Anſwereſt thou nothing, ſaid he, what is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? And ſome of the council added, Art thou the Chriſt? To which our bleſſed Saviour anſwered, If I ſhould tell you plainly, you would not believe me; and if I ſhould demonſtrate it to you by the moſt evident and undeniable arguments, ye would neither be convinced nor releaſe me.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe things, the high-prieſt finding it impoſſible to enſnare JESUS, and being deſirous of rendering the trial as ſhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>u art the Meſſiah, the Son of God? This queſtion was artfully contrived; for, if JESUS ſhould anſwer it in the affirmative, they were ready to condemn him as a blaſphemer; if in the negative, they intended to puniſh him as an impoſtor, who had deceived the people by accepting from them the honours and titles of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS was not, however, intimidated by the conſequence attending his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confeſſion of the truth; for being adjured by the chief magiſtrate, he immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the charge, adding, ye ſhall ſhortly ſee a convincing evidence of this truth, in that wonderful and unparalleled deſtruction which I will ſend upon the Jewiſh nation; in the quick and powerful progreſs which the goſpel ſhall make over the earth; and finally, in my glorious appearance in the clouds of heaven at the laſt day, the ſign you have ſo often demanded in confirmation of my being ſent from God.</p>
               <p>THIS anſwer of our bleſſed Saviour's, cauſed a number of them to cry out at once, as aſtoniſhed at the ſuppoſed blaſphemy, <hi>art thou the Son of God?</hi> To which our great Redeemer replied, <hi>Ye ſay that I am:</hi> a manner of ſpeaking among the Jews, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a plain and ſtrong affirmation.</p>
               <p>THE high-prieſt, on hearing this ſecond aſſertion, rent his cloths with great indignation, and ſaid unto the council, Why need we trouble ourſelves to ſeek for any more witneſſes? Ye yourſelves, nay, this whole aſſembly are witneſſes, that he hath ſpoken manifeſt and notorious blaſphemy; what think ye? To which they all replied, that, for aſſuming to himſelf the character of the Meſſiah, he deſerved to be put to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="unknown:029927_0255_0FE338EE736731E8"/>THE ſervants and common people then began to fall upon him as a man already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; ſpitting upon him, buffeting him, and offering him all manner of rudeneſs and indignities; they blindfolded him, and ſome of the council, in order to ridicule him for having pretended to be the great Prophet, bid him exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THUS was the great Judge of all the earth placed at the bar of frail mortals, falſely accuſed by the witneſſes, unjuſtly condemned by his judges, and barbarouſly inſulted by all. Yet, becauſe it was agreeable to the end of his coming, he patiently ſubmitted, though he could with a frown, have made his judges, his accuſers, and thoſe who had him in cuſtody, to expire in a moment, or utterly dwindle away.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Saviour of the world, whom the whole Jewiſh nation had ſo long expected, having been thus condemned by the Sanhedrim, they conſulted together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to carry him before the governor, that he might likewiſe paſs ſentence on him. The Roman governors of Judea, generally reſided at Caeſarea; but at the great feaſts they came up to Jeruſalem to prevent or ſuppreſs tumults, and to adminiſter juſtice: it being a cuſtom for the Roman governors of provinces to viſit the principal towns under their juriſdiction on this latter account. Pilate, being accordingly come to Jeruſalem ſome time before the feaſt, had been informed, probably by Joſeph of Arimathea, of the great ferment amongſt the rulers, and the true character of the perſon on whoſe account it was raiſed; for he entertained a juſt notion of it: <hi>he knew that for envy they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him.</hi> He knew the cauſe of their envy, was impreſſed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Jewiſh council early in the morning, brought JESUS to the hall of judgment, or governor's palace. They themſelves, however, went not into the hall, but ſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, leſt they ſhould be rendered incapable of eating the paſſover, by being defiled.</p>
               <p>JUDAS Iſcariot, who had delivered his Maſter into the hands of the council, finding his project turned out very different from what he expected, was filled with the deepeſt remorſe for what he had done. He ſaw all his golden dreams of temporal honours and advantages, ſunk at once to nothing; he ſaw his kind, his indulgent Maſter condemned, and forſaken by all his followers. He ſaw all this, and determined to make all the ſatisfaction in his power for the crime he had committed: accordingly, he came and confeſſed openly his ſin before the chief prieſts and elders, offered them the money they had given him to commit it, and earneſtly wiſhed he could recal the fatal tranſaction of the preceding night. It ſeems he thought this was the moſt public teſtimony he could poſſibly give of his Maſter's innocence, and his own repentance: I have, ſaid he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a moſt horrid crime, in betraying an innocent man to death.

tribunal. By this contrivance, the people might ſtand round the tribunal in the open air, hear and ſee the governor when he ſpake to them from the pavement, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the whole adminiſtration of juſtice, without danger of being defiled either by him or any of his attendants.</p>
               <p>THE great Redeemer of mankind was brought before this tribunal: and the prieſt and elders having taken their places around the pavement, the governor aſcended the judgment-ſeat, and aſked them what accuſation they brought againſt the priſoner? Though nothing could be more natural than for the governor to aſk this queſtion, yet the Jews thought themſelves highly affronted by it. They probably knew his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the priſoner, and therefore conſidered his queſtion as intended to inſinuate, that they brought one to be condemned, againſt whom they could find no accuſation. Pilate might indeed ſpeak to them in a ſtern manner, and by that means ſufficiently indicate his diſpleaſure: but, however that be, the Jews haughtily anſwered, if he had not been a very great and extraordinary malefactor, we ſhould not have given thee this trouble at all, much leſs at ſo unſeaſonable an hour as the perſent.</p>
               <p>JESUS was then examined by Pilate, who finding he had not been guilty either of rebellion or ſedition, but that he was accuſed of particulars relating to the religion and cuſtoms of the Jews, grew angry, and ſaid, what are theſe things to me? Take him yourſelves, and judge him according to your own law; plainly inſinuating, that in his opinion, the crime they laid to the priſoner's charge was not of a capital na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that ſuch puniſhments as they were permitted by Caeſar to inflict, were ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to any miſdemeanor that JESUS was charged with. But this propoſal of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governor was abſolutely refuſed by the Jewiſh prieſts and elders, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their whole proceeding, and therefore they anſwered, We have no power to put any one to death, as this man certainly deſerves, who has attempted not only to make innovations in our religion, but alſo ſet up himſelf for a king. This eagerneſs of the Jews to get JESUS condemned by the Roman governor, who often ſentenced malefactors to be crucified, tended to fulfil the ſayings of our great Redeemer, who, during the courſe of his miniſtry, has often mentioned what kind of death he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to die by the pre-determination of the Omniſcient God.</p>
               <p>AS Pilate now found it impoſſible to prevent a tumult, unleſs he proceeded to try JESUS, he therefore aſcended again the judgment-ſeat, and commanded his accuſers to produce their charges againſt him. Accordingly, they accuſed him of ſeditious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, affirming that he had uſed every method in his power to diſſuade the people from paying taxes to Caeſar, pretending that he himſelf was the Meſſiah, the great king of the Jews, ſo long expected: but they brought no proof of this aſſertion. They only inſinuated that they had already convicted him of this crime; which was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe. Pilate, however, aſked him, Is it true, what theſe men lay to thy charge, that thou haſt indeed attempted to ſet up thyſelf as king of the Jews? To which JESUS replied, haſt thou ever during thy ſtay in this province, heard any thing of me, that gave thee any reaſon to ſuſpect me guilty of ſecret practices and ſeditious deſigns againſt the government? Or doſt thou found thy queſtion only on the preſent clamour and tumult that is raiſed againſt me? If this be the caſe, be very careful leſt thou be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on merely by the ambiguity of a word: for, to be King of the Jews, is not to erect a temporal throne in oppoſition to that of Caeſar, but ſomething very different from it; the kingdom of the Meſſiah is of a ſpiritual nature.</p>
               <p>PILATE replied, am I a Jew? Can I tell what their expectations are, and in what ſuperſtitious ſenſe they underſtand theſe words? The rulers and chiefs of their own
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:029927_0259_0FE338FC29032928"/>
people, we are the moſt proper judges of theſe particulars, have brought thee before me, as a riotous and ſeditious perſon; if this be not the truth, let me know what is, and the crime thou haſt been guilty of, and what they lay to thy charge.</p>
               <p>TO which JESUS anſwered, I have indeed a kingdom, and this kingdom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to eſtabliſh; but then it is not of this world, nor have my endeavours to eſtabliſh it any tendency to cauſe diſturbances in the government: for, had that been the caſe, my ſervants would have fought for me, and not ſuffered me to have fallen into the hands of the Jews: but I tell thee plainly, my kingdom is wholly ſpiritual, conſiſting only in the obedience of the wills and affections of men to the laws of God.</p>
               <p>PILATE ſaid, Thou acknowledges then in general, that thou haſt pretended to be a king? To which the bleſſed JESUS replied, In the ſenſe I have told thee, I have declared, and do now declare myſelf to be a king: for this very end I was born, and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I came into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the truth; and whoſoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loves, and is always ready to embrace the truth, will hear my teſtimony and be convinced by it. Pilate ſaid, <hi>What is truth?</hi> and immediately went out to the Jews, and ſaid unto them, I have again examined this man, but can find him guilty of no fault, which, according to the Roman law, deſerves to have the puniſhment of death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for it.</p>
               <p>THOUGH the governor made this generous declaration of the innocence of our bleſſed Saviour, it had no effect on the ſuperſtitious and bigoted Jews: they even perſiſted in their accuſations with more vehemence than before, affirming that he had attempted to raiſe a ſedition in Galilee: <hi>He ſtirred up,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>the people, beginning from Galilee to this place.</hi> JESUS, however, made no anſwer at all to this heavy charge: nay, he continued ſilent, notwithſtanding the governor himſelf expreſsly required him to ſpeak in his own defence. A conduct ſo extraordinary, in ſuch circumſtances, aſtoniſhed Pilate exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; for he had great reaſon to be perſuaded of the innocence of our dear Redeemer. The truth is, he was altogether ignorant of the divine council by which the whole affair was directed, and the end propoſed by it.</p>
               <p>MANY reaſons induced the bleſſed JESUS not to make a public defence. He came into the world purely to redeem loſt and undone mankind, by offering up himſelf a ſacrifice to appeaſe the wrath of his Almighty Father: but had he pleaded with his uſual force, the people had, in all probability, been induced to aſk his releaſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his death had been prevented: beſides, the groſs falſehood of the accuſation, known to all the inhabitants of Galilee, rendered any reply abſolutely unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>THE chief prieſts continued, in the mean time, to accuſe him with great noiſe and tumult: and the meek and humble JESUS ſtill continuing mute, Pilate ſpake again to him, ſaying, Wilt thou continue to make no defence? Doſt thou not hear how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently theſe men accuſe thee? But Pilate recollecting what the chief prieſts had ſaid with regard to a ſedition in Galilee, aſked if JESUS came out of that country; and on being informed he did, he immediately ordered him to be carried to Herod, who then reſided at Jeruſalem; for the governor ſuppoſed that Herod, in whoſe dominions the ſedition was ſaid to have been raiſed, muſt be a much better judge of the affair than himſelf: beſides, his being a Jew, rendered him more expert in the religion of his own country, and gave him greater influence over the chief prieſts and elders: he therefore conſidered him as the moſt proper perſon to prevail on the Jewiſh council to deſiſt from their cruel proſecution: but if, contrary to all human probability, he ſhould, at their ſolicitation, condemn JESUS, Pilate hoped to eſcape the guilt and infamy of putting an

               <p>WHATEVER might be the motive that induced Pilate to ſend our great Redeemer to Herod, the latter greatly rejoiced at this opportunity of ſeeing JESUS, hoping to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leaſure of beholding him perform ſome great miracle. In this he was however miſtaken: for as Herod had apoſtatized from the doctrine of John the Baptiſt, to which he was once a convert, and had even put this teacher to death, the bleſſed JESUS, however liberal of his miracles to the ſons and daughters of affliction, would not work them to gratify the curioſity of a tyrant, nor even anſwer one of the many queſtions he propoſed.</p>
               <p>FINDING himſelf thus diſappointed, Herod ordered our bleſſed Saviour to be clothed with an old robe, reſembling in colour, thoſe worn by kings, and permitted his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to inſult him; perhaps to provoke him to work ſome miracle, though it ſhould prove of a hurtful kind. From Herod's dreſſing him in this manner, it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the chief prieſts and elders had accuſed him of nothing, but his having aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the character of the Meſſiah; for the affront put upon him was plainly in deriſion of that pretenſion.</p>
               <p>THE other head of accuſation, namely, his having attempted to raiſe a ſedition in Galilee, on account of the tribute paid to Caeſar, they did not dare to mention, as Herod could not fail of knowing it to be a groſs and malicious falſehood; and no crime worthy of death being laid to his charge, Herod ſent him again to Pilate. It ſeems, that though he was diſpleaſed with the great Redeemer of mankind for refuſing to work a miracle before him, yet he did not think proper to be unjuſt to him. Perhaps he was reſtrained by the remorſe he felt on account of the death of John the Baptiſt, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined bringing a greater weight upon his conſcience.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Pilate gives the Jews their Choice of <hi>JESUS</hi> or Barabbas to be releaſed: Upon the Clamour of the common People, Barabbas is looſed, and <hi>JESUS</hi> delivered up to be crucified: He is crowned with Thorns, ſpit on, and mocked.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Roman governors at the paſſover, made it a cuſtom to court the favour of the populace, by gratifying them with the releaſe of any one priſoner they pleaſed. And at this feaſt, there was one in priſon named Barabbas, who, at the head of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rebels, had made an inſurrection in the city, and committed murder during the tumult.</p>
               <p>THERE being now again a great multitude of people aſſembled before the governor's palace, they began to call aloud on him to perform the annual office of mercy, cuſtomary at the feſtival they were now celebrating. Pilate, glad of this opportunity, told them, that he was willing to grant the favour they deſired; and aſked them whether they would have Barabbas or JESUS releaſed unto them? But without waiting for an anſwer, he offered to releaſe JESUS, knowing that the chief prieſts had delivered him through envy; eſpecially as Herod had not found him guilty of the crimes he had been accuſed of.</p>

                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:029927_0262_0FE339063746F870"/>DURING theſe tranſactions, Pilate received a meſſage from his wife, then with him at Jeruſalem, and who had that morning been informed of ſomething in a dream which gave her great uneaſineſs. Perhaps it preſaged the vengeance of the Almighty purſuing her huſband and family, on account of the injuſtice he was going to commit. But whatever the dream was, it had ſo great an effect on this Roman lady, that ſhe could not reſt till ſhe had ſent an account of it to her huſband, who was then ſitting on the tribunal in the pavement, and begged him to have no hand in the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſon who was then brought to his bar.</p>

               <p>THE intent of Pilate, in doing the prieſts the honour to conſult their inclinations in particular, might, in all probability, be with a deſign to ſoften their ſtony hearts, and, if poſſible, to move them for once to pity an unhappy, and innocent man. But he was perſuaded, that if pity was abſolutely baniſhed from their callous breaſts, his propoſal would have been acceptable to the people, whom he expected would embrace the firſt opportunity of declaring in his favour. Yet in this he was diſappointed. They cried out all at once, <hi>Away with this man, and releaſe unto us Barabbas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YE apoſtate mortals, a few hours ago ye liſtened with rapture to his heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, beheld with tranſport the many ſalutary miracles wrought by this benevolent ſon of the Moſt High, and earneſtly importuned him to take poſſeſſion of the throne and ſceptre of David! Now nothing will ſatiate your infernal malice but his precious blood! But remember ye miſcreants, ye monſters in the human form, that this ſame JESUS, whom ye beheld with ſuch contempt before the tribunal of the Roman governor; this JESUS, whoſe blood your infernal mouths ſo loudly requeſted, ſhall one day come in the clouds of heaven to take vengeance on his enemies! And how will you be able to bear the ſight of his appearance, when the very heavens themſelves will melt at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, "the ſun become black as ſackcloth of hair," the moon be turned into blood, and the ſtars fly from their ſpheres? How will ye then repent of your unjuſt demand, and call to the mountains and rocks to fall on you, and hide you from the preſence of that immaculate Lamb of God, the tremendous judge of quick and dead!</p>
               <p>THE governor himſelf was aſtoniſhed at this determination of the multitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his queſtion, for he could hardly believe what he had himſelf heard.

               <p>THE office of governor, obliging Pilate to be preſent at this ſhocking ſcene of inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, he was ready to burſt with grief. The fight of an innocent and virtuous man, treated with ſuch ſhocking barbarity, raiſed in his breaſt the moſt painful ſenſations of pity: and though he had given ſentence that it ſhould be as the Jews deſired, and had delivered our dear Redeemer to the ſoldiers to be crucified, he was perſuaded, that if he ſhewed him to the people in that condition, they muſt relent, and petition him to let him go. Filled with this thought, he reſolved to carry him out, and exhibit to their view, a ſpectacle capable of ſoftening the moſt envenomed, obdurate, enraged enemy. And in order to render the impreſſion ſtill more poignant, he went out himſelf, and ſaid unto them, Though I have ſentenced this man to die, and have ſcourged him as one that is to be crucified; yet I once more bring him before you, that I may again teſtify how fully I am perſuaded of his innocence, and that ye may yet have an opportunity of ſaving his life, and clearing the guiltleſs.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner had the governor finiſhed his ſpeech, than JESUS appeared on the pavement, with his hair, his face, his ſhoulders all clotted with blood, and the purple robe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daubed with ſpittle. And that the ſight of JESUS in this diſtreſs might make the greater
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:029927_0267_0FE3391480F095D8"/>
impreſſion on the people, Pilate, while he was coming forward, cried out, <hi>Behold the man!</hi> As if he had ſaid, will nothing make you relent? Have you loſt all the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and bowels of compaſſion? Can you bear to ſee the innocent, a ſon of Abraham, thus injured? Perhaps alſo, the ſoldiers were ſuffered to buffet JESUS again on the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the multitude, in order to excite their pity, or at leaſt their pride: for though they might not pity JESUS as a perſon unjuſtly condemned; yet when they ſaw one of their countrymen inſulted by Heathens, it was natural for the governor to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that their national pride being provoked, it would have induced them to have demanded his enlargement: but all this was to no purpoſe. The prieſts, whoſe rage and malice had extinguiſhed not only the ſentiments of juſtice and feelings of pity, natural to the human heart, but alſo that love which countrymen bear for each other, no ſooner ſaw JESUS, than they began to fear the fickle populace might relent, and therefore, laying decency aſide, they led the way to the multitude, crying out with all their might, Crucify him! Crucify him! Releaſe not this man, but Barabbas!</p>
               <p>THE governor, vexed to ſee the Jewiſh rulers thus obſtinately bent on the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perſon, from whom they had nothing to fear that was dangerous, either with regard to their church or ſtate, paſſionately told them, that if they would have him crucified, they muſt do it themſelves; becauſe he would not ſuffer his people to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man who was guilty of no crime. But this they all refuſed, thinking it diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to receive permiſſion to puniſh a perſon who had been more than once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly declared innocent by his judge: beſides they conſidered with themſelves, that the governor might afterwards have called it ſedition, as the permiſſion had been extorted from him. Accordingly they told him, that even though one of the things alledged againſt the priſoner were true, he had committed ſuch a crime in the preſence of the council itſelf, as by law deſerved the moſt ignominious death, He had ſpoken blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, calling himſelf the Son of God, a title which no mortal could aſſume without the higheſt degree of guilt: <hi>We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, a divine perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PILATE's fear was increaſed when he heard that JESUS called himſelf the Son of God: but knowing the obſtinacy of the Jews in all matters of religion, he was afraid they would make a tumult in earneſt; or, perhaps he was himſelf more afraid than ever to take away his life, becauſe he ſuſpected it might be true. He doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered the miracles ſaid to have been performed by JESUS, and therefore ſuſpected that he really was the Son of God: for it is well known that the religion which the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor profeſſed, directed him to acknowledge the exiſtence of demi-gods and heroes, or men deſcended from the gods: nay, the Heathens believed, that their gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſometimes appeared upon earth in the form of men, and converſed with them.</p>
               <p>THESE kind of reflections induced Pilate to go again into the judgment-hall, and aſk JESUS from what father he ſprung, and from what country he came? But our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour gave him no anſwer, leſt the governor ſhould reverſe his ſentence, and abſolutely refuſe to crucify him. Pilate marvelled greatly at this ſilence, and ſaid unto JESUS, Why doſt thou refuſe to anſwer me? Thou canſt not be ignorant that I am inveſted with abſolute power, either to releaſe or crucify thee. To which JESUS anſwered, I well know that thou art Caeſar's ſervant, and accountable to him for thy management. I forgive thee any injury, which, contrary to thy inclination, the popular fury conſtrains thee to do unto me. Thou haſt thy power <hi>from above,</hi> from the emperor: for which cauſe, the Jewiſh high prieſt, who hath put me into
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029927_0268_0FE33916059A5B50"/>
thy hands, and by pretending that I am Caeſar's enemy, forces thee to condemn me; or if thou refuſeſt, will accuſe thee as negligent of the emperor's intereſt; he is more guilty than thee: <hi>He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin, being inſtigated thereto by malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEARING this ſweet and modeſt anſwer, ſuch an impreſſion was thereby made on Pilate, that he went out to the people, and declared his intention of releaſing JESUS, whether they gave their conſent or not. Upon which the chief prieſts and rulers of Iſrael cried out, <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſar's friend: whoſoever maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a king, ſpeaketh againſt Caeſar.</hi> If thou releaſeſt the priſoner, who hath ſet himſelf up for a king, and endeavoured to raiſe a rebellion in the country, thou art unfaithful to the intereſt of the emperor thy maſter. This argument was weighty, and ſhook Pilate's reſolution to the very baſis: he was terrified at the thought of being accuſed to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, who in all affairs of goverment always ſuſpected the worſt, and puniſhed the moſt minute crimes relative thereto, with death. The governor being thus conſtrained to yield contrary to his inclination, was very angry with the prieſts for ſtirring up the people to ſuch a pitch of madneſs, and determined to affront them. He therefore brough JESUS out a ſecond time into the pavemant, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns; and, pointing to him, ſaid, <hi>Behold your King;</hi> ridiculing the national expectation of a Meſſiah, as their deliverer.</p>
               <p>STUNG to the quick, by this ſarcaſtical expreſſion, they cried out, <hi>Away with him, away with him, crucify him.</hi> To which Pilate anſwered, with the ſame mocking air, <hi>Shall I cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify your king? The chief prieſts anſwered, We have no king but Caeſar.</hi> Thus did they publicly renounce their hope of the Meſſiah, which the whole economy of their religion had been calculated to cheriſh; they alſo publicly acknowledged their ſubjections to the Romans; and, conſequently, condemned themſelves, when they afterwards rebelled againſt the emperor Veſpaſian, who, with his ſon Titus, deſtroyed their city and temple.</p>
               <p>WE may hear obſerve, that the great unwillingneſs of the governor to paſs ſentence of death upon Jeſus, has ſomething in it very remarkable. For from the character of Pilate, as drawn by the Roman hiſtorians themſelves, he ſeems to have been far from poſſeſſing any true principle of virtue. To what then could it be owing, that ſo wicked a man ſhould ſo ſteadily adhere to the cauſe of innocence, which he defended with uncommon bravery, and perhaps would never have abandoned it, had he not been forced by the theatenings of the chief prieſts and rulers of Iſrael? And when he did yield, and paſſed ſentence upon our dear Redeemer, why did he ſtill declare him innocent? This can certainly be attributed to no other cauſe than to the ſecret and powerful direction of the providence of the Almighty, who intended that at the ſame time his ſon was condemned and executed as a malefactor, his innocence ſhould be made appear in the moſt public manner, and by the moſt authentic evidence; even that of the judge himſelf. It was the power of the Almighty that ſet bounds to the inveterate malice and fury of the Jews, that would not ſuffer them to ſtain the innocence of the bleſſed JESUS, at the ſame time they deprived him of his life; but ſaid to their boiſterous malice, as he had before ſaid to the foaming billows of the ocean, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhalt thy proud waves be ſtayed:</hi> for none can ſtay his hand, or controul his will.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JESUS</hi> is led forth to Calvary: Simon, the Cyrenian, compelled to carry the Croſs: He is crucified between two Malefactors: A Title is put upon the Croſs by Pilate, and Lots coſt for his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Multitude, the Rulers, the Prieſts, and the Soldiers revile <hi>JESUS</hi>: The Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of the Thieves: The great and unnatural Eclipſe of the Sun: <hi>JESUS</hi> ſpeaks to his Friends from the Croſs, cries, "It is finiſhed," recommends his Spirit into the Hands of his heavenly Father, and expires.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>O MY ſoul! come and follow thy Redeemer to the laſt ſcene of the moſt innocent and uſeful courſe that was ever paſſed on earth; follow him to Calvary's horrid emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenee, to Calvary's fatal cataſtrophe; there fix thy moſt conſtant attention on that lovely, that ſorrowful ſpectacle. Behold the ſpotleſs victim nailed to a tree, and ſtabbed to the heart; hear him pouring out prayers for his murderers, before he poured out his ſoul for tranſgreſſors; ſee the wounds that ſtream with forgiveneſs, and bleed balm for a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered world, O! ſee the juſtice and goodneſs of the Almighty, his mercy and his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; all his tremendous and gracious attributes manifeſted; manifeſted with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſplendour, in the moſt ignominious, and yet grandeſt of tranſactions that ever the world beheld!</p>
               <p>AFTER ſentence was pronounced againſt the bleſſed JESUS, the ſoldiers were ordered to prepare for his execution; a command which they readily obeyed, and after clothing him in his own garments, led him away to crucify him. It is not ſaid that they took the crown of thorns from his temples; probably he died wearing it, that the title placed over his head might be the better underſtood by the ſpectators.</p>
               <p>THE miniſters of Jewiſh malice we may ſuppoſe, remitted none of the circumſtances of affliction, which were ever laid on perſons condemned to be crucified. Accordingly, JESUS was obliged to walk on foot to the place of execution, bearing his croſs; but the fatigue of the preceeding night ſpent without ſleep, the ſufferings he had undergone in the garden; his having been hurried from place to place, and obliged to ſtand the whole time of his trials; the want of food, and the loſs of blood he had ſuſtained, and not his want of courage on this occaſion made him faint under the burden of his croſs. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſeeing him unable to bear the weight, laid it on one Simon, a native of Cyrene, in Egypt, the father of Alexander and Rufus, well known among the firſt Chriſtians, and forced him to bear it after the great Redeemer of mankind. The ſoldiers did not this, however, out of compaſſion to the ſuffering JESUS, but to prevent his dying with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and by that means avoiding the puniſhment deſigned for him.</p>
               <p>IN this journey to Calvary our bleſſed Saviour was followed by an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, particularly of women, who lamented bitterly the ſeverity of his ſentence, and ſhewed all the tokens of ſincere compaſſion and grief. JESUS, who always felt the woes of others more than he did his own, forgetting his diſtreſs at the very time when it lay heavieſt upon him, turned himſelf about, and, with a benevolence and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs truly divine, ſaid to them, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourſelves and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming in the which they ſhall ſay, Bleſſed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck. Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the mountains, Fall on us: and to the hills, Cover us.

them for the deplorable fate of yourſelves and your children; for the calamities that will ſoon fall on you and your offspring, are truly terrible, and call for the bittereſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In thoſe days of vengeance you will paſſionately wiſh that you had not given birth to a generation; whoſe wickedneſs has rendered them the objects of the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to ſuch a degree as was never before experienced in the world. Then ſhall they wiſh to be cruſhed under the weight of enormous mountains, and concealed from their enemies in the bowels of the earth. The thoughts of theſe calamities afflict my ſoul far more than the feeling of my own ſufferings: for if the Romans are permitted to inflict puniſhments on me who am innocent, how dreadful muſt the vengeance be which they ſhall inflict on a nation whoſe ſins cry aloud to heaven, haſtening the pace of the divine judgments, and rendering the perpetrators as proper for judgment as dry wood, is for flames of fire.</p>
               <p>AT the place of execution, which was called Golgotha, or the place of a ſkull, from the criminal bones which lay ſcattered there, ſome of our Redeemer's friends offered him a ſtupifying potion, to render him inſenſible of the ignominy and excruciating pain of his puniſhment; but as ſoon as he taſted the potion he refuſed to drink it, being determined to bear his ſufferings, however ſharp, not by intoxicating and ſtupifying himſelf, but by the ſtrength of patience, fortitude, and faith.</p>
               <p>HAVING therefore refuſed the potion, the ſoldiers began to execute their orders by ſtripping him quite naked, and in that condition began to faſten him to his croſs. But while they were piercing his hands and his feet with nails, inſtead of crying out with the ſharpneſs of the pain, he calmly, though ſeverely prayed for them, and for all thoſe who had any hand in his death; beſeeching the Almighty to forgive them, and excuſing them himſelf by the only circumſtance that could alleviate their guilt; I mean, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Father,</hi> ſaid the compaſſionate Redeemer of mankind, <hi>forgive them: for they know not what they do.</hi> This was infinite meekneſs and goodneſs, truly worthy of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God; an example of forgiveneſs, which, though it can never be equalled by any, ſhould be imitated by all, when ſuffering in a good cauſe.</p>
               <p>BEHOLD now the appointed ſoldiers dig the hole in which the croſs was to be erected. The croſs is placed in the ground, and the bleſſed Jeſus lies on the bed of ſorrows; they nail him to it; they erect it; his nerves crack; his blood diſtils; he hangs upon his wounds naked, a ſpectacle to heaven and earth. Thus was the only begotten Son of God, who came down from heaven to ſave the world, crucified by his own creatures; and, to render the ignominy ſtill greater, placed between two thieves: <hi>Hear, O heavens! O earth, earth hear! The Lord hath nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt him;</hi> by rejecting the only Saviour, and the God of all their mercies.</p>
               <p>CRIMES committed by malefactors were uſually written on a white board with black, and placed over their heads on the croſs. In conformity to this cuſtom, Pilate wrote a title in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, that all foreigners as well as natives, might be able to read it, and faſtened it to the croſs, over the head of JESUS; and the inſcription was JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. But when the chief prieſts and elders had read this title they were greatly diſpleaſed; becauſe, as it repreſented the crime for which JESUS was condemned, it inſinuated that he had been acknowledged for the Meſſiah: beſides, being placed over the head of one who was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the moſt infamous puniſhment, it implied that all who attempted to deliver the Jews, ſhould periſh in the ſame manner. The faith and hope of the nation, therefore, being thus publicly ridiculed, it is no wonder that the prieſts thought themſelves highly
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:029927_0271_0FE30EB421873C98"/>
affronted; and, accordingly came to Pilate, begging that the writing might be altered; but as he had intended the affront in revenge for their forcing him to crucify JESUS, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to his judgment and inclination, he refuſed to grant their requeſt: <hi>What I have written,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have written;</hi> and perſiſted in his reſolution not to alter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>THE ſoldiers, having nailed the bleſſed JESUS to the croſs, and erected it, divided his garments amongſt them; but his coat, or veſture, being without ſeam, woven from the top throughout, they agreed not to rend it, but to caſt lots for it, that the prediction of the prophet concerning the death and ſufferings of the Meſſiah might be fulfilled: <hi>They parted my garments amongſt them, and upon my veſture did they caſt lots.</hi> A ſufficient indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that every circumſtance of the death and paſſion of the bleſſed JESUS was long before determined in the court of heaven; and accordingly, his being crucified between two malefactors was expreſsly foretold, <hi>And he was numbered with the tranſgreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the common people, whom the vile prieſts had incenſed againſt the bleſſed JESUS, by the malicious falſhoods they had ſpread concerning him, and which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to found on the depoſition of witneſſes, ſaw him hang in ſo infamous a manner upon the croſs, and reading the inſcription that was placed over his head, they expreſſed their indignation againſt him by ſarcaſtical expreſſions: <hi>Ah, thou,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtroyſt the temple, and buildeſt it in three days ſave thyſelf, and come down from the croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE multitude were not the only perſons who mocked and derided the bleſſed JESUS, while he was ſuffering to obtain the remiſſion of the ſins of all mankind. The rulers, who now imagined they had effectually deſtroyed his pretenſions to the character of the Meſſiah, joined the populace in ridiculing him, and with a meanneſs of ſoul which many infamous wretches would have ſcorned, mocked him, even while he was ſtruggling with the agonies of death: they ſcoffed at the miracles by which he demonſtrated himſelf to be the Meſſiah, and promiſed to believe in him, on condition of his proving his pretenſions by deſcending from the croſs: <hi>He ſaved others,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>himſelf he cannot ſave. If he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the croſs, and we will believe him;</hi> not knowing what they ſaid.</p>
               <p>NOTHING could be more falſe and hypocritical than this pretenſion of the ſtiff-necked Jews; for they continued in their unbelief, notwithſtanding they well knew that he raiſed himſelf from the dead; a much greater miracle than his coming down from the croſs would have been, a miracle atteſted by witneſſes whoſe veracity they could not call in queſtion: it was told them by the ſoldiers whom they themſelves placed at the ſepulchre to watch the body, and who they were obliged to bribe largely to conceal the truth. It is therefore abundantly evident, that if the bleſſed JESUS had deſcended from the croſs, the Jewiſh prieſts would have continued in their infidelity; and conſequently that their declaration was made with no other intention than to inſult the Redeemer of mankind, thinking it impoſſible for him now to eſcape out of their hands. The ſoldiers alſo joined in this general ſcene of mockery, <hi>If thou be the King of the Jews</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſave thyſelf.</hi> If thou art the great Meſſiah expected by the Jews, deſcend from the croſs by miracle, and deliver thyſelf from theſe excruciating torments, inflicted by thy enemies.</p>
               <p>ONE of the thieves could not forbear mocking the great Lord of heaven and earth, though labouring himſelf under the moſt racking pains, and ſtruggling with the agonies of death: but the other exerciſed a moſt extraordinary faith, at a time when our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was deſerted by his Father, mocked by men, and hanged upon the croſs, as the moſt ignominious of malefactors. This Jewiſh criminal ſeems to have entertained a more
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029927_0272_0FE33922EFCEA1D8"/>
rational and exalted notion of the Meſſiah's kingdom than even the diſciples themſelves; they expected nothing but a ſecular empire: he gave ſtrong intimations of his having an idea of CHRIST's ſpiritual dominion; for at the very time when JESUS was dying on the croſs, he begged to be remembered by him when he came into his kingdom: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> Nor did he make his requeſt in vain: the great Redeemer of mankind anſwered him, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee, to-day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> Thereby evidencing the immediate happineſs of the righteous after death.</p>
               <p>LET us now attentively conſider the hiſtory of our bleſſed Saviour's paſſion, as it offers to our view events abſolutely aſtoniſhing: for when we remember the perfect innocence of our great Redeemer, the uncommon love he bore to the children of men, and the many kind and benevolent offices he did for the ſons and daughters of affliction; when we reflect on the eſteem in which he was held all along by the common people, how cheerfully they followed him to the remoteſt corners of the country, nay, even into the deſolate retreats of the wilderneſs, and with what pleaſure they liſtened to his diſcourſes; when we conſider theſe particulars, I ſay, we cannot help being aſtoniſhed to find them at the concluſion, ruſhing all of a ſudden into the oppoſite extremes, and every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual as it were, combined to treat him with the moſt barbarous cruelty and inſult.</p>
               <p>PILATE having aſked the people, if they deſired to have JESUS, releaſed, his diſciples, though they were very numerous and might have made a great appearance in his behalf, remained abſolutely ſilent, as if they had been ſpeechleſs or infatuated. The Roman ſoldiers, notwithſtanding their general had declared him innocent, inſulted him in the moſt inhuman manner; the Scribes and Phariſees ridiculed him; the common people, who had received him with Hoſannas a few days before, wagged their heads at him as they paſſed by, and railed on him as a deceiver: nay, the very thief on the croſs reviled him, in the midſt of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>THOUGH this ſudden revolution in the minds of the whole nation may ſeem unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet if we could aſſign a proper reaſon for the ſilence of the diſciples, the principle, which influenced the reſt might be diſcovered in their ſeveral ſpeeches. The followers of the bleſſed JESUS had attached themſelves to him, in expectation of being raiſed to great wealth and power in his kingdom, which they expected would have been eſtabliſhed long before this time: but ſeeing no appearance at all of what they had ſo long hoped for, they permitted him to be condemned perhaps, becauſe they thought it would have obliged him to break the Roman yoke by ſome miraculous act of divine power.</p>
               <p>THE ſoldiers were angry that any one ſhould pretend to royalty in Judea, where Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar had eſtabliſhed his authority: hence they inſulted our bleſſed Saviour with the title of King, and paid him, in mockery, the honours of a ſovereign; and as for the common people, they ſeemed to have loſt their opinion of him, probably becauſe he had neither convinced the council, nor reſcued himſelf when they condemned him. They began, therefore, to conſider the ſtory of his pretending to deſtroy the temple and build it in three days, as a kind of blaſphemy, becauſe it required divine power to perform ſuch a work.</p>
               <p>THE moſt implacable and diabolical malice irritated the prieſts and Scribes againſt him; becauſe he had torn off their maſks of hypocriſy, and ſhewed them to the people in their true colours. It is therefore, no wonder that they ridiculed his miracles, from whence he derived his reputation. In ſhort, the thief alſo fancied that he would have delivered both himſelf and them, if he had been the Meſſiah; but as no ſuch deliverance appeared, he upbraided him for making pretenſions to the high character he aſſumed.</p>

Was ever love like this! was ever benevolence ſo finely diſplayed?

               <p>THEN, O my ſoul, take ſanctuary under that tree of life, the ignominious croſs of they bleeding Saviour; let us fly for ſafety to that city of refuge opened in his bleeding wounds: theſe will prove a ſacred hiding-place, not to be pierced by the flames of divine wrath, or the fiery darts of temptation: his dying merits, his perfect obedience, will be <hi>as rivers of water in a dry place,</hi> or <hi>as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</hi> But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that laſt tremendous day when the heavens ſhall be rent aſunder, and wrapped up like a ſcroll; when his Almighty arm ſhall arreſt the ſun in his career, and daſh the ſtructure of the univerſe to pieces; when the dead, both ſmall and great, ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before the throne of his glory, and the fates of all mankind hang on the very point of a final irreverſible deciſion: then, if thou haſt faithfully truſted in him, and made his precepts thy conſtant directors, thou ſhall be owned and defended by him.

This preternatural eclipſe of the ſun continued for three hours, to the great terror and aſtoniſhment of the people preſent at the execution of our dear Redeemer. And ſurely nothing could be more proper than this extraordinary alteration in the face of nature, while the Sun of Righteouſneſs was withdrawing his beams, not only from the promiſed land, but from the whole world; for it was at once a miraculous teſtimony given by the Almighty himſelf to the innocence of his Son, and a proper emblem of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of him who was the Light of the world, at leaſt till his luminous rays, like the beams of the morning, ſhone out anew with additional ſplendour, in the miniſtry of his apoſtles, after his aſcenſion.</p>

               <p>THE Heathens themſelves conſidered this preternatural eclipſe of the ſun as a miracle, and one of them cried out, 'Either the world is at an end, or the God of nature ſuffers!' And well might he uſe the expreſſion; for never ſince this planetary ſyſtem was called from its primitive chaos, was known ſuch a deprivation of light in the glorious lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of day. Indeed, when the Almighty puniſhed Pharaoh for refuſing to let the children of Iſrael depart out of his land, the ſable veil of darkneſs was for three days drawn over Egypt: but this darkneſs was confined to a part of that kingdom; whereas this that happened at our Saviour's crucifixion, was univerſal, and not merely local.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples naturally conſidered the darkneſs, when it began, as a prelude to the deliverance of their Maſter: for though the chief prieſts, elders, and people, had ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtically deſired him to deſcend from the accurſed tree, his friends could not but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that he who had delivered ſo many from incurable diſeaſes, who had created limbs for the maimed, and eyes for the blind, who had given ſpeech to the dumb, and called the dead from the chambers of the duſt, might eaſily ſave himſelf even from the croſs. When, therefore, his mother, his mother's ſiſter Mary Magdalene, and the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple obſerved the veil of darkneſs begin to extend over the face of nature, they drew near to the foot of the croſs, probably in expectation that the Son of God was going to ſhake the frame of the univerſe, unlooſe himſelf from the croſs, and take ample ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on thoſe cruel and perfidious enemies who had ſo deſpitefully treaed him.</p>
               <p>AT this awful period, the bleſſed JESUS was in the midſt of his ſufferings; yet when he ſaw his mother and her companions, their grief greatly affected his tender breaſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the diſtreſs of his mother. The agonies of death, under which he was now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, could not prevent his expreſſing the moſt affectionate regard both for her and for them: for that ſhe might have ſome conſolation to ſupport her under the greatneſs of her ſorrows, he told her, the diſciple whom he loved, would, for the ſake of that love, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place to her after he was taken from them, even the place of a ſon; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he deſired her to conſider him as ſuch, and expect from him all the duties of a child: <hi>Woman</hi> ſaid he, <hi>behold thy ſon!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS remarkable token of filial affection towards his mother, was not the only inſtance the dying JESUS gave of his ſincere love for his friends and followers; the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple had alſo a token of his high eſteem: he ſingled him out as the only perſon among his friends, to ſupply his place with regard to his mother. Accordingly, he deſired him
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029927_0275_0FE3392FE406ABE8"/>
expreſsly to reverence her in the ſame manner as if ſhe had been his own parent: a duty which the favourite diſciple gladly undertook; for he carried her with him to his houſe, and maintained her from that hour to the day of her death; her huſband Joſeph having been dead ſome time before.</p>
               <p>WE have now before us an evident proof, that in the midſt of the heavieſt ſufferings human nature ever ſuſtained, the bleſſed JESUS demonſtrated a divine ſtrength of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; even at the time when his own diſtreſs was at the higheſt pitch, and nature was dreſſed in the robe of mourning for the ſufferings of her great Creator: his friends had ſo large a ſhare of his concern, that their happineſs interrupted the ſharpneſs of his pains, and for a ſhort time engroſſed his thoughts.</p>
               <p>NOW the moment when JESUS ſhould reſign his ſoul into the hands of his heavenly Father approached, and he repeated part of the twenty-ſecond Pſalm, uttering with a loud voice, theſe remarkable words, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lama ſabacthani?</hi> that is, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Or, <hi>My God, My God, how long a time haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> as the words may be rendered.</p>
               <p>IT is believed by ſome, that our bleſſed Saviour repeated the whole Pſalm, as it was cuſtomary with the Jews, in making quotations, to mention only the firſt words of the Pſalm or ſection which they cite. If ſo, as this Pſalm contains the moſt remarkable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of our Redeemer's paſſion, being as it were a ſummary of all the prophecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to that ſubject, by repeating it on the croſs, the bleſſed JESUS ſignified that he was now accompliſhing the things that were predicted concerning the Meſſiah. And as the Pſalm is compoſed in the form of a prayer, by pronouncing it at this time, he alſo claimed of his Father, the performance of all the promiſes he had made, whether to him or to his people; the chief of which are recorded in the latter part of the Pſalm above mentioned.</p>
               <p>WHEN ſome of the people, who ſtood by, heard our bleſſed Saviour pronounce the firſt words of this Pſalm, they miſunderſtood him, probably from their not hearing him diſtinctly, and concluded that he called for Elias; upon which one of them filled a ſpunge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, being deſirous of keeping him alive as long as poſſible, to ſee whether Elias would come to take him down from the croſs. But as ſoon as JESUS had taſted the vinegar, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> that is, the work of man's redemption is accompliſhed; that great work which the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God came into the world to perform, is finiſhed. In ſpeaking theſe words, he cried with an exceeding loud voice, and after that, he addreſſed his Almighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in words which form the beſt pattern of recommendatory prayer at the hour of death; <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi> and having uttered theſe words, he bowed his head, and yielded up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>AT the very inſtant that the bleſſed JESUS reſigned his ſoul into the hands of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, behold, the vail of the temple was miraculouſly rent from the top to the bottom; probably in the preſence of the prieſt who burnt incenſe in the holy place, and who doubtleſs publiſhed the account when he came out: for our bleſſed Saviour expired at the ninth hour, the very time of offering the evening ſacrifice. Nor was this the only miracle that happened at the death of the great Meſſiah; no, the earth trembled from its very foundations, the flinty rocks burſt aſſunder, and the ſepulchres hewn in them were opened, and many bodies of ſaints depoſited there, awaked after his reſurrection from the ſleep of death, left the gloomy chambers of the tomb, went into the city of Jeruſalem, and appeared unto many. In all probability theſe ſaints were diſciples of our
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:029927_0276_0FE3393167C30808"/>
bleſſed Saviour, who had but lately paſſed through the valley of the ſhadow of death; for when they went into the city, they were known to be ſaints by the perſons who ſaw them, which could not well have happened if they had not been co-temporaries with them.</p>
               <p>AS the rending of the veil of the temple intimated, that the entrance into the holy place, the type of heaven, was now laid open to all nations; ſo the reſurrection of a number of ſaints from the dead, demonſtrated that the power of death and the grave was broken: the ſting was taken from death, and the victory wreſted from the grave. In ſhort, our dear Redeemer's conqueſts over the enemies of mankind, were ſhewn to be complete, and an earneſt was given of the general reſurrection.</p>
               <p>THE remarkable events which attended that awful period when JESUS gave up the ghoſt, did not only affect the natives of Judea, but the Roman centurion, who was placed near the croſs, to prevent diſorders of any kind, glorified the Almighty, and cried out, <hi>Truly this man was the Son of God.</hi> And all the people when they beheld heaven itſelf bearing witneſs of the truth of our great Redeemer's miſſion, ſmote their breaſts and returned. They had been inſtant with loud voices to have him crucified; but when they ſaw the face of the creation wrapt in the gloomy mantle of darkneſs during his crucifixion, and found his death accompanied with an earthquake, as if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been in agony when he died, they rightly interpreted theſe prodegies to be ſo many teſtimonies from the Almighty of his innocence, and their paſſions which had been inflamed and exaſperated againſt him, became quite calm, or exerted in his behalf.</p>
               <p>SOME were angry with themſelves for neglecting the opportunity the governor gave them of ſaving his life; ſome were ſtung with remorſe for having been active in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Pilate to condemn him, and even offering the moſt bitter inſults, while he laboured under the crueleſt of ſufferings; and others were deeply affected at beholding the pains he ſuffered, which were as ſevere as they were undeſerved. Theſe various paſſions being viſibly painted in their countenances, afforded a melancholy ſpectacle; the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude returning from the cruel execution, with their eyes fixed upon the earth, penſive and ſilent; their hearts ready to burſt with grief, groaning deeply within themſelves, ſheddding floods of tears, and ſmitting on their breaſts, to teſtify their ſorrow.</p>
               <p>IT is obſervable that the grief they now felt for the bleſſed JESUS was diſtingiuſhed, from their former rage againſt him by this remarkable particular, that their rage was entirely owing to the artful inſinuations of the prieſts; whereas their grief was the genuine, the natural feeling of their own hearts, greatly affected with the truth and innocence of him who was the object of their commiſeration: and as flattery had no ſhare in this mourning, ſo the expreſſions of their ſorrow was ſuch as became a real, an unfeigned paſſion. Nor was this unaffected mourning ſhewn by only a few perſons, who might have been repreſented as the particular friends of the ſuffering JESUS; no, it was the general condition of the people who had repaired to Calvary, in order to behold the crucifixion of our dear Redeemer, that when they parted after he had given up the ghoſt, they covered the roads, and, as it were, darkened all the ſurrounding country.</p>

                  <p>A Roman Soldier thurſts his ſpear into our Saviour's Side: Joſeph of Aramathea comes to Pilate, and begs of him the Body of <hi>JESUS.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY the law of Moſes, it was expreſsly forbidden that the bodies of thoſe who were hanged ſhould remain all night on the tree. In conformity to this law, and becauſe the Sabbath was at hand, the Jews begged the governor, that the legs of the three perſons crucified might be broken, to haſten their death. To this requeſt Pilate readily conſented; and accordingly gave the neceſſary orders to the ſoldiers to put it in execution: but on perceiving that JESUS was already dead, the ſoldiers did not give themſelves the trouble of breaking his legs, as they had done thoſe of the two malefactors that were crucified with him. One of them, however, either out of wantonneſs or cruelty, thruſt a ſpear into his ſide and out of the wound flowed blood and water. Some ſuppoſe that the ſpear reached his heart; but however th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> be, it is certain, from the water which iſſued from the wound, that he pierced the pericardium; and conſequently muſt have killed him, had he not before been deprived of life.</p>
               <p>IT was of the greateſt importance to mankind that this wound was given, for it abundantly demonſtrated the truth of our Saviour's death, and conſequently prevented all objections that the enemies to our holy faith would otherwiſe have raiſed againſt it. The evangeliſt adds, that the legs of our great Redeemer were not broken, but his ſide pierced, that two particular prophecies might be fulfilled: <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken;</hi> and, <hi>they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced,</hi> and be convinced of the horrid impiety of the deed, as many of them afterwards were, on the preaching of Peter.</p>
               <p>THERE was a perſon amongſt the diſciples of the bleſſed JESUS, called Joſeph of Arimathea; he was equally remarkable for his birth, fortune, and office. This man, who was not to be intimidated by the malice of his countrymen, went boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of his great Maſter: he had indeed nothing to fear from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governor, who, during the whole courſe of our Saviour's trial, had ſhewn the greateſt inclination to releaſe him; but he had reaſon to apprehend, that this action might draw upon him the malice of the rulers of the Jews, who had taken ſuch great pains to get their Meſſiah crucified. The great regard, however, he had for the remains of his Maſter, made him deſpiſe the malice of the Jews, being perſuaded that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would defend him, and cover his enemies with ſhame and confuſion: and he well knew, that if no friend procured a grant of the body, it would be ignominiouſly caſt out amongſt the executed malefactors, and perhaps be expoſed to many indignities.</p>
               <p>THE governor was at firſt ſurpriſed at the requeſt of Joſeph, thinking it highly improbable that he ſhould be dead in ſo ſhort a time. He had indeed given orders for the ſoldiers to break the legs of the crucified perſons; but he knew it was not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for them to live many hours after that operation was performed: for though the pain it left muſt be exquiſitive in the laſt degree, yet as the vital parts remain untouched, life would continue ſome time in the miſerable body. Pilate therefore called the centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion to know the truth of what Joſeph had told him; and being convinced, from the anſwer of that officer, that JESUS had been dead ſome time, he readily granted the requeſt.</p>

The latter was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo cautious in viſiting JESUS, that he came to him by night; but in paying the laſt duties to his Maſter, he uſed no a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t to conceal his deſign: he ſhewed a courage far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of any of the apoſtles; not only aſſiſting Joſeph in taking down the body of JESUS from the croſs, but bringing with him a quantity of ſpices neceſſary in the burial of his Saviour. Accordingly, they wrapt the body, with the ſpices, in fine linen, and laid it in a new ſepulchre which Joſeph had hewn out of a rock for himſelf. This ſepulchre was ſituated in a garden near mount Calvary; but being not entirely finiſhed when they depoſited in it the body of the bleſſed JESUS, they faſtened the entrance by rolling a very large ſtone upon it.</p>
               <p>WHAT a wonderful ſpectacle was now exhibited in this memorable ſepulchre! He who clothes himſelf with light, as with a garment, and walks upon the wings of the wind, was pleaſed to wear the habiliments of mortality, and dwell amongſt this proſtrate dead! Who can repeat the wondrous truth too often! Who can dwell upon the enchanting theme too long! He who ſits enthroned in glory, and diffuſes bliſs amongſt all the heavenly hoſt, was once a pale and bloody corpſe, and preſſed the floor of this little ſepulchre! Wonder, O heavens! and be aſtoniſhed O earth!</p>
               <p>IN that ſolemn hour how great was thy triumph, O death? never did thy gloomy realms contain ſuch a priſoner before.—Priſoner, did I ſay? No, he was more than conqueror. He aroſe far more mightily than Sampſon from a tranſient ſlumber; broke down the gates, and demoliſhed the ſtrong holds of thoſe dark dominions. And this, O mortals, is your conſolation and ſecurity! JESUS has trod the dreadful path, and ſmoothed it for your paſſage. JESUS, ſleeping in the chambers of the tomb, has bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the diſmal manſion, and left an inviting odour in thoſe beds of duſt. The dying JESUS is your ſure protection, your unqueſtionable paſſport through the territories of the grave. Believe in him with all your hearts, and love and obey him, and you will find him the high way to Sion: he will tranſmit you ſafe to paradiſe. Believe in him, and you ſhall be no loſers, but unſpeakable gainers by your diſſolution. For hear what the oracle of heaven ſays on this important point: 'Whoſo believeth in me, ſhall never die.' Death ſhall no longer be inflicted as a puniſhment, but rather vouchſafed as a bleſſing. Their exit is the end of their frailty, and their entrance upon perfection: their laſt groan is the prelude to life, immortality, and joy.</p>
               <p>THE women of Galilee, who had watched their dear Redeemer in his laſt moments, and accompanied his body to the ſepulchre, obſerving that the funeral rites were performed in a hurry, agreed among themſelves, as ſoon as the ſabbath was paſſed, to return to the ſepulchre, and embalm the body of their great Saviour, by anointing and ſwathing him in the manner then common amongſt the Jews. Accordingly, they returned to the city, and purchaſed the ſpices neceſſary for that purpoſe; Nicodemus having furniſhed only a mixture of myrrh and aloes for the above end.</p>
               <p>THE chief prieſts and Phariſees, during theſe tranſactions, remembering that JESUS had more than once predicted his own reſurrection, came to the governor, and informed him of it; begging, at the ſame time, that a guard might be placed at the ſepulchre, leſt his diſciples ſhould carry away the body, and affirm that he was riſen from the dead. This happened a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="262" facs="unknown:029927_0280_0FE3393FA1112238"/>
the porticoes of the temple. For that they were not Jewiſh but Roman ſoldiers, whom the prieſts employed to watch the ſepulchre, is evident from their aſking them of the governor: beſides, when the ſoldiers returned with the news of our Saviour's reſurrection, the prieſts deſired them to report that his diſciples had ſtolen him away while they ſlept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to encourage them to tell that falſehood boldly, promiſed that if their neglect of duty came to the governor's ears, proper methods ſhould be uſed to pacify him, and deliver them from any puniſhment: a promiſe which there was no need of making to ſervants under their own immediate command.</p>
               <p>NOW the prieſts having thus obtained a guard of Roman ſoldiers, men, long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to military duties, and therefore moſt proper for watching the body, ſet out with them to the ſepulchre; and to prevent theſe guards from combining with the diſciples in carrying on any fraud, placed them at their poſt, and ſealed the ſtone which was rolled to the door of the ſepulchre.

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, came very early in the morning to viſit the ſepulchre, in order to embalm our Lord's body: for the performance of which they had, in concert with ſeveral other women from Galilee, brought unguents and ſpices. But before they reached the ſepulchre, there was a great earthquake preceding the moſt memorable event that ever happened amongſt the children of men, the reſurrection of the Son of God from the dead: <hi>For the angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and ſat upon it: his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as ſnow; and for fear of him the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men;</hi> they fled into the city, and the Saviour of the world roſe from the dead. The angel, who had till then ſat upon the ſtone quitted his ſtation, entered into the ſepulchre, and probably placed the linen clothes and napkin in the order they were afterwards found and obſerved by John and Peter.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, Mary Magdelene and the other Mary were ſtill on their way to the ſepulchre, together with Salome, who joined them on the road; as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on their way, they conſulted amongſt themſelves with regard to the method of putting their intention of embalming the body of their beloved Maſter in execution; particularly with reſpect to the enormous ſtone which they had ſeen placed there with the utmoſt difficulty two days before: <hi>Who,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s alarmed at ſo extraordinary and ſo unexpected a circumſtance, Mary Magdalene concluded, that the ſtone could not be rolled away without ſome deſign; and that they who rolled it away could have no other deſign, than that of removing our Lord's body: and being convinced by appearances that they had really done ſo, ſhe ran immediately to acquaint Peter and John of what ſhe had ſeen, and what ſhe ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; leaving Mary and Salome there, that if the other women ſhould arrive during her abſence, they might acquaint them with their ſurpriſe at finding the ſtone removed, and of Mary Magdalene's running to inform the apoſtles of the extraordinary event.</p>
               <p>THE Soldiers who where terrified at ſeeing an awful meſſenger from on high, roll away the ſtone from the door of the ſepulchre, and open it in quality of a ſervant, fled into the city, and informed the Jewiſh rulers of theſe miraculous appearances. This account was highly mortifying to the chief prieſts, as it was a proof of our Saviour's reſurrection that could not be denied; they therefore reſolved to ſtifle it immediately; and, accordingly, bribed the ſoldiers to conceal the real fact, and to publiſh every where, that his diſciples had ſtolen the body out of the ſepulchre. What! the body taken away while the ſepulchre was guarded by Roman ſoldiers? Yes! the diſciples ſtole the body while the ſoldiers ſlept. A ſtory ſo inconſiſtent, and which ſo evidently carries the marks of its own confutation with it, deſerves no anſwer. The prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not be ſo ſtupid as not to foreſee what conſtruction the world would put upon the relation of perſons, who pretended to know and tell what was done while they were aſleep, and in a ſtate of inſenſibility.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER Mary Magdalene was gone to inform the diſciples that the ſtone was rolled away from the mouth of the ſepulchre, and the ſuppoſed body taken away, Mary and Salome drew near towards the ſepulchre, and at their arrival found what they expected, the body of their beloved Maſter gone from the place where it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited by Nicodemus and Joſeph of Arimathea; but at the ſame time beheld, to their great aſtoniſhment, a beautiful young man, in ſhining raiment, very glorious to behold, ſitting at the right ſide of the ſepulchre. Matthew tells us, that it was the angel who had rolled away the ſtone, and frightened away the guards from the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre. It ſeems he had now laid aſide his terrors in which he was then arrayed, and aſſumed the form and dreſs of a human being, in order that theſe pious women, who had accompained him during the greateſt part of the time of his public miniſtry, might not be terrified: but, notwithſtanding his beauty and benign appearance, they were greatly affrighted, and on the point of turning back when the heavenly meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to baniſh their fears, told them, in a gentle accent, that he knew their errend: <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus, which was crucified. He is not here; for he is riſen, as he ſaid:</hi> and then invited them to come down into the ſepulchre, and view the place where the Son of God had lain; that is, to look on the linen clothes, and the napkin that was about his head, and which he had left behind him when he roſe
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:029927_0282_0FE33A2FEAE92F08"/>
from the dead: for to look at the place in any other view would not have tended to confirm their faith of his being riſen.</p>
               <p>GREATLY encouraged by the agreeable news, as well as by the ſweet accent with which this meſſenger from the heavenly Canaan delivered his ſpeech, the women went down into the ſepulchre, when behold another of the angelic choir appeared. Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the one ſat at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of JESUS had lain; the poſition in which they appeared to Mary Magdalene afterwards.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER they did not yet ſeem to give credit to what was told them by the angels; and therefore the other gently chid them for ſeeking the living amongſt the dead, with an intention to do him an office due only to the latter, and for not believing what was told them by a meſſenger from heaven, or rather for not remembering the words which their great Maſter had himſelf told them with regard to his own reſurrection: <hi>Why ſeek ye the living amongst the dead? He is not here, but is riſen: remember how he ſpake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, ſaying, The ſon of man muſt be delivered into the hands of ſinful men, and be crucified, and the third day riſe again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this, when the women had ſatisfied their curioſity by looking at the place where our Lord had lain, and where nothing was to be found but the linen cloths, the angel who firſt appeared to them reſumed the diſcourſe, and bade them to go and tell his diſciples, particularly Peter, the glad-tidings of his reſurrection from the dead; that he was going before them to Galilee; and that they ſhould there have the pleaſure of ſeeing him in perſon.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, were ordered to go into Galilee to meet their great and beloved Maſter, becauſe they were now moſt of them in Jeruſalem, celebrating the paſſover; and it may eaſily be imagined that, on the receiving the news of the Lord's reſurrection, many, if not all of them, would reſolve to tarry in Jeruſalem, in expectation of meeting him: a thing which muſt have proved of great detriment to them at that time of the year, when the harveſt was about to begin, the ſheaf of firſt fruits being always offered on the ſecond day of the paſſover-week. In order therefore to prevent their ſtaying ſo long from home, the meſſage was ſent direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to return to Galilee, with full aſſurance, that they ſhould there have the pleaſure of ſeeing their great Lord and Maſter; and by that means be happily relieved from the ſuſpicion of his being an impoſtor, which doubtleſs had ariſen in their minds, when they ſaw him expire on the croſs. Hereupon the women, highly elated with the news of their Lord's reſurrection, left the ſepulchre immediately, and ran to carry the diſciples theſe glad-tidings.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, Peter and John, having been informed by Mary Magdalene, that the ſtone was rolled away, and the body of JESUS not to be found, were haſtening to the grave, and miſſed the women who had ſeen this viſion of angels. Theſe diſciples being aſtoniſhed at what Mary Magdalene had told them, and deſirous of having their doubts cleared up, made all the haſte poſſible to the ſepulchre; and John being youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Peter, arrived at the ſepulchre firſt, but did not go in, contenting himſelf with ſtooping down and ſeeing the linen cloths lying which had been wrapped about our Saviour's body. Peter ſoon arrived, and went into the ſepulchre, where he ſaw the <hi>linen cloths lie; and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is the opinion of ſome, that our dear Redeemer folded up the napkin, to ſhew the perfect calmneſs and compoſure with which he aroſe, as out of a common ſleep: but however that be, it is certain that he left the grave clothes in the ſepulchre, to

ſhew that his body was not ſtolen away by his diſciples, who in ſuch a caſe would not have taken time to have ſtripped it: beſides, the circumſtance of the grave-clothes, diſpoſed the diſciples themſelves to believe, when the reſurrection was related to them; but at preſent they had not the leaſt ſuſpicion that he was riſen from the dead, as the angels had affirmed.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus ſatisfied themſelves that what Mary Magdalene had told them was really true, thoſe two diſciples returned to their reſpective habitations: but Mary continued weeping at the door of the ſepulchre: ſhe had, it ſeems, followed Peter and John to the garden, but did not return with them, being anxious to find the body; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtepping down into the ſepulchre to examine it once more, ſhe ſaw two angels ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of JESUS had lain. They were now in the ſame poſition, as when they appeared to the other women; but had rendered themſelves inviſible while Peter and John were at the ſepulchre, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord.</p>
               <p>MARY, beholding theſe heavenly meſſengers dreſſed in the robes of light, was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified: but they, in the moſt endearing accent, aſked her, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, <hi>Becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> On pronouncing theſe words, ſhe turned herſelf about, and ſaw JESUS ſtanding near her; but the terror ſhe was in, and the garments in which he was now dreſſed, prevented her from knowing him for ſome time. JESUS repeated the ſame queſtion uſed before by the angel, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> To which Mary who now ſuppoſed him to be the gardner, anſwered, Sir, if his body was troubleſome in the ſepulchre, and thou haſt removed him, tell me where he is depoſited, and I will take him away. But our bleſſed Saviour willing to remove her anxiety, called her by her name, with his uſual tone of voice. On which ſhe immediately knew him; and falling down before him, would have embraced his knees, according to that modeſty and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with which the women of the Eaſt ſaluted the men, eſpecially thoſe who were their ſuperiors in ſtation and dignity.</p>
               <p>JESUS refuſed this compliment, telling her, that he was not going immediately into heaven: he was often to ſhew himſelf to his diſciples before he aſcended, ſo that ſhe would have frequent opportunities of ſhewing her regard to him: and at the ſame time, ſaid to her, <hi>Go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my father, and your father; and to my God, and your God.</hi> Thus did the bleſſed JESUS contemplate with a ſingular pleaſure the work of redemption he had juſt finiſhed. The happy relation between God and man, which had been long cancelled by ſin, was now renewed: the Almighty, who had diſowned them on account of their rebellion was again reconciled unto them: he was become their God and Father: they were exalted to the honourable relation of CHRIST's brethren, and the ſons of God; and their father loved them with an affection far exceeding that of the moſt tender-hearted parent upon earth.</p>
               <p>THE kindneſs of this meſſage ſent by our dear Redeemer to his diſciples, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above all praiſe, if we remember their late behaviour; they had every one of them forſaken him in his greateſt extremity when he was ſcourged and mocked by the Roman ſoldiers, derided by his countrymen, and ſpitefully entreated by all, they hid themſelves in ſome place of ſafety, and preferred their own ſecurity to the deliverance of their Maſter: when he fainted under the burden of the croſs, not one of them was there to aſſiſt him; Simon, a Cyrenian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as compelled by the Roman ſoldiers to eaſe him of this pondrous burden. But notwithſtanding they had refuſed to aſſiſt their Maſter during his ſufferings
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:029927_0285_0FE33A3B8F1ADA10"/>
for the ſins of the world, he graciouſly, he freely forgave them; he aſſured them of their pardon, and even called them by the endearing name of brethren, notwithſtanding their former ſlighting conduct.</p>
               <p>WE cannot help obſerving that there is ſomething very remarkable in this part of the hiſtory: none of the apoſtles, or male diſciples were honoured with the firſt viſions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngels, or with the immediate news of the reſurrection of the Son of God, much leſs with the appearance of JESUS himſelf. The angels in the ſepulchre kept themſelves inviſible all the time that Peter and John were obſerving the linen cloths and ſatisfying themſelves that the body of their Maſter was not there: perhaps the male diſciples in general were treated with this mark of diſreſpect, both becauſe they had, with ſhameful cowardice, forſaken their Maſter when he was betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and becauſe their faith was ſo weak that they had abſolutely deſpaired of his being the Meſſiah when they ſaw him expire on the croſs: but how different was that conduct of the women! Laying aſide the weakneſs and timidity natural to their ſex, they ſhewed an uncommon magnanimity on this melancholy occaſion; for in contradiction to the whole nation, who with one voice required JESUS to be crucified as a deceiver, they proclaimed his innocence by tears, cries, and lamentations, when they ſaw him led forth to ſuffer on mount Calvary; accompanied him to the croſs, the moſt infamous of all puniſhments; kindly waited on him in his expiring moments, giving him all the conſolation in their power, though at the ſame time the ſight of his ſufferings pierced them to the heart; and when he expired, and was carried off, they accompanied him to his grave, not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, though they found he had not delivered himſelf, but to appearance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by death, the univerſal enemy of mankind. Perhaps theſe pious women enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome faint hopes that he would ſtill revive; or, if they did not entertain expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of that kind, they at leaſt cheriſhed a ſtrong degree of love for their Lord, and determined to do him all poſſible honour.</p>
               <p>IT may be obſerved, a faith ſo remarkably ſtrong, a love ſo ardent, and a fortitude ſo unſhaken, could not fail of receiving diſtinguiſhing tokens of the divine approbation; and they were accordingly honoured with the news of CHRIST's reſurrection before the male diſciples had their eyes cheered with the firſt ſight of their beloved Lord, after he aroſe from the chambers of the grave; ſo that they preached the joyful tidings of his reſurrection to the apoſtles themſelves. But there ſeems to have been other reaſons why our great Redeemer ſhewed himſelf firſt to the women: the thoughts of the apoſtles were conſtantly fixed on a temporal kingdom, and they had wreſted all his words into an agreement with that favourite notion; and whatever they could not conſtrue as conſonant to that opinion, they ſeemed either to have diſbelieved or diſregarded.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING JESUS had foretold his own ſuffering no leſs than ſeven different times, the apoſtles were aſtoniſhed above meaſure when they ſaw him expire on the croſs. Immortality and terreſtial dominion were, according to their notion, the characteriſtics of the Meſſiah; for which reaſon, when they found that inſtead of eſtabliſhing himſelf in the poſſeſſion of the univerſal empire, he had neither delivered himſelf from an handful of enemies, nor even from death, they gave over all hopes of his being the Meſſiah: and as for his reſurrection, they ſeem not to have entertained the leaſt notion of it; ſo that, when the news of this great event was brought to them, they conſidered it as an idle tale. But not ſo the women; they were more ſubmiſſive to their Maſter's inſtructions, and conſequently were much better prepared for ſeeing him after his reſurrection than the apoſtles: for though they did not expect that he would riſe from the dead, yet they were not prejudiced againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:029927_0286_0FE33A3D1327F228"/>THE apoſtles, on the other hand, not only abſolutely rejected the matter at firſt, as a thing incredible, but even after they were acquainted with the accounts the ſoldiers had given of this tranſaction; nay, after they had ſeen the bleſſed JESUS himſelf, ſome of them were ſo unreaſonable as ſtill to doubt. How much rather then would their incredulity have led them to ſuſpect his appearing as an illuſion, had he ſhewed himſelf to them! Theſe reports led them to recollect the arguments proper for diſpoſing them to believe; particularly the prophecies that had been ſo often delivered in their own hearing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his reſurrection. Hence the angels, when they told this event to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> men, and deſired them to carry the news of it to his diſciples, put them in mind of the predictions JESUS himſelf had made, as a confirmation of it. Hence we alſo ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why JESUS, before he made himſelf known to the diſciples at Emmaus, prepared them for a diſcovery, by expounding to them on the road, the ſeveral prophecies concerning the Meſſiah, contained in the Old Teſtament, which hitherto they had little attended to, or did not underſtand.</p>
               <p>THE company of women, we have obſerved, returned to the city, while Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene, were at the ſepulchre. On their arrival they told as many of the diſciples as they could find, that they had ſeen at the ſepulchre a viſion of angels, who aſſured them that JESUS was riſen from the dead. This new information aſtoniſhed the diſciples exceedingly: and as they had before ſent Peter and John to examine into the truth of what Mary Magdalene had told them concerning the body's being removed out of the ſepulchre, ſo they now judged it highly proper to ſend ſome of their number to ſee the angels, and learn from them the joyful tidings of that great tranſaction of which the women had given them an account. That this was really the caſe, appears from what the diſciples, in their journey to Emmaus, told their great Lord and Maſter; namely they, when the women came and told them that they had ſeen a viſion of angels, certain of their number went to the ſepulchre, and found it even as the women had ſaid, but ſaw not JESUS.</p>
               <p>WE may venture to affirm, that this ſecond deputation from the apoſtles did not go alone; for as Mary Magdalene returned with Peter and John, who went to examine the truth of her information, ſo the women who brought an account of the viſion of angels, in all probability returned with thoſe who were ſent to be witneſſes of the truth of their report: beſides curioſity, they had an errand thither. The angels had expreſsly ordered them to tell the news to Peter in particular; for which reaſon, when they underſtood that he was gone to the ſepulchre, it is natural to think they would return with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to ſeek him. About the time that the diſciples and women ſet out for the ſepulchre, Peter and John reached the city, but paſſing through a different ſtreet, did not meet their brethren in the way.</p>
               <p>HAVING a great deſire to reach the ſepulchre, the diſciples ſoon left the women behind, and juſt as they arrived, Mary Magdalene having ſeen the Lord, was coming away; but they did not meet her, becauſe they entered the garden at one door, while ſhe was coming out at another. When they came to the ſepulchre, they ſaw the angels, and received from them the news of their bleſſed Maſter's reſurrection; for St. Luke tells us, <hi>they found it even as the women had ſaid.</hi> Highly elated with their ſucceſs, they departed and ran back to the city, with ſuch expedition, that they gave an account of what they had ſeen in the hearing of the two diſciples, before Mary Magdalene arrived. Nor will their ſpeed appear at all incredible, if we conſider that the nature of the tidings the apoſtles had to carry gave them wings, as it were, to make their brethren partakers of their joy at this ſurpriſing event.</p>

that very morning riſen from the dead, JESUS himſelf overtook them, and joined their company.</p>
               <p>APPEARING like a ſtranger, they did not in the leaſt ſuſpect, that their fellow-traveller was no other than the great Redeemer of the ſons of men. He ſoon entered into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them, by inquiring what event had ſo cloſely engaged them in converſation, and why they appeared ſo ſorrowful and dejected, as if they had met with ſome heavy diſappointment or ſore affliction?</p>
               <p>CLEOPHAS, one of the diſciples, being ſurpriſed at the queſtion, replied, is it poſſible, that you can be ſo great a ſtranger to the affairs of the world, as to have been at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and not have heard the ſurpriſing events that have happened there: events that have aſtoniſhed the whole city, and are now the conſtant topic of converſation amongſt all the inhabitants? JESUS anſwered, what ſurpriſing events do you mean? To which Cleophas replied, The tranſactions which have happened concerning JESUS of Nazareth, who appeared as a great prophet and teacher ſent from God; and accordingly was highly venerated amongſt the people, for the excellency of his doctrine, and the number, benefit, and greatneſs of his miracles. Our chief prieſts and elders, therefore, envying him as one who leſſened their authority over the people, apprehended him, and found means to put him to death; but we firmly believed he would have proved himſelf the Meſſiah, or great Deliverer: and this perſuaſion we a long time ſupported, nor were we willing to abandon it, even when we ſaw him put to death: but it is now three days ſince theſe things were done, and therefore begin to fear we were miſtaken concerning him.</p>
               <p>A thing indeed happened this very morning, which extremely ſurpriſes us, and we are very ſolicitous with regard to the event. Some women who had entertained the ſame hopes and expectations as we, going early in the morning to pay their laſt duties to their Maſter, by embalming his body, returned with great haſte to the city, and informed us, that they had been at the ſepulchre, but were diſappointed in finding the body; and to increaſe our ſurpriſe, they added, that they had ſeen a viſion of angels, who told them that JESUS was riſen from the dead. This relation appeared at firſt to us as an idle tale, altogether incredible; but two of the company going immediately after to the ſepulchre, found every thing exactly as the women had reported; they ſaw the angels, but heard not any thing of the body—ſo that we are ſtill in doubt and perplexity with regard to this wonderful event, and what the end of theſe things will be. JESUS replied, why are ye ſo very averſe to believe all that the prophets have with one voice predicted concerning the Meſſiah? Is it not clearly, and very expreſsly foretold, in all the prophetic writings, that it was appointed by the council of Omnipotence for the Meſſiah to ſuffer in this manner, and that after ſuſtaining the greateſt indignities, reproach, and contempt from the malice and perverſeneſs of mankind, and even undergoing an ignominious and cruel death, to be exalted to a glorious and eternal kingdom. After having ſaid this, he began at the writings of Moſes, and explained to them in order, all the principal paſſages, both in the books of that great legiſlator, and the writings of the other prophets, relating to his own ſufferings, death, and glorious reſurrection, as predicted of them.</p>
               <p>THIS he did, with ſuch ſurpriſing plainneſs, clearneſs, and ſtrength, that the two diſciples, not yet ſuſpecting who he was, were as much amazed to find a ſtranger ſo well acquainted with all that JESUS did and ſuffered, as they at firſt wondered at his appearing to be totally ignorant of theſe tranſactions. They were alſo aſtoniſhed to hear him inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and apply the Scriptures to their preſent purpoſe, with ſuch readineſs and convincing clearneſs of argument, as carried with it a ſtrange and unuſual authority and efficacy.
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:029927_0289_0FE33A494C2F8D78"/>
When therefore they came to the village whither they were going, and JESUS ſeemed as if he would have paſſed on and travelled further, they deſirous of his company, preſſed him, in the ſtrongeſt manner, to tarry with them that night, as it was then late in the evening.</p>
               <p>THE great Redeemer of mankind conſented to this requeſt, and when they were ſat down to ſupper, he took bread, and gave thanks to God, and brake it, and gave it to them in the ſame manner he uſed to do while he converſed with them upon earth, before his death. This engaged their attention, and looking ſtedfaſtly on him, they perceived it was their great and beloved Maſter; but they had then no time to expreſs their joy and aſtoniſhment to their benevolent Redeemer; for he vaniſhed out of their ſight immediately.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner did they perceive that their Maſter was departed, than they ſaid one to another, How ſlow and ſtupid were we before, not to know him on the road while he explained to us the Scriptures, when beſides the affability of his diſcourſe, and the ſtrength and clearneſs of his arguments, we perceived ſuch an authority in what he ſaid, and ſuch a powerful efficacy attending his words, and ſtriking our hearts with affection, as we could not but have known, if we had not been remarkably ſtupid, to have been the very ſame that uſed to accompany his teaching, and was peculiar to our dear Maſter, who ſpake as never man ſpoke.</p>
               <p>AFTER this ſurpriſing event, they did not think proper to ſtay any longer in Emmaus, but returned that very night to Jeruſalem and found the apoſtles, with ſeveral other diſciples, diſcourſing about the reſurrection of their Maſter; and on their entering the room, the diſciples accoſted them, ſaying, <hi>The Lord is riſen indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE reports of the women were little credited, ſuppoſing they were occaſioned more by imagination than reality; but when a perſon of Simon's capacity and gravity declared he had ſeen the Lord, they began to think that he was really riſen from the dead. Their belief of this was greatly confirmed by the arrival of the two diſciples from Emmaus, who declared to their brethren, how JESUS had appeared to them on the road and how they diſcovered him to be their Maſter, by his breaking of bread, when he ſat down to ſupper with them.</p>
               <p>DURING this converſation of the diſciples from Emmaus, deſcribing the manner of the appearing of JESUS to them, and offering arguments to convince thoſe who doubted the truth of it, their great Maſter himſelf put an end to the debate, by ſtanding in the midſt of them, and ſaid, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE diſciples were greatly terrified at this appearance of our bleſſed Saviour, ſuppoſing they had ſeen a ſpirit; for as they had ſecured the doors of the houſe where they were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, and JESUS having opened the locks, by his miraculous power, without the knowledge of any in the houſe, it was natural for them to think that a ſpiritual ſubſtance only could enter. The circumſtance therefore of the doors being ſhut, is very happily mentioned by St. John; becauſe it ſuggeſts a reaſon why the diſciples took their Maſter for a ſpirit, notwithſtanding many of them were convinced that he was really riſen from the dead, and were that moment converſing about the event.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, to diſpel their fears and doubts; JESUS came forward, ſpake to them in the moſt endearing accent, ſhewed them his hands and his feet, and deſired them to handle him, in order to convince themſelves by the united report of their different ſenſes,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:029927_0290_0FE33A4AD1112400"/>
that it was he himſelf, and no ſpectre or apparition: <hi>Why are ye troubled,</hi> ſaid the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Redeemer of mankind, <hi>and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myſelf: handle me, and ſee; for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> Luke xxiv.38, 39.</p>
               <p>BY theſe infallible proofs, the diſciples were ſufficiently convinced of the truth of their Lord's reſurrection, and they received him with rapture and exultation: but their joy and wonder had ſo great an affect on their minds, that ſome of them, ſenſible of the great commotion they were in, ſuſpended their belief, till they had conſidered the matter more calmly: JESUS therefore knowing their thoughts, called for meat, and eat with them, in order to prove more fully the truth of his reſurrection from the dead, and the reality of his preſence with them at this time. When JESUS had given this further occular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his having vanquiſhed the power of death, and opened the tremendous portals of the grave, he again repeated his ſalutation. <hi>Peace be unto you;</hi> adding, The ſame commiſſion that my Father hath given unto me, I give unto you: go ye therefore into every part of the world, and preach the goſpel to all the children of men. Then breathing on them, he ſaid, <hi>receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to direct and aſſiſt you in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of your commiſſion: whoſoever embraces your doctrine, and ſincerely repents, ye ſhall remit his ſins, and your ſentence of abſolution ſhall be ratified and confirmed in the courts of heaven: and whoſoever either obſtinately rejects your doctrine, diſobeys it, or behaves himſelf unworthily, after he hath embraced it, his ſins ſhall not be forgiven him; but the cenſure ye ſhall paſs upon him on earth, ſhall be confirmed in heaven, to his condemnation.</p>
               <p>AT this meeting of the apoſtles, Thomas, otherwiſe called Didymus, was abſent; nor did this happen without the ſpecial direction of Providence, that the particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſatisfaction which was afterwards granted him, might be an abundant and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable teſtimony of the truth of our bleſſed Saviour's reſurrection, to all ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. The reſt of the apoſtles therefore told him, that they had ſeen the Lord, and repeated to him the words he had delivered in their hearing: but Thomas replied, This event is of ſuch great importance, that unleſs, to prevent all poſſibility of deception, I ſee him with my own eyes, and feel him with my own hands, putting my fingers into the print of the nails whereby he was faſtened to the croſs, and thruſting my hand into his ſide which the ſoldier pierced with his ſpear; I will not believe that he is riſen from the dead in reality and truth, as ye affirm.</p>
               <p>WE have now enumerated, in the moſt explicit manner, the tranſactions of that day, on which the great Redeemer of mankind aroſe from the dead; a day highly to be remembered by the children of men, throughout all generations; a day, in which was fully completed and diſplayed the conceptions lodged in the breaſt of Infinite Wiſdom from all eternity; even thoſe thoughts of love and mercy, on which the ſalvation of the world depended, Chriſtians have, therefore, the higheſt reaſon to ſolemnize this day with gladneſs, each returning week, by ceaſing from their labour, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to prayer, pious meditations, and other exerciſes of religion. The redemption of mankind, which they weekly commemorate, affords matter of eternal thought; it is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject impoſſible to be equalled, and whoſe luſtre, neither length of time, nor frequent review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can either tarniſh or diminiſh: it reſembles the ſun, which we behold always the ſame glorious and luminous object; for the benefit we celebrate is, after ſo many ages, as freſh and beautiful as ever, and will always continue the ſame, flouriſhing in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of all reaſonable beings through the endleſs revolutions of eternity. Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the brighteſt mirror in which we contemplate the goodneſs of the Almightty,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:029927_0291_0FE33A4C57B127B0"/>
other gifts are only mites from the divine treaſury; but redemption opens, we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid exhauſts, all the ſtores of grace. May it be conſtantly the favourite ſubject of our meditations, more delightful to our muſing minds, than applauſe to the ambitious ear! May it be the darling theme of our diſcourſes; ſweeter to our tongues, than the droppings of the honey-comb to the taſte! May it be our choiceſt comfort, through all the changes of this mortal life, and the reviving cordial, even in the laſt extremities of diſſolution itſelf, and upon the verge of the grave!</p>
               <p>AFTER our great Redeemer had been riſen eight days from the dead, he ſhewed himſelf again to his diſciples while Thomas was with them, and upbraided that diſciple for his unbelief; but knowing that it did not, like that of the Phariſees, proceed from a wicked mind, but from an honeſt heart, and a ſincere deſire of being ſatisfied of the truth, he addreſſed himſelf particularly to this doubting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: Thomas, ſaid he, ſince thou wilt not be contented to rely on the teſtimony of others, but muſt be convinced by the experience of thy own ſenſes, behold the wounds in my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and doubt no longer of the reality of my reſurrection from the tomb.</p>
               <p>THE incredulous diſciple immediately obeyed the kind invitation of his Maſter; and being fully ſatisfied according to his own deſire, he cried out, I am abundantly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thou art indeed my Lord, the very ſame that was crucified; and I acknowledge thy almighty power, in having triumphed over death, and worſhip thee as my God and Saviour.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS replied, Becauſe thou haſt both ſeen and felt me, Thomas, thou haſt believed that I am really riſen from the dead. Bleſſed are they who without ſuch evidence of the ſenſes, ſhall, upon credible teſtimony, be willing to believe and embrace a doctrine, which tends ſo greatly to the glory of God, and the ſalvation of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS appeared, according to St. John, on ſeveral other occaſions to his diſciples after his reſurrection; and by many infallible proofs, not mentioned by the evangeliſts, fully convinced them, that he was alive after his paſſion: but that thoſe which are mentioned, are abundantly ſufficient to induce men to believe that JESUS was the Son of God, the great Meſſiah ſo often foretold by the ancient prophets; and that by means of that belief, they may obtain everlaſting life, in the happy regions of the heavenly Canaan, and there adore and praiſe him for ever.</p>
               <p>JESUS having firſt by the angels, and afterwards in perſon, ordered his diſciples to repair to their reſpective habitations in Galilee, it is reaſonable to think they would leave Jeruſalem as ſoon as poſſible. This they accordingly did, and on their arrival at their reſpective places of abode, applied themſelves to their uſual occupations; and the apoſtles returned to their old trade of fiſhing on the lake of Tiberius. Here they were toiling with their nets very early in the morning, and ſaw JESUS ſtanding on the ſhore, but did not then know him to be their Maſter, as it was ſomething dark, and they at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from him. He, however, called to them, and aſked if they had taken any fiſh; to which they anſwered, they had caught nothing: he then deſired them to let down their nets on the right ſide of the boat, and they ſhould not be diſappointed. The diſciples imagining that he might be acquainted with the places proper for fiſhing, did as he had directed them, and encloſed in their net ſo vaſt a multitude of fiſhes, that they were not able to draw it into the boat, but were forced to drag it after them in the water towards the land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="unknown:029927_0292_0FE33A5563F4BA28"/>THEY had toiled, it ſeems, all the preceding night to no purpoſe; and therefore ſuch remarkable ſucceſs could not fail of cauſing various conjectures amongſt them, with regard to a ſtranger on the ſhore, who had given them ſuch happy advice. Some of the diſciples declared they could not imagine who he was; but others were perſuaded, that this perſon was no other than their great and beloved Maſter, John was fully convinced of his being the Lord, and accordingly told his thoughts to Simon Peter; who making no doubt of it, girt on his fiſher's coat, and leaped into the ſea, in order to get aſhore ſooner than the boat could be brought to land, dragging after it a net full of ſuch large fiſhes as were almoſt ready to ſink it.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples, when they came aſhore, found a fire kindled, and on it a fiſh broiling, and near it ſome bread: but neither being ſufficient for the company, JESUS bid them bring ſome of the fiſh they had now caught, and invited them to eat with him. Thus did the bleſſed JESUS prove again to his diſciples the reality of his reſurrection, not only by eating with them, but by working a miracle, like that which, at the beginning of his miniſtry, had made ſuch an impreſſion upon them, as diſpoſed them to be his conſtant followers. This was the third time that JESUS appeared publicly to a great number of his diſciples in a body, beſides his ſhewing himſelf to particular perſons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpecial occaſions and at divers times.</p>
               <p>AFTER they had eaten, JESUS reminded Peter how diligent and zealous he ought to be, in order to wipe off the ſtain of his denying him, when he was carried before the high-prieſt: <hi>Simon, ſon of Jonas,</hi> ſaid our bleſſed Saviour to him, art thou more zealous and affectionate in thy love towards me, than the reſt of my diſciples? To which Peter anſwered, <hi>Yea, Lord; thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> He was taught modeſty and diffidence by his late fall; and therefore, would not compare himſelf with others, but humbly appealed to his Maſter's omniſcience for the ſincerity of his regard to him. JESUS anſwered, Expreſs then thy love towards me by the care of my flock committed to thy charge: <hi>Feed my Lambs, feed my ſheep.</hi> I well know indeed, continued the bleſſed JESUS, that thou wilt continue my faithful ſhepherd even until death: for the time will come when thou, who now girdeſt on thy fiſhers' coat voluntarily, and ſtretchedſt out thy hands to come to me, ſhalt in thine old age be girt by others, and forced to ſtretch out thy hands againſt thy will, in a very different manner, for the ſake of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant profeſſion of my religion</p>
               <p>JESUS, by theſe laſt words, ſignified the manner of Peter's death, and that he ſhould finally ſuffer martyrdom for the glory of God, and the teſtimony of the truth of the Chriſtian religion, which he had been inſtrumental in propagating to the world.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples being now about to meet their great Lord and Maſter, according to the meſſage he had ſent them by the women, and having, in all probability, appointed this meeting at ſome former appearance, not mentioned by the evangeliſts, the brethren ſet out for the mountain in Galilee, perhaps that on which he was transfigured. Here five hundred of them were gathered together, waiting the joyful ſight of their great Maſter, after he had triumphed over death and the grave; ſome of them not having yet ſeen him after his reſurrection from the dead.</p>
               <p>THE diſciples did not wait long before JESUS appeared, on which they were ſeized with rapture; and with hearts overflowing with gladneſs, they approached their kind, their benevolent Maſter, and worſhipped him. Some few, indeed, doubted, it being a thing agreeable to nature for men to be afraid to believe what they vehemently wiſh, leſt
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029927_0293_0FE33A572C331428"/>
they ſhould indulge themſelves in falſe joys, which vaniſh like the morning cloud. But JESUS afterwards appeared frequently to them, and gave all of them full ſatisfaction, and inſtructed them in many things relating to their preaching the goſpel, eſtabliſhing the church, and ſpreading it through the known world.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, either at his appearance on the mountain, or ſome ſubſequent appearance, not mentioned by the evangeliſts, probably ordered them to return to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, as he propoſed to aſcend viſibly into heaven from the top of the mount of Olives.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ABOUT twelve days before the feaſt of Pentechoſt, called in the law <hi>the feaſt of weeks,</hi> and nearly forty days after our bleſſed Saviour aroſe from the dead, the diſciples repaired to Jeruſalem, probably in conformity to a command given them by their great Maſter at one of his appearances; unleſs we ſuppoſe they went up to that city, in order to purify and prepare themſelves for the ſolemnity now approaching.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER that may be, the bleſſed JESUS made his laſt appearance here to his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: and, after inſtructing them in many particulars concerning the kingdom of God, and the manner they were to behave themſelves in propagating the doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he put them in mind that, during his abode with them in Galilee, he had often told them, that all things written in the law, the prophets, and the Pſalms concerning him, were to be exactly accompliſhed. At the ſame time, he opened their underſtandings, that is, he removed their prejudices by the operation of his ſpirit, cleared their doubts, improved their memories, ſtrengthened their judgments, and enabled them to diſcern the true meaning of the Scriptures reſpecting his divine miſſion.</p>
               <p>BEING thus qualified by him for receiving the truth, he again aſſured them that both Moſes and the prophets had foretold that the Meſſiah was to ſuffer in the very manner he had ſuffered, that he was to riſe from the dead on the third day, as he had done, and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins was to be preached in the Meſſiah's name amongſt all nations, beginning with the Jews at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>AFTER this, he delivered unto them their commiſſion to preach the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins in his name amongſt all nations, and to teſtify unto the world the exact accompliſhment in him of all things foretold concerning the Meſſiah; and, to enable them to perform this important work, promiſed to beſtow on them the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, which he called the promiſe of his Father; becauſe the Almighty had promiſed them by his prophets in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>BEING thus fortified for the important work they were going to undertake, he led them on to the Mount of Olives as far as Bethany; where, ſtanding on a hill above the town, he told them that he was now raiſed to the government of heaven and earth; for which reaſon, they might go courageouſly through all the world, and preach the goſpel to every rational creature; aſſuring themſelves that affairs in all countries ſhould be ſo ordered, as to diſpoſe the inhabitants for the reception of the goſpel; that they
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:029927_0294_0FE33A58B30EE088"/>
who believed, were to be admitted into his church by the rite of baptiſm, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; and to be taught, in conſequence of their baptiſm, to obey all the precepts he had enjoined them: that ſuch baptiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould receive pardon of their ſins, together with eternal life in the happy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Father's kingdom; but that thoſe who refuſed to embrace the doctrines of the goſpel, ſhould be for ever excluded thoſe happy regions, and have their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone; that while they were employed in this work, he would be with them to the end of the world, to guide them by his counſel, to aſſiſt them by his Spirit, and to protect them by his Providence. Finally, that thoſe who ſhould, through their preaching, be induced to believe, ſhould themſelves work moſt aſtoniſhing miracles, by which the goſpel ſhould be propagated with the greateſt rapidity and ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>AFTER JESUS had ſpoken theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he lifted up his hands and bleſſed them; and in the action of bleſſing them, he was parted from them in the midſt of the day, a ſhining cloud receiving him out of their ſight: that is, this brilliant cloud encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him about, and carried him up to heaven, not ſuddenly, but at leiſure, that they might behold him departing, and ſee the proof of his having come down from heaven, as he had promiſed them.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS aſcended in a cloud which was more bright and pure than the cleareſt lambent flame, being no other than the Shechinab, or glory of the Lord, the viſible ſymbol of the divine Preſence which had ſo often appeared to the patriarchs of old, which filled the temple at its dedication, and which, in its greateſt ſplendour, cannot be beheld with mortal eyes; for which reaſon, it is called the light inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in which the Almighty reſides, and with which he is ſurrounded.</p>
               <p>IT was probably on this occaſion that our Lord's body was changed, acquiring the glories of immortality, perhaps in the preſence of his diſciples, who ſtedfaſtly beheld him as he mounted from the earth. And as he aſcended, the flaming cloud that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him marked his paſſage through the air, but gradually loſt its magnitude in the eyes of thoſe who ſtood below, till at laſt it vaniſhed, together with their beloved Maſter, out of their ſight; for he was received up where the Divine Being manifeſts himſelf in a peculiar manner, and was ſet down on the righthand of the Majeſty on high; all power in heaven and in earth being now given him: and this univerſal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will hold, till he eſtabliſhes the dominion of righteouſneſs, when he will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, <hi>that God may be all in all.</hi> 1 Cor. xv.28.</p>
               <p>THUS did the great Redeemer of mankind depart in a moſt illuſtrious manner, after having finiſhed the grand work which he left the boſom of his Father to execute; a work which God himſelf, in the remoteſt eternity, contemplated with pleaſure, which angels with joy deſcried as to happen, and which, through all eternity to come, ſhall at periods the moſt immenſely diſtant from the time of its execution, be looked back upon with inexpreſſible delight by every inhabitant of heaven; for though the minute affairs of time may vaniſh altogether and be loſt, when they are removed far back by the endleſs progreſſion of duration, this object is ſuch, that no diſtance, however great, can leſſen it: the kingdom of heaven is erected on the incarnation and ſufferings of the Son of God, the kingdom and city of the Almighty comprehending all the virtuous beings in the univerſe, made happy by goodneſs and love; and, therefore, none of them can ever forget the foundation on which their happineſs ſtands eſtabliſhed: the human ſpecies in particular, recovered by the labour of the Son of God, will view their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:029927_0295_0FE33A5A39855780"/>
and look back on his ſtupendous undertaking with the higheſt rapture, while they are feaſting without interruption, on its delicious fruits: the reſt of the members of the city of God, will contemplate it with perpetual pleaſure, as the happy means of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their kindred that were loſt; poſſibly the grand confirmation of the whole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſyſtem, in ſubjection to him who reigned for ever, whoſe favour is better than life itſelf, and at whoſe right-hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</p>
               <p>WE have now followed our dear Redeemer through all the tranſactions of his life, and enlarged on the ſtupendous miracles of his reſurrection, as the whole Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is founded on that glorious event. And it is abundantly evident from this hiſtory, that our bleſſed Saviour ſhewed himſelf to his diſciples and friends only, not to the Jews in general. This circumſtance gave Spinoza a pretence for raiſing an objection, which his diſciples have conſidered as the ſtrongeſt argument againſt our Lord's reſurrection. 'If, ſay they, he really roſe from the dead, to have ſhewed himſelf to his enemies as well as to his friends, would have put the truth of his reſurrection beyond all doubt, than which nothing could be more neceſſary to the cauſe of Chriſtianity; and therefore, the ſuppoſition of his having confined his appearances, after his reſurrection, to a few ſelect friends, renders the affair extremely ſuſpicious and unworthy of credit.'</p>
               <p>THIS argument however plauſible it may appear at firſt ſight, is deſtitute of the leaſt force; becauſe it may be demonſtrated, that if JESUS had ſhewed himſelf to his enemies, and to all the people in general, theſe appearances, inſtead of putting the truth of his reſurrection beyond all doubt, would have weakened the evidence of it, at leaſt in after-ages; and, conſequently, have been of infinite prejudice to mankind—for upon the ſuppoſition that our bleſſed Saviour had ſhewed himſelf openly, one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily have happened; either his enemies, ſubmitting to the evidence of their ſenſes, would have believed his reſurrection, or, reſiſting that evidence, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it altogether. We ſhall begin with taking the latter into conſideration.</p>
               <p>ITS very evident, that thoſe enemies of the great Redeemer of mankind, who reſiſted the evidence of their ſenſes, or who, though really convinced, would not acknowledge their conviction, muſt have juſtified their diſbelief by affirming that the perſon who appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>d to them, as riſen from the dead, was not JESUS whom the Roman governor had crucified, but an impoſtor who perſonated him. On any other foundation their infidelity would have been ridiculous and abſurd; but, if the unbelieving Jews, by our Lord's appearing perſonally to them, would have been laid under a neceſſity of denying the reality of his reſurrection, even though perſuaded of it in their own minds, the evidence of fact could have gained nothing by ſuch public appearances; becauſe the generality of the Jews were not capable of paſſing a judgment upon the falſehood which CHRIST's enemies muſt have made uſe of to ſupport their denial of his reſurrection, being unacquainted with JESUS, they could not certainly tell whether he was really the perſon whom the Romans had crucified. His apoſtles, diſciples, and acquaintance, who, by their long attendance on him, knew his ſtature, ſhape, air, voice, and manner, were the only proper perſons by whoſe determination the point in diſpute could be decided; conſequently, if our Lord had appeared to all the people, if any conſiderable number of his enemies had continued in their infidelity, the whole ſtreſs of the evidence of his reſurrection muſt have wreſted on the evidence of the very perſons who according to the plan pitched upon by Providence, bear witneſs to it now, and upon whoſe teſtimony the world has believed it: ſo that, inſtead of gaining an additional evidence by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed method, of ſhewing JESUS publicly to all the people, we ſhould have had nothing
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:029927_0296_0FE33A63493BC118"/>
to truſt to but the teſtimony of his diſciples, and that clogged with the incumbrance, that his reſurrection was denied by many to whom he appeared, and who were not convinced by the teſtimony of their ſenſes.</p>
               <p>IN the ſecond place, it may be ſuppoſed that in caſe our bleſſed Saviour had ſhewed himſelf publicly, the whole nation of the Jews muſt have believed, and that future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would thus have had the fulleſt evidence of the truth of his reſurrection, beyond all poſſibility of a doubt.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, this will not appear to be the caſe, if we conſider, that the greateſt part of our Lord's enemies having not given themſelves the trouble of attending him often, cannot be ſuppoſed to have been ſo well acquainted with his perſon as to know him with certainty; for which reaſon, though he had ſhewed himſelf to them, even their belief of his reſurrection muſt, in a great meaſure, have depended on the teſtimony of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and friends: if ſo, it is not very probable that his appearing publicly would have had any great effect on the Jews, to perſuade them to embrace a crucified Meſſiah. It is far more reaſonable to believe, that they would have rejected the whole, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their infidelity, unleſs a divine power interpoſed to remove the veil from their hearts.</p>
               <p>IN order to give the argument all the force the Deiſts can deſire, let us further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, in conſequence of our bleſſed Saviour's appearing to all the people of the Jews, the nation in general would have been convinced of the truth of his reſurrection, and become his diſciples; what advantage would the cauſe of Chriſtianity have reaped from ſuch effects of our Lord's public appearance? Would the evidence of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection have become thereby the more unqueſtionable? or would the modern infidels have been the better diſpoſed to believe in this crucified JESUS? By no means: for we do not find that men of this claſs are at all the more ready to believe the miracles of Moſes in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the Wilderneſs, becauſe the whole nation were witneſſes of them. The truth is, had our bleſſed Redeemer perſuaded all the people of the Jews, by appearing perſonally to them, the objections againſt his reſurrection would have been ten times more numerous and forcible than they are at preſent; for would not the whole have been called a ſtate-trick, a Jewiſh fable, a mere political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, to patch up their broken credit, after they had ſo long talked of a Meſſiah, who was to come at that time? Beſides, we ſhould certainly have been told, that the government being engaged in the plot, a fraud of this kind might have eaſily been carried on, eſpecially as the people in general would eagerly fall in with it; becauſe it was ſo exactly adapted to their prejudices, and becauſe the few who had ſagacity enough to detect the fraud, could have no opportunity of examining into it; or, if they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and detect the fraud, would not have dared to make any diſcovery of it, in oppoſition to the whole weight of the ſtate: ſo that they would let it paſs quietly, without once calling it in queſtion.</p>
               <p>THE reſurrection of our great Redeemer univerſally believed amongſt the Jews, and publiſhed to the world by the unanimous voice of the nation would, to ſay the truth, have been liable to an infinite number of objections, which are all effectually cut off by the method made choice of by the wiſdom of Providence; for as the people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the rulers in particular, continued in their infidelity, the perſons concerned in this ſuppoſed fraud, muſt have carried it on under the greateſt diſadvantages. The reaſon is, that inſtead of making many friends to aſſiſt them, which a fraud of this kind requires, all men were their enemies, and intereſted to diſcover the cheat. The Jewiſh rulers, in particular gave all poſſible encouragement to make the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny into
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:029927_0297_0FE33A651373DFA8"/>
the fact, and into all its circumſtances; and many doubtleſs, zealouſly made the inquiry with the utmoſt exactneſs. The apoſtles who preached the reſurrection, expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the fierceſt reſentment of the men in power; becauſe the reſurrection of our great Redeemer caſt the greateſt reflection upon thoſe who had put him to death. It ſhould alſo be remembered, that if the generality of the nation had not continued in their unbelief, the apoſtles, who preached the reſurrection, would not have ſuffered theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, which in every country were raiſed againſt them, chiefly by the Jews; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently one of the ſtrongeſt arguments for the truth of their teſtimony would have been wanting: whereas, by their having been perſecuted to death for their preaching the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their great Maſter, they fully demonſtrated how ſincerely they believed the great fact which they preached, in continual jeopardy of their lives, notwithſtanding the virulent malice and reſtleſs perſecution of their enemies.</p>
               <p>WE have thus endeavoured to anſwer, in the plaineſt and moſt ſatisfactory manner, the principal objection made by the Deiſts againſt the truth of our bleſſed Saviour's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and ſhall conclude this chapter with a few reflections on the life of the bleſſed JESUS; a life the greateſt and beſt that was ever led by man, or was ever the ſubject of any hiſtory ſince the univerſe was called from its original chaos, by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word of the Almighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſpake it into being.</p>
               <p>AS the human character of the bleſſed JESUS reſults from the accounts given of him by the evangeliſts (for they have not formally drawn it up) ſo it is entirely different from that of all other men whatſoever; for whereas they have ſelfiſh paſſions, deeply rooted in their breaſts, and are influenced by them in almoſt every thing they do, JESUS was ſo entirely free from them, that the moſt ſevere ſcrutiny cannot furniſh one ſingle action in the whole courſe of his life wherein he conſulted his own intereſt only: no, he was influenced by very different motives; the preſent happineſs and eternal welfare of ſinners regulated his conduct; and while others followed their reſpective occupations, JESUS had no other buſineſs than that of promoting the happineſs of the ſons of men; nor did he wait till he was ſolicited to extend his benevolent hand to the diſtreſſed; he went about doing good, and always accounted it more bleſſed to give than to receive; reſembling God rather than man, in every act of his life.</p>
               <p>PERSONS of the moſt exalted faculties are apt to be elated with ſucceſs and applauſe, or dejected by cenſure and diſappointments: but the bleſſed JESUS was never elevated by the one, nor depreſſed by the other; he was never more courageous than when he met with the greateſt oppoſition and cruel treatment, nor more humble than when the ſons of men worſhipped at his feet. He came into the world inſpired with the grandeſt purpoſe that ever was formed, that of ſaving from eternal perdition, not a ſingle nation, but the whole world; and in the execution of it, went through the longeſt and heavieſt train of labours that ever was ſuſtained, with a conſtancy and reſolution, on which no diſadvantageous impreſſion could be made by any accident whatever: calumny, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, bad ſucceſs, with many other evils conſtantly attending him, ſerved only to quicken his endeavours in this glorious enterpriſe, which he unweariedly purſued, even till he finiſhed it by his death on the croſs.</p>
               <p>MANKIND are prone to retaliate injuries received, and ſeem to take a ſatisfaction in complaining of the cruelties of thoſe who oppreſs them; whereas, the whole of CHRIST's labours breathed nothing but meekneſs, patience, and forgiveneſs, even to his bittereſt enemies, and in the midſt of the moſt excruciating torments. The words <hi>Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they do,</hi> uttered by him when his enemies were nailing
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:029927_0298_0FE33A66980356C0"/>
him to the croſs, fitly expreſs the temper which he maintained through the whole courſe of his life, even when aſſaulted by the heavieſt provocations. The truth is, he never ſignified, on any occaſion, the leaſt reſentment by ſpeech or action, nor indeed any emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind whatever, except ſuch as flowed from pity and charity; conſequently ſuch only as expreſſed the deepeſt concern for the welfare of mankind, to which his glorious life and ſufferings effectually opened the way.</p>
               <p>THE greateſt and beſt men have had their failings, which tarniſh the luſtre of their virtues, and ſhew them to have been nothing more than men. This was the caſe with Noah, Abraham, Moſes, Job, David, Paul, and other heroes celebrated in hiſtory; but it was otherwiſe with JESUS; he was ſuperior to all the men that ever lived, both with regard to the purity of his manners and the perfection of his virtues: he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparated from ſinners. Whether we conſider him as a teacher, or as a man, <hi>he did not ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> 1 Pet. ii.22. His whole life was perfectly free from ſpot or weakneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the ſame time it was remarkable for the greateſt and moſt extenſive exerciſes of virtue: but never to have committed the leaſt ſin in word or in deed, never to have uttered any ſentiment that could be cenſured, upon the various topics of religion and morality, which were the daily ſubjects of his diſcourſes, and that through the courſe of a life filled with the action, and led under the obſervation of many enemies, who had always acceſs to converſe with him, and who often came to find fault, is a pitch of perfection evidently above the reach of human nature, and, conſequently, he who poſſeſſed it, muſt have been divine, and a moſt perfect Being.</p>
               <p>This adorable Perſon is the ſubject of the evangelical hiſtory. If the reader, by reviewing his life, doctrine, and miracles, as they are here repreſented to him united in one ſeries, has a clearer idea of theſe things than before, or obſerves a beauty in his actions thus linked together, which taken ſeparately, do not appear ſo fully; if he feels himſelf touched by the character of JESUS in general, or with any of his ſermons and actions in particular, thus ſimply delineated in writing, whoſe principal charms are the beauties of truth; above all, if his dying ſo generouſly for men, ſtrikes him with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or fills him with joy, in the proſpect of that pardon which is hereby purchaſed for the world; let him ſeriouſly conſider with himſelf, what improvement he ought to make of the divine goodneſs, what returns of praiſe and gratitude due from him.</p>
               <p>THE Saviour of mankind, by his death, has ſet open the gates of immortality to all the poſterity of Adam; and by his word, ſpirit, and example, graciouſly offers to make them meet for the glorious rewards in the kingdom of the heavenly Canaan, and to conduct them into the inheritance of the ſaints in light: let us, therefore, remember, that, being born under the diſpenſation of his goſpel, we have, from our earlieſt years, enjoyed the beſt means of acquiring wiſdom, virtue, and happineſs, the lineaments of the image of God. We have been called to aſpire after an exaltation to the nature and felicity of the Almighty exhibited to mortal eyes in the man CHRIST JESUS, to fire us with the nobleſt ambition. His goſpel teaches us that we are made for eternity; and that our preſent life is to our future exiſtence, as infancy is to manhood: but as in the former, many things are to be learned, many hardſhips to be endured, many habits to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and that by a tedious courſe of exerciſes, which in themſelves though painful, and poſſibly uſeleſs to the child, yet are neceſſary to fit him for the buſineſs and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of manhood; ſo while we remain in this infancy of human life, things are to be learned, hardſhips to be endured, and habits to be acquired by a laborious courſe of diſcipline, which however painful, muſt be under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </argument>
               <p>WE cannot more properly conclude our hiſtory of the life of the bleſſed JESUS, the author and finiſher of our faith, nor place the great doctrines taught by the benevolent Son of the Moſt High, in a more conſpicuous light, than by removing a few prejudices which ſome, we fear too many, have formed againſt the religion of the holy JESUS, and ſhew that his yoke is eaſy, and his burden is light.</p>
               <p>THERE have not, perhaps, been greater enemies to the progreſs of religion, than thoſe who deleniate it in a gloomy and terrifying form; nor any guilty of a more injurious calumny againſt the goſpel, than thoſe who repreſent its precepts as rigorous impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and unneceſſary reſtraints. True religion is the perfection of human nature, and the foundation of uniform exalted pleaſure, of public order and private happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Chriſtianity is the moſt excellent and the moſt uſeful inſtitution, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come; it is the voice of reaſon; it is alſo the language of Scripture; the ways of wiſdom <hi>are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Prov. iii.17. And our bleſſed Saviour himſelf aſſures us, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are eaſy, and the burden of his religion light and pleaſant.</p>
               <p>THE religion which CHRIST came into this lower world to eſtabliſh, is a rational ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, a worſhip in ſpirit and truth, a worſhip worthy of the majeſty of the Almighty to receive, and of the nature of man to pay. One of its important branches is natural religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reinforced by additional motives and new diſcoveries: its poſitive rights are few, of plain and eaſy ſignificancy, and manifeſtly adopted to eſtabliſh a ſenſe of moral obligations. The goſpel places religion not in abſtruce ſpeculation and metaphyſical ſubtilties; not in outward ſhew and tedious ceremony; not in ſuperſtitious auſterities and enthuſiaſtic viſion, but in purity of heart, and holineſs of life. The ſum of our duty, according to our great Maſter himſelf, conſiſts in the <hi>love of God,</hi> and <hi>of our neighbour;</hi> according to St. Paul, in <hi>denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts;</hi> and in <hi>living ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world:</hi> according to St. James, in <hi>viſiting the fatherleſs and widows in affliction,</hi> and in <hi>keeping ourſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> This is the conſtant ſtrain and tenor of the goſpel; this it inculcates moſt earneſtly, and on this it lays the greateſt ſtreſs, as moſt conducive to true and ſubſtantial happineſs.</p>
               <p>IF it be aſked, whether the Chriſtian ſyſtem is only a republication of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or merely a refined ſyſtem of morality? We reply, No certainly; it is a great deal more. It is an act of grace, a ſtupendous plan of Providence, deſigned for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of mankind from a ſtate of degradation and ruin, to the favour of the Almighty, and to the hopes of a happy immortality through a Mediator. Under this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, true religion conſiſts in a repentance towards God, and in faith in the Lord JESUS
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:029927_0300_0FE33A6F1E82E1F0"/>
CHRIST, as the perſon appointed by the ſupreme authority of heaven and earth, to reconcile apoſtate man to his offended Creator, as a ſacrifice for ſin; our vital head, and governing Lord. This is the religion of Chriſtians; and what hardſhip, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action is there in all this? Surely none: nay, the practice of religion is much eaſier than the ſervitude of ſin, which at beſt is the vileſt drudgery, and yields the worſt kind of wages.</p>
               <p>ALL will readily agree, that our rational powers are impaired, and the ſoul weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by ſin; the animal paſſions are ſtrong and apt to oppoſe the dictates of reaſon; objects of ſenſe, make powerful impreſſions on the mind; we are in every ſituation, ſurrounded with many ſnares and temptations: in ſuch a diſordered ſtate of things, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a courſe of ſtrict piety and uncorrupted virtue, is a work of great difficulty. There are, however, many tender propenſions and generous inſtincts interwoven with our very being, as reſtraints from vice, and incitements to virtue. The gracious Author of nature has planted in the human breaſt, a quick ſenſe of good and evil; a faculty which ſtrongly dictates right and wrong; and, though, by the ſtrength of appetite and warmth of paſſion, men are often hurried into immoral practices; yet in the beginning, eſpecially when there has been the advantage of a good education, it is uſually with reluctance and oppoſition of mind. What inward ſtruggles precede, what bitter pangs attend their ſinful exceſſes! What guilty bluſhes and uneaſy fears! What frightful proſpects and pale reviews! 'Terrors are upon them, and a fire not blown conſumeth them.' To make a mock at ſin, and to commit iniquity without remorſe, is an attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that requires length of time, and much painful labour; more labour than is requiſite to attain that habitual goodneſs which is the glory of the man, the ornament of the Chriſtian, his preparation for heaven, and the chief ſource of his happineſs there. The ſoul can no more be reconciled to flagrant acts of wickedneſs and injuſtice, than the body to exceſs, without ſuffering many bitter pains and cruel attacks, attacks attended with much anguiſh and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>CONSCIENCE may indeed be ſtopped and put to ſilence for a while by falſe principles, its ſecret whiſpers may be drowned by the noiſe of company, and ſtifled by entertainments of ſenſe; but this principle of conſcience is ſo deeply rooted in human nature, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the hour of calamity arrives, when ſickneſs ſeizeth, and death approacheth the ſinner, conſcience conſtrains him to liſten to her accuſations, and will not ſuffer the temples of his head to take any reſt: <hi>There is no peace for the wicked;</hi> the foundations of peace are ſubverted, they are at utter enmity with their reaſon, with their conſcience, and with the God of their mercies.</p>
               <p>THE caſe is far otherwiſe with true religion: conſcience is on her ſide: reaſon pleads for her, and intereſt joins in the recommendation. When religion pure and genuine forms the temper, and governs the life, conſcience applauds, and peace takes her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the breaſt: the ſoul is in its proper ſtate, there is order and regularity both in the faculties and actions. Conſcious of its own integrity, and ſecure of the divine approbation, the ſoul enjoys a calmneſs not to be deſcribed: but why do I call this happy frame calmneſs only? It is far more than mere calmneſs: the air may be calm, and the day overcaſt with thick miſts and dark clouds: the pious and virtuous mind reſembles a ſerene day, enlighted and enlivened with the brighteſt rays of the ſun; though all without may be clouds and darkneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is light in the heart of a pious man; he is ſatisfied from himſelf, and is filled with peace and joy in believing: in the concluding ſcene, the awful moment of diſſolution, all is peaceful and ſerene.

                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:029927_0301_0FE33A71637CBB68"/>THE goſpel enjoins no duty but what is fit and reaſonable: it calls upon all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to practiſe reverence, ſubmiſſion and gratitude to God; juſtice, truth, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence to men; and to maintain the government of our own minds: and what has any one to ſubject againſt this? From the leaſt to the greateſt commandment of our dear Redeemer, there is not one which impartial reaſon can find fault with; his law is perfect; his precepts are true, and righteous altogether. Not even thoſe excepted, which require us to love our enemies, to deny ourſelves, and to take up our croſs. To forgive an injury is more generous and manly than to revenge it; to controul a licentious appetite than to indulge it: to ſuffer poverty, reproach, and even death itſelf, in the ſacred cauſe of truth and integrity, is much wiſer and better, than, by baſe compliances, to make ſhipwreck of faith and a good conſcience. Thus in a ſtorm at ſea, or a confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration on the land, a man with pleaſure abandons his lumber to ſecure his jewels: piety and virtue are the wiſeſt and moſt reaſonable things in the world, vice and wickedneſs the moſt irrational, abſurd, and pernicious.</p>
               <p>THE infinitely wiſe Author of our being hath ſo framed our natures, and placed us in ſuch relations, that there is nothing vicious but what is injurious; nothing virtuous but what is advantageous to our preſent intereſt, both with reſpect to body and mind. Meekneſs and humility, patience and univerſal charity, are graces which give a joy unknown to tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. The divine virtues of truth and equity are the only bands of friendſhip, the only ſupports of ſociety. Temperance and ſobriety are the beſt preſervatives of health and ſtrength; but ſin and debauchery impair the body, conſume the ſubſtance, reduce to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and form the direct path to an immature and untimely death. Now this is the chief excellency of all laws; and what will always render their burden pleaſant and delightful is, that they enjoin nothing unbecoming or injurious; but, on the contrary, what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and of a ſalutary nature.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, to render our duty eaſy, we have the example as well as the commands of the bleſſed JESUS. The maſters of morality amongſt the Heathens gave excellent rules for regulation of men's manners; but they wanted either the honeſty or the courage to try their own arguments upon themſelves. It was a ſtrong preſumption that the yoke of the ſcribes and Phariſees was grievous, when they laid heavy burdens upon men's ſhoulders, which they themſelves refuſed to touch with one of their fingers. Not thus our great lawgiver, JESUS CHRIST the righteous; his behaviour was, in all reſpects, conformable to his doctrine; his devotion towards God, how ſublime and ardent! benevolence towards men, how great and diffuſive? He was in his life an exact pattern of innocence: for he <hi>did not ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> In the Son of God incarnate is exhibited the brighteſt, the faireſt reſemblance of the Father, that earth or heaven ever beheld: an example peculiarly perſuaſive, calculated to inſpire reſolution, and to animate us to uſe our utmoſt endeavours to imitate the divine pattern, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the author and finiſher of our faith, of him who loved us, and gave himſelf for us. Our profeſſion and character as Chriſtians oblige us to make this example the model of our lives. Every motive of decency, gratitude and intereſt, conſtrains us to tread the paths he trod before us, more eſpecially when we reflect that it was marked out to us by Unerring Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>LET us alſo remember, that our burden is eaſy; becauſe God, who knoweth whereof we are made, who conſidereth that we are but duſt, is ever ready to aſſiſt us. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſages themſelves had had ſome notions of this aſſiſtance, though guided only by a glimmering lamp of reaſon; but what they looked upon as probable, the goſpel clearly and ſtrongly aſſerts. We there hear the apoſtle exhorting, <hi>Let us come boldly unto the
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:029927_0302_0FE33A72E92468E0"/>
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.</hi> Heb. iv.16. We there hear the bleſſed JESUS himſelf arguing in this convincing manner, <hi>If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him?</hi> Luke ix.13.</p>
               <p>WE would not here be underſtood to mean, that the agency of the ſpirit is irreſiſtible, and lays a neceſſitating biaſs on all the faculties and affections. Were this the caſe, precepts and prohibitions, promiſes and threatenings, would ſignify nothing; and duty and obligation would be words without a meaning. The ſpirit aſſiſteth in a manner agreeable to the frame of human nature; not controlling the free uſe of reaſon, but by aſſiſting the underſtanding, influencing the will, and moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affections; but though we may not be able to explain the mode of his operations, the Scriptures warrant us to aſſert, that, when men are renewed and prepared for heaven, it is through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth. How enlivening the thought! how encouraging the motive! We are not left to ſtruggle alone with the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which attend the practice of virtue in the preſent imperfect ſtate. The merciful Father of our ſpirits is ever near to help our infirmities, to enlighten the underſtanding, to ſtrengthen good reſolutions, and, in concurrence with our own endeavours, to make us conquerors over all oppoſition. Faithful is he to his promiſes and will not ſuffer the ſincere and well diſpoſed to be tempted above what they are able to bear. What can be deſired more than this? To promote the virtue and happineſs of his moral offspring, the Supreme Parent hath done all that is conſiſtent with the holineſs of his nature, and the free agency of man: if then we are not virtuous and happy, it is our own faults, and we are utterly inexcuſable, in refuſing the grace and mercy proffered in the goſpel.</p>
               <p>LET us alſo remember, that the great doctrine of the goſpel concerning the propitious mercy of God to all the penitents through CHRIST JESUS, greatly contributes to the eaſe and pleaſure of a religious life. Let it be granted, that the hope of pardon is eſſential to the religion of fallen creatures, and one of its firſt principles; yet, conſidering the doubts and ſuſpicions which are apt to ariſe in a mind conſcious of guilt, it is undoubtedly a great and ineſtimable favour, to be relieved in this reſpect by a meſſenger from Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence himſelf. This is our happineſs: we are not left to depend upon conſequential reaſonings, which the bulk of manking are little uſed to; but we are aſſured, that upon our true repentance, we ſhall, through the mediation of CHRIST, receive the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of paſt ſins, and be reſtored to the ſame ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What grace and favour is this! Who can dwell upon the tranſporting theme too long! Now our way is plain before us, and the burden we are to bear is made eaſy. No ſins are unpardonable, if repented of and forſaken; for it is ſaid ſuch ſhall find mercy.</p>
               <p>YOU who have never yet regarded religion, but purſued a courſe of vice and ſenſuality all your lives long, are earneſtly entreated to conſider, that, though your conduct has been baſe to the laſt degree, your caſe is not deſperate, far from it: the God whom you

The law of Moſes, though of divine original, is chiefly enforced by promiſes of temporal bleſſings; and, even in the writings of the prophets, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture immortality is very ſparingly mentioned, and obſcurely repreſented: but the doctrine of our Saviour hath <hi>brought life and immortality to light.</hi> In the goſpel we have a diſtinct account of another world, attended with many engaging circumſtances, about which the deciſions of reaſon were dark and confuſed. We have the teſtimony of the Author of our religion, who was raiſed from the dead, and who afterwards, in the preſence of his diſciples, aſcended into heaven. In the New Teſtament it is expreſsly declared, that good men, <hi>when abſent from the body, are preſent with the Lord.</hi> Here we are aſſured of the reſurrection of the body in a glorious form, clothed with immortal vigour, ſuited to the active nature of the animating ſpirit, and aſſiſting its moſt enlarged operations and inceſſant progreſs towards perfection.

               <p>IN order to confute and expoſe this looſe and careleſs way of reaſoning, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the liberty of a rational creature doth not conſiſt in an entire exemption from all controul, but in following the dictates of reaſon as the governing principle, and in keeping the various paſſions in due ſubordination. To follow the regular motion of thoſe affections which the wiſe Creator hath implanted within us, is our duty: but as our natural deſires in this ſtate of trial are often irregular, we are bound to reſtrain their exceſſes, and not to indulge them, but in a ſtrict ſubſerviency to the integrity and peace of our minds, and to the order and happineſs of human ſociety eſtabliſhed in the world. They who allow the ſupreme command to be uſurped by ſenſe and brutal appetite, may promiſe themſelves liberty, but are truly and abſolutely the ſervants of corruption: to be vicious is to be enſlaved. We behold with pity thoſe miſerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are chained in the gallies, or confined in dark priſons and loathſome dungeons; but much more abject and vile is the ſlavery of the ſinner! No ſlavery of the body is equal to the bondage of the mind: no chains preſs ſo cloſely or gall ſo cruelly as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etters of ſin, which corrode the very ſubſtance of the ſoul, fret every faculty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade men below the brute part of the creation.</p>
               <p>WE muſt indeed confeſs, that there are ſome profligates ſo hardened by cuſtom, as to be paſt all feeling; and, becauſe inſenſible of their bondage, boaſt of this inſenſibility as a mark of their native freedom, and their happineſs. Vain men! they might extol, with equal propriety, the peculiar happineſs of an apoplexy, the profound tranquility of a lethergy, or, we may add, the ideal paradiſe of a fool or a mad-man.</p>
               <p>WE have, in the foregoing obſervations, endeavoured to place in a plain and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous light, ſome of the peculiar excellencies of the Chriſtian religion; and from hence many uſeful reflections will naturally ariſe in the mind of every attentive reader. It is the religion of JESUS that hath removed idolatry and ſuperſtition, and brought immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light, when concealed under a veil of darkneſs almoſt impenetrable. This hath ſet the great truths of religion in a clear and conſpicuous point of view, and propoſed new and powerful motives to influence our minds, and to determine our conduct. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is enjoined to be believed, but what is worthy of God; nothing to be practiſed but what is friendly to man. All the doctrines of the goſpel are rational and conſiſtent; all its precepts are truly wiſe, juſt, and good. The goſpel contains nothing grievous to an ingenious mind; it debars us from nothing but doing harm to ourſelves or to our fellow creatures; and permits us to range any where but in the paths of danger and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It only requires us to act up to the dignity of the rational nature, and to prefer to the vaniſhing pleaſures of ſin, the ſmiles of a reconciled God, and an eternal weight of glory: and is this a rigorous exaction, a heavy burden not be endured? How can ſinful mortals harbour a thought ſo ridiculous and unworthy?</p>
               <p>CAN any man who is a real friend to the cauſe of virtue, and to the intereſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ever be an enemy to Chriſtianity if he truly underſtands it, and ſeriouſly reflects on its wiſe and uſeful tendency? Impoſſible, for it conducteth us to our journey's end by the plaineſt and ſecureſt path, where the ſteps are not ſtraightened, and where he that runneth ſtumbleth not. Let us who live under this laſt, and moſt gracious diſpenſation

of God to mankind, <hi>count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord:</hi> and not ſuffer ourſelves, by the ſlight cavils of unbelievers, to be moved away from the hope of the goſpel. Let us demonſtrate, that we believe the ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Chriſtian diſpenſation, by conforming to its precepts. Let us ſhew that we are Chriſtians in deed and in truth; not by endleſs diſputes about trifles, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a blind zeal, but by practiſing that univerſal, that exalted goodneſs, our holy religion recommends, and by abounding in thoſe <hi>fruits of righteouſneſs which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> Phil. i.11.</p>
               <p>WE may clearly perceive, from what has been ſaid, how groundleſs all thoſe prejudices are which ſome conceive againſt religion, as if it was a peeviſh, moroſe ſcheme, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to human nature, and inconſiſtent with the true enjoyment of life. Such ſentiments are too apt to prevail in the heat of youth, when the ſpirits are briſk and lively, and the paſſions warm and impetuous: but it is wholly a miſtake, and a miſtake of the moſt dangerous tendency. The truth is, there is no pleaſure like that of a good conſcience, no real peace but what reſults from the practice of virtue; this ennobles the mind, and can alone ſupport it under all the various and unequal ſcenes of the preſent ſtate of trial; this lays a ſure foundation of an eaſy, comfortable life, of a ſerene, peaceful death, and of eternal joy and happineſs hereafter: whereas vice is ruinous to all our moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intereſts; it ſpoils the native beauty, and ſubverts the order of the ſoul; it renders us the ſcorn of man, the rejected of God, and, without timely repentance, will rob us of a happy eternity. Religion is the health, the liberty, and the happineſs of the ſoul; ſin is the diſeaſe, the ſervitude, and deſtruction of it, both here and for ever.</p>
               <p>IF theſe arguments be not ſufficient to convince you, let me lead you into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an habitual rioter, the lewd debauchee, worn out in the cauſe of iniquity, his bones full of the ſins of his youth, that from his own mouth, as he lies on his expiring bed, you may learn that the way of tranſgreſſion is hard; and that however ſweet ſin may be in the commiſſion, <hi>it biteth like a ſerpent, and ſtingeth like an adder.</hi> Prov. xxiii.32. This awful truth is exemplified in a very ſtrong point of view, by the late celebrated Dr. Young, in his <hi>Centaur not Fabulous,</hi> page 149—161, where he draw a moſt awful picture of the laſt ſcene of an abandoned profligate, who had diſpiſed religion, and led a life of pleaſure and diſſipation. The relation is as follows:</p>
               <p>"I am going, Reader to repreſent to thee the laſt moments of a perſon of high birth and ſpirit, of great parts and ſtrong paſſions, every way accompliſhed, not the leaſt in iniquity: his unkind treatment was the death of a moſt valuable wife, and his monſtrous extravigance, in effect, diſinherited his only child. And ſurely the death-bed of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate is next in horror, to that abyſs to which it leads: it has the moſt of hell that is viſible upon earth, and he that has ſeen it has more than faith to confirm him in his creed. I ſee it now, ſays the worthy divine from whom I ſhall borrow this relation, for who can forget it? Are there in it no flames and furies?—You are ignorant then, of what a ſacred imagination can figure, what a guilty heart can feel! How diſmal is it! The two great enemies of ſoul and body, ſickneſs and ſin, ſink and confound his friends; ſilence and darkneſs the ſhocking ſcene: ſickneſs excludes the light of heaven, and ſin its bleſſed hope. Oh, double darkneſs! more than Egyptian! acutely to be felt!</p>
               <p>"THE ſad evening before the death of that noble youth, whoſe laſt hours ſuggeſted theſe thoughts, I was with him. No one was there but his phyſician, and an intimate acquaintance whom he loved and whom he had ruined. At my coming he ſaid, "You and the phyſician are come too late.—I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raiſe the dead."</p>

               <p>"I ſaid, the bleſſed Redeemer"—"Hold! Hold! you wound me! That is the rock on which I have ſplit! I denied his name."</p>
               <p>"REFUSING to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phyſician, he lay ſilent, as far as ſudden darts of pain would permit, till the clock ſtruck; then he cried out with vehemence, "Oh time! time! It is fit thou ſhouldſt thus ſtrike thy murderer to the heart.—How art thou fled forever?—A month?—Oh for a ſingle week! I aſk not for years, though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</p>

               <p>"SOON after I propoſed prayer.—"Pray you that can: I never prayed: I cannot pray. —Nor need I. Heaven is on my ſide already: it cloſes with my conſcience its ſevereſt ſtrokes but ſecond my own."</p>
               <p>"HIS friend being much touched, even to tears at this (for who could forbear? I could not) he, with a moſt affectionate look, ſaid, "Keep theſe tears for thyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"No, ſtay. Thou ſtill may'ſt hope;—therefore hear me. How madly have I talked? How madly haſt thou liſtened and believed? But look on my preſent ſtate as a full anſwer to thee and to myſelf. This body is all weakneſs and pain; but my ſoul, as if ſtung up by torment, to greater ſtrength and ſpirit, is full powerful to reaſon; full mighty to ſuffer. And that which thus triumphs within the jaws of mortality, is doubtleſs immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. And as for a Deity, nothing leſs than an Almighty could inflict the pains I feel."</p>
               <p>"I was about to congratulate this paſſive, involuntary confeſſion, in his aſſerting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature: when he thus very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately added, "No, no! let me ſpeak on.—I have not long to ſpeak.—My much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured friend! my ſoul as my body, lies, in ruins, in ſcattered fragments of broken thought: remorſe for the paſt throws my thoughts on the future: worſe dread of the future ſtrikes it back on the paſt. I turn, and turn, and find no ray.—Didſt thou feel half the mountain that is on me, thou wouldſt ſtruggle with the martyr for his ſtake, and bleſs heaven for the flames;—that is not an everlaſting flame; that is not an unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire."</p>
               <p>"How were we ſtruck? Yet, ſoon after ſtill more. With what an eye of diſtraction what a face of deſpair he cried out, "My principles have poiſoned my friend; my extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance has beggared my boy; my unkindneſs has murdered my wife! And is there another hell? Oh! thou blaſphemed, yet moſt indulgent Lord God! Hell itſelf is a refuge if it hides me from thy frown.—"</p>
               <p>"SOON after, his underſtanding failed; his terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever forgotten; and before the ſun (which I hope has ſeen few like him) aroſe, this gay, young, noble, ingenuous, accompliſhed, and moſt wretched mortal, expired."</p>
               <p>IT ſometimes happens, we confeſs, that men who have led very wicked lives have gone out of the world, as they lived in it defying conſcience, and deriding a future judgment as an idle fiction: but theſe inſtances are very rare, and only prove that there are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the moral as well as in the natural world, who have ſported with their own deceivings, and have even dared to lift their puny and rebellious arm againſt Omnipotence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="unknown:029927_0307_0FE33A82EDCEE9D8"/>BUT it will perhaps be ſaid, that the ſons of vice and riot have pleaſure in ſenſual indulgences. Allowed: but it is altogether of the lower kind, empty, fleeting, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient; like the crackling of thorns under a pot, ſo is the mirth of the wicked. It makes a noiſe and a blaze for the preſent but ſoon vaniſhes away into ſmoke and vapour. On the other hand, the pleaſure of religion is ſolid and laſting, and will attend us through all, even the laſt ſtages of life. When we have paſſed the levity of youth, and have loſt our reliſh for the gay entertainments of ſenſe; when old age ſteals upon us, and bends us towards the grave, this will cleave faſt to us, and give us relief. It will be ſo far from terminating at death, that it then commences perfect, and continually improves with new additions, and ever-blooming joys.</p>
               <p>IF our ſouls are clad in this immortal robe, we need not fear the awful ſummons of the king of terrors, nor regret our retiring into the chambers of the duſt. Our immortal part will wing its way to the arms of its Omnipotent Redeemer, and find reſt in the heavenly manſions of the Almighty. And though our earthly part, this tabernacle of clay, return to its original duſt, it is only to be raiſed in a more beautiful and heavenly form. If it retires into the ſhadow of death, and viſits the gloomy habitations of the grave, it is only to return from a ſhort confinement to endleſs liberty: for our great Maſter will lead his redeemed from the chambers of the grave, and guide them in his ſtrength to his holy habitation: he will plant them in the mountain of his inheritance, in the place he hath prepared for them, even the ſanctuary which his hands hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and we ſhall be with the Lord for ever and ever, to ſerve him day and night in his temple, where the inhabitant ſhall never ſay, I am ſick; where the wicked ſhall ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary ſoul, will be for ever at reſt.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall here ſubjoin a copy of a letter, ſent by Publius Lentulus, governor of Judea, to the ſenate of Rome, reſpecting the perſon and action of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, JESUS CHRIST; which may ſerve as a ſtrong teſtimony and evidence in favour of the divinity of our Lord's perſon and doctrines againſt the ſtale objections of the Deiſts, as the authenticity of the ancient manuſcripts, from which it was tranſlated, is founded on the beſt authority. Tiberius Caeſar was then emperor, and cauſed the extraordinary intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, contained in this letter, to be publiſhed throughout all the Roman provinces. One would have thought this confirmation, iſſued by the Roman governor, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the generality of the Romans, as well as Jews, concerning the divinity of our Lord's miſſion; but ſuch was the univerſal prejudice of the people, that nothing would ſatisfy thoſe who had not given credit to the words of CHRIST himſelf. The epiſtle runs as follows:</p>

            <div type="biography">
               <head>THE LIFE OF ST. MATTHEW, The EVANGELIST and APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>THIS evangeliſt was alſo called Levi, and, though a Roman officer, was a true He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and probably a Galilean. Kirſten, an Arabian author, tells us, that he was born at Nazareth, a city in the tribe of Zebulon, famous for the habitation of Joſeph and Mary, and the place where our bleſſed Saviour reſided the whole time of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. St. Matthew was the ſon of Alpheus and Mary, ſiſter, or kinſwoman, to the bleſſed Virgin, both originally deſcended from the tribe of Iſſachar.</p>
               <p>THE occupation of Matthew was that of a publican, or tax-gatherer to the Romans, an office deteſted by the generality of the Jews. Amongſt the Romans, indeed, it was accounted a place of power and credit, and, as ſuch, rarely conferred on any but Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knights: and T. Fl. Sabimus, father of the emperor Veſpaſian, was the publican of the Aſian provinces, an office which he diſcharged ſo greatly to the ſatisfaction of the public, that they erected ſtatues to him. Theſe officers being ſent into the provinces to gather the tributes, generally employed the natives under them, as perſons beſt ſkilled in the affairs and cuſtoms of their own country.</p>
               <p>ON two accounts, this office was odious to the Jews. Firſt, becauſe the perſons who managed it were generally covetous and great exactors; for having themſelves farmed the cuſtoms of the Romans, they uſed every method of oppreſſion, in order to pay their rents to the Romans and procure an advantage to themſelves. Of this Zaccheus, the chief of theſe farmers, was very ſenſible after his converſion, when he offered to make a fourfold reſtitution to all from whom he had taken any thing by fraud and extortion. And upon this account they became infamous, even amongſt the Gentiles themſelves, who commonly mention them as public robbers, and, though members of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were more voracious and deſtructive in a city, than wild beaſts in a foreſt. The other particular which rendered them ſo hateful to the Jews, was the tribute they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which they conſidered not only as a burden, but alſo as an affront to their nation; for they looked upon themſelves as a free people, having received that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege immediately from God himſelf; and therefore they conſidered this tribute as a daily and ſtanding inſtance of their ſlavery, which they deteſted above every thing; and it was this that betrayed them into ſo many rebellions againſt the Romans. We may add, that theſe publicans were obliged by their office to have frequent dealings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Gentiles, which the Jews conſidered as an abomination; and though they were themſelves Jews, they rigorouſly exacted the taxes of their brethren, and thereby ſeemed to conſpire with the Romans to entail perpetual ſlavery on their own countrymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="unknown:029927_0310_0FE33A8D62FF1B40"/>THE Publicans, by theſe practices, became univerſally abhorred by the Jewiſh nation, ſo that it was reckoned unlawful to aſſiſt them in the common offices of humanity: nay, they aſſerted it was no crime to cheat and over-reach a publican, though they broke the ſolemnity of an oath: they might not eat or drink, converſe or travel with them; they were conſidered as common thieves and robbers, and the money received of them was not permitted to be depoſited with others, conſidering it as gained by rapine and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; they were not admitted to give teſtimony in any court of juſtice; they were looked upon in ſo infamous a light, that they were not only baniſhed from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in matters of divine worſhip, but ſhunned in all affairs of civil ſociety and commerce, as the peſts of their country, as perſons whoſe converſation was infectious, and not at all better than the Heathens themſelves. And hence they had a common proverb amongſt them, 'Take not a wife out of that family in which there is a publican; for they are all publicans!' that is, they are all thieves, robbers, and wicked ſinners. And to this proverbial cuſtom our bleſſed Saviour alludes, when ſpeaking of a hardened ſinner, on whom neither private reproofs, nor the public cenſures and admonitions of the church, can prevail, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man and publican;</hi> or, in other words, an incorrigible ſinner.</p>
               <p>ST. MATTHEW the evangeliſt was of this profeſſion, and he ſeems to have been more particularly employed in collecting the cuſtoms on commodities that came by ſea into Galilee, and the tribute which paſſengers were to pay who went by water: and for this purpoſe the office or cuſtom-houſe ſtood by the ſea ſide, that the officers might be always at hand: and here it was, as St. Mark intimates, that Matthew ſat at the receipt of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, where the tribute-money was collected.</p>
               <p>AFTER having cured a perſon long afflicted with the palſy, our bleſſed Lord retired out of Capernaum, to walk by the ſea-ſide, where he taught the people that flocked after him. Here he ſaw Matthew ſitting in his office, and called him to follow him. The man was rich, had a large and profitable employment, was a wiſe and prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and doubtleſs underſtood what it would coſt him to comply with the call of JESUS: he was not ignorant that he muſt exchange wealth for poverty, a cuſtom-houſe for a priſon, rich and powerful maſters, for a naked and deſpiſed Saviour: but he overlooked all theſe conſiderations, left all his intereſt and relations, to become our Lord's diſciple, and to embrace a more ſpiritual way of commerce and traffic, which might bring glory to God, and peace of conſcience to himſelf.</p>
               <p>IT is not likely that he was before wholly unacquainted with our Saviour's perſon or doctrine, eſpecially as he reſided at Capernaum, where our Lord ſo often preached, and wrought his miracles; ſo that he muſt in ſome meaſure, be prepared to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which our Saviour's call made upon him, and to ſhew that he was not diſcontented at his change, he entertained both his Maſter and his diſciples at his houſe, calling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his friends, eſpecially thoſe of his own profeſſion, hoping no doubt that they might alſo be converted by the company and converſation of our bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>AS the Phariſees had ſought all opportunities of raiſing objections againſt the doctrine of the bleſſed JESUS, ſo they took this opportunity of ſuggeſting to his diſciples, that it was highly unbecoming ſo pure and holy a perſon, as their Maſter pretended himſelf to be, to converſe ſo familiarly with the worſt of men, with publicans and ſinners, perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous to a proverb; but he preſently replied to them, that theſe were the ſick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needed the phyſician: that his company was of moſt conſequence, where the ſouls of men moſt required it: that God himſelf preferred works of mercy and charity, eſpecially in doing good to the ſouls of men, infinitely above all ritual obſervances, and that the
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:029927_0311_0FE33A8FD6AF0D78"/>
principal deſign of his coming into the world, was not to call the righteous, or thoſe who like themſelves vainly pretended to be ſo, but ſinners, modeſt, humble, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinners, to repentance, and to reduce them to a better ſtate and courſe of life than they had hitherto purſued.</p>
               <p>ST. MATTHEW after his election to the apoſtleſhip, continued with the reſt till the aſcenſion of his great and beloved Maſter, after which, for the firſt eight years at leaſt he preached in different parts of Judea, but afterwards he left the country of Paleſtine to convert the Gentile world before his departure, he was entreated by the Jewiſh converts to write the hiſtory of the life and actions of the bleſſed JESUS, and leave it amongſt them as a ſtanding monument of what he had ſo often delivered to them in his ſermons. This he readily complied with, as we ſhall more particularly mention, in giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the goſpel penned by him.</p>
               <p>LEAVING Judea, he travelled into ſeveral parts, eſpecially Ethiopia; but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places he viſited are not known with any certainty. Metaphraſtus tells us, that he firſt viſited Parthia, and after planting Chriſtianity in thoſe parts, he travelled into Ethiopia; where, by his preaching and miracles, he triumphed over ſuperſtition and idolatry, convinced multitudes of the error of their ways, and prevailed on them to obey the precepts of the goſpel: ordained them ſpiritual guides and paſtors to confirm them in the faith, and bringing over others to the religion of the ſon of God, which he had inculcated both by his doctrine and example.</p>
               <p>HAVING laboured indefatigably in the vineyard of his Maſter, he afterwards ſuffered martyrdom at a city of Ethiopia, called Naddabar; but by what kind of death, is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely known, though the general opinion is that he was ſlain with an halbert.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was a remarkable inſtance of the power of religion, in bringing men to a better temper of mind. If we reflect upon his circumſtances while he continued a ſtranger to the great Redeemer of mankind, we ſhall find that the love of the world had poſſeſſed his heart. He had acquired a plentiful eſtate, was in poſſeſſion of a very rich and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able office, ſupported by the power and favour of the Romans, prompted by covetous inclinations, and theſe confirmed by long habits and cuſtoms: but notwithſtanding all this, no ſooner did CHRIST call him, than he abandoned, without the leaſt ſcruple or heſitation, all his riches; nay, he not only renounced his lucrative office, but ran the greateſt hazard of diſpleaſing the maſters who employed him, for quitting their ſervice, without giving them the leaſt notice and leaving his accounts in confuſion.</p>
               <p>HAD our bleſſed Saviour appeared as a ſecular prince clothed with temporal power and authority, it would have been no wonder for St. Matthew to have gone over to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but when he appeared under all the circumſtances of meanneſs and diſgrace, when he ſeems to promiſe his followers nothing but miſery and ſufferings in this life, and to propoſe no other rewards than the inviſible encouragements of another world, his change appears truly wonderful and ſurpriſing. It was indeed ſo remarkable, that both Porphyry and Julian two ſubtle adverſaries of the Chriſtian religion, took occaſion from hence to charge him either with falſehood or folly: with the former, if he did not give a true account of things; and with the latter, if his caſe was fairly repreſented, in ſo haſtily following the perſon who called him: but theſe detractors would have done well to have remembered, that the holy JESUS was no common perſon; his commands were attended with ſomething more than common.</p>
               <p>ST. JEROM is of opinion, that beſides the divinty which evidently appeared in the miracles of the Lamb of God, there was a divine brightneſs and kind of majeſty in his
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:029927_0312_0FE33A2E66AC3908"/>
looks, which was at firſt ſight ſufficient to draw perſons after him; but however that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his miraculous powers that reflected a luſtre from every quarter, and the efficacy of his doctrine accompanied with the divine grace made way for the ſummons ſent to our apoſtle, and enabled him to conquer all oppoſitions, and all the difficulties that oppoſed his obeying the commands of his Saviour, when he received the powerful call.</p>
               <p>A ſtill further evidence of this contempt of the world appeared in his exemplary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and abſtemiouſneſs from all delights and pleaſures; nay, even from the ordinary conveniency and accommodations of it: he was ſo far from indulging his appetite with delicate rarities, that he refuſed to gratify it with lawful and ordinary proviſions; his uſual diet being only herbs, roots, ſeeds, and berries: but what appeared moſt remarkable in him, and which, though the leaſt virtue in itſelf, is the greateſt in the eſteem and value of a wiſe man, was his humility: he was mean and modeſt in his own opinion, always preferring others to himſelf: for whereas the other evangeliſts, in deſcribing the apoſtles by pairs, conſtantly place him before St. Thomas, he modeſtly places him before himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE reſt of the evangeliſts are careful to mention the honour of his apoſtleſhip, but ſpeak of his former ſordid, diſhoneſt, and diſgraceful courſe of life, only under the name of Levi; while he himſelf ſets it down, with all its circumſtances, under his own proper and common name; a conduct which at once commends the prudence and candour of the apoſtle, and ſuggeſts to us this uſeful reflection. That the greateſt ſinners are not excluded from divine grace; nor can any, if penitent, have juſt reaſon to deſpair, when publicans and ſinners find mercy at the throne of grace. The conduct of the other evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts with regard to St. Matthew, ſhould alſo teach us to uſe a penitent brother with the greateſt modeſty and tenderneſs; it being contrary to the rules of civility, as well as the laws of religion, to upbraid and reproach a perſon, after his repentance, with the errors of his former life and practices.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall conclude the life of this apoſtle with a remark concerning his goſpel, which was written at the entreaty of the Jewiſh converts, while he abode in Paleſtine, but at what particular time, is uncertain; ſome will have it to be written eight, ſome fifteen, and ſome thirty years after our Lord's aſcenſion: it was originally written in Hebrew, but ſoon after tranſlated into Greek by one of the diſciples, probably by St. James the Leſs: but whoever the tranſlator was, it of no conſequence, becauſe the verſion was well known to the apoſtles, and approved by them; and accordingly the church has from the earlieſt ages received the Greek copy as authentic, and placed it in the ſacred canon of Scripture.</p>
               <p>THE Greek tranſlation having been entertained, the Hebrew copy was afterwards chiefly owned and uſed by the Nazaraei, a middle ſect between Jews and Chriſtians; with the former, they adhered to the rites and ceremonies of the Moſaic law; and with the latter, they believed in CHRIST, and embraced his religion; and hence this goſpel has been ſtyled, 'The goſpel according to the Hebrews, and the goſpel of the Nazarenes.' But after a time, it was interpolated by theſe Chriſtians, who inſerted ſeveral paſſages of the evangelical hiſtory; which they had heard from the apoſtles, or from thoſe who had familiarly converſed with them; and to theſe additions the ancient fathers frequently refer in their writings. The Ebonites, on the contrary, ſtruck out many paſſages becauſe they were not favourable to their tenets. A Hebrew copy of St. Matthew's goſpel (but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exactly the ſame as that written by the apoſtle, is uncertain) was found amongſt the other books in the treaſury of the Jews at Tiberias, by one Joſeph, a Jew, who, after his converſion, was a man of great honour and eſteem in the reign of Conſtantine. St. Jerom aſſures us that another was kept in the library at Caeſarea in his time, and another by the Nazarenes at Berea, from whom he procured the liberty to tranſcribe it, and which he afterwards
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:029927_0313_0FE33A81693C9C30"/>
tranſlated both into Greek and Latin, with this remarkable obſervation, that in quoting the text of the Old Teſtament, the evangeliſt immediately follows the Hebrew, without taking notice of the Septuagint tranſlation. A copy of this goſpel was alſo dug up in the year 485, on opening the grave of St. Barnabas, in Cyprus, tranſcribed with his own hand; but theſe copies have long ſince periſhed: and with regard to thoſe publiſhed ſince by Tile and Munſter, the barbarous and corrupt ſtile ſufficiently demonſtrate that they were not originals, but the tranſlation of a more ignorant and corrupt age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſervedly rejected by the more judicious and enlightened part of mankind.</p>

            <div type="biography">
               <head>THE LIFE OF ST. MARK. The EVANGELIST and APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>THOUGH the name of St. Mark ſeems to be of Roman original, he was nevertheleſs deſcended from Jewiſh parents, and of the tribe of Levi: nor was it uncommon amongſt the Jews to change their names on ſome remarkable revolution or incident of life, or when they intended to travel into any of the Roman provinces in Europe.</p>
               <p>ST. MARK was generally conſidered by the ancients, as one of the ſeventy diſciples; and Epiphanius expreſsly tells us, that 'he was one of thoſe who, taking exception at our Lord's diſcourſe of eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, went back and walked no more with him.' But there appears no manner of foundation for theſe opinions, nor for that of Nicephorus, who will have him to be the ſon of St. Peter's ſiſter: nay, Pepias, biſhop of Hierapolis, who lived near the apoſtolic times, poſitively affirms, that he was neither a hearer nor follower of our Saviour. It is therefore moſt probable, that he was converted by ſome of the apoſtles, perhaps by St. Peter, whom he conſtantly attended in his travels, ſupplying the place of an amanuenſis and interpreter: for though, the apoſtles were divinely inſpired, and had, amongſt other miraculous powers, the gift of tongues conferred upon them, yet the interpretation of tongues was a gift more peculiar to ſome than to others; and this probably was St. Mark's talent, in expounding St. Peter's diſcourſes whether by word or writing, to thoſe who were ſtrangers to the language in which they were delivered: but however this be, he accompanied him in his apoſtolical progreſs, preached the goſpel in Italy and at Rome, where, at the requeſt of the Chriſtians of thoſe parts, he compoſed and wrote the goſpel, which is called after his name.</p>
               <p>WE are told by Euſebius, that St. Mark was ſent into Egypt by St. Peter to preach the goſpel, and accordingly planted a church in Alexandria, the metropolis of it; and his ſucceſs was ſo very remarkable, that he converted multitudes both of men and women, perſuading them not only to embrace the Chriſtian religion, but alſo a life of more than ordinary ſtrictneſs. That there was indeed a ſect in Egypt remarkably ſtrict in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is evident from Philo, who gives the following account of them.</p>
               <p>'THERE is, ſays he, a ſort of perſons in many parts of the world, eſpecially near the Maroeotick lake in Egypt, who have formed themſelves into religious ſocieties and lead a ſtrict philoſophical and contemplative courſe of life. When they firſt enter on this manner of living, they renounce all ſecular intereſts and employments, and leaving their eſtates to their relations, retire into gardens, and places devoted to ſolitude and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Their houſes, or colleges, are not contiguous, that, being free from noiſe and tumult, they might the better attend to the deſigns of a contemplative life; nor yet removed at too great diſtance, that they may maintain mutual ſociety, and be conveniently capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of helping and aſſiſting one another.

Their diſcourſes are commonly myſtical and allegorical, ſeeking hidden ſenſes under plain words; and of ſuch an allegorical philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the books of their religion, left them by their anceſtors, conſiſt: the law they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to an animal, the letters of it reſembling the body, while the ſoul of it lies in theſe abſtruſe and recondite notions, which the external veil and ſurface of the words conceal from common underſtanding.</p>
               <p>'WITH regard to their method of living, they take very little care of their bodies, ſpending their whole time in perfecting their minds by precepts of wiſdom and religion; the day they wholly ſpend in pious and divine meditations, in reading and expounding the law and the prophets, and the holy volumes of the ancient founders of their ſect, and in ſinging Pſalms to the honour of their Maker; abſolutely temporate and abſtemious, neither eating nor drinking till night, the only time they think proper to refreſh and regale the body: and ſome of them out of an inſatiable deſire of growing in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and virtue, faſt many days together. Their diet is plain and ſimple, ſufficient only to ſatisfy the calls of nature, a little bread, ſalt, and water, being their conſtant bill of fare. Their clothes are as mean as their food, deſigned only as preſent ſecurity againſt cold and nakedneſs. Nor is this the caſe only of the men, but alſo of the pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout women that live amongſt them; who religiouſly obſerve every ſeventh day, and eſpecially the preparatory week to the great ſolemnity, which they keep with all expreſſions of ſincere devotion, and alſo with ſevere abſtinence.'</p>
               <p>EUSEBIUS affirms, that theſe excellent perſons were Chriſtians, converted and brought under ſuch admirable rules and inſtitutions by St. Mark at his coming hither, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating all paſſages to the manner and diſcipline of the Chriſtians: and is followed by Epiphanius, Jerom, and others. But whoever ſeriouſly and impartially conſiders Philo's account, will plainly find, that he intends it of the Jews, and profeſſors of the Moſaic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though what particular ſect they were, I ſhall not pretend to determine; perhaps they were Eſſenes: but however that be, it is plain they were not Chriſtians; for Philo ſpeaks of them as an inſtitution of ſome ſtanding; whereas, the Chriſtians had but very lately appeared in the world, eſpecially in Egypt: beſides, many parts of Philo's account does not in ſeveral parts agree with the ſtate and manners of the Chriſtians at that time; as that they withdrew themſelves from public converſation, and all the affairs of civil life, which the Chriſtians never did, but when forced to it by violent perſecutions; for at other times, as Juſtin Martyr, and Tertullian tells us, they mixed themſelves promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly with the inhabitants of the country, dwelt in towns and cities, ploughed their lands, and followed their reſpective trades and callings like other men. Nor can the books which Philo tells us they had, beſides thoſe of Moſes and the prophets, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of thoſe of the Chriſtians; for the writings of the evangeliſts had been very lately publiſhed, and conſequently could not come under the character of ancient authors. Not to mention that ſome of their ceremonies were ſuch as the Chriſtians of thoſe days were abſolute ſtrangers to, not being introduced into the church till ſome ages after Philo wrote his account: nay, ſome of them were never uſed by the primitive Chriſtians, eſpecially their religious dances, which Philo particularly deſcribes, as uſed by them at their feſtival ſolemnities, eſpecially that remarkable one which they obſerved at the end of every ſeven weeks; when their entertainment being ended, they all roſe up, the men in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:029927_0315_0FE3394B2DB917E8"/>
and the women in another, dancing with various meaſures and motions, each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſinging divine hymns and ſongs, and having a precentor going before each diviſion, ſinging alternately; till, in the concluſion, they joined in one common chorus, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the triumphant ſong ſung by Moſes and the Iſraelites, after their great deliverance at the Red Sea, from the hoſtile attempts of Pharaoh and his army.</p>
               <p>FROM theſe, and ſeveral other particulars that might be mentioned, it will appear, that theſe could not be Chriſtians; it is not indeed to be doubted, but that perſons educated under ſuch excellent rules and methods of life, were more than ordinarily prepared for the reception of Chriſtianity, and could not fail of rendering St. Mark's ſucceſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing in thoſe parts, and open a path for men to come in multitudes to embrace the doctrines of the goſpel of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle did not confine himſelf to Alexandria, and the oriental parts of Egypt, but removed weſtward to Lybia, paſſing through the countries of Marmarcia, Pentapolis, and others adjacent, where, though the people were both barbarous in their manners, and idolatrous in their worſhip, yet by his preaching and miracles, he prevailed on them to embrace the tenets of the goſpel; nor did he leave them till he had confirmed them in the faith of his divine Maſter.</p>
               <p>HE returned, after his long tour, to Alexandria, where he preached with the greateſt freedom, ordered and diſpoſed of the affairs of the church, and wiſely provided for a ſucceſſion, by conſtituting governors and paſtors of it. But the reſtleſs enemy of the ſouls of men, would not ſuffer our apoſtle to continue in peace and quietneſs: for while he was aſſiduouſly labouring in the vineyard of his Maſter the idolatrous inhabitants about the time of Eaſter, when they were celebrating the ſolemnities of Serapis, tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entered the church, forced St. Mark, then performing divine ſervice, from thence, and binding his feet with cords, draged him through the ſtreets, and over the moſt craggy places to the Bucelus, a precipice near the ſea, leaving him there in a loneſome priſon for that night; but his great and beloved Maſter appeared to him in a viſion, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouragng his ſoul, under the ruins of his ſhattered body. The next morning early, the tragedy began a freſh, dragging him about in the ſame cruel and barbarous manner, till he expired: but their malice did not end with his death, they burnt his mangled body, after they had ſo inhumanly deprived it of life; but the Chriſtians, after the helliſh tragedy was over, gathered up his bones and aſhes, and decently interred them near the place where he uſed to preach. His remains were afterwards, with great pomp, removed from Alexandria to Venice, where they are religiouſly honoured, and he adopted as the titular ſaint and pattern of that ſtate and people. He ſuffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom on the 25th of April, but the year is not abſolutely known; the moſt probable opinion however is, that it happened about the end of Nero's reign.</p>
               <p>AS to his perſon, St. Mark was of a middle ſize and ſtature, his noſe long, his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows turning back, his eyes graceful and amiable, his head bald, his beard thick and grey, his gait quick, and the conſtitution of his body ſtrong and healthful.</p>
               <p>THE only writing he left behind him, was his goſpel, written, as we have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, at the entreaty and earneſt deſire of the converts at Rome, who not content to have heard St. Peter preach, preſſed St. Mark his diſciple, to commit to writing, an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical account of what he had delivered to them, which he performed with equal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and brevity, and being peruſed and approved by St. Peter, and commanded to be publicly read in their aſſemblies. It was frequently ſtyled St. Peter's goſpel, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dictated it to St. Mark, but becauſe the latter compoſed it from the accounts St. Peter uſually delivered in his diſcourſes to the people: and this is probably the reaſon

The remarkable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality he obſerved in all his relations, is plain, from hence, that he is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the ſhameful lapſe and denial of Peter, his dear tutor and maſter, that he deſcribes it with more aggravating circumſtances than any of the other evangeliſts. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians pretend to have the original Greek copy of St. Mark's goſpel, written with his own hand: but this manuſcript, if written by St. Mark, is now uſeleſs, the very letters being rendered illegible by length of time.</p>

            <div type="biography">
               <head>ST. LUKE THE EVANGELIST.</head>
               <p>ST. LUKE was born at Antioch, the metropolis of Syria, a city celebrated for the pleaſantneſs of its ſituation, the fertility of its ſoil, the riches of its commerce, the wiſdom of its ſenate, and the civility and politeneſs of its inhabitants, by the pens of ſome of the greateſt orators of thoſe times. It was eminent for ſchools of learning, which produced the moſt renowned maſters in the arts and ſciences; ſo that being born as it were, in the lap of the muſes, he could not well fail of acquiring an ingenious and liberal education: but he was not contented with the learning of his own country, he travelled for improvement into ſeveral parts of Greece and Egypt, and became particularly ſkilled in phyſic, which he made his profeſſion.</p>
               <p>THEY who would, from this particular, infer the quality of his birth and fortune, ſeem to forget that the healing art was, in theſe early times, generally practiſed by ſervants; and hence Grotius is of opinion, that St. Luke was carried to Rome, and lived there a ſervant to ſome noble family, in quality of phyſician: but after obtaining his freedom, he returned into his own country, and probably continued his profeſſion till his death, it being ſo highly conſiſtent with, and in many caſes ſubſervient to, the care of ſouls. He is alſo famous for his ſkill in another art, namely, painting, and an ancient inſcription, was found in a vault near the church of St. Maria de Via Lata, at Rome, ſuppoſed to have been the place where St. Paul dwelt, which mentions a picture of the bleſſed Virgin, UNA EX vii. AB LUCA DEPICTIS, <hi>being one of the ſeven painted by St. Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is not certainly known when St. Luke became a Chriſtian, after having been a Jewiſh proſelyte: thoſe who underſtand him in the beginning of his goſpel, to ſay that he had the facts from the reports of others, who were eye witneſſes, ſuppoſe him to have been converted by St. Paul, and that he learned the hiſtory of his goſpel from the converſation of that apoſtle, and wrote it under his direction; and that when St. Paul, in one of his epiſtles, ſays, <hi>according to my goſpel,</hi> he means this of St. Luke, which he ſtyle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>his,</hi> from the great ſhare he had in its compoſition.</p>
               <p>THEY, on the other hand, who hold that he wrote his goſpel from his own perſonal knowledge, obſerve, that he could not receive it from St. Paul, as an eye-witneſs of the matter contained in it, becauſe all thoſe matters were tranſacted before his converſion; and that he never ſaw our Lord, before he appeared to him in his journey to Damaſcus, which was ſome time after he aſcended into heaven. Conſequently, when St. Paul ſays, <hi>according to my goſpel,</hi> he means no more than the goſpel in general which he preached; the whole preaching of the apoſtles, ſtyled the goſpel, all having an uniform tendency to inculcate and eſtabliſh the faith and practice of the Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>BUT they further obſerve, that it is not probable that St. Luke was converted by St. Paul, becauſe the latter would in that caſe have ſtyled him his ſon, it being the conſtant, practice of the apoſtles to call all eminent converts by that appellation; but he mentions
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:029927_0317_0FE3394E3B936B48"/>
him by the name of <hi>Luke, the beloved phyſician.</hi> They therefore ſuppoſe, that he ſtudied the law in one of the ſchools of Jeruſalem, where he was converted by our Lord, and was one of the ſeventy diſciples mentioned in Scripture.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this be, St. Luke became the inſeparable companion of St. Paul in all his travels, and his conſtant fellow-labourer in the work of the miniſtry: he followed him in all his dangers, was with him at his ſeveral arraignments at Jeruſalem, accompanied him in his tedious and dangerous voyage to Rome, where he ſtill attended on him, to adminiſter to him in his neceſſities, and ſupply thoſe miniſterial offices, which the apoſtle's confinement would not ſuffer him to undertake; and eſpecially in carrying meſſages to other churches, where he had planted the Chriſtian religion. This infinitely endeared him to St. Paul, who ſeemed delighted with owning him for his fellow-labourer and in calling him the <hi>beloved phyſician,</hi> and the <hi>brother whoſe praiſe is in the goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. viii.13.</p>
               <p>IT is very probable, he did not leave St. Paul till he had finiſhed his courſe, and received the crown of martyrdom; though ſome tells us, that he left St. Paul at Rome, and returned back into the Eaſt, travelling into Egypt and ſeveral parts of Libya, where he preached the goſpel, wrought miracles, converted multitudes, and conſtituted guides and miniſters of religion; nay, that he himſelf undertook the epiſcopal charge of the city of Thebais. Epiphanius tells us, that he firſt preached in Dalmatia and Galatia, then in Italy and Macedonia, where he ſpared no pains, and declined no dangers, that he might faithfully diſcharge the truſt committed to him by his great Maſter.</p>
               <p>THE time or manner of his death are not very well agreed upon by the ancients: ſome affirming him to die in Egypt, others in Greece, the Roman martyrology in Bythinia, and Dorothaeus at Epheſus; ſome will have that he died a natural, and others a violent death. Indeed, neither Euſebius nor St. Jerom take any notice of it, but Gregory Nazianzen, Paulinus biſhop of Nola, and ſeveral others, expreſsly aſſert, that he ſuffered martyrdom; and Nicephorus gives us this particular account of it: "That coming into Greece, he ſucceſsfully preached the goſpel, and baptiſed many converts into the Chriſtian faith, till, at laſt, a party of infidels oppoſed his doctrines: but being unable to ſilence him by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſon and argument, they had recourſe to cruelty, dragged him from the place where he was teaching the goſpel, and hung him on an olive tree, in the eightieth, or according to St. Jerom, in the eighty-fourth year of his age." Kirſtenius thinks, he ſuffered martyrdom at Rome ſoon after St. Paul's firſt impriſonment, becauſe he did not continue his acts of the apoſtles any further, which it is natural to think he would have done, had he lived any conſiderable time after St. Paul's departure. His body was afterwards, by the command of Conſtantine, or his ſon Conſtantius, removed with great ſolemnity to Conſtantinople, and buried in the great church, erected to the memory of the apoſtles, in that city.</p>
               <p>HIS goſpel, and the acts of the apoſtles, were written by him for the uſe of the church; both which he dedicated to Theophilus, which many of the ancients ſuppoſed to be a feigned name, denoting a lover of God, a title common to all ſincere Chriſtians: but others think it was a real perſon, becauſe the title of "moſt excellent," is attributed to him, the uſual title and form of addreſs in thoſe times to princes and great men. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he was ſome magiſtrate, whom St. Luke had converted and baptized, and to whom he dedicated theſe books, not only as a teſtimony of honourable reſpect, but alſo as a means of giving him further certainty and aſſurance of thoſe things wherein he had inſtructed him, and which it was requiſite he ſhould be informed of.</p>
               <p>THE principal tranſactions of our Lord's life are contained in his goſpel; and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars omitted by him, are, in general, of leſs importance than thoſe the other evangeliſts forbear to mention.</p>

               <head>THE LIFE OF ST. JOHN, The APOSTLE and EVANGELIST; commonly called the DIVINE.</head>
               <p>THIS beloved diſciple of our Lord was a native of Galilee, the ſon of Zebedee and Salome, one of thoſe devout women that conſtantly attended on our Lord in his miniſtry, and brother of James the Great. Before his becoming a diſciple of the bleſſed JESUS, he was, in all brobability, a follower of John the Baptiſt, and is thought to be that other diſciple, who, in the firſt chapter of his goſpel, is ſaid to have been preſent with Andrew when John declared JESUS, to be the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> and thereupon to have followed him to the place of his reſidence.</p>
               <p>THOUGH St. John was by much the youngeſt of the apoſtles, he was nevertheleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into as great a ſhare of his Maſter's confidence as any of them. He was one of thoſe to whom he communicated the moſt private tranſactions of his life: one of thoſe whom he took with him when he raiſed the daughter of Jairus from the dead; one of thoſe to whom he exhibited a ſpecimen of his divinity, in his transfiguration on the mount; one of thoſe who were preſent at his conference with Moſes and Elias, and heard that voice which declared him <hi>the beloved Son of God;</hi> and one of thoſe who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in his ſolitude, moſt retired devotions, and bitter agonies in the garden. Thus of the three who were made the witneſſes of their Maſter's actions, which it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to conceal, St. John conſtantly enjoyed the privilege of being one: nay, even of theſe three he ſeems to have had, in ſome reſpects, the preference; witneſs his lying on his maſter's boſom at the paſchal ſupper: and even when Peter was deſirous of knowing who was the perſon that ſhould betray their Maſter, and durſt not himſelf aſk the queſtion, he made uſe of St. John, to propoſe it to their Lord, as the perſon moſt likely to ſucceed in obtaining an anſwer.</p>
               <p>OUR apoſtle endeavoured, in ſome meaſure, to anſwer theſe inſtances of particular favour, by returns of particular kindneſs and conſtancy; for though he had at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his Maſter on his apprehenſion, yet he ſoon recovered himſelf, and came to ſeek his ſaviour, confidently entered the high-prieſt's hall, followed our Lord through the ſeveral particulars of his trial, and at laſt waited on him at his execution, owning him, as well as being owned by him, in the midſt of armed ſoldiers, and in the thickeſt crowds of his moſt inveterate enemies. Here it was that our great Redeemer committed to his care his ſorrowful and diſconſolate mother, with his dying breath. And certainly

the holy JESUS could not have given a more honourable teſtimony of his particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and kindneſs to St. John, than by leaving his own mother to his truſt and care, and ſubſtituting him to ſupply that duty he himſelf paid her, while he reſided in this vale of ſorrow amongſt men.</p>
               <p>ST. JOHN no ſooner heard of our Lord's being riſen from the chambers of the duſt, than he, in company with Peter, haſtened to the ſepulchre. There ſeems indeed to have been a peculiar intimacy between theſe two diſciples; it was Peter that St. John introduced into the palace of the high-prieſt; it was Peter to whom he gave notice of CHRIST's appearing when he came to them at the ſea of Tiberias, in the habit of a ſtranger; and it was for St. John that Peter was ſo ſolicitouſly inquiſitive to know what was determined concerning him when our Saviour expreſſed himſelf ſomewhat ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reſpecting that diſciple.</p>
               <p>AFTER the aſcenſion of the Saviour of the world, when the apoſtles made a diviſion of the provinces amongſt themſelves, that of Aſia fell to the ſhare of St. John, though he did not immediately enter upon his charge, but continued at Jeruſalem till the death of the bleſſed Virgin, which happened about fifteen years after our Lord's aſcenſion: being releaſed from the truſt committed to his care by his dying Maſter, he retired into Aſia, and induſtriouſly applied himſelf to the propagating of Chriſtianity, preaching where the goſpel had not yet been known, and confirming it where it was already planted. Many churches of note and eminence were of his founding, particularly thoſe of Smyrna, Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodocea, and others; but his chief place of reſidence was at Epheſus, where St. Paul had many years before founded a church, and conſtituted Timothy biſhop of it. Nor can we ſuppoſe that he confined his miniſtry entirely to Aſia Minor; it is highly reaſonable to think that he preached in other parts of the Eaſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to the Parthians, his firſt epiſtle being anciently directed to them; and the Jeſuits aſſure us that the inhabitants of the kingdom of Baſſorain Indian affirm, that, according to a tradition handed down from their anceſtors, St. John planted the Chriſtian faith in their country, where the Chriſtians are called by his name.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſpent ſeveral years at Epheſus, he was accuſed to Domitian, who had begun a perſecution againſt the Chriſtians as an eminent aſſerter of Atheiſm and impiety, and a public ſubverter of the religion of the empire; ſo that by his command, the proconſul ſent him bound to Rome, where he met with the treatment that might have been expected from ſo barbarous a prince, being thrown into a chaldron of boiling oil: but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who reſerved him for further ſervices in the vineyard of his Son, reſtrained the heat, as he did in the fiery furnace of old, and delivered him from this ſeeming una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable deſtruction. And ſurely one would have thought that ſo miraculous a deliverance would have been ſufficient to have perſuaded any rational man that the religion he taught was from God, and that he was protected from danger by the hand of Omnipotence; but miracles themſelves were not ſufficient to convince this cruel emperor, or abate his fury: he ordered St. John to be tranſported to a diſconſolate iſland in the Archipelago, called Patmos, where he continued ſeveral years inſtructing the poor inhabitants in the knowledge of the Chriſtian faith; and here, about the end of Domitian's reign, he wrote his book of Revelation, exhibiting, by viſions and prophetical repreſentations, the ſtate and condition of Chriſtianity in the future periods and ages of the church, till the final conſumation of all things.</p>
               <p>AFTER the death of Domitian, and on the ſucceſſion of Nerva, who repealed all the odious acts of his predeceſſor, and by public edicts recalled thoſe whom the fury of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian had baniſhed, St. John returned to Aſia and fixed his ſeat again at Epheſus; and rather, becauſe the people of that city had lately martyred Timothy their biſhop. Here,

               <p>THIS great evangeliſt and apoſtle ſeems always to have led a ſingle life; though ſome of the ancients tell us he was a married man. With regard to his natural temper, he ſeems to have been of an eager and reſolute diſpoſition, eaſily inflamed, but which age had reduced to a calmer temper. He was poliſhed by no ſtudy or arts of learning; but, what was wanting from human art, was abundantly ſupplied by the excellent conſtitution of his mind, and that fulneſs of divine grace with which he was adorned: his humility was admirable, ſtudiouſly concealing his own honour; for in his epiſtles, he never ſtyles himſelf either apoſtle or evangeliſt; the title of preſbyter or elder, is all he aſſumes, and probably in regard to his age as much as his office, in his goſpel, when he ſpeaks of <hi>the diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> he conſtantly conceals his own name, leaving the reader to diſcover whom he meant: love and charity he practiſed himſelf, and affectionately preſſed them upon others; the great love of his Saviour towards him, ſeems to have inſpired his ſoul with a larger and more generous charity than the reſt. This is the great vein that runs through all his writings, eſpecially his epiſtles, where he urges it as the great and peculiar law of Chriſtianity, and without which all other pretences to the religion of the holy JESUS are vain and frivolous, uſeleſs and inſignificant: and this was his conſtant practice to the very hour of his diſſolution; for when age and the decays of nature had rendered him ſo weak that he was unable to preach to the people any longer, he was conſtantly led, at every public meeting, to the church of Epheſus, and always repeated to them the ſame precept, <hi>Little children, love one another:</hi> and when his hearers wearied with the conſtant repetition of the ſame thing, aſked him why he never varied his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he anſwered, "Becauſe to love one another was the command of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and if they did nothing more, this alone was ſufficient to denote whoſe they were, and whom they ſerved."</p>
               <p>THE largeſt meaſures of his charity were, however, diſplayed in the remarkable care he took to promote the ſalvation of the ſouls of men; travelling from Eaſt to Weſt, in propagating the principles of that religion he was ſent to teach, patiently enduring every torment, ſurmounting every difficulty, and removing every obſtacle, to ſave the ſouls of the human race, free their minds from error and idolatry, and turn them from the paths of vice and debauchery. Amongſt many other inſtances of this kind, Euſebius relates the following.</p>

JOHN, during one of his viſitations of the church at Epheſus, was greatly pleaſed with the appearance and behaviour of a young man, whom he called to him, and, with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial charge, recommended to the biſhop, who undertook the truſt, and promiſed to diſcharge it with the greateſt fidelity: accordingly, the biſhop took him home with him to his houſe carefully inſtructed him in the principles of the Chriſtian religion, and at laſt baptiſed and confirmed him. After he had proceeded thus far, he thought he might a little relax the reins of diſcipline; but the youth made a bad uſe of his liberty, and being debauched by evil company, became the captain of a gang of robbers, and committed the moſt horrid outrages in the adjacent countries. St. John, being informed of this at his return, ſharply reproved the biſhop, and determined to find the young man out; never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:029927_0322_0FE33966A6563198"/>
the dangers that would inevitably attend him, by venturing himſelf amongſt perſons of deſperate fortunes: accordingly, he repaired to the mountains where they uſually abode, and being taken by one of the robbers placed as a watch, he deſired to be carried to their captain, who, on ſeeing St. John coming towards him, immediately fled. The apoſtle forgetting his age, haſtened after him; but being unable to overtake him, he paſſionately cried out, 'Child, why doſt thou run from thy father, an old and defenceleſs man? Spare me the pains of following thee, and let not terrors and deſpair ſeize upon thee. Thy ſalvation is not irrecoverable. Stay, and be convinced that CHRIST himſelf hath ſent me.' At theſe words, the young man ſtopped, fixed his eyes upon the earth, trembled in every part, and burſt into a flood of tears. And when the aged apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached he embraced him, and implored forgiveneſs with ſuch weeping and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he ſeemed to be re-baptized, and to waſh away his ſins with his own tears. The apoſtle received him with the greateſt kindneſs, aſſured him that he had obtained pardon for his ſins at the hands of his great Redeemer, and returned him a true penitent and convert to the church of which he was a member.</p>
               <p>OUR apoſtle's care for the ſouls of men, is further evidenced by the writings he left to poſterity, The firſt of which in time, though placed laſt in the ſacred canon, is his Apocalypſe, or book of Revelation, which he wrote during his baniſhment at Patmos. After the preface and admonition given to the biſhops of the ſeven churches in Aſia, it contains a prophetic view of the perſecutions the faithful were to ſuffer from the Jews, Heretics, and tyrannical princes, together with the peaceable and flouriſhing ſtate of the church, till diſturbed by other enemies; and the happineſs of the church triumphant in heaven. And hence St. John is, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, a prophet, and has thereby one material addition to his titles, being not only an apoſtle and evangeliſt, but alſo a prophet: an honour peculiar to himſelf. St. Peter was an apoſtle, but no evangeliſt: St. Mark and St. Luke were evangeliſts, but no apoſtles: St. Matthew, was an apoſtle and evangeliſt, but no prophet: but St. John was an apoſtle, an evangeliſt, and a prophet likewiſe.</p>
               <p>HIS three epiſtles take place, in order of time, next to the Apocalypſe; the firſt of which is catholic, being calculated for all times and places, and containing the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rules for the conduct of a Chriſtian life, preſſing to holineſs and pureneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and not to be ſatisfied with a naked and empty profeſſion of religion; not to be led away with the crafty inſinuations of ſeducers; and cautioning men againſt the poiſonous principles and practices of the Gnoſtics. The apoſtle here, according to his uſual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, conceals his name, it being of more conſequence to a wiſe man what is ſaid, than he who ſays it. It appears from St. Auguſtine, that this epiſtle was anciently inſcribed to the Parthians, becauſe, in all probability, St. John preached the goſpel in Parthia. The other two epiſtles are but ſhort, and directed to particular perſons; the one a lady of great quality, the other to the charitable and hoſpitable Gaius, the kindeſt friend, and the moſt courteous entertainer of all indigent Chriſtians, in thoſe primitive times.</p>
               <p>WE are told by Euſebius and St. Jerom, that St. John, having peruſed the other three goſpels, approved and confirmed them by his authority; but obſerving, at the ſame time, that theſe evangeliſts had omitted ſeveral of our bleſſed Saviour's tranſactions, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe which were performed before the Baptiſt's impriſonment, he wrote his goſpel to ſupply what was wanting in them; and becauſe ſeveral Heretics were at that time ſprung up in the church, who denied the divinity of our bleſſed Saviour, he took care to guard againſt theſe hereſies, by proving that our great Redeemer was God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. He largely records our Saviour's diſcourſes, but takes little notice of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, probably becauſe the other evangeliſts had ſo fully and particularly written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="unknown:029927_0323_0FE33968F5039C08"/>PREVIOUS to his undertaking the taſk of writing his goſpel, he cauſed a general faſt to be kept by all the Aſian churches, to implore the bleſſing of heaven on ſo great and momentous an undertaking. When this was done, he ſet about the work, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated it in ſo excellent and ſublime a manner, that the ancients generally compared him to an eagle's ſoaring aloft amongſt the clouds, whither the weak eye of man was not able to follow him. "Among all the evangelical writers," ſays St. Baſil, "none are like St. John, the ſon of thunder, for the ſublimity of his ſpeech, and the height of his diſcourſes, which are beyond any man's capacity fully to reach and comprehend." "St. John, as a true ſon of thunder," ſays Epiphanius, by a loftineſs of ſpeech peculiar to himſelf, "acquaints us, as it were out of the clouds and dark receſſes of wiſdom, with the divine doctrine of the Son of God, the glorious Saviour of mankind."</p>
               <p>THUS have we given the character of the writings of this great apoſtle and evangeliſt, who as we have hinted before, was honoured with the endearing title of being the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciple of the Son of God; and was a writer ſo ſublime as to deſerve, by way of eminence, the character of <hi>St. John the Divine.</hi>

               <head>THE LIFE OF ST. PAUL, The APOSTLE to the GENTILES.</head>
               <p>THIS eminent and laborious apoſtle was a native of Tarſus, and a deſcendant from the ancient ſtock of Abraham. He was born about two years before the bleſſed JESUS, and belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, the youngeſt ſon of Jacob, who thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of him. <hi>Benjamin ſhall raven as a wolf; in the morning he ſhall devour the prey, and at night he ſhall divide the ſpoil;</hi> a prophetical character which Tertullian and others will have to be accompliſhed in this apoſtle: for, in his youth, or the morning of his days, he proſecuted the churches, deſtroying the flock of the Almighty; devouring the prey: in his declining age, or evening of his days, he became a phyſician of the nations, feeding and diſtributing with the greateſt care and aſſiduity, the ſheep of CHRIST, the great Shepherd of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>THE place of this apoſtle's nativity, was Tarſus, the metropolis of Cilica, ſituated about three hundred miles diſtant from Jeruſalem; it was exceedingly rich and populous, and a Roman municipium, or free corporation, inveſted with the privileges of Rome by the two firſt emperors, as a reward for the citizens' firm adherence to the Caeſars, in the rebellion of Craſſus. St. Paul was therefore born a Roman citizen, and he often pleads this privilege on his trials.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of Tarſus uſually ſent their children into other cities for learning and improvement, eſpecially to Jeruſalem, where they were ſo numerous, that they had a ſynagogue of their own, called the ſynagogue of the Cilic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s. To this capital our apoſtle was alſo ſent, and brought up at the feet of that eminent rabbi Gamalia, in the moſt exact knowledge of the law of Moſes: nor did he fail to profit by the inſtructions of that great maſter; for he ſo diligently conformed himſelf to his precepts, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out boaſting, he aſſerts of himſelf, that touching the righteouſneſs of the law, he was blameleſs, and defied even his enemies to alledge any thing to the contrary, even in his youth. He joined himſelf to the ſect of the Phariſees, the moſt ſtrict order of the Jewiſh religion; but, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ſame time, the proudeſt, and the greateſt enemies to CHRIST and his holy religion, as evidently appears by the character given of them by the evangeliſts, and our Lord's deſcription of that ſelf-righteous ſect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="unknown:029927_0324_0FE3396A796B5B28"/>RESPECTING his double capacity, of Jewiſh extraction and Roman freedom, he had two names <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the former Hebrew, and the latter Latin. It was common for the deſcendants of Benjamin to give the name of Saul to their children ever ſince the time of the firſt king of Iſrael, who was choſen out of that tribe; and Paul was a name as common amongſt the Romans. We muſt alſo conſider his trade of tent-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as part of his education, it being the conſtant practice of the Jews, to bring up their children to ſome honeſt calling, that, in caſe of neceſſity, they might provide for themſelves by the labour of their own hands, without becoming burthenſome to the public.</p>
               <p>HAVING obtained a thorough knowledge of the ſciences cultivated by the Jews, and being naturally of a very hot and fiery temper, Saul became a great champion for the law of Moſes, and the tradition of the elders, which he conſidered as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal for God. This rendered him impatient of all oppoſition to the doctrine and tenets he had imbibed, and a vehement blaſphemer and perſecutor of Chriſtians, who were commonly reputed the enemies and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſtroyers of the Jewiſh economy. We muſt not however conſider our apoſtle as guilty of the pride and hypocriſy of the Phariſees; for he declares, that he had ever been careful to act in conformity to the dictates of his conſcience, by which he thought himſelf bound to do many things contrary to the name of JESUS of Nazareth. It was therefore the prejudice of his education, and the natural warmth of his temper, that excited him to thoſe violent perſecutions of the Chriſtians, for which he became ſo famous, in the infancy of the church.</p>
               <p>WE find that the firſt action he engaged in, was the diſputation he and his countrymen had with the martyr Stephen, concerning the Meſſiah. The Chriſtian was too hard for them in the diſpute; but they were too powerful for him in their civil intereſts; for being enraged at his convincing arguments, they carried him before the high-prieſt, who, by falſe accuſations condemned him to death. How far Saul was concerned in this cruel action, is impoſſible to ſay; all we know is, that he kept the raiment of them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ew him, and, conſequently, was acceſſary to his death.</p>
               <p>THE enemies of the church having thus raiſed a ſtorm of perſecution againſt it, it increaſed prodigiouſly, and the poor Chriſtians of Jeruſalem were miſerably harraſſed and diſperſed. In this perſecution, our apoſtle was principal agent, ſearching all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts for the afflicted ſaints, beating ſome in the ſynagogue, compelling ſome to blaſpheme, confining ſome in priſon, and procuring others to be put to death for their profeſſion: nor could Jeruſalem and the adjacent parts confine his fiery zeal; he applied to the Sanhedrim, and procured a commiſſion from that court, to extend his perſecution to Damaſcus. How eternally inſatiable is the fury of a miſguided zeal! how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and unwearied in its deſigns of cruelty? It had already ſufficiently harraſſed the poor Chriſtians at Jeruſalem, but not content with that, it perſecuted them to ſtrange cities; even to Damaſcus itſelf, whither many of them had fled for ſhelter, reſolving to being them back to Jeruſalem, in order to their puniſhment and execution there.</p>
               <p>WE think it neceſſary to obſerve here, that the Jewiſh Sanhedrim had not only the power of ſeizing and ſcourging offenders againſt their law within the bounds of their own country, but, by the connivance and favour of the Romans, might ſend into other countries, where there were any ſynagogues that acknowledged a dependence in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affairs upon the council of Jeruſalem, to apprehend them: and accordingly, Saul was ſent to Damaſcus, to apprehend what Chriſtians he could find in that city, and bring them bound to Jeruſalem, to be tried and puniſhed.</p>
               <p>IT was however Saul's peculiar happineſs, that the Almighty deſigned to employ him in a work of a very different nature, and, accordingly ſtopped him in his journey: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="304" facs="unknown:029927_0325_0FE3396C01922538"/>
was travelling between Jeruſalem and Damaſcus, to execute the commiſſion of the Jewiſh Sanhedrim, a refulgent light, far exceeding the brightneſs of the ſun, darted upon him; at which both he and his companions were terribly amazed and confounded, falling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their horſes, proſtrate on the ground. Amidſt this confuſion, a voice was heard in the Hebrew language, ſaying <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> To which Saul replied, <hi>Who art thou, Lord?</hi> And was immediately anſwered, <hi>I am Jeſus,</hi> of Nazareth, <hi>whom thou perſecuteſt: it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> As if the bleſſed JESUS had ſaid, "All thy attempts to extirpate the faith in me, will prove abortive, and, like kicking againſt the ſpikes wound and torment thyſelf the more."</p>
               <p>BEING now ſufficiently convinced of his folly in acting againſt JESUS, whom he was now aſſured to be the true Meſſiah, Saul aſked, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> On which the bleſſed JESUS informed him of the true intention of his appearance, 'Ariſe, ſaid he, and ſtand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a witneſs, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and inheritance amongſt them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me,' Acts xxvi.16, 17, 18. And for further inſtruction, the immaculate JESUS referred him to one of his followers, named Ananias, commanding him to repair immediately to the city, and receive further inſtruction from that diſciple.</p>
               <p>THE men who were with him heard the voice, but did not ſee the perſon who ſpake from heaven: in all probability they were ignorant of the Hebrew language, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only heard a confuſed ſound; for the apoſtle himſelf tells us, that they heard not the voice of him that ſpake, that is, they did not hear it with a proper degree of underſtanding.</p>
               <p>SAUL now aroſe from the earth, but found himſelf deprived of ſight, the reſplendent brightneſs of the viſion being too intenſe for mortal eyes to behold. His companions therefore led him by the hand to the city of Damaſcus, where he entered the houſe of Judas, and remained there three days without ſight, nor did he either eat or drink but ſpent his time in prayer to the Almighty, beſeeching him to pardon the ſins of his paſt life, and be gracious to him.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, in the mean time appeared in a viſion to Ananias, a very devout and religious man, highly eſteemed by all the inhabitants of Damaſcus, though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the religion of the crucified JESUS commanding him to go into ſuch a ſtreet of the city, and enquire in the houſe of Judas, for one Saul of Tarſus, then offering up the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers to the throne of grace. Annias, who, was ever ready to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Moſt High, ſtartled at the name, having heard of his bloody practices at Jeruſalem, and what commiſſion he was now come to execute in Damaſcus: he therefore ſuſpected that his pretended converſion was nothing more than a ſnare artfully laid for the Chriſtians. But our bleſſed Saviour ſoon removed his apprehenſions, by telling him that his ſuſpicions were entirely deſtitute of foundation; and that he had now taken him as a choſen veſſel to preach the goſpel both to the Jews and Gentiles, and even before the greateſt monarchs of the earth; acquainting him, at the ſame time, with the great things he ſhould do and ſuffer for the ſake of the goſpel, what chains and impriſonments, what racks and ſcourges, what hunger and thirſt, what ſhipwrecks, and that, at laſt, he ſhould even ſuffer death itſelf.</p>
               <p>THE fears of Ananias being thus quieted, he immediately obeyed the heavenly viſion, repaired to the houſe of Judas, and laid hands upon Saul, ſaying, "That JESUS who
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:029927_0326_0FE33975510E0B08"/>
appeared to thee in the way, hath ſent me to reſtore thy ſight, and, by the infuſion of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pirit, to give thee the knowledge of thoſe truths which thou haſt blindly and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly perſecuted; but who now is willing to receive thee by baptiſm into his church, and make thee a member of his body."</p>
               <p>THIS ſpeech was no ſooner pronounced, than there fell from his eyes thick films reſembling ſcales, and he received his ſight, and after baptiſm converſed freely with the Chriſtians of Damaſcus. Nor did he only converſe with them; he alſo to the great aſtoniſhment of the whole church, preached the goſpel to thoſe Chriſtians he came down with an intention to deſtroy, boldly aſſerting, <hi>that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the Son of God;</hi> and proving it to the Jews with ſuch demonſtrative evidence, that they were confounded, and found it impoſſible to anſwer him, or diſprove his arguments.</p>
               <p>ST. Paul did not ſtay long at Damaſcus after his converſion; nor did he return to Jeruſalem; but being commanded to preach the goſpel to the Gentiles, he retired into Arabia Petrae, where he received a full revelation of all the myſteries of Chriſtianity; for he himſelf declares, that he converſed not with fleſh and blood. And having preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeveral parts of that country ſome time, he returned again to Damaſcus, applying himſelf with the utmoſt aſſiduity to the great work of the miniſtry, frequenting the ſynagogues there, powerfully confuting the objections commonly made by the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Jacob againſt JESUS of Nazareth, and converting great numbers of Jews and Gentiles to the faith.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was indeed remarkably zealous in his preaching, and bleſſed with a very extraordinary method of reaſoning, whereby he proved the fundamental points of Chriſtianity beyond exception. This irritated the Jews to the higheſt degree: and, at length, after two or three years continuance in thoſe parts, they found means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on the governor of Damaſcus to have him put to death: but they knew it would be difficult to take him, as he had ſo many friends in the city; they therefore kept themſelves a continual watch, ſearched all the houſes where they ſuppoſed he might conceal himſelf, and alſo obtained a guard from the governor to obſerve the gates, in order to prevent his eſcaping from the place.</p>
               <p>HIS Chriſtian friends were far from deſerting him in this diſtreſs; they tried every method that offered to procure his eſcape: but finding it impoſſible for him to paſs through either of the gates of the city, they let him down from one of their houſes through a window in a baſket, over the wall, by which means the cruel deſigns of his enemies were rendered ineffectual. St. Paul having thus eſcaped from his malicious perſecutors, repaired to Jeruſalem, and, on his arrival, addreſſed himſelf to the church: but they knowing well the former temper and principles of this great perſecutor, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his company, till Barnabas brought him to Peter, who was not yet caſt into priſon, and to James our Lord's brother, biſhop of Jeruſalem, informing them of his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous converſion, and that he had preached the goſpel with the greateſt boldneſs in the ſynagogue of Damaſcus; upon which they gladly received him, and entertained him fifteen days with the greateſt hoſpitality and affection.</p>
               <p>HE was remarkably aſſiduous during this interval, in preaching the goſpel of the Son of God, and confuting the Helleniſtic Jews, with the greateſt courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſnares were ſoon laid for him, as malice can as eaſily ceaſe to be, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inactive; and being warned by God in a viſion, that his teſtimony would not be received at Jeruſalem, and therefore it was neceſſary for him to depart and preach the goſpel to the Gentiles. Accordingly, being conducted by the brethren to Caeſarea
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:029927_0327_0FE33976E34E25A0"/>
Philippi, he ſet ſail for Tarſus, his native city; from whence he was ſoon after broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>HERE the diſciples firſt acquired the name of Chriſtians, for before they were ſtyled Nazareens; but this appellation ſoon prevailed all over the world, and the former wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A terrible famine, foretold by Hygabus, happened about this time, in ſeveral parts of the Roman empire, particularly in Judea; which induced the Chriſtians at Antioch to compaſſionate the miſeries of their brethren at Jeruſalem; and, accordingly raiſed conſiderable contributions for their relief, which they ſent to the capital of Judea by the hands of Barnabas and Saul who, immediately after executing their commiſſion, returned to Antioch. But while they were performing the public exerciſes of religion, it was revealed to them by the Holy Ghoſt, that they ſhould ſet apart Barnabas and Saul to preach the goſpel in other places, which was accordingly done, and they were immediately deputed for that ſervice by prayer, faſting, and the impoſition of hands.</p>
               <p>THEY firſt of all viſited Seleucia, where they did not continue long, but ſailed for Cyprus; and at Salamis, a great city in that iſland, they preached in the ſynagogue of the Jews. From hence they removed to Paphos, the reſidence of Sergius Paulus, the proconſul of the iſland, a man of great wiſdom and prudence, but miſerably ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the wicked artifices of Bar-Jeſus, a Jewiſh impoſter, who ſtyled himſelf Elymas, or the magician, vehemently oppoſed the apoſtles, and kept the proconſul from embracing the faith, as preached by them.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, the proconſul called for the apoſtles, who, after ſeverely checking Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas for his malicious oppoſition to the truth, told him the divine vengeance was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the Almighty, in depriving him of the uſe of his bodily eyes, bore a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able analogy to the blindneſs of thoſe of his mind, which were ſo wilfully and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhut againſt the light of the goſpel, and alſo endeavoured to keep others in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance.

               <p>AFTER this remarkable ſucceſs in Cyprus, St. Paul repaired to Phrygia and Pamphili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Soon after their arrival, they entered the ſynagogue of the Jews on the Sabbath-day, and after the reading of the law, Paul being invited by the rulers of the Synagogue, delivered himſelf in the following manner: "Hearken, all ye deſcendants of Jacob, and ye that fear the Almighty, to the words of my mouth. The God of Iſrael made choice of our fathers, and loved them, when they had no city of their own to dwell in, but were ſtrangers and ſlaves in Egypt, bringing them from thence with a mighty hand and a ſtrethed out arm; fed them in the wilderneſs forty years, and would not ſuffer his anger to riſe againſt them, though they often provoked him in the deſert. On their arrival in the land he promiſed their fathers, he deſtroyed the nations that inhabited it, and placed them in that fruitful country, dividing it to them by lot, for their inheritance.</p>

And according to his promiſe, the Almighty hath raiſed up to the ſons of David a Saviour JESUS, which is CHRIST the Lord. The baptiſm of repentance having been preached before his coming by John: and as the forerunner executed his office, he aſked his followers, <hi>Whom think ye that I am?</hi> You muſt not miſtake me for the Meſſiah; he will ſoon follow me, but I am not worthy to perform the meaneſt office for him.</p>
               <p>"THEREFORE, ye deſcendants of Abraham, and all others who fear the Almighty, to you <hi>is the word of this ſalvation ſent.</hi> For the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and rulers of Iſrael, being ignorant of him, and the voices of the prophets though read every Sabbath in their ſynagygues, fulfilled their predictions by condemning the immaculate Son of the Moſt High. They found indeed no fault in him, though they earneſtly deſired Pilate that he might be crucified.</p>
               <p>"EVERY thing that had been written by the prophets concerning him, being now fulfilled, they took him from the tree, and depoſited his body in the chambers of the grave: but death had no power to detain him: his Almighty Father raiſed him from the habitations of the dead. After which, he was ſeen during many days by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples who attended him from Galilee, and who are the witneſſes, choſen by Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, of theſe great and miraculous works. And we now declare unto you glad-tidings namely, That the promiſe made by the Almighty to our forefathers, he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us their children, by raiſing JESUS from the dead. The prophet David alſo ſaid, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> He alſo foretold, that he ſhould return from the chambers of the duſt, and no more be ſubject to corruption: <hi>I will give him,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the ſure mercies of David.</hi> And again, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine Holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Now this prophecy muſt relate to the Meſſiah, for David himſelf, after he had ſwayed the ſceptre of Iſrael a certain time, fell aſleep, was depoſited in the chambers of the grave, and his fleſh ſaw corruption: but the great Son of David, whom the Almighty raiſed from the dead, never ſaw corruption, as it was written of him.</p>

               <p>THE apoſtle's ſpeech had the deſired effect; for ſeveral of the Jews, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth, deſired to hear him on the next Sabbath, and the apoſtles perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to continue firm in the belief of theſe things. The enſuing Sabbath, almoſt the whole city flocked to hear the apoſtles; at which the Jews were filled with envy, and contradicted Paul, uttering many blaſphemous expreſſions againſt the name of JESUS of Nazareth: but their oppoſition could not daunt the apoſtles, who boldly declared, that our bleſſed Saviour had charged them to preach the goſpel firſt to the Jews; but as they ſo obſtinately rejected it, they were now to addr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This increaſed the malice and fury of the Jews, who, by falſe and artful inſinuations, prevailed on ſome of the more devout and honourable women to bring over their huſbands to the party; by which means, Paul and Barnabas were driven out of the city. At which the apoſtles departed, ſhaking off the duſt from their feet, as a teſtimony of their ingratitude, infidelity, and rejection of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="unknown:029927_0329_0FE3397A10AB6138"/>THEY went from Antioch to Iconium, the metropolis of Lycaonia, a province of the Leſſer Aſia, where they again entered into the ſynagogue of the Jews, notwithſtanding the ill-treatment they had met with from the Jews in other places; for ſo great was their zeal for the goſpel, that they were not to be deterred from preaching it by ill uſage, however great. Therefore, according to their uſual method, they began their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the aſſembly of Iſraelites; and the Almighty ſo far aſſiſted their endeavours, that many, both Jews and proſelytes, believed. Their ſucceſs encouraged them to continue a conſiderable time in this city, to inſtruct the converts, and confirm their faith by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. But, though they had gained a conſiderable part of the city to the faith, yet many continued in their infidelity: the old leven of Jewiſh malice began again to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the unbelieving Jews, having ſtirred up the Gentiles againſt the apoſtles, at laſt prevailed on the multitude to ſtone them: but the apoſtles having timely notice of their deſign, fled from the city, and travelled to Lyſtra, where they preached the goſpel to the inhabitants, and thoſe who dwelt in the country adjacent.</p>
               <p>AT Lyſtra, there was a man amongſt the converts, who had been lame from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's womb, and never had walked: and Paul, perceiving that he had faith to be ſaved, thought proper to add the cure of his body to that of his ſoul, knowing that it would not only be beneficial to him, but to all the reſt of the believers, by confirming their faith: and, that the miracle might be wrought in the moſt conſpicuous manner, be, in the midſt of the congregation, ſaid in an audible voice to the man, <hi>Stand upright on thy feet:</hi> and the words were no ſooner pronounced, than his ſtrength was at once reſtored, and he leaped up and walked, praiſing God.</p>
               <p>THEY who were eye-witneſſes to this miracle well knew, that it was not wrought by any human power; but having been initiated into the ſuperſtitious cuſtoms of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, cried out, in the ſpeech of Lycoania, <hi>The Gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of men.</hi> And accordingly they called Barnabas Jupiter, becauſe of his venerable gravity, and Paul Mercury, from his oloquence. Nor was it long before the whole city reſounded with acclamations; ſo that almoſt all the inhabitants gathered themſelves together, and, preceded by the prieſt of Jupiter, and oxen dreſſed in garlands, they came to the houſe where the apoſtles were, intending to do ſacrifice to them: But as ſoon as Barnabas and Paul underſtood their intentions, they were greatly affected at this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious attempt; and rending their clothes to expreſs their grief and abhorrance of the action, ran to them, crying out, "Ye men of Lyſtra, ye are miſtaken in the object of your worſhip; for though we have done many miracles in the name, and by the power of CHRIST, yet we are no more than men, and ſubject to the ſame paſſions as yourſelves, and preach unto you the glad-tidings of ſalvation, that ye may forſake the vanities of this world, and turn to the living God, who created the heaven and the earth, the ſea, and all the creatures they contain. This Omnipotent being ſuffered all nations formerly to walk in their own ways, though he never left himſelf without a witneſs, doing the greateſt good to the children of men; it is he that ſendeth rain from heaven, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the year with fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with joy and gladneſs."</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle's argument had the deſired effect; and the people were at laſt, though with difficulty, perſuaded to lay aſide their intended idolatrous ſacrifice; and ſurely no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be more proper to affect the minds of the audience.

               <p>THUS having perſuaded the people to deſiſt from the idolatrous worſhip they would have paid them, the apoſtles continued their labours in inſtructing the people, and planting in this city the goſpel of the Son of God: but the malice of the Jews ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them; for ſome of theſe bigotted Iſraelites coming from Antioch and Iconium, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated and ſtirred up the multitude; ſo that thoſe very perſons who could hardly be reſtrained from offering ſacrifice to them, now uſed them like ſlaves, ſtoning them, in ſo cruel a manner, that Paul was thought to be dead, and as ſuch they dragged him out of the city; but while the Chriſtians of Lyſtra were attending on his corpſe, probably in order to carry him to his grave, he aroſe and returned with them into the city; and the next day departed with Barnabas to Derbe where they preached the goſpel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted many; no danger being able to terrify them from the work of the miniſtry, and publiſhing the glad-tidings of ſalvation in every place they came to.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, they did not long continue at Derbe, but returned to Lyſtra, Iconium, and Antioch of Piſidia, confirming the Chriſtians of thoſe places in the faith, earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them to perſevere, and not be diſcouraged with thoſe troubles and perſecutions which they muſt expect would attend the profeſſion of the goſpel. And that the affairs of the church might be conducted with more regularity, they ordained elders and paſtors, to teach, to inſtruct, and to watch over them; and then left them to the protection of the Almighty to whoſe care they recommended them by faſting and prayer.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtles, after leaving Antioch, paſſed through Piſidia, and came to Pamphylia; and after preaching the goſpel at Perga, they went down to Attalia. Having thus finiſhed the circuit of their miniſtry, they returned back to Antioch in Syria, from whence they at firſt departed. Here they ſummoned the church, and gave them an account of their miniſtry, the ſucceſs it had met with in theſe different parts, and how great a door had thus been opened for the converſion of the Heathens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="unknown:029927_0331_0FE33982F5E126E0"/>DURING St. Paul's ſtay at Antioch, that famous controverſy, relating to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh ceremonies in the Chriſtian diſpenſation, was ſet on foot by certain Jewiſh converts, to the great diſturbance of the whole church. And it was determined to ſend Paul and Barnabas to conſult with the Apoſtles and church at Jeruſalem, that this affair might be ſettled on the moſt ſolid foundation. On their arrival at Jeruſalem, they firſt addreſſed themſelves to Peter, James, and John, the pillars of that church, by whom they were kindly entertained, and kindly admitted to the right-hand of fellowſhip. And perceiving by the account given them by St. Paul, that the goſpel of the uncircumciſion was committed to him, as that of the circumciſion was to Peter, they agreed that Peter ſhould preach to the Jews, and Paul to the Gentiles. This being determined, a council was ſummoned, wherein Peter declared his opinion, and Paul and Barnabas acquainted them with the great things God by their miniſtry, had done amongſt the Gentiles. A plain evidence, that they were accepted by the Almighty, though uncircumciſed, as well as the Jews with all their legal rights and privileges. Accordingly, it was unanimouſly determined, that the Gentiles were not under the obligation of the law of Moſes, and therefore, for their fuller ſatisfaction in this matter, it was agreed, that ſome perſons of their own church ſhould be joined with Paul and Barnabas, to carry the decrees of the council to Antioch.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL and his companions, having received the decretal epiſtle, returned back to Antioch; and ſoon after Peter himſelf came down. On reading this epiſtle in the church the converts converſed freely and inoffenſively with the Gentiles, till ſome of the Jews coming thither from Jeruſalem, Peter withdrew his converſation, as if it had been a thing unwarrantable and unlawful. By ſuch a ſtrange method of proceding, the minds of many were diſſatisfied, and their conſciences very uneaſy. St. Paul, with the greateſt concern, obſerved it, and publicly rebuked Peter with that ſharpneſs and ſeverity his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable practice called for on ſuch an important occaſion.</p>
               <p>PAUL and Barnabas, ſoon after this diſpute, reſolved to viſit the churches they had planted amongſt the Gentiles, and Barnabas was deſirous of taking with them his couſin Mark: but this Paul ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, as he had left them in their former journey. This trifling diſpute aroſe to ſuch a height, that theſe two great apoſtles and fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the goſpel parted aſunder; Barnabas, taking Mark with him repaired to Cyprus his native country; and Paul, having made choice of Silas, and recommended the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his undertaking to the care of Divine Providence, ſet forward on his intended journey.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL and Silas firſt viſited the churches of Syria and Cilicia, confirming them in the faith, by their inſtructions and exhortations. Hence they ſailed to Crete, where Paul preached the goſpel, and conſtituted Titus to be the firſt biſhop and paſtor of that iſland, leaving him to ſettle thoſe affairs of the church which time would not permit the apoſtle to ſettle himſelf. From hence Paul and Silas returned back into Cilicia, and came to Lyſtra, where they found Timothy, whoſe father was a Greek but his mother a Jewiſh convert, and by her he had been brought up under all the advantages of a pious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education, eſpecially with regard to the Holy Scriptures, which he had ſtudied with the greateſt aſſiduity and ſucceſs. This perſon St. Paul deſigned for the companion of his travels, and a ſpecial inſtrument in the miniſtry of the goſpel: but knowing that his being uncircumciſed would prove a ſtumbling block to the Jews, cauſed him to be circumciſed; being willing in lawful and indifferent matters, in order to ſave the ſouls of men, to conform himſelf to their tempers, apprehenſions, and prejudices.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL and his companions now departed from Lyſtra, paſſing through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, where the apoſtle was entertained with the greateſt kindneſs and veneration, the people looking upon him as an angel ſent immediately from heaven;
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:029927_0332_0FE33984786FE810"/>
and being by revelation forbidden to go into Aſia, he was commanded by a ſecond viſion to repair to Macedonia, to preach the goſpel.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY, our apoſtle prepared to paſs from Aſia into Europe. Here St. Luke joined them, and became ever after the inſeparable companion of St. Paul, who being deſirous of finding the ſpeedieſt paſſage into Macedonia, took ſhip with his companions Silas, Luke and Timothy, and came to Samothracia, an iſland in the Aegean ſea, not far from Thrace; and the next day to Neapolis, a port of Macedonia. Leaving Neapolis they repaired to Philippi, the metropolis of that part of Macedonia, and Roman colony, where, for ſome days, they reſided.</p>
               <p>PAUL, according to his conſtant practice, preached in a Proſeucha or oratory of the Jews, which ſtood by the river ſide, at ſome diſtance from this city, and was much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the devout women of their religion, who met there to pray and hear the law. To theſe St. Paul preached the glad-tidings of the goſpel; and, by the influence of the Holy Spirit, converted many, eſpecially a certain woman named Lydia, a Jewiſh proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, a ſeller of purple in that city, but a native of Thyatira. This woman being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with her whole family, was ſo importunate with St. Paul and his companions to abide at her houſe, that they were conſtrained to accept of her invitation.</p>
               <p>WHILE the apoſtles reſided at Philippi, they continued their daily courſe of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the ſame oratory. And after ſeveral days, as they were repairing to the ſame place of devotion, there met them a damſel who had a prophetic ſpirit of divination, by whom her maſters acquired very great advantage. This woman followed Paul and his companions, crying out, <hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the Moſt High God, which ſhew unto us the way to ſalvation.</hi> Paul, at firſt, took no notice of her, not being willing to multiply miracles without neceſſity: but when he ſaw her following them ſeveral days together, he began to be troubled; and in imitation of his great Maſter, who would not ſuffer the devil to acknowledge him, leſt his falſe and lying tongue ſhould prejudice the truth in the minds of men, commanded the ſpirit, in the name of JESUS, to come out of her. The devil with reluctance obeyed, and left the damſel immediately.</p>
               <p>AS this miraculous cure proved a great loſs to her maſters, who acquired large gains from her ſoothſaying, they were filled with malice and envy againſt the apoſtles; and, by their inſtigation, the multitude aroſe, and, ſeizing upon Paul and his companions, hurried them before the magiſtrates and governors of the colony; accuſing them of introducing many innovations which were prejudicial to the ſtate, and unlawful for them to comply with, as being Romans. The magiſtrates being concerned for the tranquility of the ſtate, and jealous of all diſturbances, were very forward to puniſh the offenders, againſt whom the multitude teſtified; and therefore commanded the officers to ſtrip them and ſcourge them ſeverely, as perſons who ſtirred up ſeditions.</p>
               <p>THE ſentence was accordingly executed; after which the apoſtles were committed to cloſe cuſtody, the goaler receiving more than ordinary charge to keep them ſafely; and he accordingly thruſt them into the inner priſon, and made their feet faſt in the ſtocks: but the moſt obſcure dungeon, or the pitchy mantle of the night, cannot intercept the beams of divine joy and comfort from the ſouls of ſuch pious men. Their minds were all ſerenity, and at midnight they prayed and ſung praiſes ſo loud, that they were heard in every part of the priſon: nor were their prayers offered to the throne of grace in vain; an earthquake ſhook the foundations of the priſon, opened the doors, looſed the chains, and ſet the priſoners at liberty. This convulſion of nature rouſed the goaler from his ſleep; and concluding from what he ſaw, that all his priſoners were eſcaped, was going to put a period to his life; but Paul, obſerving him, haſtily cried out, <hi>Do thyſelf no harm, for we are all here.</hi> The keeper was now as greatly ſurpriſed at the goodneſs of
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:029927_0333_0FE33986019BA2E8"/>
the apoſtles, as he was before terrified at the thoughts of their eſcape; and calling for a light, he came immediately into the preſence of the apoſtles, fell down at their feet, took them from the dungeon, brought them into his own houſe, waſhed their ſtripes, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them to inſtruct him in the knowledge of that God who was mighty to ſave and deliver.</p>
               <p>THE goaler's requeſt was readily granted by St. Paul, who replied, That, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in JESUS CHRIST, he might be ſaved, with his whole houſe. Accordingly, the goaler, with all his family, were, after a competent inſtruction, baptized, and received as members of the church of CHRIST. How happy a change does the doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel make in the minds of men! How does it ſmooth the rougheſt tempers, and inſtil the ſweeteſt principles of civility and good-nature into the minds of men! He who but a few moments before, tyrannized over the apoſtles, now treated them with the greateſt reſpect, and the higheſt marks of kindneſs he was capable of ſhewing.</p>
               <p>WHEN it was day, the magiſtrates, either hearing what had happened, or reflecting on what they had done, as too harſh and unjuſtifiable, ſent their ſerjeant to the goaler with orders to diſcharge the apoſtles. The goaler joyfully delivered the meſſage, and bid them depart in peace: but Paul, that he might make the magiſtrates ſenſible what injury they had done them, and how unjuſtly they had puniſhed them without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or trial, ſent them word, that as they had thought proper to ſcourge and impriſon Romans, contrary to the laws of the empire, he expected they ſhould come themſelves, and make them ſome ſatisfaction for the illegal treatment they had received.</p>
               <p>THIS meſſage terrified the magiſtrates, who well knew how dangerous it was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the formidable power of the Romans, who never ſuffered any freeman to be beaten uncondemned; they came therefore to the priſon, and very ſubmiſſively entreated the apoſtles to depart without any further diſturbance. This ſmall recompence for the cruel uſage they had received was accepted by the meek followers of the bleſſed JESUS; they left the priſon, and retired to the houſe of Lydia, where they comforted their brethren with an account of their deliverance, and departed; having laid the foundation of a very eminent church, as appears from St. Paul's epiſtle to the church at Philippi.</p>
               <p>PAUL and his companions leaving this city, continued their journey towards the weſt, till they came to Theſſalonica, the capital of Macedonia, about an hundred and twenty miles from Philippi. On their arrival at Theſſalonica, Paul, according to his cuſtom, went into the ſynagogue of the Jews, and preached unto his countrymen; the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſage he had met with in other places, not diſcouraging him from perſevering in ſo glorious a work. His doctrine however was ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by the Jews, who would not allow JESUS to be the Meſſiah, becauſe of the ignominious death which he had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtles during their ſtay at Theſſalonica, lodged in a houſe of a certain Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, named Jaſon, who entertained them very courteouſly. But the Jews would not ſuffer the apoſtles to continue at reſt; they refuſed to embrace the goſpel themſelves, and therefore envied its ſucceſs, and determined to oppoſe its progreſs; accordingly, they gathered together a great number of lewd and wicked wretches, who beſet the houſe of Jaſon, intending to take Paul, and deliver him up to an incenſed multitude; but in this they were diſappointed, Paul and Silas being removed from thence by the Chriſtians, and concealed in ſome other part of the city. Their fury however was rather exaſperated than leſſened at loſing their prey; and, as they could not find the apoſtles of the bleſſed JESUS, they determined to be revenged on Jaſon, who had concealed them. Accordingly they ſeized on him and ſome others of the brethren, and carried them before the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:029927_0334_0FE3398E5C8B28D0"/>
of the city, accuſing them, as they had before done the apoſtles themſelves at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, of diſturbing the peace of the empire, and ſetting up JESUS as a king, in degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the emperor's dignity and authority. This accuſation induced both people and magiſtrates to be their enemies; and though Jaſon was only accuſed of harbouring thoſe innovators, yet the magiſtrate could not be prevailed upon to diſmiſs him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, till they had given ſecurity for their appearance when called upon.</p>
               <p>WHEN the tumult was over, the Theſſalonians, who had been converted by them, ſent away Paul and Silas by night to Beroea, a city about fifty miles ſouth of Theſſalonica, but out of the power of their enemies. Here alſo Paul's great love for his countrymen the Jews, and his earneſt deſire for their ſalvation, excited him to preach to them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: accordingly, he entered into their ſynagogue, and explained the goſpel unto them, proving out of the Old Teſtament, the truth of the doctrines he advanced. Theſe Jews were of a more candid and ingenious temper than thoſe of Theſſalonica; and as they heard him with great reverence and attention expound and apply the Scriptures, ſo they ſearched diligently, whether his proofs were proper and pertinent, and conſonant to the ſenſe of the texts he referred to: and having found every thing to be agreeable to what Paul had advanced, many of them believed; and ſeveral Gentiles, followed their example, became obedient to the faith, amongſt whom were ſeveral women of quality. The news of this remarkable ſucceſs was carried to Theſſalonica, and greatly incenſed the inveterate enemies of the goſpel there; who accordingly repaired to Beroea, and raiſed tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the apoſtles; ſo that Paul, to avoid their fury, was forced to leave the town; but Silas and Timothy, either leſs known, or leſs envied, continued ſtill in the place.</p>
               <p>LEAVING Beroea under the conduct of certain guides, it was pretended that Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to retire by ſea out of Greece, that his reſtleſs enemies might ceaſe their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: but the guides, according to his deſire, brought him to Athens, and left him there, after receiving from him an order for Silas and Timothy to repair to him as ſoon as they conveniently could.</p>
               <p>AT this time Athens was the moſt famous academy of all Greece, and abounding with philoſophers illuſtrious for their learning. Amongſt the ſeveral ſects that now flouriſhed at Athens, the Stoics and Epicureans were the moſt remarkable for their oppoſition to Chriſtianity. The Epicureans becauſe they found their pleaſant and jovial humour, and their looſe and exorbitant courſe of life, ſo greatly checked and controlled by the ſtrict and ſevere precepts of the goſpel; and becauſe the doctrines of it ſo plainly and poſitively aſſerted a Divine Providence governing the world, and which at the laſt day will reward or puniſh every man according to his works. The Stoics, on the other hand, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to principles of great and uncommon ſeverity, and ſuch as had the neareſt affinity to the doctrines of the goſpel, yet they found them very different in pactice. That meek and humble temper of mind, that modeſty and ſelf-denial, which the goſpel ſo earneſtly recommends, and ſo ſtrictly requires, were directly oppoſite to the immoderate pride and ambition of that ſect, who were not aſhamed to affirm, that their ſages and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were not inferior to God himſelf in wiſdom.</p>
               <p>DURING Paul's abode at Athens, expecting the arrival of Silas and Timothy, he walked up and down, to take a more accurate ſurvey of the city, which he found miſerably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with ſuperſtition and idolatry. The inhabitants were remarkably religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout: they had a great number of gods, whom they adored; falſe, indeed, they were, but ſuch as they, being deſtitute of revelation, accounted true: and ſo very careful were they, that no deity ſhould want due honour from them, that they had an altar inſcribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. A great variety of reaſons are given for this inſcription: ſome affirm, that it was the name which the Pagans generally gave to the God of the Jews; but others think that, beſides the unknown God, it included all the gods of Aſia, Europe, and Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="unknown:029927_0335_0FE33990004630C0"/>THE ſpirit of the apoſtle was grieved at theſe ſuperſtitious practices: he lamented to ſee ſo much zeal and devotion miſplaced; and flattered himſelf, if he could but direct it to its proper object, it would be of eminent ſervice to the church of CHRIST. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, he exerted all his ſtrength for their converſion; diſputing on the ſabbath-days in the ſynagogues of the Jews; and at other times took all opportunities of preaching to the Athenians the coming of the Meſſiah to ſave the world from ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle's doctrine was equally new and ſtrange to the Athenians; and though they did not perſecute him as the Jews did, yet his preaching JESUS was conſidered by the Epicurean and Stoic philoſophers as a fabulous legend; and by the more ſober part, as a diſcovery of ſome new gods, which they had not yet placed in their temples: and though they were not unwilling to receive any new deities, yet as Areopagus, the ſupreme court of the city, was to judge of all gods, to whom public worſhip might be allowed, they brought him before thoſe judges, to give an account of his doctrine in their hearing.</p>
               <p>BEING placed before the judges of this high aſſembly, St. Paul readily gave them an account of his doctrine, in a grave and elegant ſpeech; wherein he did not tell them they were horrible and groſs idolators, leſt he ſhould offend them, and thereby prevent them from liſtening to his reaſons; but, having commended them for their religious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, he took occaſion from the altar inſcribed to the unknown God, to make a proper defence of his doctrine. "I endeavour, ſaid he, only to explain that altar to you, and manifeſt the nature of that God whom ye ignorantly worſhip; which is the God that made the world, and all things therein: and who being Lord of all, dwells not in temples made with hands, nor is to be worſhipped in lifeleſs idols. As he is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all things, he cannot be confined to the workmanſhip of man, whether temples or ſtatues; nor ſtands in need of ſacrifices, ſince he is the fountain of life to all things. He made from one common original, the whole race of mankind, and hath wiſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined their dependance on him, that they might be obliged to ſeek after him and ſerve him. A truth perceivable in the darkeſt ſtate of ignorance, and acknowledged by one of your own poets. If this be the nature of God, it is ſurely the higheſt abſurdity to repreſent him by any image or ſimilitude. The divine patience hath been too much exerciſed already with ſuch groſs abuſes in religion; but now expects a thorough refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, having ſent his ſon JESUS CHRIST to make him known to the world, and at the ſame time to inform them that he hath appointed a day of general judgment, when the religion of mankind ſhall be tried by the teſt of the goſpel, before his only begotten Son, who is appointed ſole Judge of quick and dead, and whoſe commiſſion to that high office hath been ratified by the Almighty, in raiſing him from the dead by his almighty power."</p>
               <p>HE had no ſooner mentioned the reſurrection, than ſome of the philoſophers mocked and derided him; others, more modeſt, but not ſatisfied with the proofs he had given, gravely anſwered, <hi>We would hear thee again of this matter,</hi> After which Paul departed from the court; but not without ſome ſucceſs: for a few of his auditors believed and attended his inſtructions; amongſt whom were Dionyſius one of the judges, and Damaris, thought by ſome to have been his wife. And it is generally believed that Dionyſius was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſtituted the firſt biſhop of Athens by this Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>WHILE St. Paul remained at Athens, Timothy, according to the order he had received, came to him out of Macedonia, and brought an account that the Chriſtians at Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica were under proſecution from their fellow citizens, ever ſince his departure, at which St. Paul was greatly concerned, and at firſt inclined to viſit them in perſon, to confirm them in the faith they had embraced; but being hindered by the enemies to the goſpel, he ſent Timothy to comfort them, and put them in mind of what they had at firſt heard, namely, that perſecution would be the conſtant attendant on their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="unknown:029927_0336_0FE3399186236D28"/>ST. PAUL left Athens on Timothy's departure, and travelled to Corinth, a very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous place, and famous for its trade. Here he found Aquila, and Priſcilla his wife, lately come from Italy, after having been baniſhed from Rome by a decree of Claudius; and they being of the ſame trade he himſelf had learned in his youth, he wrought with them, that he might not be burdenſome to the new converts in that city.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle after ſome ſtay in Corinth, was joined by Silas and Timothy, and diſputed frequently in the ſynagogue, reaſoning and proving that JESUS was the true Meſſiah. This exaſperated the Jews to the greateſt degree, and what they could not conquer by argument and force of reaſon, they endeavoured to carry by noiſe and clamour, blended with blaſphemies and revilings; the laſt refuge of an impotent and baffled cauſe. But St. Paul, to teſtify his reſentment, ſhook his garment, and told them, that ſince they were determined to pull down the vengeance of heaven upon their own heads, he was abſolutely guiltleſs and innocent, and would henceforth addreſs himſelf to the Gentiles: accordingly he left them, and repaired to the houſe of Juſtus, a religious proſelyte, where by his preaching and miracles, he converted great numbers to the faith; amongſt which were Criſpus the chief ruler of the ſynagogue, Gaius, and Stephanus, who with their families were baptiſed, and admitted members of the church of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>INASMUCH as the conſtant returns of malice and ingratitude are ſufficient to tire the largeſt charity, and cool the moſt generous reſolution; our dear Redeemer, therefore, that the apoſtle might not be diſcouraged by the reſtleſs attempts and machinations of his enemies, appeared to him in a viſion, and told him, that notwithſtanding the bad ſucceſs he had hitherto met with, there was a large harveſt to be gathered in that place, that he ſhould not be afraid of his enemies, but preach the goſpel boldly and faithfully, for that he himſelf would protect and preſerve him from every danger.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL ſeems about this time to have written his firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, Silas and Timothy being lately returned from thence, and delivered the meſſage for which he had ſent them thither. The principal deſign of this epiſtle is, to confirm them in the belief of the Chriſtian religion, and excite them to perſevere in it, notwithſtanding al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the malice of their enemies, and the perſecutions they muſt expect to ſuffer; and to inſtruct them in the duties of their high vocation.</p>
               <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, the malicious Jews were plotting his deſtruction: but being for ſome time diſappointed, their malice changed into fury, and they hurried the apoſtle before the tribunal of Gallio, elder brother to the famous Seneca, and proconſul of the province, accuſing him of being an innovator in religion, and of endeavouring to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a method of worſhipping God contrary to the law. Paul was ready to have made his defence; but Gallio prevented him by telling his accuſers, that if he had been guilty of any injuſtice he would have heard their complaint and redreſſed their grievance; but as it was nothing but a controverſy about words and names, he would have nothing to do with it. But the Jews continuing their clamour, he commanded his officers to drive them from the tribunal; which was accordingly done, and ſome of the townſmen ſeized upon Softhens one of the rulers of the ſynagogue, and beat him before the judgment-ſeat, the proconſul giving himſelf no concern about it. Thus were the deſigns of the apoſtle's enemies rendered abortive; and Paul continued, without any further oppoſition, to preach the doctrine of the goſpel during a year and a half, when he left the church at Corinth, to viſit others he had planted in different parts of the eaſt.</p>
               <p>WHILE the apoſtle continued at Corinth he wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, to ſupply his abſence. In this Epiſtle he again endeavours to confirm their minds in the truth of the goſpel, and prevent their being ſhaken with thoſe troubles which the
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:029927_0337_0FE339930EBD21E0"/>
wicked and unbelieving Jews would be continually raiſing againſt them. And becauſe ſome paſſages in his former Epiſtle relating to the deſtruction of the Jews had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, as if the day of the Lord was near at hand, he rectifies theſe miſtakes, and ſhews the ſign that muſt precede our Lord's coming to judgment in the latter days.</p>
               <p>LEAVING the church at Corinth, St. Paul took ſhip at Cenchrea, the port of Corinth, for Syria, taking with him Aquila and Priſcilla; and on his arrival at Epheſus, he preached a while in the ſynagogue of the Jews, promiſing to return to them, after keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſſover at Jeruſalem. Accordingly, he again took ſhip, and landed at Caeſarea, and from thence travelled to Jeruſalem, where he kept the feaſt, viſited the church, and then repaired to Antioch: here he ſtayed ſome time, and then traverſed the countries of Gallatia and Phrygia, till he came to Epheſus, confirming the new-converted Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>WHILE the apoſtle was taking this large circuit, Providence took care of the churches of Epheſus and Corinth, by means of one Apollos, an eloquent Jew of Alexandria, and well acquainted with the law and writings of the prophets. This man coming to Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, though he was only inſtructed in the rudiments of Chriſtianity, and John's baptiſm; yet he taught with great courage, and a moſt powerful zeal. After being fully inſtructed in the faith by Aquila and Priſcilla, he paſſed over into Achaia, being furniſhed with recommendatory letters, by the churches of Epheſus and Corinth. He was of the greateſt ſervice in Achaia, in watering what Paul had planted, confirming the diſciples, and powerfully convincing the Jews, that JESUS was the true Meſſiah promiſed in the ſcriptures of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>LEAVING Apollos thus uſefully employed, St. Paul returned to Epheſus, where he fixed his abode for three years, bringing with him Gaius of Derbe, Ariſtarchus a native of Theſſalonica, Timotheus and Eraſtus of Corinth, and Titus. The firſt thing he did after his arrival was to examine certain diſciples, whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt ſince they believed? To which they anſwered, 'That the doctrine they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, promiſed nothing of that nature; nor had they ever heard that ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpirit had of late been beſtowed upon the church.' This anſwer ſurprized the apoſtle, who aſked them in what name they had been baptiſed; ſince, in the Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>an form, the name of the Holy Ghoſt was always expreſſed? They replied, that they had only received John's baptiſm; which, though it enjoined men to repent, yet mentioned nothing expreſsly concerning the Holy Ghoſt, or its gifts or powers. Upon which the apoſtle informed them, that though John's babtiſm commanded nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yet it tacitly implied the whole doctrine of CHRIST and the Holy Ghoſt. When they heard this, they were baptiſed according to the form preſcribed by CHRIST himſelf, that is, in the name of the bleſſed Trinity; and after the apoſtle had prayed and laid his hands upon them, they received the gifts of tongues and other miraculous powers.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL, after this, entered into the Jewiſh ſynagogues, where for the firſt three months, he contende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and diſputed with the Jews, endeavouring with great earneſtneſs and reſolution to convince them of the truth of the Chriſtian religion. But when inſtead of ſucceſs he met with nothing but obſtinacy and infidelity, he left the ſynagogue, and taking thoſe with him whom he had converted, inſtructed them and others who reſorted to him, in the ſchool of one Tyrannus, a place where ſcholars uſed to be inſtructed. In this manner he continued to preach the goſpel two whole years; by which means the Jews and proſelytes of the whole proconſular of Aſia had an opportunity of hearing the glad-tidings of ſalvation. And becauſe miracles are the cleareſt evidence of a divine commiſſion, the Almighty was pleaſed to ratify the doctrine which St. Paul delivered by amazing and miraculous operations, many of which were of a peculiar and extraordinary
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:029927_0338_0FE3399A61515F88"/>
nature; for he did not only heal thoſe that come to him, but if napkins or handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs were only touched by him, and applied to the ſick, their diſeaſes immediately va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the evil ſpirits departed out of thoſe whom they had poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle about this time wrote his Epiſtle to the Galatians; for he had heard that ſince his departure, corrupt opinions had crept in amongſt them, with regard to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obſerving the legal rites; and that ſeveral impoſtors had found admittance into that church, who knew no better method of undermining the doctrine he had planted there, than by vilifying his perſon, ſlighting him only as an apoſtle at ſecond hand, not to be compared with Peter, James, and John, who had familiarly converſed with CHRIST in the days of his fleſh, and been immediately deputed by him.</p>
               <p>IN this epiſtle he reproves them with ſome neceſſary ſeverity, for their being ſo ſoon led out of the right way, wherein he had placed them, and ſo eaſily ſuffered themſelves to be impoſed upon by the crafty artifices of ſeducers. He vindicates the honour of his apoſtleſhip, and the immediate receiving his commiſſion from CHRIST, wherein he ſhews, that he was not inferior to the very beſt of his apoſtles. He largely refutes thoſe Judaical opinions that had tainted and infected them; and in the concluſion, inſtructs them in the rules and duties of a holy life.</p>
               <p>WHILE St. Paul reſided at Epheſus, an accident happened which was attended with great trouble and danger. In this city was the celebrated temple of Diana, a ſtructure ſo magnificent for beauty, riches, and magnitude, that it was reckoned one of the ſeven wonders of the world: but what increaſed its fame and reputation was an image of Diana kept there, which the idolatrous prieſts perſuaded the people was made by Jupiter himſelf, and dropt down from heaven; for which reaſon it was held in great veneration, not only at Epheſus, but throughout all Aſia: ſo that people procured ſilver ſhrines, or figures of this temple; of ſuch a ſize as to carry in their pockets, either for curioſity, or to ſtir up their devotion. This proved the ſource of a great deal of buſineſs to the ſilverſmiths of Epheſus, of whom one Demetrius was the chief: this man plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that Chriſtianity tended to the ſubverſion of idolatry, and, conſequently, to the ruin of their gainful employment, called all the artiſts together, and pathetically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, "How inevitably they muſt be reduced to a ſtate of poverty, if they ſuffered Paul to bring their temple and goddeſs into contempt, by perſuading people, as he did, that they were no gods which were made by the hands of men."</p>
               <p>ON hearing this ſpeech of Demetrius, the people were fired with a zeal which they could no longer contain; ſo that they cried out with one voice, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> They ſhould, indeed, have conſidered, that if their goddeſs was able to defend herſelf againſt the doctrines preached by Paul, neither ſhe nor the temple were in danger; whereas, if Paul was able to deſtroy their gods, it was in vain for them to reſiſt him: but intereſt and ſuperſtition meeting in the minds of a biggotted multitude, admitted of no reaſon; they were all fired with zeal for their goddeſs, and determined, if they could find Paul, to expoſe him to the beaſts in the theatre. The whole city was filled with the tumult; and the crowd, miſſing Paul, laid hold on Gaius and Ariſtarchus, two Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians of Paul's company, and hurried them into the theatre, with a deſign to throw them to the wild beaſts: Paul who was at preſent in a place of ſecurity, hearing of the danger to which his brethren were expoſed, was very deſirous of venturing after them, in order to ſpeak in their behalf; but was at laſt diſſuaded from it, not only by the Chriſtians, but alſo by the Gentile governors of the theatrical games, who were his friends, and aſſured him, that he would only endanger himſelf, without reſcuing his friends, or affording them any aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="unknown:029927_0339_0FE3399CC2E00DB0"/>THE multitude were now prodigiouſly clamorous and confuſed, moſt of them not knowing the reaſon for which they were come together; and, therefore, ſome cried one thing, and ſome another. In this diſtraction, Alexander, a Jewiſh convert, was ſingled out by the multitude, and by the inſtigation of the Jews was going to make his defence, in which doubtleſs, he would have laid the whole blame upon Paul: but the multitude perceiving him to be a Jew, and therefore ſuſpecting he was one of Paul's aſſociates, raiſed another outcry for near two hours together, wherein nothing could be heard but <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> This confuſion brought the town-clerk, who kept the regiſter of the games, into the theatre, to ſuppreſs, if poſſible, ſo uncommon a tumult; and having with great difficulty, obtained ſilence, calmly and diſcretely told them, "That the world was ſufficiently acquainted with the devotion paid by the Epheſians to the great goddeſs Diana, and the image which fell down from Jupiter; and therefore it was abſolutely needleſs for them to publiſh it at that time; that if Demetrius and his fraternity had any thing to alledge againſt Paul and his companions, the court were open, and they might bring their accuſation againſt them; or, if they were queſtioned with regard to the breach of any of their laws, the cauſe ought to be heard in a regular aſſembly. That they would do well to conſider this, and be quiet; having already rendered themſelves obnoxious to the diſpleaſure of the magiſtrates, if they did think proper to call them to an account for the tumult which they had that day occaſioned.</p>
               <p>THE multitude, on hearing this diſcourſe, were convinced that they had acted very improperly, and therefore repaired to their reſpective habitations; and Gaius, Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, and Alexander, were releaſed without any hurt: but the eſcape of Paul was ſo very remarkable, that he mentions it as a miraculous deliverance. <hi>We had,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the ſentence of death in ourſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in ourſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead, who delivered us from ſo great a death.</hi> And in another place he tells us, <hi>he fought with beaſts at Epheſus;</hi> alluding, either to the deſign of the enraged multitude, of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the wild beaſts in the theatre, though their intention was not executed; or to the manners of the people, who ſufficiently deſerved the character of being ſavage and brutal in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the words.</p>
               <p>PAUL about this time, was informed of ſome diſturbances in the church of Corinth, hatched and fomented by a company of falſe teachers, crept in amongſt them, who endeavoured to draw them into parties and factions, by perſuading one company to be for Peter, another for Paul, and a third for Apollos; as if the principal part of religion conſiſted in being of this or that denomination, or in a warm active zeal to depreciate and oppoſe whoever is not for our own narrow ſect. It is a very weak and ſlender claim, when a man holds his religion by no better title than his having joined himſelf to ſuch or ſuch a ſect or congregation, and is remarkably zealous to promote it; to be childiſhly and paſſionately clamorous for ſome perſon's particular mode of adminiſtration, or ſome particular opinion; as if religion rather conſiſted in curious diſputes, or in ſeparating from our brethren, than in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. By theſe means, ſchiſms and factions broke into the Corinthian church, whereby many wild and extravagant opinions, and ſome of them ſuch as tended to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> articles of Chriſtianity, were planted, and had taken root there. To cure theſe diſtempers, St. Paul wrote his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, wherein he ſmartly reproves them for their ſchiſms and parties, conjures them to follow after peace and unity, corrects thoſe groſs corruptions that had been introduced amongſt them, and particularly reſolves thoſe many caſes and controverſies, wherein they had requeſted his advice.</p>
               <p>APOLLOS ſoon after determining to go to Crete together with Zenos, St. Paul ſent by them his Epiſtle to Titus, whom he had made biſhop of that iſland, and had left there for
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:029927_0340_0FE3399E48E62708"/>
propagating the goſpel. In this Epiſtle, he inſtructs him fully in the execution of his office, how to behave himſelf, and what directions he ſhould give to others, in the ſeveral relations and ranks of men, eſpecially thoſe who were to be advanced to places of office and authority in the church, amongſt the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>THE tumult at Athens had not long ſubſided, before Paul called the Chriſtians toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and took his leave of them with the moſt tender expreſſions of love and affection. He had now ſpent almoſt three years at Epheſus, and founded there a very conſiderable church, of which he had ordained Timothy the firſt biſhop. He firſt travelled about two hundred miles northward to Troas, before he took ſhip, expecting to meet Titus there: but miſſing him, he purſued his voyage to Macedonia, where on his arrival, he preached the goſpel in ſeveral places, even, as far as Illyricum, now called Sclavonia. During this journey, he met with many troubles and dangers, <hi>without were fightings,</hi> and <hi>within were fears:</hi> but God, who comforteth thoſe that are caſt down, revived his ſpirits by the arrival of Titus, who gave him a pleaſing account of the good effects his Epiſtle had produced at Corinth. This worthy biſhop came thither with large contributions from that church, and from the example of thoſe liberal Chriſtians, St. Paul ſtirred up the Macedonians to imitate their charity, intending to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed Chriſtians at Jeruſalem, who were then in an indigent and perſecuted ſtate.</p>
               <p>WHILE Titus continued in Macedonia, Paul wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to Corinthians, and ſent it to them by Titus and Luke. In this, he endeavours to rectify what his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epiſtle had not effected, to vindicate his apoſtleſhip from that contempt and ſcorn, and himſelf from thoſe ſlanders and aſperſions which the ſeducers, who found themſelves laſhed by his former letter, had caſt upon him; together with ſeveral other particular caſes relating to the church. About this time alſo, he wrote his firſt Epiſtle to Timothy, whom he had left at Epheſus, wherein he gives him large directions how to carry himſelf in the diſcharge of that great office and authority in the church, committed to his care; and inſtructs him in the particular qualifications of thoſe he ſhould make choice of as biſhops and miniſters in the church. He likewiſe gives him inſtructions with regard to his giving orders to deaconeſſes, and inſtructing ſervants; warning him at the ſame time againſt that peſtilent generation of heretics and ſeducers that would ariſe in the church, after his departure.</p>
               <p>WHILE Paul remained in Greece, he went to Corinth, where he wrote his excellent Epiſtle to the Romans, which he ſent by Phoebe, a deaconeſs of the church of Cenchrea, near Corinth. His principle intention in this Epiſtle is, fully to ſtate and determine the great controverſy between the Jews and Gentiles, with regard to the obligations of the rites and ceremonies of the Jewiſh law, and thoſe principal and material points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine depending upon it; namely, Chriſtian liberty, the uſe of indifferent things, and the like; and, which is the chief intention of all religion, inſtructs them, and preſſes them to perform the duties of a holy and pious life, ſuch as the Chriſtian doctrine natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally recommends and enforces.</p>
               <p>BEING now determined to return into Syria, in order to convey the contributions to the brethren at Jeruſalem, he ſet out on his journey; but being informed, that the Jews had formed a deſign of killing and robbing him by the way, he returned back into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, and came to Philippi, from whence he went to Troas, where he ſtayed ſeven days: here he preached to them on the Lord's day, and continued his diſcourſe till midnight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to depart in the morning. The length of his diſcourſe and time of the night cauſed ſome of his audience to be overtaken with ſleep, and amongſt them a young man, named Eutychus, who fell from the third ſtory, and was taken up dead; but the apoſtle, by his prayer to the throne of grace, preſently reſtored him to life, and health.

From whence they came to Patra, the metropolis of Lycia, where they went on board another veſſel bound for Tyre in Phoenicia. On his arrival he viſited the brethren there, and continued with them a week, and was adviſed by ſome of them, who had the gift of prophecy, not to go up to Jeruſalem; but the apoſtle would by no means abandon his deſign, or refuſe to ſuffer any thing, provided he might ſpread the goſpel of his Saviour. Finding all perſuaſions were in vain, they all accompanied him to the ſhore, where he kneeled down and prayed with them; and after embracing them with the utmoſt affection, he went on board, and came to Ptolemais, and the next day to Ceſarea. Here Paul and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions lodged in the houſe of Philip, the Evangeliſt, one of the ſeven deacons ſet apart by the apoſtles, and who had before converted the Samaritans. Philip had four daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all virgins, each of whom had a prophetic ſpirit.</p>
               <p>WHILE they were in this place, Agabus, a Chriſtian prophet, came thither from Judea, who taking Paul's girdle, bound his own hands and feet with it; ſignifying by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſymbol, that the Jews would bind Paul in that manner, and deliver him to the Gentiles. Whereupon, both his own companions and the Chriſtians of Ceſarea, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought him, that he would not go up to Jeruſalem; but the apoſtle aſked them, if they intended by theſe paſſionate diſſuaſives to add more affliction to his ſorrow? <hi>For I am ready,</hi> continued he, <hi>not only to be bound, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem, for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> When the diſciples found that his reſolution was not to be ſhaken they importuned him no further, leaving the event to be determined according to the pleaſure of the Moſt High. And all things being ready, Paul and his companions ſet forwards on their journey, and were kindly and joyfully received by the Chriſtians at Jeruſalem, on their arrival.</p>
               <p>PAUL and his companions, the next day after their arrival, went to the houſe of St. James the apoſtle, where the reſt of the biſhops and governors of the church were met together. After mutual ſalutation, the apoſtle gave them a particular account of the ſucceſs with which God had bleſſed his endeavours in propagating Chriſtianity amongſt the Gentiles; for which they all joined in thankſgiving to God; but withal told him, that he was now come to a place where there were many thouſands of Jewiſh converts, who were all zealous for the law of Moſes, and who had been informed, that he taught the Jews whom he had converted, to renounce circumciſion, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law; that as ſoon as the multitude heard of his arrival, they would all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to ſee how he behaved himſelf in this matter: and therefore, to prevent diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they thought it adviſable for him to join himſelf with four perſons, who were at that time to accompliſh a vow, and perform the uſual rites and ceremonies with them, and provide ſuch ſacrifices for them, as the law, in that caſe, required; and that as a ſymbol of their diſcharging their vow, they might ſhave their heads; whereby it would appear, that the reports that were ſpread concerning him, were falſe and groundleſs, and that he himſelf ſtill obſerved the rites and orders of the Moſaical inſtitutions. But, with regard to the Gentile converts, they required no ſuch obſervances at their hands, nor expected any thing more from them in theſe indifferent matters, than what had been before determined in the ſynod formerly held at Jeruſalem. St. Paul, who in ſuch caſes was willing to become all things to all men, that he might gain the more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their counſel; and, taking the perſons with him to the temple, told the prieſts that the time of a vow they had made being now expired, and having purified themſelves as the nature of their caſe required, they were come to make the offerings which the law enjoined.</p>

This accuſation, though abſolutely falſe, ſet the whole city in an uproar, and ſeizing on the apoſtle, they dragged him out of the temple, when the doors were immediately ſhut, to prevent his returning into that holy place: nor had they failed of ſoon putting a period to all his ſufferings and troubles, had n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Claudius Lyſias, commander of the Roman garriſon, in the caſtle of Antonio, arrived with a band of ſoldiers to his reſcue, and ſuppoſing, from the great tumult of the Jews, that he was a more than ordinary malefactor, loaded him with a double chain, though he was as yet altogether ignorant, either of his country, or the crime he was accuſed of; it being impoſſible to obtain any ſatisfactory anſwer from the multitude, who called for nothing but his death, following the ſoldiers in ſuch a riotous manner, that they were forced to carry the apoſtle in their arms, to ſecure him from the rage and violence of the people, who were ready to tear him in pieces.</p>
               <p>WHILE they were going in this manner towards the caſtle, Paul aſked the governor whether he might have the liberty of ſpeaking to him; who, finding he underſtood the Greek language, inquired of him whether he was not an Egyptian, who, a few years before, had raiſed a ſedition in Judea, and headed a party of four thouſand vile and profligate wretches. To which the apoſtle replied, that he was a Jew of Tarſus, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a rich and honourable city, and therefore begged of him, that he might have leave to ſpeak unto the people. This the Roman officer readily granted, and Paul, ſtanding near the door of the caſtle, made ſigns that they ſhould hold their peace, and began to addreſs them in the Hebrew language; which engaged them to liſten with more attention to the following extraordinary narrative.</p>
               <p>"YE deſcendants of Jacob, liſten to a perſon of your own religion, and, like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a child of Abraham; born in Tarſus, and brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and fully inſtructed in the law delivered by Moſes to our forefathers, and formerly as zealous for the temple-worſhip as ye are at preſent.</p>
               <p>"YEA, more, I perſecuted unto death all who believed in JESUS, ſeizing on all I could find both men and women, and caſt them into priſon. This the high-prieſt, and all our elders well know; for from them I received a commiſſion, and repaired to Damaſcus, to bring from thence to Jeruſalem all the Chriſtians, in order to their undergoing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment. But as I was purſuing my journey, to execute this commiſſion, and being arrived near Damaſcus, there appeared, about mid-day, a light from heaven, ſhining around me with great brightneſs.</p>
               <p>"BEING terrified at ſo awful an appearance I fell to the ground, and heard a voice ſaying unto me, <hi>Saul, Saul why perſecuteſt thou me.</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> And the voice replied, <hi>I am Jeſus of Nazareth, whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"MY companions, during this interval, were greatly terrified at the great light which ſurrounded me; but they did not underſtand the words that were ſpoken from above.</p>

               </p>
               <p>"I was immediately deprived of ſight by the brilliance of the glory that ſhone around me; ſo that my companions led me by the hand to Damaſcus, where one Ananias, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well reſpected by all the Jews of that city, viſited me, and ſaid, <hi>Brother Saul, receive thy ſight.</hi> And in a moment my eyes were opened, and I ſaw him ſtanding before me.</p>
               <p>"PERCEIVING that my ſight was reſtored he ſaid to me,
<q>The Almighty God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, hath appointed thee to know his will, to ſee the great Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah the Holy One of God, and hear the voice of his mouth; for thou art choſen to be a witneſs, to all the nations of the earth, of thoſe ſurpriſing things which thou haſt ſeen and heard.

               </p>
               <p>"IN a ſhort time after this glorious viſion, and miraculous power of the Moſt High, when I was returned from Damaſcus to Jeruſalem, and offering up my prayers in the temple, I fell into a trance, and again ſaw the great Son of David, who ſaid unto me
<q>Depart quickly from Jeruſalem; for the ſons of Jacob will refuſe to believe thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning me.</q>
And I anſwered,
<q>Lord, they know how cruelly I uſed thy ſaints and followers; that I impriſoned and beat them in every city, and in every ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. Nay, when they ſhed the blood of thy holy martyr Stephen, I was alſo one of the ſpectators; I conſented to his death; I even kept the raiment of thoſe that ſlew him.</q>
But he replied,
<q>Depart: I will ſend thee to countries far remote; even to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt there ſpeak in my name and publiſh to them my ſalvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>TILL now the Jews had liſtened with ſome attention to his ſpeech; but, on his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the commiſſion he had received to preach the goſpel to the Gentiles, their fury knew no bounds; crying out, with one accord, <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth:</hi> he is unworthy to be ranked amongſt the race of mortals, or even to breathe the vital air. And as they thought words too weak to expreſs their fury, they threw off their clothes, and filled the air with duſt, indicating their great deſire of ſtoning him to death.</p>
               <p>AT this inſtant a captain of the guard commanded him to be brought within the caſtle, and that he ſhould be examined by ſcourging, till he confeſſed the reaſon of the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rage ſhewn againſt him by the people. Accordingly, the lictor bound him, and was going to put the orders he had received into execution, when Paul aſked the centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion that ſtood by, whether it was lawful to ſcourge a citizen of Rome, before any ſentence had been paſſed upon him? The centurion, inſtead of anſwering the queſtion, repaired immediately to the governor, deſiring him to take care how he proceeded againſt the priſoner, becauſe he was a Roman.</p>
               <p>ON this information, the governor himſelf came into the priſon, and aſked Paul, whether he was really a free citizen of Rome? And being told he was, he anſwered, that he himſelf procured the great privilege by a large ſum of money; but Paul anſwered <hi>I was free born.</hi> On receiving this account, the governor commanded the centurion not to ſcourge him, being terrified at what he had already done; in chaining a free denizen of Rome. The next day therefore he ordered his chains to be taken off; and that he might thoroughly ſatisfy himſelf of the cauſe of ſo unuſual a tumult the preceding day, ſummoned the Sanhedrim to meet, and brought down Paul before them, that they might hear his defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="unknown:029927_0345_0FE339AE5D509F98"/>BEING thus placed before the high council of the Jews, Paul told them, that in all the paſſages of his life, he had taken care to govern his actions by the ſevereſt rules of duty and conſcience: <hi>Men and brethren I have lived in all good conſcience before God until this day.</hi> How great is the ſecurity of a truly good man? How ſtrong, though inviſible, a ſupport does innocence become in the greateſt danger! With how generous a confidence does virtue and honeſty guard the breaſt of a true profeſſor of Chriſtianity! Nothing elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can lay a ſolid foundation for ſatisfaction and tranquility. When any calamity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes us, religion and a good conſcience fill the breaſt with a heavenly ſerenity, which all the little accidents of this world can neither ruffle or diſcompoſe. And, accordingly, Seneca compares the mind of a wiſe and good man to the ſtate of the upper region, which is always calm and ſerene, though all around is tumult and confuſion.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this expreſſion of the apoſtle might tend to ſhew the true ſtate of his mind; the high-prieſt Ananias was ſo offended at it, that he commanded thoſe who ſtood next to him, to ſtrike him on the face; at which the apoſtle ſmartly replied, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall.</hi> Thou art placed on the ſeat of judgment to determine according to the law, and commandeſt me to be ſmitten in direct oppoſition to its precepts. On which ſome of the ſpectators replied, it is not lawful to revile the high-prieſt of the Almighty. And Paul anſwered, I did not know that Ananias was appointed by God to be an high-prieſt; but as he is inveſted with authority, it is unjuſt to revile him, God himſelf having commanded, that <hi>no man ſhould ſpeak evil of the ruler of the people.</hi> St. Paul, now perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the council conſiſted partly of Sadducees and partly of Phariſees, cried aloud, "<hi>Men and brethren, I am a Phariſee, a ſon of a Phariſee,</hi> and am now brought before this tribunal, for aſſerting the reſurrection from the dead." This declaration threw the whole court into confuſion; the Phariſees, being zealous patrons of that tenet, declared the priſoner innocent, and that in all probability he had received ſome intimation from heaven by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or the ſilent whiſpers of the Holy Spirit; and if ſo, they really fought againſt the Omnipotence himſelf, by oppoſing his doctrine. While the Sadducees, who denied the reſurrection, together with the exiſtence of either angel or ſpirit, ſtrenuouſly inſiſted that the apoſtle was a turbulent perſon, and ought to be puniſhed for his miſconduct.</p>
               <p>HEREUPON the council was greatly divided, and their diſſentions increaſed to that degree, that the captain feared Paul would have been pulled in pieces by them, and therefore took him from the bar, and carried him back to the caſtle. But during the ſilence of the night, the great Redeemer of mankind, to comfort his faithful ſervant under all the terrors he had ſuffered the two preceding days, appeared to him in a viſion, encouraging him to conſtancy and reſolution, aſſuring him, that as he had borne witneſs of him at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, he ſhould, notwithſtanding all the malice and wicked deſigns of his enemies, live to bear his teſtimony even in Rome itſelf before the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>THE Jews, whoſe envy and malice were increaſed by the dilatory proceedings, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the next morning, to uſe a quicker method of putting a period to his life. In order to this, above forty of the moſt turbulent entered into a ſhocking confederacy of killing him; ratifying it by an oath, and the moſt bitter execration, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had put their inhuman deſign in execution: but ſuch vile monſters would do well to remember, that a Being, from whoſe eye nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and whoſe power nothing can reſiſt, is privy to all their actions, often renders their deſigns abortive, and will ſurely puniſh them for their baſe attempts. Accordingly, this deſign, though probably concluded under the pitchy mantle of the night, was diſcovered to St. Paul, by his ſiſter's ſon, and, at the requeſt of the apoſtle, told to the governor himſelf, who immediately commanded two parties of horſe and foot to be ready

by nine o'clock that night, in order to conduct St. Paul to Felix, the Roman governor of that province, to whom alſo he ſent an account of the whole proceedings of the Jews againſt the priſoner; and, at the ſame time, ordered his accuſers alſo to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman magiſtrate: accordingly St. Paul was conducted to Antipatris, and afterwards to Ceſarea, where the letters being delivered to Felix, the apoſtle was alſo preſented to him; and finding that he belonged to the province of Cilicia, he told him, that as ſoon as his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cuſers were come down, he would determine the affair, and commanded him to be ſecured in the place called Herod's Hall, till they ſhould appear againſt him.</p>
               <p>ANANIAS the high-prieſt, with ſome others of the Sanhedrim, came to Ceſarea, a few days after St. Paul's arrival, accompanied by Tertullus their advocate, who, in a ſhort, but eloquent ſpeech, adorned with all the flattering and inſinuating arts of oratory, began to accuſe the apoſtle, charging him with ſedition, hereſy, and the profanation of the temple; that they would have ſaved him the trouble of this hearing, by judging him according to their own law, had not Lyſias, the chief captain, violently taken him from them, and ſent both the priſoner and them to Ceſarea, by a guard of ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>THE charge of the orator againſt the apoſtle being finiſhed, Felix told St. Paul, that he was now at liberty to make his defence: accordingly he diſtinctly anſwered every part of the charge, in the following manner. "I anſwer this charge of the Jews with greater ſatisfaction before thee, becauſe thou haſt for many years been a judge of this nation. About twelve days ſince, I repaired to Jeruſalem, to worſhip the God of Jacob: but I neither diſputed with any man, or endeavoured to ſtir up the people in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues or the city; nor can they prove the charge they have brought againſt me at this time.</p>
               <p>"HOWEVER, I readily confeſs, <hi>that after the way which they call hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers,</hi> firmly believing every part of the writings of Moſes and the prophets; and, at the ſame time, believe as they themſelves alſo do, that the Almighty will raiſe at the laſt day, both the juſt and unjuſt from the dead; and I am careful to maintain a clear and quiet conſcience, both towards God and man, agreeable to this faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>"HAVING ſpent ſome years in diſtant countries, I repaired to Jeruſalem, with the alm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had collected in other provinces, for the poor of mine own nation, and offerings for the God of Jacob. And while I was performing the duties of religion, certain Aſiatic Jews found me in the temple, purified according to the law; but neither attended with a multitude of followers, or the leaſt tumultuous aſſembly. It was therefore neceſſary that theſe Jews ſhould have been here, if they had any thing to alledge againſt me: nay, I appeal to thoſe of the Sanhedrim here preſent, if any thing has been laid to my charge, except the objections of the Sadducees, who violently oppoſed me for aſſerting the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the reſurrection from the grave at the laſt day."</p>
               <p>HAVING thus heard both parties, Felix refuſed to paſs any final ſentence, till he had more fully adviſed about it, and conſulted Lyſias the governor of the caſtle, who was the moſt proper perſon to give an account of the ſedition and tumult; commanding, in the mean time, that St. Paul ſhould be kept under a guard, but at the ſame time enjoy the liberty of being viſited by his friends, and receive from them any office of friendſhip and kindneſs they thought proper to beſtow.</p>
               <p>DRUSILLA, a Jeweſs, and daughter of the elder Herod, who was alſo the wife of Felix, ſoon after this came down to him at Ceſarea, in whoſe preſence the governor ſent
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:029927_0347_0FE339B9CCC6ACF8"/>
for Paul, and gave him leave to explain the doctrines of Chriſtianity. In this diſcourſe, the apoſtle took occaſion particularly to inſiſt upon the great obligation which the laws of CHRIST lay upon men to judgment and righteouſneſs, to ſobriety and chaſtity; urging, at the ſame time, the true and impartial account that muſt be given at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, when all men ſhall be arraigned before the awful tribunal of Omnipotence, for the actions of their paſt lives, and be eternally puniſhed or rewarded, according to their works done in the body.</p>
               <p>THIS reaſoning was wiſely adopted to the ſtate and temper of Felix; but corroſives are very uneaſy to a guilty mind: men naturally hate whatever brings their ſins to rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebrance, and ſharpens the ſting of a violated conſcience. But however diſagreeable theſe truths may be, they cannot be heard without confuſion; and, accordingly, when St. Paul pathetically deſcribed the terrors of the laſt judgment, Felix trembled on his throne; and was ſo greatly affected, that he cauſed the apoſtle to break off abruptly, telling him that he would hear the remainder of his diſcourſe at a ſeaſon more convenient than the preſent.</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY Felix had ſufficient reaſon to tremble, and his conſcience to be ſenſibly alarmed at theſe reflections; for he was a man notoriouſly infamous for rapine and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Tacitus tells us, that he made his will the law of the government, practiſing all manner of cruelty and injuſtice: his incontinence, luxury, and debauchery, was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor did he ſcruple to violate all the laws of God and man, to ſatisfy his unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: to theſe qualities he added bribery and covetouſneſs; and, therefore, often ſent for our apoſtle to diſcourſe with him, expecting he would have given him a conſiderable ſum for his releaſe; having in all probability, heard that St. Paul had brought a large quantity of money to Jeruſalem: but finding no offers were made him, either by the apoſtle himſelf or his friends, he kept him priſoner two years; when he himſelf being diſcharged from his office by Nero, he left Paul in priſon, in order to gratify the malice of the Jews, and engage them, after his departure from Judea, to ſpeak the better of his government.</p>
               <p>AFTER the diſplacing of Felix, the government of the province was conferred on Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Feſtus, before whom, at his firſt coming to Jeruſalem, the high-prieſt and Sanhedrim preferred an indictment againſt Paul, deſiring that he might be ſent for up to Jeruſalem, in order to his trial, intending to aſſaſſinate him by the way: but Feſtus told them, that he was ſhortly going himſelf to Ceſarea; and that, if they had any complaint againſt Paul, they might come down thither and accuſe him. Accordingly, as ſoon as he was come to Ceſarea, he aſcended the tribunal, where the Jews renewed the charge they had before brought againſt Paul; but the apoſtle ſoon cleared himſelf of every part of the charge, they not being able to prove any thing againſt him. Feſtus, however, being willing to procure the favour of the Jews at his entrance on the government, aſked him whether he would go up and be tried before him at Jeruſalem? But the apoſtle well knowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a propoſal, anſwered, "I am a Roman, and therefore ought to be judged by the Roman law; and now ſtand before the judgment-ſeat of Caeſar. I have done nothing againſt the Jews, a fact thou thyſelf very well knoweſt to be true. If I have committed any thing that deſerves death, I am ready to die; but if not, no perſon hath a power to deliver me into the hands of mine enemies. <hi>I appeal unto Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>APPEALS of this nature were common amongſt the Romans, and introduced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and ſecure the lives and fortunes of the people from the unjuſt encroachment and and over-rigorous ſeverities of the magiſtrates, whereby it was lawful in caſes of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:029927_0348_0FE339BB51A28AA8"/>
to appeal to the emperor for redreſs; a thing more than once ſetteled by the function of the Valerian law, and now fully eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>KING Agrippa, who ſucceeded Herod in the tetrarchate of Galilee, and his ſiſter Bernice, came to Ceſarea, ſome time after St. Paul had appealed to Caeſar, to viſit the new governor. Feſtus embraced this opportunity of mentioning the caſe of our apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to king Agrippa, together with the remarkable tumult this affair had occaſioned amongſt the Jews and the appeal he had made to Caeſar. This account excited the the curioſity of king Agrippa, and he was deſirous of hearing himſelf what St. Paul had to ſay in his own vindication. Accordingly the next day the king and his ſiſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Feſtus the governor, and ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction, came into the court with a pompous and ſplendid retinue, where the priſoner was brought before them. On his appearing, Feſtus informed the court how greatly he had been impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by the Jews, both at Ceſarea and Jeruſalem, to put the priſoner to death as a malefactor; but having, on examination, found him guilty of no capital crime, and the priſoner himſelf having appealed unto Caeſar, he was determined to ſend him to Rome; but was willing to have his cauſe debated before Agrippa, that he might be furniſhed with ſome material particulars to ſend with him; it being highly abſurd to ſend thither a priſoner without ſignifying the crimes laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>AFTER Feſtus had finiſhed his ſpeech, Agrippa told Paul, he was now at liberty to make his own defence: and ſilence being made, he addreſſed his ſpeech particularly to Agrippa, in the following manner.</p>
               <p>"I eſteem it a particular happineſs, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence againſt the accuſations of the Jews, before thee; becauſe thou art well accquainted with all their cuſtoms, and the queſtions commonly debated amongſt them: I therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to hear me patiently and impartially.</p>
               <p>"THE Jews in general are well acquainted with my manner of life from my youth, the greateſt part of it having been ſpent with mine own countrymen at Jeruſalem, They alſo know that I was educated under the inſtitutions of the Phariſees, the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſect of our religion, and am now arrainged for a tenet believed by all their fathers, a tenet ſufficiently credible in itſelf, and plainly revealed in the Scripture, I mean, the reſurrection of the dead. Why ſhould any mortal think it either incredible or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that God ſhould raiſe the dead to life?</p>
               <p>"I once though myſelf indiſpenſably obliged to oppoſe the religion of JESUS of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth: nor was I ſatisfied with impriſoning, and puniſhing with death itſelf, the ſaints I found at Jeruſalem; I even perſecuted them in ſtrange cities, whither my implacable zeal perſued them having procured authority from the chief prieſts and elders for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"I departed accordingly for Damaſcus with a commiſſion from the Sanhedrim; but as I was travelling towards that city, I ſaw at mid-day, O king, a light from heaven, far exceeding the brightneſs of the ſun, encompaſſing me and my companions. On ſeeing this awful appearance, we all fell to the earth; and I heard a voice, which ſaid to me in the Hebrew language, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for the to kick againſt the pricks?</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>Who art thou, Lord?</hi> And he replied, <hi>I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt:</hi> but be not terrified, ariſe from the earth; for I have appeared unto thee, that thou mighteſt be both witneſs of the things thou haſt ſeen, and alſo of others which I will hereafter reveal unto thee: my power ſhall deliver thee from
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:029927_0349_0FE339BCD4807960"/>
the Jews and the Gentiles, to whom now I ſend thee to preach the goſpel; to withdraw the veil of darkneſs and ignorance, to turn them from falſehood unto truth, <hi>and from the power of ſatan unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"HEREUPON, king Agrippa, I readily obeyed the heavenly viſion; I preached the goſpel firſt to the inhabitants of Damaſcus, then to thoſe of Jeruſalem and Judea, and afterwards to the Gentiles; perſuading them to forſake their iniquities, and turn to the living God, by ſincere repentance.</p>
               <p>"THE Jews, being exaſperated at theſe endeavours to ſave the ſouls of ſinful mortals, caught me in the temple, and entered into a conſpiracy to deſtroy me; but by the help of Omnipotence, I ſtill remain a witneſs to all the human race, preaching nothing but what Moſes and all the prophets foretold, namely, that the Meſſiah ſhould ſuffer, be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the chambers of the grave, and publiſh, both to the Jews and Gentiles, the glad-tidings of ſalvation."</p>
               <p>AFTER the apoſtle had thus pleaded for himſelf Feſtus cried out, "Paul, thou art mad; too much ſtudy hath deprived thee of thy reaſon." But Paul anſwered, "I am far, moſt noble Feſtus, from being tranſported with idle and diſtracted ideas; the words I ſpeak are dictated by truth and ſobriety: and I am perſuaded that king Agrippa himſelf is not ignorant of theſe things: for they were tranſacted openly before the world. I am confident, king Agrippa, that thou believeſt the prophets; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt know that all their predictions were fulfilled in CHRIST." To which Agrippa anſwered, "Thou haſt almoſt perſuaded me to embrace the Chriſtian faith." And Paul, replied, "I ſincerely wiſh, that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me, were not almoſt, but altogether the ſame as I myſelf, except being priſoners."</p>
               <p>AFTER Paul had thus ſpoken, the king and the governor, with the reſt of the council, withdrew to confer privately together; and finding, by the accuſations brought againſt him, that he was not guilty by the Roman law of any capital offence, nor even of ſuch as deſerved impriſonment, Agrippa told Feſtus, that he might have been ſet at liberty if he had not appealed unto Caeſar; but an appeal being once made, the judge had no longer any power either to abſolve or condemn, the cauſe being entirely reſerved to the cognizance of that ſuperior, to whom the priſoner had appealed, for his own juſtification.</p>
               <p>AS it was now finally determined Paul ſhould be ſent to Rome, he, with ſeveral others, priſoners of conſequence, were committed to the care of Julius, commander of a company belonging to the legion of Auguſtus; and was accompanied in this voyage by St. Luke, Ariſtarchus, Trophimus, and ſome others not mentioned by the ſacred penman.</p>
               <p>IN the month of September 56, or according to others, 57, they embarked on board a ſhip of Adramyttium, and ſailed to Sidon, where the centurion courteouſly gave the apoſtle leave to go on ſhore to viſit his friends, and refreſh himſelf. After a ſhort ſtay they ſailed for Cyprus, and arrived oppoſite the Fair Havens, a place near Myra, a city of Lycia. Here the ſeaſon being far advanced, and Paul foreſeeing it would be a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous voyage, perſuaded them to put in and winter there; but the Roman centurion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the opinion of the maſter of the ſhip, and the harbour being at the ſame time incommodious, reſolved, if poſſible, to reach Phoenice, a port of Crete, and winter there. But they ſoon found themſelves diſappointed; for the fine ſoutherly gale, which had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them for ſome time, ſuddenly changed into a ſtormy and tempeſtuous wind at north-eaſt, which blew with ſuch violence that the ſhip was obliged to ſail before it; and to prevent her foundering, they threw overboard the principal part of her lading, to lighten the veſſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="unknown:029927_0350_0FE339C4E69E13F0"/>THEY continued fourteen days in this deſperate and uncomfortable condition, neither ſun nor ſtar appearing for great part of the time. During this confuſion, the apoſtle put them in mind how prepoſterouſly they had acted in not liſtening to his advice; but, at the ſame time told them, that the God whom he ſerved and worſhipped, had the laſt night ſent an angel to him, with aſſurance that, notwithſtanding the preſent danger, not one of their lives ſhould be loſt, though the ſhip ſhould be wrecked.</p>
               <p>WHEN the fourteenth night arrived, the ſailors, upon ſounding, found they were near ſome coaſt; and, therefore, to avoid the rocks, thought proper to come to an anchor, till the morning might give them better information. In the mean time, the ſeamen, how beſt underſtood the danger, were preparing to get into the boat to ſave themſelves; which Paul perceiving, told the captain, that unleſs they all ſtayed in the ſhip, not one of them could be ſaved: whereupon the ſoldiers cut the ropes, and let the boat fall into the ſea, from the ſhip.</p>
               <p>WHILE they continued at anchor, waiting for the light of the morning, St. Paul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them to eat, and refreſh themſelves, having faſted a long time, aſſuring them they ſhould all eſcape. When they had finiſhed their repaſt, they lightened the ſhip of thoſe goods which ſtill remained on board, and endeavoured to put into a ſmall creek they had diſcovered at a little diſtance; but falling into a place where two ſeas met, the ſhip ran aground, the forepart remaining immovable, but the after part was demoliſhed by the waves: awakened with the danger they were in, the ſoldiers were deſirous of killing the priſoners, leſt any of them ſhould make their eſcape: but the centurion, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave Paul, refuſed his conſent, commanding that every one ſhould ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the beſt method he could. Accordingly, ſome by ſwimming, and others by broken pieces of the ſhip, they all, to the number of two hundred threeſcore and ſixteen, got to ſhore in ſafety.</p>
               <p>AGREEABLE to St. Paul's prediction, the country on which they were caſt, was an iſland called Melita, now Malta, ſituated in the Lybian ſea, between Syracuſe and Africa. Here they met with great civility from a barbarous people, and the plain acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a divine juſtice written on the naked and uninſtructed minds of men; they treated them with great humanity, entertaining them with all the neceſſary accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but while St. Paul was laying a few ſticks on the fire, a viper enlivened by the heat, came from amongſt the wood and faſtened on his hand. On ſeeing this, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the iſland concluded, that he was certainly ſome notorious murderer, whom the divine vengeance, though it ſuffered him to eſcape the ſea, had reſerved for a more public and ſolemn execution: but when they ſaw him ſhake off the venemous creature into the fire, and no manner of harm enſue, they changed their ſentiments, and cried out, <hi>that he was a God:</hi> ſo eaſily are light and credulous minds tranſported from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to another, according to the difference of occurrences.</p>
               <p>THE reſidence of Publius, the governor of the iſland, was not far from the place where they were ſhipwrecked: he entertained this unfortunate company with great hoſpitality for three days; in acknowledgment of which St. Paul by his prayers, and the impoſition of his hands, recovered his father from a fever and bloody-flux; and reſtored ſeveral others of the inhabitants, afflicted with different diſeaſes, to their former health and ſtrength; in conſequence of which, they not only ſhewed him the greateſt marks of their eſteem, but furniſhed both him and his company with all the neceſſaries proper for the reſt of their voyage.</p>
               <p>AFTER three months ſtay in this iſland, the centurion with his charge went on board the Caſtor and Pollux, a ſhip of Alexandria, bound to Italy. They put in at Syracuſe,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:029927_0351_0FE339C744DFAE40"/>
where they tarried three days, ſailed from thence to Regium, and ſo to Puteoli, where they landed; and finding ſome Chriſtians there, ſtaid at their requeſt a week with them, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſet forward on their journey to Rome. The Chriſtians of this city, hearing of the apoſtle's coming, went to meet him as far as the Three Taverns, about thirty miles from Rome, and others as far as the Apii Forum, fifty-one miles diſtant from the capital: they kindly embraced each other, and the liberty he ſaw the Chriſtians enjoy at Rome, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tended to enliven the ſpirits of the apoſtle. By theſe Chriſtians he was conducted in a kind of triumph into the city, where, at their arrival, the reſt of the priſoners were delivered to the captain of the guard, and by him diſpoſed in the common priſon; but St. Paul, probably by the interceſſion of Julius, was permitted to reſide in a private houſe, with only one ſoldier to guard him.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL arriving at Rome, he ſent, after he had been there three days, for the heads of the Jewiſh conſiſtory in that city, and related to them the cauſe of his coming, in the following manner: "Though I have been guilty of no violence of the laws of our religion, yet I was delivered by the Jews at Jeruſalem to the Roman governors, who more than once would have acquitted me as innocent of any capital offence; but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of my perſecutors, I was obliged to appeal unto Caeſar; not that I had any thing to accuſe my nation of: I had therefore recourſe to this method, merely to prove mine own innocence, and confute the allegations of my enemies."</p>
               <p>A popular prejudice being thus removed he added, "That the true cauſe of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was what their own religion had taught him, the belief and expectation of a future reſurrection." This ſpeech gained greatly on their affections, and they anſwered, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y had received no advice concerning him, nor had any of the Jews that came from Judea brought any charge againſt him; but, at the ſame time, they deſired to know what he had to ſay in ſupport of the religion he embraced, it being every where decried both by Jew and Gentile. Accordingly, upon a day appointed, he diſcourſed with them from morning to night concerning the religion and doctrine of the holy JESUS; proving, from the promiſes and predictions of the Old Teſtament, that he was the true Meſſiah; but his diſcourſe had different effects on different hearers, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced, and others perſiſting in their infidelity; and as they were departing in ſome diſcontent at each other, the apoſtle told them, it was too plain that God had accompliſhed upon them the prophetical curſe, of being left to their own wilful hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency to be blind at noon-day, and to run themſelves headlong into irrecoverable ruin. That ſince this was the caſe, they muſt expect, that he would henceforth preach to the Gentiles, who would very readily embrace the glad-tidings of the goſpel, which they ſo ſcornfully rejected.</p>
               <p>DURING two whole years, Paul dwelt at Rome, in a houſe he had hired for his own uſe; wherein he conſtantly employed himſelf in preaching and writing for the good of the church. He preached daily without interruption, and with rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>kable ſucceſs; ſo that his impriſonment contributed greatly to the propagation of the goſpel, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him famous even in the emperor's court, where he converted ſeveral to the faith of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>BESIDES others of the apoſtle's converts at Rome, there was one Oneſimus, who had formerly been a ſervant to Philemon, a perſon of diſtinction in Coloſſe, but had run away from his maſter, and taken with him ſome things of value. Having rambled as far as Rome, he was now converted by St. Paul, and by him returned to his maſter, with a ſhort recommendatory letter, earneſtly deſiring him to pardon him; and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his former faults, to treat him kindly, and uſe him as a brother, promiſing withal, that if he had wronged or owed him any thing, he himſelf would repay it for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="unknown:029927_0352_0FE339C8CBD47528"/>ST. Paul's Epiſtle on this ſubject may be conſidered as a maſter-piece of eloquence, in the perſuaſive way; for the apoſtle has herein had recourſe to all the conſiderations, which friendſhip, religion, piety and tenderneſs, can inſpire, to reconcile a maſter to his ſervant; and yet ſome of the ancients were of opinion, that it did not deſerve a place in the canon of Scripture becauſe it was written on a particular occaſion, and with a deſign not ſo much to inſtruct Chriſtians in general, as to recommend a poor fugitive ſervant: but though the ſubject of this Epiſtle be a private affair, yet it contains, amongſt others, the following general inſtruction: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that no Chriſtian, though of the meaneſt condition, is to be contemned. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Chriſtianity does not impair the power of maſters over their ſervants. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſervants ought to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for any wrong or injury done to their maſters. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That maſters ought to be reconciled to their ſervants, upon their repentance and acknowledgement of their faults, And. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That there is at all times, a love and affection due from a maſter to a ſervant. Who, therefore, would refuſe to number an Epiſtle ſo profitable, and ſo inſtructive, with the reſt of the works of this learned apoſtle?</p>
               <p>THE Philippians hearing of St. Paul's impriſonment at Rome, and not knowing what ſtraits he might be reduced to, raiſed a contribution for him, and ſent it by Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus their biſhop, by whom he returned an Epiſtle to them, wherein he gives ſome account of the ſtate of his affairs at Rome; gratefully acknowledges their kindneſs to him; warnes them againſt the dangerous opinions which the Judaizing teachers began to vent amongſt them; and adviſes them to live in continual obedience to CHRIST; to avoid diſputations, delight in prayer, be courageous under affliction, united in love, and clothed with humility, in imitation of the bleſſed JESUS, who ſo far humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to <hi>become obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs,</hi> for the ſins of men.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle had lived three years at Epheſus, preaching the goſpel to the numerous inhabitants of that city, and was therefore well acquainted with the ſtate and condition of the place; ſo that taking the opportunity of Tychicus's going thither he wrote his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, wherein he endeavours to countermine the principles and practices both of the Jews and Gentiles; to confirm them in the belief and practice of the Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and to inſtruct them fully in the great myſteries of the goſpel; that redemption and juſtification by the death of CHRIST; their gratuitous election; their union with the Jews in the body, of which CHRIST is the head, and the glorious exaltation of that head above all creatures both ſpiritual and temporal; together with many excellent moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, both as to the general duties of religion, and the duties of their particular relations in life.</p>
               <p>THOUGH St. Paul, himſelf had never been at Coloſſe, yet Epaphras, who was then at Rome a priſoner with him, had preached the goſpel there with good ſucceſs; and from him might learn, that certain falſe teachers had endeavoured to perſuade the people, that they ought not to apply to God by JESUS CHRIST, who, ſince his aſcenſion, was ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above them, that angels were now become the proper mediators between God and man; and, therefore, in oppoſition to this, as well as other ſeductions of the ſame nature, he wrote his Epiſtle to the Colloſſians; wherein he magnificently diſplays the Meſſiah, and all the benefits flowing from him, as being the image of his Father, the Redeemer of all mankind, the reconciler of all things to God, and the head of the church, which gives life and vigour to all its members: he commends the doctrine preached to them by Epaphras, and exhorts them not to be led away by the reaſonings of human phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, by the ſuperſtitious practices of making differences of meats and drinks, or by a pretended humility in worſhipping angels; and gives them an abſtract of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE have no account in hiſtory, by what means St. Paul was delivered from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and diſcharged from the accuſation the Jews brought againſt him; but it is natural to ſuppoſe, that not having ſufficient proof of what they alledged, or being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the crimes they accuſed him of, were no violations of the Roman law, they durſt not implead him before the emperor, and ſo permitted him to be diſcharged of courſe: but by whatever means he procured his liberty, he wrote his Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews before he left Italy, from whence he dates his ſalutations to the Jewiſh churches.</p>
               <p>IT is neceſſary to obſerve, that the principal deſign of this admirable Epiſtle is, to magnify CHRIST and the religion of the goſpel, above Moſes and the Jewiſh econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in order to eſtabliſh and confirm the converted Jews in the firm belief and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, notwithſtanding the trouble and perſecutions that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly attend them. He therefore repreſents our Saviour in his divine nature, as far ſuperior to all angels, and all created being; and in his mediatorial capacity as a greater prieſt than Aaron, and a greater king and prieſt than Melchiſedec: he ſhews that the ceremonies, the ſacrifices, and the obſervances of the law could have no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in themſelves, but only as they were the types of JESUS CHRIST; and being now accompliſhed in his perſon, were finally and totally aboliſhed: he inſiſts on the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of faith; and by the examples of the patriarchs, and prophets, proves that juſtification can be procured no other way, than by the merits of a dying Saviour: and, laſtly, he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles many excellent precepts for the regulation of their lives; exhortations to put truſt and confidence in CHRIST, in all their ſufferings; and ſtrict cautions againſt apoſtacy from his religion in the hotteſt perſecutions from their enemies.</p>

What ſucceſs he had in theſe weſtern parts, is not known; he how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever continued there eight or nine months, and then returned again to the Eaſt, viſited Sicily, Greece, and Crete, and then repaired into Judea.</p>
               <p>HOW long he continued in his native country, is unknown, no further mention being made of him, till his return to Rome, which was probably about the eighth or ninth year of Nero's reign. Here he met with Peter, and was, together with him, thrown into priſon, doubtleſs in the general proſecution raiſed againſt the Chriſtians, under pretence that they had ſet fire to the city: but beſides this general, there were particular reaſons for his impriſonment. Some of the ancients ſay, he was engaged with St. Peter in detecting the impoſitions of Simon Magus.</p>
               <p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM tells us, that Nero was highly enraged againſt St. Paul, for his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted one of his favourite concubines; and the apoſtle, after he was thrown into priſon, perſiſting to perſuade that lady to continue in her chaſte and pious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Nero commanded him to be put to death. How long he continued in priſon, is uncertain; nor do we know whether he was ſcourged before his execution: he was however allowed the privilege of a Roman citizen, and therefore beheaded.</p>
               <p>AS he was led to the place of execution, he is ſaid to have converted three of the ſoldiers ſent to guard and conduct him, and who ſoon after became martyrs to the faith.

Being come to the place, which was the Aquae Salviae, three miles from Rome, he cheerfully, after a ſolemn preparation, gave his neck to the fatal ſtroke; and from this vale of miſery, his ſpirit paſſed to the bliſsful regions of immortality to the kingdom of his beloved Maſter, the great redeemer of the human race, in the propagation of whoſe goſpel, he had ſo long and faithfully laboured.</p>
               <p>HIS mortal part was buried in the Via Oſtienſis, about two miles from Rome; and about the year 317, Conſtantine the Great, at the inſtance of Pope Sylveſter, built a ſtately church over his grave, adorned it with an hundred marble columns and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it with the moſt exquiſite workmanſhip: but this church being thought too ſmall for the honour of ſo great an apoſtle, Valentinian, by a reſcript to Sauſtius, perfect of the city, cauſed it to be taken down, and a much larger ſtructure to be erected, which was finiſhed after his death by Theodoſius; and further beautified, at the perſuaſion of Leo, biſhop of Rome, by the empreſs Placida.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to Nicephorus, St. Paul was of a low and ſmall ſtature, ſomewhat ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his complexion was fair, his countenance grave, his head ſmall, his eyes ſparkling, his noſe high and bending, and his hair thick and dark, but mixed with grey. His conſtitution was weak, and often ſubject to diſtempers: but how mean ſoever the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet might be, there was a treaſure within precious and valuable, as will ſufficiently appear, if we view the accompliſhments of his mind.</p>
               <p>HIS judgment was clear and ſolid, his underſtanding quick and his memory was ſtrong and clear; all which were greatly improved by art, and the advantages of a liberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The ſchools of Tarſus and Jeruſalem had ſharpened his diſcurſive faculty by logic and the arts of reaſoning, inſtructed him in the inſtitutions of philoſophy, and adorned his mind with every kind of human learning. A ſufficient proof, that it is not unlawful to bring the ſpoils of Egypt into the ſervice of the ſanctuary; and to make uſe of the advantages of foreign ſtudies and human literature to divine and excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. He ſeems indeed to have been educated purpoſely to qualify him for being the apoſtle of the Gentiles, to contend with and confute the grave and the wiſe, the acute and the ſubtle, the ſage and the learned of the heathen world, and to wound them with arrows from their own quivers. He ſeldom made uſe of learning and philoſophy; it being more agreeable to the deſigns of the goſpel, to confound, by the plain doctrine of the croſs, the wiſdom and learning of the world.</p>
               <p>THOUGH theſe were great accompliſhments, yet they were only a ſhadow of that divine temper of mind he enjoyed, and which diſcovered itſelf through the whole courſe of his life. He was humble to the loweſt ſtep of abaſement and condeſcenſion, none ever think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better of others, or more meanly of himſelf. And though when he had to deal with envious and malicious adverſaries, who endeavoured, by vilifying his perſon, to obſtruct his miniſtry, he knew how to magnify his office, and to let them know that he was not inferior to the chiefeſt of the apoſtles; yet, at other times, he always declared to the world, that he conſidered himſelf as an abortive, or an untimely birth, as <hi>the leaſt of the apoſtles, not meet to be called an apoſtle;</hi> and, as if this were not enough, he formed a word on purpoſe to expreſs his humility, ſtyling himſelf Elachiſtoteron, <hi>leſs than the leaſt of the ſaints;</hi> nay, <hi>the very chief of ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOW freely and frequently does he confeſs, that, before his converſion, he was a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a perſecutor, a perſon that injured both God and man: though honoured with the higheſt grace and favour, taken up to an immediate converſe with God in heaven yet he never ſhewed the leaſt loftineſs over his brethren; he was intruſted with the
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:029927_0355_0FE339D5A896B388"/>
greateſt power and authority in the church, but never affected to govern the faith of men; he only endeavoured to be an helper to their joy. How ſtudiouſly did he decline all the honours and commendations that were heaped upon him: when ſome in the church of Corinth magnified him, and, under the patronage of his name, began to ſet up for a party, he ſeverely rebuked them, told them that it was CHRIST, not he that was crucified for them; that they had not been baptized in his name, nor did he remember to have baptized above three or four of them, and was heartily glad he had no oftener per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ceremony, leſt a foundation might have been laid, from that circumſtance, for charging him with Judaizing.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL's temperance and ſobriety were remarkable, for he often abridged himſelf of the conveniency of lawful and neceſſary accommodations: his hungerings and thirſtings were frequent: by which means he reduced the extravagancy of the ſenſual appetites to a perfect ſubjection of the law of reaſon. Hence he eaſily got above the world, with all its charms and frowns, and his mind was continually converſant in heaven, where his thoughts were fixed, and whither his deſires always aſcended. What he taught to others, he practiſed himſelf; his converſation was in heaven, and his deſires were to depart, and to be with CHRIST. This world neither arreſted his affection nor diſturbed his fears: he was neither pleaſed with its applauſes, nor terrified with its threatenings: he ſtudied not to pleaſe men, nor valued the cenſures they paſſed upon him: he was not greedy of a great eſtate, titles of honour, or rich preſents from men; food and raiment was his bill of fare, and more than this he never cared for; accounting, that the leſs he was clogged with theſe things the lighter he ſhould paſs to heaven, eſpecially as he was travelling through a world over-run with trouble and perſecutions. And hence it is very probable, that he always led a ſingle life, though ſome of the ancients rank him amongſt thoſe apoſtles that were married.</p>
               <p>NO leſs exemplary was his kindneſs and charity; for he had a compaſſionate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the poor and a quick ſenſe of the wants of others. To which church ſoever he came, it was always one of his firſt cares to make proviſion for the poor and to ſtir up the bounty of the rich and wealthy; nay, he himſelf worked often with his own hands, not only to maintain himſelf, but alſo to help and relieve them; but his charity to the ſouls of men was infinitely greater, fearing no angers, refuſing no labours, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through good and evil report, that he might gain men over to the knowledge of the truth, bring them out of the crooked paths of vice and idolatry and place them in the ſtraight way that leadeth to life eternal: nay, ſo inſatiable was his thirſt for the good of ſouls, that he affirms that he would ſooner himſelf be accurſed from CHRIST, than that his countrymen ſhould miſcarry. And as he was infinitely ſolicitous to gain them over to the religion of the Son of God, ſo he was equally careful to keep them from being ſeduced from it; ready to ſuſpect every thing that might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their minds from the ſimplicity that is in CHRIST: <hi>I am jealous over you,</hi> ſays he to the church of Corinth, <hi>with a Godly jealouſy:</hi> an affection of all others the moſt active and vigilant, and which inſpires men with the moſt paſſionate care and concern for the good of thoſe for whom they have the higheſt degree of love and kindneſs.</p>
               <p>NOR was his charity to men greater than his zeal for God, labouring with all his might to promote the honour of his maſter. How remarkable zealous was he while he continued a member of the Jewiſh religion, of the tradition of the father! How earneſt to vindicate and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ert the divinity of the Moſaic diſpenſation, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all who were of a contrary faith, even to rage and madneſs? And when his zeal was afterwards turned into a right channel, it ran with ſwift current, carrying
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:029927_0356_0FE339D72EDEF660"/>
him out againſt all oppoſition, to vanquiſh the kingdom and the powers of darkneſs, to beat down idolatry, and plant the world with the right apprehenſions of God, and the true knowledge of religion. When at Athens he ſaw them involved in the groſſeſt ſuperſtition and idolatry, and giving the honour that was due to God alone to ſtatues and images, this fired his zeal, and he could not but let them know the reſentment of his mind, and how greatly they diſhonoured God, the great maker and preſerver of the world. This zeal muſt have rendered him remarkably diligent and induſtrious in the execution of his office, warning, reproving, entreating, perſuading, preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, by night and by day, by ſea and by land: he thought no pains too much to be taken, no dangers too great to be overcome.</p>
               <p>FOR thirty-five years after his converſion he ſeldom ſtaid long in one place, travelling from Jeruſalem through Arabia, Aſia, and Greece, to Illyricum, to Rome, and to the utmoſt bounds of the weſtern world, preaching the goſpel of CHRIST. Running, ſays St. Jerom, from ocean to ocean, like the ſun in the heavens, of which it is ſaid, his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit is from the one end of the heavens to the other, ſooner wanting ground to tread on, than a deſire to propagate the faith of CHRIST. Nicephorus compares him to a bird in the air, which, in a few years flew round the world: Iſidore, to a winged huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who flew from place to place, to cultivate the world with the moſt exact rules and inſtitutions of life. And while the other apoſtles confined themſelves, as it were, to one foot, chooſing this or that particular province and place for their miniſtry, St. Paul over-ran the whole world to its utmoſt bounds and corners, planting all places where he came with the divine doctrines of the goſpel. Nor in this courſe was he tired with the dangers and difficulties he met with, the troubles and oppoſitions that were raiſed againſt him: but all theſe ſerved only to reflect a greater luſtre on his patience; of which he was a moſt eminent pattern, enduring the greateſt troubles and perſecutions, with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience triumphant and unconquerable.</p>
               <p>THIS will eaſily appear if we take a ſurvey of what trials and ſufferings he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went; ſome part whereof are thus briefly ſummed up by himſelf: <hi>In labours abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons frequent, in deaths oft; thrince beaten with rods, once ſtoned, thrice ſuffered ſhipwreck, a night and a day in the deep: in journeyings often, in perils of water, in perils by his countrymen, in perils by the Heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in perils in the ſea, in perils amongst falſe brethren: in wearineſs, in painfulneſs, in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt; in faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs; and beſides thoſe things that were without, which daily came upon him, the care of all the churches.</hi> An account, though very great, yet far ſhort of what he endured. All which he cheerfully underwent with a ſoul as calm and ſerene as the morning ſun; no malice or rage, nor fury or ſtorms, could ruffle or diſcompoſe his ſpirit: nay, they animated him to riſe up with the greater eagerneſs and reſolution to perform his duty. Could all the powers of men and devils, ſpite and oppoſition, torments and threatenings, have been able to baffle him out of that religion he had embraced, he muſt have deſerted his ſtation: but his ſoul was ſteeled with a courage and reſolution that was impenetrable; and on which no temptation, either from hopes or fears, could make any more impreſſion, than an arrow ſhot againſt a wall of adamant.</p>
               <p>HE did not want ſolicitations both from Jews and Gentiles; and might, doubtleſs, in ſome meaſure, have made his own terms, would he have been falſe to his truſt, and quitted that way which was then every where ſpoken againſt. But, alas! theſe things weighed little with our apoſtle, who <hi>counted not his life dear unto him, ſo that he might finiſh his courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which he had received of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and therefore, when he thought himſelf under the ſentence of death, could
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:029927_0357_0FE339D8B1F6AE10"/>
triumphantly ſay, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> In ſhort, he was a man in whom the divine life eminently diſplayed itſelf; he lived piouſly and devoutly, ſoberly and temperately, juſtly and righteouſly; careful <hi>always to keep a conſcience void of offence both towards God and man.</hi> This, he tells us, was his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under all his ſufferings; this the foundation of his confidence towards God, and his firm hopes of happineſs in another world. <hi>This is our rejoicing the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> In ſhort, as the love of this great apoſtle to his divine Maſter knew no bounds, ſo the beauty and energy of his writings, as well as his ſufferings in ſupport of the truth he eſpouſed and inculcated, are beyond example.</p>

               <head>THE LIFE of ST. JAMES the APOSTLE, ſurnamed the GREAT.</head>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was a native of Galilee, born in all probability either at Capernaum or Bethſaida, as he was a partner with Simon Peter in the fiſhing trade. The epithet of Great was given him, to diſtinguiſh him from another apoſtle of the ſame name.</p>
               <p>HE was the ſon of Zebedee, a fiſherman, who kept ſeveral ſervants to carry on his trade, and therefore muſt have been a perſon of conſequence in his way. His mother's name was Mary, ſurnamed Salome, the daughter of Cleophas, and ſiſter, or rather couſin-german to Mary the mother of our Lord; ſo that he had the honour of being a near relation to CHRIST himſelf. He was brought up to the trade of his father; a mean occupation, indeed, in the eye of the world, but no employment is mean that is honeſt and induſtrious; and it ſhould be remembered that the Son of God himſelf ſtooped ſo low, as to become the reputed ſon of a carpenter, and during the retirement of his private life, laboured himſelf at his father's trade; not merely devoting himſelf to contemplations, nor withdrawing from all uſeful ſociety with the world, and hiding himſelf in the ſolitudes of an anchoret, but buſying himſelf in an active courſe of life, as he continually went about doing good to the ſouls and bodies of mankind.</p>
               <p>NOT in the leaſt diſcouraged at the meanneſs of his father's trade, St. James applied himſelf to it with remarkable aſſiduity, and was exerciſing his employment when the Saviour of the world paſſing by the ſea of Galilee, ſaw him with his brother in the ſhip, and called them both to be his diſciples. Nor was the call in vain; they cheerfully complied with it, and immediately left all to follow him: they did not ſtay to diſpute his commands, or ſolicitouſly inquire into the minute conſequences of the undertaking, the troubles and dangers that might attend this new employment; but readily delivered themſelves up to perform whatever ſervice he ſhould call them to.</p>
               <p>HE was called ſoon after this from the ſtation of an ordinary diſciple, to the apoſtolical office, and even honoured with ſome particular favours beyond moſt of the apoſtles, being one of the three whom our Lord made choice of, as his companion in the more intimate tranſactions of his life, from which the reſt were excluded. Thus, with Peter and his brother John, he attended his Maſter when he raiſed the daughter of Jairus from the dead; he was admitted to CHRIST's glorious transfiguration on the mount, and heard the diſcourſes that paſſed between him and the great miniſters from the courts of heaven: and when the holy JESUS was to undergo his bitter agony in the garden, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory ſufferings to his paſſion, James was one of the three taken to be a ſpectator of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="unknown:029927_0358_0FE339E01FA07368"/>IT is not eaſy to determine what reaſons induced the Redeemer of mankind to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe three apoſtles to peculiar acts of favour; though he doubtleſs did it for wiſe and proper ends. Whether he deſigned theſe three to be more ſolemn and peculiar witneſſes of ſome remarkable tranſactions of his life than the other apoſtles; or that they would be more eminently uſeful and ſerviceable in ſome parts of the apoſtolic office; or to encourage them thereby to prepare for the ſufferings that would attend them in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; or whether he deſigned them for ſome more eminent kinds of matyrdom than the reſt of his diſciples.</p>
               <p>IT was not the leaſt inſtance of particular honour that our Lord conferred on theſe apoſtles, when he called them to the apoſtolate, that he gave them a new name and title. A thing not uncommon of old, for the Almighty often impoſed new names on perſons, when he intended them for ſome great and peculiar ſervices and employments; inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this we have in Abraham and Jacob. Accordingly our Lord, at the election of theſe three apoſtles, gave them new names: Simon he called <hi>Peter,</hi> or a rock, and James and John, <hi>Boanerges,</hi> or the ſons of thunder. What our Lord intended by their ſurnames is much eaſier to conjecture than determine; ſome think it was given them on account of their being preſent in the mount, when a voice came out of the cloud, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved ſon,</hi> &amp;c. for when the people heared the ſame voice at another time, they ſaid "It thundered." But this obſervation is in itſelf very inconſiderable, becauſe it was equally applicable to Peter as to them. Others think that it was given them on account of their loud and bold ſpeaking the goſpel to the world, fearing no threatenings, diſpiſing all oppoſition, and going on thundering in the ears of a drowſy and ſleepy world; rouſing and awakening the conſciences of men with the earneſtneſs and vehemence of their preaching, which reſembled thunder, as the voice of God power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhakes the natural world, and breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. Others think it relates to the doctrines they delivered, teaching the great myſteries of the goſpel in a more profound and loftier ſtrain than the reſt.</p>
               <p>HOW far the latter opinion might be true with regard to St. James, the ſcriptures are wholly ſilent; but it was certainly verified in his brother John, whoſe goſpel is ſo full of the more ſublime notions and myſteries of the goſpel concerning the divinity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, &amp;c. of CHRIST, that he is generally affirmed by the ancients to thunder ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſpeak. Perhaps the expreſſions may denote no more than that in general they were to be prime and eminent miniſters, in this new ſtate of things; the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the goſpel or evangelical diſpenſation, being called "a voice ſhaking the heaven and the earth," and therefore exactly correſpondent to the native importance of the word, ſignifying an <hi>earthquake,</hi> or a vehement commotion, that like thunder, makes an alarming noiſe.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this be, our bleſſed Saviour doubtleſs by this term alluded to the furious and reſolute diſpoſitions of theſe two brothers, who ſeem to have been of a more fiery temper than the reſt of the apoſtles, of which we have this memorable inſtance. When our Lord was determined on his journey to Jeruſalem, he ſent ſome of his diſciples before him to make preparation for his coming; but, on their entering a village of Samaria, were rudely rejected, from the old grudge that ſubſiſted between the Samaritans and the Jews, and becauſe our Saviour, by going up to Jeruſalem, ſeemed to flight their place of worſhip on mount Garizim.</p>
               <p>THIS piece of rudeneſs and inhumanity was ſo highly reſented by St. James and his brother John, that they came to JESUS, deſiring to know if he would not imitate Elias, by calling down fire from heaven to conſume this barbarous, inhoſpitable people. So

But the holy JESUS ſoon convinced them of their miſtake, by telling them, that he was come to ſave the lives of the children of men, and not to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>WE have no account from ſacred hiſtory, what became of St. James after the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of his great and beloved Maſter. Sophronius tells us, that he preached to the diſperſed Jews, that is, to thoſe converts who were diſperſed after the death of Stephen. The Spaniſh writers will have it, that after preaching the goſpel in ſeveral parts of Judea and Samaria, he viſited Spain, where he planted Chriſtianity, and appointed ſome ſelect diſciples to perfect what he had begun; but if we conſider the ſhortneſs of St. James's life, and that the apoſtles continued in a body at Jeruſalem, even after the diſperſion of the other Chriſtians, we ſhall find it difficult to allow time ſufficient for ſo tedious and difficult a voyage as that was in thoſe early ages; and therefore it is ſafeſt to confine his miniſtry to Judea and the countries bordering upon it.</p>
               <p>WE learn from profane hiſtory, that Herod Agrippa, ſon of Ariſtobulus and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Herod the Great, had been a great favourite both with the emperor Caligula and his ſucceſſor Claudius, who conferred on his grandfather's kingdoms, and ſent him into Judea. Herod was noble and generous, prudent and politic, thoroughly verſed in all the arts and intrigues of a court; he knew how to oblige his enemies, and molify or avert the diſpleaſure of the emperor. He was of a courteous and affable diſpoſition; but at the ſame time a great zealot of the Jewiſh religion, and a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate obſerver of the Moſaic law. This prince, at his arrival in his new kingdom, though there was no ſurer way of ingratiating himſelf into the favour of the populace, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by perſecuting the Chriſtians, whom he knew the Jews deteſted. Accordingly, he began a violent perſecution; but the commonalty being too mean a ſacrifice to ſatisfy his own zeal, and favour his popular deſigns, he laid hands on St. James, whoſe active temper and vigorous manner of contending for the truth and excellency of the Chriſtian religion, rendered him a proper victim at this time.</p>
               <p>THE ſame zeal which animated Herod to lay hands on St. James, alſo prompted him to paſs ſentence of death on him immediately. As he was led to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the officer that guarded him to the tribunal, or rather his accuſer, having been converted by that remarkable courage and conſtancy ſhewn by the apoſtle at the time of his trial, repented of what he had done, came and fell down at the apoſtle's feet, and heartily begged pardon for what he had ſaid againſt him. The holy man, after recovering from the ſurpriſe, tenderly embraced him. "Peace," ſaid he, "my ſon peace be to thee, and the pardon of the faults." Upon which the officer publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf a Chriſtian, and both were beheaded at the ſame time. Thus fell the great apoſtle James, the firſt protomartyr of the apoſtles, the firſt of that number that gained the crown, taking cheerfully that cup of which he had long ſince told his Lord he was ready to drink.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, the divine vengeance, that never ſleeps, would not ſuffer the death of this innocent and righteous man to paſs long unrevenged; for ſhortly after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of St. James, Herod removed to Ceſarea, in order to make war on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Tyrians and Sidonians; and while he continued in this city, he proclaimed ſolemn fights and feſtival entertainments to be held in honour of Caeſar to which there flocked a prodigious confluence of the principal inhabitants of the ajacent parts. Early in the morning of the ſecond day, he came with great ſtate into the theatre, to make

as oration to the people; and being clothed in a robe curiouſly wrought with ſilver, the beams of the ſun were reflected from it with ſuch luſtre, that the people cried out, that it was ſome deity they beheld; and that he who ſpoke to them muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above the common ſtandard of humanity.</p>
               <p>THIS impious applauſe Herod received without the leaſt token of diſlike, or ſenſe of the injury that was done by it to the Supreme Being. But a ſudden accident changed the ſcene, and turned their mirth and rejoicing into melancholy and mourning; for Herod looking up, ſaw an owl perched upon a rope over his head, which he conſidered as the fatal miniſter of his death; on which an incurable melancholy ſeized his mind, and the moſt exquiſite torments his bowels, occaſioned by thoſe worms St. Luke men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that turning to the people, he cried out, "Behold the deity you admired, and yourſelves evidently convinced of flattery and falſehood; ſee me this moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the laws of fate to die, whom juſt now you ſtyled immortal." He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the palace, but his pains ſtill increaſed upon him; and though the people faſted, and offered prayers for his life and health, yet his accute torments prevailed, and after five days put a period to his life.</p>

               <p>BEFORE we enter upon the life of this apoſtle, it will be neceſſary to remove ſome difficulties relating to his perſon. It has been doubted by ſome whether this was the ſame with that St. James, who was afterwards biſhop of Jeruſalem, two of this name being mentioned in the ſacred writings, namely, St. James the Great and St. James the Leſs, both apoſtles; the ancients mention a third, ſurnamed the Juſt, which they will have to be diſtinct from the former, and biſhop of Jeruſalem; but this opinion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> built on a ſandy foundation; for nothing is plainer, than that St. James the apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom St. Paul calls <hi>our Lord's brother,</hi> and reckons with Peter and John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of the pillars of the church, was the ſame who preſided among the apoſtles, doubtleſs by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his epiſcopal office, and determined the cauſes in the ſynod of Jeruſalem. Nor do either Clemens, Alexandrinus, or Euſebius, mention any more than two, St. James ſlain by Herod, and St. James the Juſt, biſhop of Jeruſalem, whom they expreſsly affirm to be the ſame with him who is called the brother of our Lord by St. Paul.</p>
               <p>THE difficulties with regard to his perſon being thus removed, we ſhall proceed to the hiſtory of his life. It is reaſonable to think that he was the ſon of Joſeph, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the huſband of Mary, by his firſt wife, whom St. Jerom ſtyles Eſcha, and adds, that ſhe was the daughter of Aggi, brother to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hence he was reputed our Lord's brother. We find indeed ſeveral mentioned as the brethren of our Saviour, in the evangelical hiſtory; but in what ſenſe, was greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by the ancients. St. Jerom, St. Chryſoſtom, and ſome others, will have them to have been ſo called from their being the ſons of Mary, couſin-german, or according to the Hebrew idiom, ſiſter to the Virgin Mary: but Euſebius, Epiphanius, and many others tell us, they were the children of Joſeph by a former wife; and this ſeems moſt natural, and beſt agrees with what the evangeliſt ſays of them, when he enumerates the queſtions of the Jews: <hi>Is not this the carpenter's ſon? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brethren, James, and Joſes, and Simeon and Judas? And his ſiſters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this man theſe things?</hi> By which it is plain that the Jews underſtood theſe perſons not to be CHRIST's kinſman only, but his brethren; the ſame carpenter's ſons having the ſame relation to him, that JESUS himſelf had: indeed they had more, CHRIST being only his reputed, they his natural ſons. Upon this account, the bleſſed

Virgin is ſometimes called the mother of James and Joſes; and by this name we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find her mentioned by the evangeliſts in relating our Lord's crucifixion: and though ſhe was only mother-in-law to St. James, yet the evangeliſts might chooſe to ſtyle her ſo, becauſe ſhe was commonly called his mother after the death of Joſeph: perhaps ſhe herſelf choſe that title, that the Son of God, whom as a virgin ſhe had brought into the world, might be the better concealed, and leſs expoſed to the envious malice of the Jews. To this it may be added, that Joſephus, who was eminently ſkilled in matters of genealogy and deſcent, expreſsly ſays, that St. James was the brother of JESUS CHRIST. There is indeed one objection againſt this, namely, that he is called <hi>the ſon of Alpheus:</hi> but this may mean no more, than either that Joſeph was called by another name, a thing very common among the Jews, or that James himſelf was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſome particular ſect or ſynagogue called Alpheans, there being many ſuch ſects about this time amongſt the Jews.</p>
               <p>THE ſacred hiſtory is ſilent with regard to the place of his birth: the Jews in their Talmud, calls him a man of the town of Sechania: but where that place was ſituated is uncertain: nor is it known what his particular way or courſe of life was before he was called to the apoſtleſhip: the ſacred writers having been ſilent with regard to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, mentioning nothing concerning him during the life of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>ST. JAMES was honoured, after the reſurrection, with a particular appearance of our Lord to him, which, though paſſed over in ſilence by the evangeliſts, is recorded by St. Paul, St. Jerom, from the Hebrew goſpel of the Nazarenes, which contain ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars omitted by the evangelical hiſtorians, gives the following relation of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

St. James had ſolemnly ſworn, that from the time he had drank of the cup at the inſtitution of the ſupper, he would eat bread no more, till he ſaw the Lord riſen from the dead; our Lord, therefore, being returned from the grave, came and appeared to him, and commanded bread to be ſet before him, which he took, bleſſed, and brake, and gave to St. James; ſaying, "Eat thy bread, my brother, for the Son of man is truly riſen from amongſt them that ſleep."</p>
               <p>AFTER the reſurrection of our Saviour, he was choſen biſhop of Jeruſalem, being preferred before all the reſt for his near relation to CHRIST; and for the ſame reaſon, we find Simeon choſen to be his immediate ſucceſſor in that ſee, becauſe, after St. James, he was our Lord's next kinſman; a conſideration that made Peter and the two ſons of Zebedee, though they had been peculiarly honoured by our Saviour, not to contend for this high and honourable ſtation, but freely choſe James the Juſt, biſhop of Jeruſalem. This dignity is indeed ſaid by ſome of the ancients to have been conferred on him by CHRIST, who conſtituted him biſhop at the time of his appearing to him: but it is ſafeſt to follow the general opinion, that this dignity was conferred upon him by the apoſtles; though poſſibly they might receive ſome intimations from our Lord concerning it.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL, when he came to Jeruſalem, after his converſion, applied to St. James and was by him honoured with the righthand of fellowſhip: and Peter ſent to St. James the news of his miraculous deliverance out of priſon, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhew theſe things unto James, and to the brethern;</hi> that is, to the whole church, eſpecially to St. James the paſtor of it at that time.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was remarkable active in the ſynod of Jeruſalem, when the great cauſe relating to the Moſaic rites was debated; for the cauſe being opened by Peter, and further debated by Paul and Barnabas, St. James ſtood up to paſs the final decretory ſentence,—That the Gentile converts were not to be loaded with the Jewiſh yoke; a

few indifferent rites only being ordered to be obſerved in order to produce an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation between the Jews and Gentiles, uſhering in the expedient with this poſitive concluſion, "This is my ſentence and determination:" a circumſtance the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, becauſe ſpoken at a time when Peter was in council, and produced not the leaſt intimation of the authority afterwards aſcribed to him.</p>
               <p>ST. JAMES performed every part of his charge with all poſſible care and induſtry, omitting no particular neceſſary to be obſerved by a diligent and faithful guide of ſouls; ſtrengthening the weak, inſtructing the ignorant, reducing the erroneous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the obſtinate; and, by the conſtancy of his ſermons, conquering the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that perverſe and refractory generation he had to deal with, many of the nobler and better ſort being perſuaded to embrace the Chriſtian faith: but a perſon ſo careful, ſo ſucceſsful in his charge, could not fail of awakening the ſpite and malice of his enemies; a ſort of men of whom the apoſtle has given too true a character, that <hi>they pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews being vexed to ſee St. Paul had eſcaped their hands by appealing unto Caeſar, their malice became as great and inſatiable as hell itſelf, ſo that as they could not have their revenge on St. Paul, they turned their fury againſt St. James; but being unable to effect their deſign under the government of Feſtus, they determined to attempt it under the procuratorſhip of Albinus his ſucceſſor, Ananus the younger, of the ſect of the Sadducees, being high-prieſt. They were however fearful that Albinus would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their deſign, and therefore thought it the ſureſt method to diſpatch him, if poſſible, before the new governor arrived. In order to this, a council was ſummoned, and the apoſtle, with others, arraigned and condemned as violat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs of the law: but that the action might appear more plauſible and popular, the Scribes and Phariſees, maſters in the art of diſſimulation, endeavoured to inſnare him, that they had placed the greateſt confidence in him; that the whole nation, as well as they, gave him the title of a juſt man, and one that was no reſpecter of perſons; that they therefore deſired he would correct the error and falſe opinion the people had conceived of JESUS, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the Meſſiah, and take this opportunity of the univerſal confluence to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal ſolemnity, to ſet them right in their opinions in this particular, and would go with them to the top of the temple, where he might be ſeen and heard by all the people.</p>
               <p>TO this the apoſtle readily conſented, and being advantageouſly placed on a pinnacle of the temple, they addreſſed him in the following manner: "Tell us O Juſtus! whom we have all the reaſon in the world to believe, that the people are thus generally led away with the doctrine of JESUS, who was crucified; tell us, what is this inſtitution of the crucified JESUS?" To which the apoſtle anſwered, with an audible voice: "Why do you enquire of JESUS, the Son of man? He ſits in heaven at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, and will come again in the clouds of heaven." The people below hearing this, glorified the bleſſed JESUS, and openly proclaimed, "Hoſanna to the Son of David."</p>
               <p>HEREUPON the Scribes and Phariſees perceived that they had acted fooliſhly; that, inſtead of reclaiming, they had confirmed the people in their error; and that there was no way left but to diſpatch him immediately, in order to warn others, by his ſufferings, not to believe in JESUS of Nazareth: accordingly they ſuddenly cried out, That Juſtus himſelf was ſeduced and become an impoſtor; and immediately threw him from the pinnacle or which he ſtood, into the court below; but not being killed on the ſpot, he recovered himſelf ſo far as to riſe on his knees, and pray fervently to heaven for his murderers: but malice is too diabolical to be pacified with kindneſs, or ſatisfied with cruelty: little portions of revenge ſerve only to enflame it, and rouſe it up to greater

acts of cruelty. Accordingly, his enemies, vexed that they had not fully accompliſhed their work, they poured a ſhower of ſtones upon him, while he was imploring their forgivneſs at the throne of grace; and one of them, more merciful than the reſt, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS great and good man thus finiſhed his courſe in the ninety-ſixth year of his age, and about twenty-four years after our bleſſed Saviour's aſcenſion into heaven. His death was lamented by all good men, even by the ſober and juſt perſons amongſt the Jews themſelves, as Joſephus himſelf confeſſes. He was buried, according to Gregory of Tours, on Mount Olivet, in a tomb he had built for himſelf, and in which he had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Zacharias and old Simeon. Hejeſippus ſays, he was buried in the court of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where he ſuffered martyrdom, and that a monument was there erected to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: but the former ſeems more agreeable to reaſon; for the Jews very rarely buried any perſon in the city, much leſs in the courts of the temple; and therefore, it is not natural to think they would permit that honour to be paid to him they ſo lately put to death as an impoſtor and deceiver.</p>
               <p>ST. JAMES was a man of exemplary piety and devotion, educated under the ſtricteſt rules and inſtitutions of religion, a prieſt of the ancient order of the Rechabites, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Epiphanius conjectures, according to the moſt ancient order and form of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when the ſacerdotal office was the prerogative of the firſt-born; but whether this kind of prieſthood was at any time obſerved under the Moſaic diſpenſation, we are no where told in Sacred Writ; but however that be, it is certain that he had the privilege of entering the ſanctuary, or holy place, when he pleaſed, though none but prieſts of the order of Aaron were permitted to enter there beſides himſelf. Prayer was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant buſineſs and delight; he ſeemed to live upon it, and to have continually his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven; and, therefore, uſed conſtantly to repair into the temple to pray, which he always performed kneeling, and with the greateſt reverence, till by his daily devotions, his knees were become hard and callous like thoſe of a camel. And he who has told us, that <hi>the prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> found it ſo by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, heaven lending a more immediate ear to his petitions; ſo that in a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable drought, on his praying for rain, the clouds melted into fruitful ſhowers, and relived the neceſſities of the people.</p>
               <p>HIS charity towards men was not leſs ſingular than his piety towards God; he did good to all, watched over the ſouls of men, and ſtudied to advance their eternal welfare; his daily errand into the temple was to pray for the happineſs of the people, and that God would not ſeverely reckon with them; he could forgive his moſt inveterate enemies, and overcome evil with good: when thrown from the top of the temple, he made uſe of his lateſt breath in ſending up petitions to heaven for the pardon of his murderers, "I beſeech thee, O Almighty Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was of a remarkable meek and humble temper, honouring what was excellent in others, concealing what was valuable in himſelf: neither the eminency of his relation to the bleſſed JESUS, nor the dignity of the place he ſo worthily filled, could induce him to entertain lofty thoughts of himſelf above the reſt of his brethren; on the contrary, he ſtrove to conceal whatever might place him in a higher rank than the other diſciples of the Lord of glory. Though he was brother to the Redeemer of mankind, he ſtyles himſelf only the ſervant of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; not ſo much as mentioning his being an apoſtle of his divine Maſter.</p>
               <p>HE was a perſon of extraordinary temperance, wholly abſtaining from fleſh, drinking neither wine nor ſtrong drink, and never uſing the bath. His holy and mortified mind
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:029927_0364_0FE339F232C2A8D0"/>
was contented with the meaneſt accommodations; he went bare-foot, and never wore any other than linen garments. He lived indeed after the ſtricteſt rules of the Nazarite order; and as the mitre he wore on his head evinced his prieſthood, which was rather from Malchizedek than Aaron; ſo his never ſhaving his head, or uſing any ointments, his habit and diet, and the great ſeverity of his life, ſhewed him to belong to the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite inſtitution, to which he was conſecrated, even from his mother's womb. A man of ſo divine a temper, that he was at once the love and wonder of his age; and from the reputation of his holy and religious life, was ſtyled <hi>James the Juſt.</hi> He was indeed the ſafety and happineſs of the nation, which was reckoned to depend upon his prayers and intereſt with heaven, and hence he acquired the title of <hi>Oblias,</hi> or <hi>Ozliam,</hi> the <hi>defence and fortreſs of the people;</hi> indicating, that when he was no more, their caſtles would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled and their ſtrength laid level with the ground: and ſo indeed it proved; for a few years after his death, the Roman army broke in upon them, and filled the country with blood and ſlaughter. It is indeed no wonder that the judgments of the Almighty, like a flood, ſhould come rolling in upon a nation, when the ſluices are plucked up, and Moſes taken away that ſtood in the gap to oppoſe them. In ſhort, St. James was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of all good men, and in ſo great favour and eſtimation with the people, that they uſed to flock after him, and ſtrive who ſhould touch, if it were only the border of his garment; his very epiſcopal chair, as Euſebius informs us, wherein he uſed to ſit, was carefully preſerved, and had a kind of veneration paid it, even in his time. He was beloved not only by his friends, but alſo by his enemies, and the Jews themelſves men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion St. James in their Talmud, as a perſon who wrought miracles in the name of JESUS his Maſter; and the wiſeſt of them conſidered his martyrdom as the principal cauſe of all thoſe calamities that ſoon after flowed in upon them. Joſephus in particular reckons the death of St. James, as the action that more immediately rouſed the divine vengeance, and haſtened the univerſal ruin of that nation by the Roman armies.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle wrote only one epiſtle, probably not long before his martyrdom, as appears from ſome paſſages in it relating to the near approach of the deſtruction of the Jews: he directed it to the Jewiſh converts diſperſed up and down thoſe eaſtern countries, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them under their ſufferings, and confirm them againſt error: he ſaw a great degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of manners coming on, and that the purity of the Chriſtian faith began to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the doctrines and practices of the Gnoſtics, who, under pretence of zeal for the legal rites, generally mixed themſelves with the Jews: He beheld libertiniſm flowing in apace, and the way to heaven made ſoft and eaſy, men declaiming againſt good works as uſeleſs and unneceſſary, and aſſerting that a naked belief was ſufficient to ſalvation. Theſe doctrines the apoſtle oppoſes, preſſes the purity, patience, charity, and all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a good life; and by undeniable arguments proves, that ſuch a faith alone, which has CHRIST for its object, and works by love and holineſs, can juſtify us before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and procure our admittance into the celeſtial kingdom of eternal glory.</p>

and reſpect the gravity of his perſon procured him among the reſt of the apoſtles, ſufficiently declare this conjecture to be very far from being improbable.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER being a deſcendant of Abraham, was circumciſed according to the rites of the Moſaic law, and called by his parents, Simon or Simeon, a name at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the Jews: but after his becoming a diſciple of the bleſſed JESUS, the additional title of Cephas was conferred upon him by his Maſter, to denote the firmneſs of his faith; the word Cephas in the Syriac, the common language of the Jews at that time, ſignifying ſtone or rock: and hence he is called in Greek <hi>Petros,</hi> and by us Peter, which appellation bears the ſame meaning.</p>
               <p>THE evangeliſts have alſo been ſilent with regard to the parents of St. Peter, except in telling us, that his father's name was Jonah, probably a fiſherman of Bethſaida: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was his trade, he was highly honoured by our bleſſed Saviour, who choſe two of his ſons, Andrew and Peter, to be his apoſtles, and preachers of the glad-tidings of ſalvation to mankind.</p>
               <p>WHILE young, St. Peter was brought up to the trade of fiſhing on the lake of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida, famous for different kinds of fiſh, which excelled all others in the fineneſs of the taſte. Here he cloſely followed this trade: but afterwards removed to Capernaum, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably on his being married, where he ſettled; for we find he had a houſe there when our Saviour began his public miniſtry, and there he paid tribute.

unlikely that he, who was ſo ready to carry his brother the early tidings of the Meſſiah, that the Son of Righteouſneſs was already riſen in theſe parts, ſhould not be equally ſolicitous to bring him under the diſcipline and influence of John the Baptiſt, the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar which appeared to uſher in the appearance of the Son of God: beſides, Peter's great readineſs and curioſity at the firſt news of CHRIST's appearing, to come to him and converſe with him, ſhews that his expectations had been awakened, and ſome glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>WHETHER Peter was or was not a diſciple of John the Baptiſt, he became acquainted with the immaculate Lamb of God in the following manner: The bleſſed JESUS, having ſpent thirty years in the ſolitude of a private life, had lately been baptiſed by John in Jordan, and there owned by the ſolemn atteſtation of heaven to be the Son of God; whereupon he was immediately hurried into the wilderneſs, and there for forty days maintained a perſonal conteſt with the Devil, but having conquered this great enemy of mankind, he returned to Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptiſing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and endeavouring to anſwer the Jews, who had ſent a deputation to him to enquire concerning the new Meſſiah that appeared among them. To ſatisfy theſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquires of Iſrael, John faithfully related every thing he knew concerning him, gave him the greateſt character, and ſoon after pointed him out to his diſciples; upon which two of them preſently followed the great Redeemer of mankind, one of which was Andrew, Simon's brother. They came to him towards evening, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſtayed with him the whole night, during which time Andrew had an opportunity of informing himſelf, and of ſatisfying his moſt anxious ſcruples.</p>
               <p>HE did not long conceal the joyful diſcovery he had made; for early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he haſtened to acquaint his brother Simon that he had found the Meſſiah. It is not enough to be happy alone; religion is a communicative principle, that like the circles in the water, delights to multiply itſelf, and to diffuſe its influences all around, eſpecially on thoſe whom nature has placed neareſt to us. "I have (ſaid he with rapture to his brother) found that eminent perſon ſo long and ſignally foretold by the prophets, and whom all the devout and pious amongſt the ſons of Jacob ſo earneſtly expected to appear."</p>
               <p>ST. PETER, who was one of thoſe who waited for Redemption in Iſrael, raviſhed with joyful news, and impatient of delay, preſently followed his brother to the place; and, on his arrival, our bleſſed Saviour immediately gave him a proof of his divinity, ſaluting him at firſt ſight by his name, and telling him both who he was, his name and kindred, and what title ſhould ſoon be conferred upon him by the authority of his Maſter.</p>
               <p>WHETHER theſe two ſons of Jonah conſtantly attended in perſon from that time on the great Redeemer of mankind, and became his diſciples, the ſacred hiſtory does not mention. It is however probable, that they ſtayed with him ſome time, till they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the firſt rudiments of his doctrine, and then, by the leave of their great and benevolent Maſter, returned to their families and to their callings; for it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the bleſſed JESUS was not at this time willing to awaken the jealouſly of the rulers of Iſrael, and the ſuſpicion of the Romans, by a numerous retinue, and therefore diſmiſſed his diſciples, amongſt the reſt Andrew and Peter, who returned to their trade of fiſhing on the lake, where they were afterwards found by our bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord had now more than a year entered on his public miniſtry, going into every part of the country, to ſeek opportunities of doing good to the children of men;

ſo that by the conſtancy of his preaching, and the reputation of his miracles, his fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> was ſpread throughout all Judea, and multitudes of people flocked to him from all parts to hear his doctrine, and be ſpectators of his mighty works. And ſurely it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the parched and barren earth thirſted for the kindly dews and ſhowers of heaven, to refreſh it.</p>
               <p>IN order to avoid this prodigious throng of people, our great Redeemer often retired to ſome ſolitary place, to indulge the privacies of contemplation: in one of theſe retreats on the banks of the ſea of Galilee, the multitude found him out, and ran to him from the city. Our Saviour, therefore to avoid the crowd, ſtepped into a fiſhing-boat which lay near the ſhore, and belonged to Simon Peter, who, together with his companions were on ſhore drying their nets, after an unſucceſsful night ſpent in toil and labour. The bleſſed JESUS, who might have commanded, was pleaſed to entreat Peter, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his boat, to thruſt off a little from the land, that he might inſtruct the people, who were gathered in prodigious crowds on the borders of the lake, to hear him.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER gladly complied with the requeſt of his Maſter, who delivered his heavenly doctrine to the people on the ſhore. As ſoon as he had ended his diſcourſe, he reſolved to ſeal his miracles, that the people might be perſuaded he was a <hi>teacher come from God;</hi> accordingly, he ordered Simon to row further from the ſhore, and caſt his net into the ſea. To which Simon anſwered, that they had laboured the whole preceding night, and had taken nothing; and if they could not then ſucceed, there was little hopes of it now, as the day was far leſs proper for fiſhing than the night: but as his Maſter was pleaſed to command, he would readily obey; and, accordingly, he let down his net, when, to the aſtoniſhment both of him and his companions, ſo great a multitude of fiſhes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, that they were obliged to call their partners to their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>AMAZED at this miraculous draught of fiſhes, Simon Peter, in an extacy of admiration, blended with awe and humility, fell proſtrate it his Maſter's feet, acknowledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a vile and ſinful perſon, and thinking himſelf unworthy of being admitted into the preſence of a perſon ſo immediately ſent from God: but the compaſſionate Son of the Moſt High kindly removed his fears, telling him that this miracle was wrought to confirm his faith, and to indicate to him, that the Almighty had appointed a more noble em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for him, that of ſaving the ſouls of the children of men. From this time Peter and his companions became the inſeparable and conſtant diſciples of the great Meſſiah, living under the rules of his inſtitutions and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour returned ſoon after to Capernaum with his diſciples, where they found the mother-in-law of Peter dangerouſly ill of a fever: but the compaſſionate JESUS, who never omitted an opportunity of doing good to the human race, rebuked the diſeaſe, and taking her by the hand, reſtored her in a moment to her former health; demonſtrating at once his power and willingneſs to relieve and comfort the ſons and daughters of affliction and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>THE adorable Redeemer, having for ſome time entered on his public miniſtry, thought proper to elect ſome peculiar perſons from amongſt his followers, to be conſtant wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his miracles and doctrines, and who after his departure, might be intruſted with the care of building his church, and planting that religion in the world, for which he himſelf left the manſions of heaven, and put on the veil of mortality. In order to this, he withdrew privately in the evening to a ſolitary mountain, where he ſpent the night in ſolemn addreſſes to his Almighty Father, for rendering the great work he was going to undertake proſperous and beneficial to mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="unknown:029927_0368_0FE33A01F9D5ADE8"/>THE diſciples came to him early the next morning, out of whom he made choice of twelve to be his apoſtles, and the conſtant attendants on his perſon. Theſe he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inveſted with the power of working miracles, and ſent them into different parts of Judea, in order to carry on with more rapidity the great work which he himſelf had ſo happily begun among the people.</p>
               <p>THE evangeliſts in general, in their enumeration of the apoſtles, conſtantly place St. Peter firſt. Indeed, the age and gravity of his perſon, together with his being firſt called to be an apoſtle, particularly qualified him for being preſident of this ſacred col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege: but we muſt not ſuppoſe that St. Peter was inveſted with any perſonal prerogative above his brethren; none of them ever intimated any ſuch thing; and St. Paul ſays expreſsly, that he himſelf was not inferior to the very chiefeſt apoſtle; for he was not leſs eminent for uſefulneſs than ſucceſs in his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>THIS election had not long taken place, when the bleſſed JESUS, attended by Peter and the two ſons of Zebedee, followed Jairus, a ruler of the ſynagogue, to his houſe, in order to reſtore his daughter, an only child, who lay on the point of death; but before their arrival, a meſſenger arrived with the news that the damſel was dead, and therefore unneceſſary for our Saviour to give himſelf any further trouble: but our Lord bid the ruler not diſpair; for, if he believed, his daughter ſhould yet be reſtored to her former health: and accordingly, on his arrival he took the maid by the hand, and with the power of his word recalled her fleeting ſpirit, which had quitted its earthly tabernacle, and reſtored her again to life and health, in the preſence of her aſtoniſhed friends.</p>
               <p>NO further account of St. Peter, in particular, occurs till the night after our Saviour's miraculouſly feeding the multitude in the wilderneſs. JESUS had ordered his diſciples to take ſhip, and paſs over to the other ſide, while he ſent the multitude away; but a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtorm ariſing, they were in great danger of their lives, when their great Maſter came to them, walking on the ſurface of the boiſterous billows, with the ſame eaſe as if it had been dry ground. At his approach, the diſciples were greatly terrified, ſuppoſing they had ſeen a ſpirit: but their compaſſionate Maſter ſoon diſpelled their fears, by telling them it was he himſelf, and therefore they had no reaſon to be terrified.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER, who was always remarkable for bold reſolutions and precipitate zeal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Maſter to give him leave to come to him on the water; and on obtaining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he left the ſhip, and walked on the ſea to meet his Saviour; but when he heard the deep roar about him, and the waves increaſe, he began to be afraid; and as his faith declined, his body ſunk into the water; ſo that, in the greateſt agony, he called for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to him who was able to ſave: nor was his cry in vain: the compaſſionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankind ſtretched out his hand, and again placed him on the ſurface of the water, with this gentle reproof, <hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> And no ſooner was the bleſſed JESUS and his diſciple entered into the ſhip, than the winds ceaſed, the waves ſubſided, and the ſhip was at the land whither they were going. A miracle of this kind could not fail of aſtoniſhing the diſciples, and convincing them of the divinity of his perſon; accordingly, they drew near, and worſhipped him with this confeſſion, <hi>of a truth thou art the Son of God</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, the next day, entered the ſynagogue of Capernaum; and, from the miracle of the loaves, took occaſion to diſcourſe concerning himſelf, as the true manna, and the <hi>bread which came down from heaven:</hi> opening to them the more ſublime and ſpiritual myſteries, and the neceſſary and important duties of the goſpel. On which, great part of the audience, who expected he was going to erect a temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and re-eſtabliſh the throne of David in Jeruſalem, offended at his repreſenting

               <p>OUR great Redeemer being willing to hear what account his diſciples would give him of the various opinions of the people, aſked them what the world ſaid concerning him? To which they replied, that ſome took him for John the Baptiſt riſen from the dead; ſome thought him to be Elias, and others Jeremiah, or one of the old prophets. This account not ſatisfying our bleſſed Saviour, he told them that it was no wonder that the people, who had ſeldom ſeen him, ſhould form various conjectures concerning him and the doctrine he preached; but as they had been conſtantly with him, heard his ſermons, and been ſpectators of his miracles, it was natural to think they might form a truer idea of him; and, therefore, aſked them what they themſelves thought of him? To which Peter in the name of the reſt, anſwered, <hi>Thou art Chriſt, Son of the living God,</hi> anointed and ſet apart by the Moſt High, to be the great King, Prieſt, and Prophet of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>THIS full and comprehenſive declaration of Peter, ſatisfied the enquiry of our bleſſed Saviour, who anſwered, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-Jonah; for fleſh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven:</hi> that is, this faith which thou haſt now confeſſed, is not human, or built upon the teſtimony of man, but upon thoſe evidences and principles which I was ſent from God to reveal unto the world, and thoſe great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn atteſtations he hath given from heaven to the truth both of my perſon and doctrine: therefore, <hi>I ſay unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> As thy name ſignifies a rock, ſo ſhalt thou prove firm, ſolid, and immovable, in building my church, which ſhall be ſo firmly eſtabliſhed by thy care and diligence to that faith thou haſt now profeſſed, and all the aſſaults of men and devils ſhall not be able to deſtroy, by their utmoſt efforts.</p>
               <p>AT this time the diſciples had no idea that their Maſter was to ſuffer death for the ſins of the world; on the contrary, they conſidered him as immortal, having imbibed the opinion of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>That Chriſt abideth forever:</hi> ſo that when the bleſſed JESUS told them of the ſufferings he muſt undergo at Jeruſalem, what affronts and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities he muſt ſuffer, and be at laſt put to death with all the effects of torture and diſgrace, by a ſentence of the Jewiſh Sanhedrim, St. Peter, who could not endure the thought of his Maſter's ſuffering even the leaſt puniſhment, much leſs thoſe cruelties he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and at laſt death itſelf, interrupted him very unſeaſonably, and ſaid, <hi>Be it far from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, who came down from heaven to give his life a ranſom for the ſins of the world, and who valued the redemption of mankind infinitely more than his own eaſe and ſafety, highly reſented this ſpeech of St. Peter, and accordingly returned this ſharp reproof, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me; thou favoureſt not the things of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi>

               <p>ST. PETER and the two apoſtles were in the mean time fallen aſleep, being either weary for want of natural reſt; or, overpowered with theſe extraordinary appearances, which the frailty and weakneſs of their nature could not ſupport, were fallen into a trance: but on their awaking, were ſtrangely ſurpriſed to ſee their Lord ſurrounded with ſo much glory, and thoſe two great perſons converſing wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They however, remained ſilent till thoſe viſitants from the courts of heaven were going to depart, when Peter, in a rapture and extacy of mind, addreſſed himſelf to his Maſter, declaring their infinite pleaſure and delight in being favoured with this glorious ſpectacle; and deſired his leave to erect three tabernacles, one for him, one for Moſes, and one for Elias; but while he was ſpeaking, a bright cloud ſuddenly overſhaded thoſe two great prophets, and a voice came from it, uttering theſe remarkable words, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> On which the apoſtles were ſeized with the utmoſt conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and fell upon their faces to the ground; but JESUS touching them, bid them diſmiſs their fears and look up with confidence. They immediately obeyed, but ſaw their Maſter only; the others having vaniſhed, together with the cloud of light they had lately beheld.</p>
               <p>THIS heavenly ſcene being ended, our bleſſed Saviour travelled through Galilee with his apoſtles, and at his return to Capernaum, the tax-gatherers came to Peter, and aſked him, whether his Maſter was not obliged to pay tribute. To which Peter readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he did. On his entering the houſe to give his Maſter an account of this demand, JESUS prevented him, by aſking, <hi>What thinkeſt thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take cuſtom or tribute? of their own children, or of ſtrangers?</hi> To which Peter anſwered, not from their ſervants and family, but from ſtrangers. <hi>Then,</hi> replied our Lord, <hi>are the children free.</hi> I myſelf as being the Son of God, and you as my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are free from this tax, yearly paid to God, for repairing his temple at Jeruſalem. But rather than give offence, by ſeeming to deſpiſe the houſe of God, and undervalue that authority which had ſettled this tribute, he determined to pay it, though at the expence of a miracle. Accordingly, he ordered Peter to repair to the ſea with a hook, and take the firſt fiſh that offered, in whoſe mouth he ſhould find a piece of money. The diſciple obeyed, and found the money as his Maſter had foretold, and gave to the gatherers of the tribute for his Maſter and himſelf, as their proportion of it.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour having entered the city of Jeruſalem in triumph, he repaired to Bethany; from whence he ſent two of his diſciples, Peter and John, to make preparation for his celebrating the paſſover before his death.</p>
               <p>PREPARATION being made, the great Redeemer and his apoſtles entered the houſe, and ſet down at table. But their great Maſter, who often taught them by example as well as precept, aroſe from his ſeat, laid aſide his upper garment, took a towel, and pouring water into a baſon, began to waſh his diſciples' feet, to teach them humility and charity by his own example. But on his coming to Peter, he would by no means admit his Maſter to perform ſo mean and condeſcending an office. What! the Son of God
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:029927_0371_0FE33A109CA0A0E8"/>
ſtoop to waſh the feet of a ſinful mortel! A thought which ſhocked the apoſtle, who ſtrenuouſly declared, <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet.</hi> But the bleſſed JESUS told him, that if he waſhed him not, he could have no part with him; meaning that this action was myſtical, and ſignified the remiſſion of ſins, and the purifying virtue of the ſpirit of the Moſt High, to be poured upon all true Chriſtians. This anſwer ſufficiently removed the ſcruples of Peter, who cried out, <hi>Lord, not my feet only, but alſo my hands and my head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE dear Redeemer now began the inſtitution of his ſupper, that great and ſolemn inſtitution, which he reſolved to leave behind him, to be conſtantly celebrated in his church, as a ſtanding monument and memorial of his love in dying for mankind; telling them at the ſame time, that he himſelf was now going to leave them, and that whither he went, they could not come. Peter, not well underſtanding what he meant, aſked him whither he was going? To which our bleſſed Lord replied, that he was going to that place, whither he could not now, but ſhould hereafter follow him; intimating the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom he was to ſuffer for his Maſter's religion. Peter anſwered, that he was ready to follow him, even if it required him to lay down his life. This confident preſumption was not at all agreeable to the bleſſed JESUS, who told him he had promiſed great things, but would be ſo far from performing them, that before the cock crew twice, that is before three in the morning, he would deny his Maſter thrice.</p>
               <p>HAVING now ended ſupper, they ſung an hymn, and departed to the Mount of Olives; where JESUS again put them in mind how greatly the things he was going to ſuffer would offend them. To which Peter replied, that <hi>though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this they repaired to the garden of Gethſemane; and leaving the reſt of the apoſtles near the entrance, our bleſſed Saviour, taking with him Peter, James, and John, retired into the more ſolitary parts of the garden, to enter on the preparatory ſcene of the great tragedy that was now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igh at hand.</p>
               <p>THE bleſſed JESUS at this awful juncture laboured under the bittereſt agony that human nature ſuffered, during which he prayed with the utmoſt fervency to his almighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>offering up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong cryings and tears; and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</hi> While our great Redeemer was thus interceding with the Almighty, his three diſciples were fallen aſleep, though he had made three ſeveral viſits to them; calling to Peter, aſked him, if he could not watch one hour with him? adviſing them all to watch and pray, that they might not enter into temptation, adding, <hi>The ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DURING our Lord's converſation with them, a band of ſoldiers from the chief prieſts and elders, preceeded by the traitor Judas to conduct and direct them, ruſhed into the garden, and ſeized the great High-Prieſt of our profeſſion. Peter, whoſe ungovernable zeal would admit of no reſtaint, drew his ſword, and, without the leaſt order from his Maſter, ſtruck at one of the perſons who ſeemed to be remarkably buſy in binding JESUS, and cut off his right ear. This wild and unwarrantable zeal was very offenſive to his Maſter, who rebuked Peter, and entreated the patience of the ſoldiers, while he healed the wound by a miracle.</p>
               <p>THE fidelity of the apoſtles, which they had urged with ſo much confidence, was now put to the trial. They ſaw their Maſter in the hands of a rude and inconſiderate band of men; and therefore ſhould have exerted their power to releaſe him, or at leaſt have been the companions of his ſufferings, and endeavoured, by every kind and endearing action, to have leſſened his grief. But, alas! inſtead of aſſiſting or comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſter, they all forſook him and fled,—from innocence in diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="unknown:029927_0372_0FE33A122135A5E0"/>HEREUPON the ſoldiers who had bound JESUS led him away, delivered him to the chief prieſts and elders, who carried him from one tribunal to another; firſt to Annas, and then to Caiaphas, where the Jeweſh Sanhedrim were aſſembled, in order to try and condemn him to death.</p>
               <p>PETER, who in the mean time had followed the other diſciples in their flight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſpirits, and encouraged by his companion St. John, returned to ſeek his Maſter; and ſeeing him leading to the high-prieſt's hall followed at a diſtance, to know the event: but on his coming to the door he was refuſed admittance, till one of the diſciples probably St. John, who was acquainted there, came out, and prevailed on the ſervant who kept the door to let him in. Peter being admitted, repaired to the fire burning in the middle of the hall, round which the officers and ſervants were ſtanding; where being obſerved by the maid-ſervant who let him in, ſhe charged him with being one of CHRIST's diſciples; but Peter publickly denied the charge, declaring that he did not know him, and preſently withdrew into a porch, where he heard the cock crow: an intimation ſeemingly ſufficient to have awakened his conſcience into a quick ſence of his duty, and the promiſe he had a few hours before made to his Maſter. But, alas! human nature when left to itſelf, is remarkably frail and inconſtant. This Peter ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently experienced; for while he continued in the porch, another maid met him, and charged him with being one of the followers of JESUS of Nazareth; which Peter ſtiffly denied, and, the better to gain belief, uttered an oath, to confirm his aſſertion.</p>
               <p>NEARLY an hour after this, the ſervant of the high-prieſt (he whoſe ear Peter had cut off) charged him with being a diſciple of CHRIST, and that he himſelf had ſeen him in the garden with him; adding, that his very ſpeech proved him to be a Galilean. Peter, however, ſtill denied the fact; and to add the higheſt accompliſhment to his ſins, ratified it, not only by an oath, but a ſolemn curſe and execration, that he was not the perſon, that he knew not the man. But no ſooner had he uttered this denial, than the cock crew. At which his maſter turned about, and earneſtly looked upon him: a look that pierced him to the heart, and brought to his remembrance what his Saviour more than once foretold, that he would baſely and ſhamefully deny him. Peter was now no longer able to contain his ſorrow; he fled from the palace of the high-prieſt, and wept bitterly, paſſionately bewailing his folly, and the aggrevations of his ſin; endeavouring thereby to make ſome reparation for his apoſtacy, and recover the the favour of heaven, and prevent the execution of divine juſtice, by taking a ſevere revenge upon himſelf for his crime.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER's fall ſhould convince us of the miſerable frailty even of the beſt of men, and effectually ſubdue thoſe vain confidences which are apt to riſe in our hearts from our own ſuppoſed ſtrength and virtue; for as this great diſciple fell in ſo ſcandalous a manner, we ſhall hereafter care to depend upon the higheſt degree of knowledge, when one ſo wiſe, ſo perfectly ſatisfied of the truth of the Chriſtian doctrine, was after the fulleſt convictions of his own conſcience, ſo weak and frail as to deny and abjure his Lord who inſtructed and bought him, even at the price of his own blood? Who ſhall preſume upon his beſt reſolutions, when he who declared ſo firm a purpoſe of adhearing to JESUS, did within a few hours peremptorily and ſolemnly diſown that very perſon for whoſe ſake he was lately ready and diſpoſed to lay down his life.</p>
               <p>FROM this example we ſhould alſo remember the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in cauſing the faults and infirmities of his faints to be recorded in the Holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the uſe we ought to make of their failings and temptations. Their eminent virtues, and their as eminent repentance where they did amiſs, are written as a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:029927_0373_0FE33A13E375DD98"/>
warning, and exhibit an inſtance of humiliation to all future ages; by letting us ſee, that the moſt perfect are but men, ſubject to blemiſhes and imperfections: and that the higheſt and pureſt ſtate is no ſecurity from danger. This ſhould make us very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how we judge and diſpiſe our brethern; whoſe faults, however ſeverely we may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, might probably have been our own had we been in their circumſtances and ſurrounded with their temptations: for <hi>let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> We ſhould not then promiſe ourſelves ſafety and freedom from temptations in any circumſtances in life; or ſo far preſume on our own virtue, as to think we are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of committing the blackeſt crimes, ſhould the Almighty withdraw his grace, and leave us to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>WE have no account whether St. Peter, after the denial of his Maſter, retired into ſome ſolitary place to give vent to his grief and indulge his tears: or whether he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Saviour through the ſeveral ſtages of his trial, and perſonally attended as a mourner at the funeral of his Maſter. But however that be, he ſtaid at Jeruſalem, or, at leaſt, in the neighbourhood, and probably with St. John; for when Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene returned from the ſepulchre, to inform the diſciples that the ſtone was rolled away from the door, and the body not to be found, Peter and John ſet out immediately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the garden. John who was the younger arrived firſt at the ſepulchre, looked into it, but did not enter, either out of fear, or a reverence to his Saviour.</p>
               <p>PETER, whoſe zeal was greatly increaſed, came ſoon after, and reſolutely went into the ſepulchre where he found the linen cloths lying together in one place, the napkin that was about his head wrapped together in another; a ſufficient indication that the body was not ſtolen away: for had that been the caſe ſo much care and order would not have been obſerved in diſpoſing of the linen cloths. But he did not wait long in ſuſpence with regard to his great Lord and Maſter; for the ſame day, and probably about noon, JESUS appeared to him; perhaps in compaſſion to his ſorrow, in which he was overwhelmed for his late ſhameful denial of his Maſter. And as he was the firſt of the diſciples who had made a ſignal confeſſion of the divinity of the Meſſiah, ſo it was reaſonable he ſhould firſt ſee him after his reſurerction; and, at the ſame time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that the crime he had been guilty of in denying him was pardoned, and that he was come, like the good Samaritan, to pour oil into his wounded conſcience, and adminiſter comfort to his afflicted ſoul.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtles ſoon after prepared to obey the command of their great Maſter, of retiring into Galilee; and we find that Peter, Nathaniel, the two ſons of Zebedee, and two other diſciples, returned to their old trade of fiſhing on the lake. One morning early, as they were labouring at their employment, having ſpent the whole night to no purpoſe, they ſaw on the ſhore a grave perſon (perhaps in the habit of a traveller) who called to them, and aſked if they had any meat? To which they anſwered No. Caſt then, replied he, the net on the right ſide of the ſhip, and ye ſhall find. They followed his directions, and encloſed a prodigious number of large fiſh. Aſtoniſhed at ſuch remarkable ſucceſs, the diſciples looked one upon another for ſome time, till St. John told Peter, that the perſon on the ſhore, was doubtleſs their great Lord and Maſter, whom the winds, the ſea, and the inhabitants of the watery region, were ſo ready to yield obedience to.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER no ſooner heard the beloved diſciple declare his opinion, concerning the ſtranger, than his zeal took fire, and, notwithſtanding the coolneſs of the ſeaſon, girt on his fiſher's coat, threw himſelf into the ſea, and ſwam to ſhore; his impatience to be with his Lord and Maſter, not ſuffering him to ſtay the few minutes neceſſary to bring the ſhip to the ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="unknown:029927_0374_0FE33A1C59896250"/>AS ſoon as the diſciples came on land, they found a fire kindled, and fiſh laid upon it, either immediately created by the power of their divine Maſter, or that came aſhore of its own accord, and offered itſelf to his hand: but notwithſtanding there were fiſh already on the fire, he ordered them to bring of thoſe they had now caught, and dreſs them for their repaſt, he himſelf eating with them; both to give them an inſtance of mutual love and friendſhip, and alſo to aſſure them of the truth of his human nature, ſince he was riſen from the dead, as they now beheld.</p>
               <p>THE repaſt being ended, our bleſſed Saviour addreſſed himſelf particularly to St. Peter, urging him to the utmoſt diligence in his care of ſouls; and becauſe he knew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſincere love to himſelf could ſupport him under the troubles and dangers of ſo laborious and difficult an employment, he inquired of him whether he loved him more than the reſt of the apoſtles; mildly reproving him for his over-confident reſolution. Peter, whom fatal experience had taught humility, modeſtly anſwered, that none knew ſo well as himſelf the integrity of his affections; thou knoweſt the hearts of all men, nothing is hid from thee, and therefore thou knoweſt that I love thee. The queſtion was three ſeveral times repeated by our bleſſed Saviour, and as many times anſwered by the apoſtle: it being but juſt that he, who by a threefold denial, had given ſo much reaſon to queſtion his affection, ſhould now, by a threefold confeſſion, give more than common aſſurance of his ſincere love for his Maſter; and to each of theſe confeſſions, our great Redeemer added this ſignal trial of his affection, <hi>Feed my ſheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR dear Lord having thus engaged Peter to a cheerful compliance with dangers that might attend the diſcharge of his office, particularly intimated to him the fate that would attend him; telling him, that when he was young, he girt himſelf, lived at his pleaſure, and went wherever his fancy directed him; but when he ſhould reach the term of old age, he ſhould ſtretch forth his hands, and another ſhould gird him, and bind him, and lead him, whither he had no deſire to go; intimating, as the evangeliſts tell us, by what death he ſhould glorify God, and ſeal the truth with his blood.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER was not averſe to drinking the bitter cup, and making his confeſſion as public as his denial, that he might thereby teſtify the ſincerity of his ſorrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition for his great offence. And ſeeing John following, he aſked his great Maſter what ſhould be his fate, and whether he, who had been the object of his Maſter's love in his life-time, ſhould not have as honourable a death as he that had denied him? To which JESUS replied, it doth not concern thee to know how I ſhall diſpoſe of events with regard to him; he ſhall ſee the deſtruction of the Jewiſh nation, and then go down in peace to the chambers of the duſt.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour ſoon after appeared to his diſciples at Jeruſalem, and take his laſt farewell of them, who had conſtantly attended him during his miniſtry amongſt the ſons of men. He now led them out as far as Bethany; a ſmall village on Mount Olivet, where he briefly told them, that they were the perſons he had choſen to be the witneſſes both of his death and reſurrection; a teſtimony which they ſhould publiſh in every part of the world: in order to which, he would, after his aſcenſion into heaven, pour out his ſpirit upon them in an extraordinary manner, that they might be the better enabled to ſtruggle with that violent rage and fury with which the doctrine of the goſpel would be oppoſed by men and devils; adding, that in the mean time they ſhould return to Jeruſalem, and there wait till thoſe miraculous powers were given from on high. This diſcourſe being finiſhed, he laid hands upon them, and gave them his ſolemn benediction; during which he was taken from them, and received up unto the regions of the heavenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="unknown:029927_0375_0FE33A1EE3752600"/>OUR glorious Redeemer having left this vale of miſery, and aſcended into the bliſsful habitations of immortality, the apoſtles began to act in conformity to the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they had received from him. The firſt object that engaged their attention after their return to Jeruſalem, was to fill up the vacancy in their college, lately made by the unhappy fall and apoſtacy of Judas. In order to this they called together the church, and entered into an upper room, where Peter, as preſident of the aſſembly, propoſed to them the choice of a new apoſtle. He put them in mind that Judas, one of the diſciples of their great and beloved Maſter, being betrayed by his covetous and inſatiable temper, had lately fallen from the honour of his place and miniſtry; that this was no more than what the prophet had long ſince foretold ſhould come to paſs; and that the care of the church which had been committed to him, ſhould devolve upon another; that therefore it was highly neceſſary that ſome perſon who had been familiarly converſant with the bleſſed JESUS, from firſt to laſt, and conſequently, a competent witneſs both of his doctrine and miracles, his death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, ſhould be ſubſtituted in his room, and appointed to that high office. In order to which, two candidates were propoſed, Joſeph, called Barſabas, and Matthias, both qualified for the great and important office of the apoſtleſhip; and having prayed that the Divine Providence would immediately guide and direct their choice, they caſt lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, who was accordingly admitted into the number of the twelve apoſtles of our Lord.</p>
               <p>THIS vacancy being filled up in the apoſtolic college, they ſpent their time in prayer and meditation, till the feaſt of Pentecoſt; when the promiſe of their great Maſter in ſending the Holy Ghoſt was fulfilled. The Chriſtian aſſembly were met as uſual, to perform the public ſervices of their worſhip, when ſuddenly a ſound, like that of a mighty wind, ruſhed in upon them, repreſenting the powerful efficacy of that Divine Spirit which was now to be communicated to them; after which there appeared ſmall flames of fire, which, in the ſhape of cloven tongues, deſcended, and ſat upon the head of each of them, to denote that their enjoyment of this gift ſhould be conſtant and perpetual, and not like the prophets of old, who were inſpired only at ſome particular times and ſeaſons: upon which they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, which, in an inſtant, enabled them to ſpeak fluently ſeveral languages they had never learned, and probably never heard till this time.</p>
               <p>AS this ſurpriſing tranſaction had different effects on the minds of the audience, ſome conſidering it as the effect of a miracle, and others to the power and ſtrength of new wine; the apoſtles thereupon all ſtood up, and Peter, in the name of the reſt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to confute this injurious calumny: he told them that this ſcandalous ſlander pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the ſpirit of malice and falſehood; that their cenſure was as uncharitable as it was unjuſt; that it was early in the morning, and therefore not a time for drinking, eſpecially on a day ſet apart for devotion; that theſe extraordinary and miraculous effects were but the accompliſhment of an ancient prophecy, which the Almighty had expreſsly declared ſhould be fulfilled in the times of the Meſſiah; that JESUS of Nazareth had evidently proved himſelf to be that great prophet, the Son of the Moſt High, by many unqueſtionable miracles, of which they themſelves had been eye-witneſſes; and though, by the permiſſion of Omnipotence, who had determined by this means, to bring about the redemption of mankind, they had wickedly crucified and ſlain him, yet God had raiſed him from the dead.</p>
               <p>THOUGH this was the firſt diſcourſe that St. Peter ever made in public, it deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the audience, and every word, like a dagger, pierced them to the heart; ſo that they cried out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> To which Peter anſwered, "The
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:029927_0376_0FE33A206AE47FD0"/>
only way to expiate your guilt, and obtain pardon for the ſins you have committed, and acquire the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, is to repent ſincerely, and be baptized into the religion of this crucified Saviour."</p>
               <p>A ſhort time after this wonderful converſation, Peter and John going up to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about three in the afternoon, near the concluſion of one of the ſolemn hours of prayer, they ſaw a poor impotent cripple near forty years of age, who had been lame from his birth, lying at the beautiful gate of the temple, and aſking alms of thoſe who entered the ſacred edifice. This miſerable object moved their compaſſion; and Peter beholding him with attention, ſaid, "The riches of this world, the ſilver and gold ſo highly coveted by the ſons of men, are not in my power to beſtow; but I poſſeſs the power of reſtoring life and health, and am ready to aſſiſt thee." Then taking the man by the hand, commanded him in the name of JESUS of Nazareth to riſe up and walk. Immediately the nerves and ſinews were enlarged, and the ſeveral parts of the diſeaſed members performed their natural tranſactions: upon which the man accompanied them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praiſing God for his cure.</p>
               <p>AN event ſo ſtrange and extraordinary, filled the minds of the people with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their curioſity drew them round the apoſtles to view the men who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it. Peter, ſeeing the multitude gathering round them took the opportunity of ſpeaking to them in the following manner: "Men and brethren, this remarkable cure ſhould not excite your admiration of us, as if we had performed it by our own power; it was wrought in the name of JESUS of Nazareth, our crucified Maſter, by the power of that very CHRIST, that holy and juſt Perſon, whom you yourſelves denied, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Pilate, nay, and preferred a murderer before him, when the governor was deſirous of letting him go: but though you have put him to death, yet we are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that he hath raiſed him again from the dead, and that he is aſcended into heaven, where he will remain till the great and tremendous day of general reſtitution."</p>
               <p>WHILE Peter was ſpeaking to the people in one part of the temple, John was, in all probability, doing the ſame in the other: and the ſucceſs plainly indicated how powerfully the preaching of the apoſtles was; five thouſand perſons embracing the doctrine of the goſpel, and acknowledging the crucified JESUS for their Lord and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>THE attention and envy of the rulers of Iſrael could not fail of being excited at ſuch amazing ſucceſs from the preaching of the apoſtles; accordingly, the prieſts and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees repaired to the Roman magiſtrate, and intimated to him, that, in all probability, this concourſe of people would prove the cauſe of a tumult and inſurrection. Upon this information, the captain of the temple ſeized on the apoſtles, and caſt them into priſon. The next day they were carried before the Jewiſh Sanhedrim: and being aſked by what power and authority they had done this, Peter boldly anſwered, "Be it known unto you and to all the deſcendants of Jacob, that this miracle was wrought wholly in the name of JESUS of Nazareth, whom ye yourſelves have crucified and ſlain, and whom the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath raiſed again from the dead. This is the ſtone which you builders refuſed, and which is become the head of the corner: nor is there any other way by which you, or any of the ſons of men can be ſaved, but by this crucified Saviour, the Lord JESUS CHRIST."</p>
               <p>AFTER beholding the apoſtles with a kind of aſtoniſhment, the court remembered that they had ſeen them with JESUS of Nazareth, and therefore ordered them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, whilſt they debated amongſt themſelves what was proper to be done: it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deny the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acle, for it was performed before all the people, and the perſon on whom it was wrought, no ſtranger in Jeruſalem. They therefore reſolved to charge
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:029927_0377_0FE33A21F14B5E98"/>
them ſtrictly not to preach any more in the name of JESUS: accordingly, they were again called in, and acquainted with the reſolution of the council: to which the apoſtles anſwered, "That as they had received a commiſſion from heaven, to declare to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions what they had ſeen and heard, it was certainly their duty to obey God rather than man."</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH this was a fair appeal to the conſciences of their very judges; yet theſe rulers of Iſrael, inſtead of being ſatisfied with it, would in all probability have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a greater violence, had not the peoples' veneration for the apoſtles checked their malice; ſo that all they dared to do, was to enforce their menaces, and ſuffer them to depart.</p>
               <p>THIS intrepidity of the apoſtles had the deſired effect; the church increaſed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: and that ſo great a company, eſpecially the poor and needy, might be maintained, the profeſſors of the religion of the holy JESUS ſold their eſtates, and brought the money to the apoſtles, that they might depoſit it in one common treaſury, and from thence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſeveral exigences of their poor brethren.</p>
               <p>WE find, however, that hypocriſy was not unknown amongſt the profeſſors of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, even in theſe primitive times. Ananias and his wife Sapphira, having embraced the doctrine of the goſpel, pretended to follow the free and generous ſpirit of theſe times, by conſecrating and devoting their eſtate to the honour of God, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the church. Accordingly, they ſold their poſſeſſions, and brought part of the money and laid it at the apoſtles' feet; hoping to deceive them, though guided by the ſpirit of Omnipotence: but Peter, at his firſt coming in, aſked Ananias how he could ſuffer Satan to fill his heart with ſuch enormous wickedneſs, as to think to deceive the Holy Ghoſt? That before it was ſold, it was wholly in his own power; and afterwards the money entirely at his own diſpoſal: ſo that this action was capable of no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, than that he had not only abuſed and injured man, but mocked the Almighty himſelf, who he muſt know was privy to the moſt ſecret thoughts of his heart.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner had the apoſtles finiſhed, than Ananias, to the great terror of all that were preſent, fell down dead by a ſtroke from heaven; and not long after his wife came in, whom Peter reproved in the ſame manner he had done her huſband, adding, that ſhe ſhould immediately end her life in the ſame awful manner; upon which ſhe was ſmitten by the hand of Omnipotence, and fell down dead; ſharing with her huſband in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as ſhe had before in the heinous crime.</p>
               <p>THIS remarkable inſtance of ſeverity, filled all the converts with fear and trembling, and prevented in a great meaſure, that hypocriſy and diſſimulation, by which others might flatter themſelves to deceive the church. But ſuch inſtances of ſeverity were very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; the power of the apoſtles was generally exerted in works of mercy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence towards the ſons and daughters of affliction: they cured all kinds of diſeaſes, and caſt out devils; ſo that they brought the ſick into the ſtreets, and laid them on beds and couches, that the ſhadow, at leaſt of Peter as he paſſed by, might cover ſome of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well knowing, a ſingle touch or word from either of the apoſtles was ſufficient to remove a diſeaſe of the moſt inveterate nature.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, theſe ſtupendous works of the apoſtles, and the growing numbers of the church alarmed the rulers of Iſrael, who ſeized the apoſtles and caſt them into priſon. Their power, however, was limited, and like the drop of a bucket to the ocean, when oppoſed to the Almighty arm of the great Jehovah. The priſon doors, though faſtened
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:029927_0378_0FE33A2CE2345900"/>
with the utmoſt caution, opened of themſelves at the approach of a meſſenger from the court of heaven, who commanded the apoſtles to leave the dungeon, repair to the temple, and preach the glad-tidings of the goſpel to the people in Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>WHEN the officers returned in the morning, they found the priſon doors ſhut and guarded, but the priſoners gone. This remarkable circumſtance greatly alarmed them, and they repaired to the council to acquaint them with what had happened. The rulers were aſtoniſhed at the news; but hearing that the apoſtles were teaching in the temple, they ſent an officer to bring them, without the leaſt violence to their perſons, before the Sanhedrim. Their orders were ſoon obeyed, and the diſciples of JESUS placed before the ſame court, by which their Maſter had been ſo lately condemned.</p>
               <p>BEING thus brought before the Sanhedrim, the high-prieſt aſked the apoſtles how they dared to propagate a doctrine they had lately ſo ſtrictly charged them not to preach: to which Peter, in the name of the reſt replied, "We certainly ought to obey God rather than man; and though you have ſo barbarouſly and contumeliouſly treated the Saviour of the world, yet God hath raiſed him up to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give both repentance and remiſſion of ſins: and of theſe things both we are witneſſes, together with the miraculous powers which the Holy Ghoſt hath conferred on all Chriſtians."</p>
               <p>AS the apoſtles delivered this anſwer with remarkable boldneſs, it exaſperated the council, and they began to conſult how they might deſtroy them: but Gamaliel, a grave and learned counſellor, after commanding the apoſtles to withdraw, deſired them to proceed with caution in an affair of this nature; reminding them, that ſeveral perſons had already raiſed parties, and drawn great numbers of perſons after them; but that every one of them had miſcarried, and all their deſigns were rendered abortive without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of that court. That they would therefore do well to let the apoſtles alone; for if their doctrines and deſigns were of human invention, they would come to nothing; but if they were of God, all their powers and policy would be of no effect.</p>
               <p>THE council were ſatisfied with this prudent and rational advice, and after commanding the apoſtles to be ſcourged, they ſtrictly charged them to preach no more in the name of JESUS, and ſet them at liberty: but this charge had little effect on the diſciples of the bleſſed JESUS; they returned home in triumph, rejoicing that they were thought worthy to ſuffer in ſo righteous a cauſe, and to undergo ſhame and reproach for ſo kind and ſo powerful a Maſter.</p>
               <p>HITHERTO the church at Jeruſalem had been toſſed with gentle ſtorms, but now it was overtaken by a more violent tempeſt, which commenced with the death of the proto-martyr Stephen, and was now carried on with greater violence; nor did it end but with the diſperſion of the diſciples, by which means, the glad-tidings of the goſpel, which had till then been confined to Judea, and the profeſſors of it hid in ſecret places, was now preached to the Gentile world, and an ancient prophecy fulfilled, which ſays, <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus does the Almighty bring good out of evil, and cauſe the malicious intentions of the wicked to redound to his praiſe, in the further ſpreading of the truth.</p>
               <p>THE followers of the bleſſed JESUS being thus diſperſed, Philip, the deacon, retired to Samaria, where he preached the goſpel, and confirmed his doctrine by many miraculous cures, and caſting out devils. In this city was one Simon, who, by magic arts and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical ſorceries, was beheld with admiration by the people; and ſome conſidered him as the <hi>great power of God;</hi> a name he blaſphemouſly gave himſelf, pretending to be the firſt and chief deity, or what every nation conſidered as the ſupreme God. This wicked
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:029927_0379_0FE33B4670B48180"/>
mortal, hearing the ſermons of Philip, and beholding the miracles wrought by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a convert to the religion of JESUS, and was baptiſed with the others who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL of the apoſtles who continued at Jeruſalem, were ſoon informed of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſucceſs of Philip's miniſtry at Samaria, and thought it neceſſary to ſend him aſſiſtance. Accordingly, Peter and John were deputed to this infant church, who having prayed and laid their hands on the new converts, they received the Holy Ghoſt. Such miraculous gifts aſtoniſhed the magician, and deſirous of obtaining the ſame privilege, he offered the diſciples money to inveſt him with this power, that on whomſoever he laid his hands he might receive the Holy Ghoſt; but Peter, who perceived the inſincerity of his heart, rejected his offer with ſcorn and deteſtation. "<hi>Thy money,</hi> ſaid that great apoſtle, <hi>periſh with thee.</hi> And as thy heart is full of hypocriſy and deceit, thou canſt have no ſhare nor portion in ſo great a privilege. Thou wouldeſt do well to repent for ſo monſtrous a crime, and ſincerely apply thyſelf to ſeek the Almighty, that the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thy temper and diſpoſition of mind is ſtill vicious and corrupt, and that thou art yet bound by the chains of iniquity, and in a ſtate diſpleaſing to the Almighty, and dangerous to the welfare of thy own ſoul."</p>
               <p>THIS ſpeech of St. Peter terrified Simon, his conſcience flew in his face, and he prayed the apoſtles to make interceſſion for him to the throne of grace, that the Almighty might pardon his ſin, and not inflict on him thoſe heavy judgments they had denounced.</p>
               <p>AFTER this violent ſtorm, the church enjoyed a time of calmneſs and ſerenity; during which St. Peter went to viſit the churches lately planted in thoſe parts, by the diſciples whom the perſecution had diſperſed: and at his arrival at Lydda, he miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly healed Eneas, who had been afflicted with the palſy, and confined to his bed eight years; but on Peter's bidding him ariſe in the name of JESUS, he was immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to perfect health. Nor was the ſucceſs of this miracle confined to Eneas and his family, the fame of it being blazed through all the neighbouring country, and many believed in the doctrine of the Son of God. It was even known at Joppa, a ſea-port town, about ſix miles from Lydda; and the brethren immediately ſent for Peter, on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing melancholy occaſion: Tibatha, whoſe Greek name was Dorcas, a woman vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for her piety and extenſive charity, was newly dead, to the great loſs of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind who loved the paths of virtue, eſpecially the poor and afflicted, who were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by her benevolence.</p>
               <p>WHEN St. Peter arrived, he found her dreſſed for her funeral ſolemnity, and ſurrounded by mournful widows, who ſhewed the coats and garments wherewith ſhe had clothed them, the monuments of her liberality: but Peter put them all out, and kneeling down, prayed with the utmoſt fervency; then turning to the body, he commanded her to ariſe, and taking her by the hand, preſented her in perfect health to her friends and others, who were aſſembled to pay their laſt duties to ſo good a woman. This miracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed thoſe who newly embraced the goſpel of JESUS, and converted many more to the faith. After which, he ſtayed a conſiderable time here, and lodged in the houſe of Simon a Tanner, at Joppa.</p>
               <p>WHILE he abode in this city, one day, when he was offering up his prayers to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he found himſelf hungry, and called for meat; but while it was dreſſing for him, he fell into a trance, wherein was preſented to him a large ſheet let down from heaven, containing all ſorts of creatures, clean and unclean; and at the ſame time a voice ſaid to him, <hi>Ariſe Peter, kill and eat</hi>: but the apoſtle, as yet tenacious of the rites and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:029927_0380_0FE33A998E0AA678"/>
of the Moſaic law, anſwered, that his conſcience refuſed to comply, having never eaten any thing that was common or unclean. To which the voice replied, "That it was unjuſt to conſider that as common which God had cleanſed." This was done thrice, after which the veſſel was again drawn up to heaven, and the viſion diſappeared. By this ſymbolical repreſentation, St. Peter was given to underſtand, that the Almighty was now going to ſend him on a new embaſſy, which the Spirit at the ſame time command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to undertake. While he was ſtill wondering with himſelf what the event could prove, three meſſengers knocked at the gate, enquiring for him; and from them he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following account: That Cornelius, a Roman captain of a band of Italian ſoldiers at Ceſarea, a perſon of great piety and religion, one who had been long a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte of the gate, had ſent for him, by an immediate command from God. Peter accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome of the brethren, went the next day with the meſſengers, and ſoon after arrived at Ceſarea.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS having information of his coming, had ſummoned his friends and kindred to Ceſarea; and at the apoſtle's entering his houſe, fell at his feet, a method of addreſs frequent in the Eaſtern countries; but Peter, who conſidered that honour as due only to the Almighty, lifted him up, and declared to the company the reaſon of his coming, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had lately learned, that with God there was no reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as the apoſtle had ended his ſpeech, Cornelius, at his requeſt, related the particular reaſon for his ſending for him. "Four days ago, ſaid this Roman officer, being converſant in the duties of faſting and prayer, an angel from the courts of heaven appeared to me, declaring that my prayers and alms were come up as a memorial before the throne of the Moſt High; and at the ſame time, ordered me to ſend to Jop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, for one Simon Peter, who lodged at the houſe of a Tanner near the ſea-ſides, who would give me further information in the duties of religion. Accordingly, I made no heſitation to obey the Heavenly meſſenger, but ſent immediately for thee."</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle was at firſt aſtoniſhed at this relation of the centurion; but he was ſoon convinced that God had broken down the partition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wall, and no longer maintained a peculiar kindneſs for the ſons of Jacob; that it was not the nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the religion; not the external quality of the man, but the internal temper of the mind, that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the human race to the favour of Omnipotence: that the devout and pious, the righteous and the good man, whatever part of the earth he may inhabit, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the favourite of heaven; that God as highly reſpects a juſt and virtuous man in the barren waſtes of Scythia, as on the mountain of Sion; that the reconciling and making peace between God and man by JESUS CHRIST, was the doctrine publiſhed by the prophets of old; and that God had now anointed and conſecrated JESUS of Nazareth with divine power, in the exerciſe whereof he went about doing good to the children of men.</p>
               <p>AT the time that Peter was thus preaching to them, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the greateſt part of his hearers, enabling them to ſpeak ſeveral languages, and in them to magnify the great Creator of the ſons of men. At this the Jews, who accompanied Peter, marvelled exceedingly, to ſee that the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were poured upon the Gentiles; and Peter ſeeing this, told the company, that he knew no reaſon why theſe perſons ſhould not be baptized, as they had received the Holy Ghoſt as well as them; and, accordingly, he gave orders that they ſhould be baptized; and, to confirm them in the holy faith they had embraced, he tarried ſome time with them.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus finiſhed his viſitation to the new-planted churches, Peter returned to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and was indefatigable in inſtructing the converts in the religion of JESUS, and
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:029927_0381_0FE33A9B15B023A8"/>
preaching the glad-tidings of ſalvation to the deſcendants of Jacob: but he did not long continue in this pleaſing courſe; Herod Agrippa, in order to ingratiate himſelf into the favour of the Jews, put St. James to death, and finding the action was highly accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that ſtiff-necked people, he reſolved to extend his cruelty to Peter, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly caſt him into priſon: but the churches were inceſſant in their prayers to God for his ſafety; and what have mortals to fear, when guarded by the hand of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence! Herod was perſuaded he ſhould ſoon accompliſh his intentions, and ſacrifice Peter to the inſatiable cruelty of the Jews.</p>
               <p>THE night before the intended execution, a meſſenger from the courts of heaven vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the gloomy horrors of the dungeon, where he found Peter aſleep between his keepers. The angel raiſed him up, took off his chains, ordered him to gird on his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and follow him: Peter obeyed, and having paſſed through the firſt and ſecond watch, they came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: the angel alſo accompanied him through one of the ſtreets, and then departed from him; on which Peter came to himſelf, and perceived that it was no viſion, but that his great and beloved Maſter had really ſent a meſſenger from above, and releaſed him from priſon. He therefore repaired to the houſe of Mary, where the church was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and offering up their prayers to the throne of grace for his ſafety. On his knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door, a maid who came to let him in, knowing his voice, ran back to tell them that Peter was at the door, which they at firſt conſidered as the effect of fancy: but the damſel continuing to affirm that it was really true, they concluded it was an angel, or ſome meſſenger ſent to him from the courts of heaven: but on opening the door, they were convinced of their miſtake, finding that it was Peter himſelf, who briefly told them how he was delivered, and, deſiring them to inform his brethren of his being ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he retired from them.</p>
               <p>THE officers came in the morning from Herod to the priſon, with orders to bring Peter out to the people, who were gathered together to behold his execution: but when they came to the priſon, the keepers informed them, that the apoſtle had made his eſcape; which ſo exaſperated Herod, that he commanded thoſe to be put to death who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the care of the priſoner.</p>
               <p>AFTER this miraculous deliverance of St. Peter, a controverſy aroſe between the Jewiſh and the Gentile converts, with regard to the obſervation of the Moſaic law, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which gave great uneaſineſs to the minds of many perſons; the Jews zealouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that it was abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation to be circumciſed, and obſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ceremonial law as well as thoſe of the goſpel. To compoſe this difference, it was thought neceſſary to ſummon a general council of the apoſtles and brethren to meet at Jeruſalem. This was accordingly done, and the caſe thoroughly debated.</p>
               <p>AT laſt Peter ſtood up, and declared, that God having choſen him out of all the apoſtles to be a preacher of the Goſpel, not only to the Jews, but alſo to the Gentiles, God who was beſt able to judge of the hearts of men, had borne witneſs to them, that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him by giving them his Holy Spirit, as he had done the Jews; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was no difference between them.</p>
               <p>ST. PETER's declaration convinced the church, and it was unanimouſly decreed, that no other burthen than the temporary obſervance of a few particular precepts, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="361" facs="unknown:029927_0383_0FE33AA630ACF7D0"/>PETER ſoon after left Jeruſalem, and went down to Antioch; where, uſing the liberty given him by the goſpel, he freely ate and converſed with the Gentile proſelytes, conſidering them now as <hi>fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſehold of God.</hi> This he had been taught by the viſion of the ſheet let down from heaven; this had been lately decreed at Jeruſalem; this he had before practiſed with regard to Cornelius and his family, and juſtified the action to the ſatisfaction of his accuſers; and this he had freely and innocently done at Antioch, till ſome of the Jewiſh brethren coming thither, he, for fear of offending them, withdrew himſelf from the Gentiles, as if it had been unlawful for him to hold converſation with uncircumciſed perſons; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew, and was fully ſatisfied, that our bleſſed Saviour had broken down the partition-wall between the Jews and Gentiles, under the goſpel.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus acted againſt the light of his own mind and judgment, Peter condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he had approved, and deſtroyed the ſuperſtructure he had before erected; at the ſame time, he confirmed the Jewiſh zealots in their inveterate errors, filled the minds of the Gentiles with ſcruples, and their conſciences with fears. Nor was this all, the old prejudices between Jew and Gentile were revived, and the whole number of Jewiſh converts, following the apoſtle's examples, ſeperated themſelves from the company of the Gentile Chriſtians; nay, even Barnabas himſelf was carried away by the torrent of unwarrantable practice that now unhappily prevailed.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle Paul was now at Antioch, and reſolutely oppoſed St. Peter to his face; he publicly reproved him as a perſon worthy to be blamed for his groſs prevarication. He reaſoned and ſeverely expoſtulated with him, that he who was himſelf a Jew, and conſequently under a more immediate obligation of obſerving the Moſaic law, ſhould throw off the yoke himſelf, and at the ſame time endeavour to impoſe it on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who were never under the neceſſity of obſerving the ceremonies of the Iſraelites; a ſevere, though an impartial charge.</p>
               <p>THUS far we have had an infalliable guide to direct us in writing the life of this great apoſtle; but here the ſacred hiſtorian hath left us, and therefore we muſt have recourſe to the ancients for materials in the further proſecution of his hiſtory.</p>
               <p>BEFORE this conteſt at Antioch, St. Peter had preached the goſpel in various parts of the world, enlarged the kingdom of his great Maſter, and ſpreading the glad-tidings of ſalvation amongſt the inhabitants of various countries; and, amongſt the reſt, thoſe of Rome, then the miſtreſs of the world. In that capital he is ſaid to have continued ſeveral years, till the emperor Claudius taking advantage of ſome ſeditious tumults raiſed by the Jews, publiſhed an edict, whereby they were baniſhed from Rome, and amongſt the reſt St. Peter, who returned to Jeruſalem, and was preſent at the ſynod already mentioned; but how long he continued in the capital of Judea is uncertain; for we have no account of his tranſactions for many years. This however is certain, that he was not idle in the ſervice of his great Maſter; and Euſebius tells us, from Metaphraſtes, that he viſited ſeveral of the weſtern parts, and particularly the iſland of Great Britain, where he continued ſeveral years, ſpreading the glad-tidings of ſalvation in theſe remote parts, and converting the ſeveral nations to the faith of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this be, whether St. Peter was or was not in England, it is certain, that towards the latter end of Nero's reign he returned to Rome, where he found the minds of the people ſtrongly bewitched, and hardened againſt the doctrines of the goſpel by the ſorceries of Simon Magus, who, as I have already obſerved, was chaſtiſed by
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:029927_0384_0FE33AA7B67B5788"/>
Peter for his wickedneſs at Samaria. This Monſter of impiety not only oppoſed the preaching of the apoſtles, but alſo did all in his power to render them and their doctrines odious to the emperor. St. Peter foreſeeing that the calumnies of Simon and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents would haſten his death, took the greater pains, and was ſtill more aſſiduous to confirm thoſe he had been any ways inſtrumental in converting in the ſublime truths they had received.</p>
               <p>IN order to this, the apoſtle ſtrongly oppoſed the great deceiver of mankind; for in the laſt year of his life, he ſeems to have written his two epiſtles to the diſperſed Jews in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bythinia; and, in an appointed encounter with Simon, diſcovered his magical impoſtures, and through the power and the aſſiſtance of the Almighty, brought him to an exemplary and miſerable death.</p>
               <p>THE account of the miſerable end of this unhappy man no ſooner reached the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's ears, than he vowed revenge, both for the death of his favourite, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed by the apoſtles to <hi>turn mankind from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Accordingly, he iſſued orders for apprehending St. Peter, together with his companion St. Paul. St. Ambroſe tells us, that when the people perceived the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which St. Peter was now expoſed, they prayed him to quit Rome, and repair for a while to ſome ſecure retreat, that his life might be preſerved for the benefit of the church. Peter, with great reluctance, yielded to their entreaties, and made his eſcape by night: but as he paſſed the gate, he was met by a perſon in the form of his great and beloved Maſter, and on Peter's aſking him, whither he was going, anſwered, "To Rome to be crucified the ſecond time:" which Peter taking for a reproof of his cowardice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again into the city, was ſoon after apprehended, and caſt, together with St. Paul, into the Mamertine priſon. Here they were confined eight or nine months, but ſpent their time in the exerciſe of religion, eſpecially in preaching to the priſoners, and thoſe who reſorted to them: and during this confinement, it is generally thought St. Peter wrote his ſecond epiſtle to the diſperſed Jews; wherein he endeavours to confirm them in the belief and practice of Chriſtianity, and to fortify them againſt thoſe poiſonous and pernicious principles and actions, which began to break in upon the church, then in its infancy.</p>
               <p>AT length, Nero returning from Achaia, he entered Rome in triumph; and ſoon after his arrival, reſolved that the apoſtles ſhould fall as victims and ſacrifices to his cruelty and revenge. While the fatal ſtroke was daily expected, the Chriſtians in Rome were continually offering up their prayers to heaven to protect thoſe two holy perſons: but the Almighty was now willing to put an end to their ſorrows; and after ſealing the truth they had preached with their own blood, to receive them into the regions of eternal bliſs and happineſs, and exchange their crowns of martyrdom for crowns of glory. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they were both condemned by the cruel emperor of Rome; and St. Peter having taken his farewell of the brethren, eſpecially St. Paul, was taken from the priſon, and led to the top of the Vatican mount, near the Tiber, where he was ſentenced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up his life by crucifixion.</p>
               <p>COMING to the place of execution, he begged the favour of the officers, that he might not be crucified in the common manner, but with his head downwards; affirming, that he was unworthy to ſuffer in the ſame poſture in which his Lord had ſuffered before him. This requeſt was accordingly complied with, and the great apoſtle St. Peter ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered up his ſoul into the hands of his great and beneficent Maſter, who came down from heaven to ranſom mankind from deſtruction, and to open the gates of the heavenly Canaan to all believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="unknown:029927_0385_0FE33AA9601833A8"/>THE body of Peter being taken down from the croſs, is ſaid to have been embalmed by Mercellinus the preſbyter after the manner of the Jews, and then buried in the Vatican, near the Appian way, two miles from Rome. Here it remained till the time of pope Cornelius, who conveyed it to the Vatican at Rome, where it reſted in an obſcure place, till the reign of Conſtantine, who, from the great reverence he entertained for the Chriſtian religion, erected many churches at Rome, and rebuilt and vaſtly enlarged the Vatican in honour of St. Peter.</p>
               <p>IF we conſider St. Peter as a man, there will ſeem to have been a natural eagerneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in his temper, which animated his ſoul to the moſt bold and generous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings: but if we conſider him as a diſciple of the bleſſed JESUS, we ſhall find him exemplary in the great duties of religion. To conclude: if we conſider him as an apoſtle, as a paſtor, or ſhepherd of the ſouls of men, we ſhall find him faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his office, zealouſly endeavouring to inſtruct the ignorant, reduce the erroneous, ſtrengthen the weak, confirm the ſtrong, reclaim the vicious, and turn the children of men into the paths of righteouſneſs. He never omitted any opportunity of preaching to the people, and ſpreading the glad-tidings of the goſpel amongſt the human race: and ſo powerful were his diſcourſes, that he converted many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at one time. How many painful journies and dangerous voyages did he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake! With what unconquerable patience did he endure the greateſt trials, ſurmount every difficulty, and remove every obſtacle, that he might plant the goſpel of his beloved Maſter! Never refuſing even to lay down his life to promote it: nor was he only aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to perform theſe duties himſelf; he was alſo careful to animate others to do the like, earneſtly preſſing and perſuading the paſtors and governors of the church to feed the flock of God, to labour freely for the good of the ſouls of men, and not undertake thoſe offices to acquire advantages to themſelves; beſeeching them to treat the flock committed to their care with lenity and gentleneſs, and to be themſelves ſhining exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of piety and religion, the ſureſt method of rendering their miniſtry ſucceſsful: and, becauſe it was impoſſible for him to be always preſent, to teach and warn the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, he endeavoured by letters to imprint in their minds the practice of what they had been taught: a method, he tells us, he was reſolved to purſue, as long as he continued an inhabitant of this world; thinking it meet, while he was in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, to ſtir up the profeſſors of the goſpel, by putting them in mind of theſe things; that ſo they might be able after his deceaſe to have them always in remembrance, and not let them ſlip out of their minds.</p>

The firſt he had in common with the other Jews, and in honour of one of the twelve patriarchs; the other two might be added to the former, partly to diſtinguiſh him from Judas the traitor, who had rendered the name odious to the Chriſtians, and partly as a commendation of his wiſdom and zeal: for Lebbeus, according to St. Jerom, ſignifies a man of underſtanding, and Thaddeus imports divine favour; and hence ſome of the fathers call him Zelotes, or Zealous.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was brother to St. James the Leſs, afterwards biſhop of Jeruſalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſon of Joſeph, the reputed father of CHRIST, by a former wife. It is not known when, or by what means, he became a diſciple of our bleſſed Savour, nothing being ſaid of him, till we find him in the catalogue of the twelve apoſtles; nor afterwards till

CHRIST's laſt ſupper, when diſcourſing with them about his departure, and comforting them with a promiſe, that he would return to them again, meaning after his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the world ſhould ſee him no more, though they ſhould ſee him; our apoſtle ſaid to his Maſter, <hi>Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thyſelf unto us, and not unto the world?</hi> It ſeems, from this queſtion, that St. Jude expected that the Meſſiah would eſtabliſh a ſecuar kingdom; and, therefore, could not reconcile the ſolemnity and grandeur of it, with the private manifeſtations of CHRIST to his diſciples only.</p>
               <p>IT is affirmed by St. Jerom, that St. Thomas ſent St. Jude the apoſtle, ſoon after our Lord's aſcenſion, to Edeſſa, to heal Abagarus: but this is a miſtake, it being Thaddeus, one of the ſeventy diſciples, and not Judas Thaddeus the apoſtle, who was ſent to Abagarus.</p>
               <p>WE are told by Paulinus, that the province which fell to the ſhare of St. Jude in the apoſtolic diviſion of the provinces, was Lybia; but he does not tell us, whether it was the Cyrenean Lybia, which is thought to have received the goſpel from St. Mark, or the more ſouthern part of Africa: but however that be, in his firſt ſetting out to preach the goſpel, he travelled up and down Judea and Galilee; then through Samaria into Idumea, and to the cities of Arabia, and the neighbouring countries, and afterwards to Syria and Meſopotamia. Nicephorus adds, that he came at laſt to Edeſſa, where Abagarus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and where Thaddeus, one of the ſeventy, had already ſown the ſeeds of the goſpel. Here he perfected what the other had begun; and having by his ſermons and miracles eſtabliſhed the religion of JESUS, he died in peace; but others ſay that he was ſtain at Berytes, and honourably buried there.</p>
               <p>THE writers of the Latin church are unanimous in declaring, that St. Jude travelled into Perſia, where, after great ſucceſs in his apoſtolical miniſtry for many years, he was at laſt, for his free and open reproving the ſuperſtitious rites and cuſtoms of the Magi, cruelly put to death by the enemies of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>WE do not find that St. Jude left more than one epiſtle, which is placed the laſt of thoſe ſeven, ſtyled catholic, in the ſacred canon. It hath no particular inſcription, as the other ſix have, but is thought to have been primarily intended for the Chriſtian Jews, in their ſeveral diſperſions, as St. Peter's epiſtles were. In it he tells them, "That he at firſt intended to write to them in general of the common ſalvation, and eſtabliſh and confirm them in it: but ſeeing the doctrine of CHRIST attacked on every ſide by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, he conceived it more neceſſary to ſpend his time in exhorting them to fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in defence of <hi>the faith once delivered to the ſaints,</hi> and oppoſe the falſe teachers who laboured ſo indefatigably to corrupt the truth."</p>
               <p>IT is generally underſtood, the Heretics meant in this epiſtle, were the Nicolatans, the Gnoſtics, the followers of Simon Magus and others of the ſame kind, whoſe morals were as corrupt as their doctrine, truſting to a faith without works, as ſufficient to their ſalvation: ſo that the ſubject of St. Jude's epiſtle is nearly the ſame with that of the ſecond of St. Peter, whoſe ſenſe he generally follows, and often uſes the very ſame expreſſions: only as the infection had ſpread itſelf further, and had gotten more ground, he ſeems to oppoſe thoſe Heretics with more zeal and ſharpneſs than St. Peter had done: but becauſe true Chriſtian charity, though it be zealous, yet is without bitterneſs and hatred, he exhorts the Chriſtians to uſe gentle methods with thoſe deluded people, and to pluck them as brands out of the fire; meaning by fire, their impious principles and practices, which if continued in, would certainly conſume them. He ſeems expreſsly to cite St. Peter's ſecond epiſtle, and to intimate plainly that moſt of the apoſtles were dead; ſo that his epiſtle ſeems not to have been written till after Nero's reign and the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by the Romans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="unknown:029927_0387_0FE33AB4401410B8"/>THIS epiſtle was not at firſt generally received in the church: the author indeed, like St. James, St. John, and ſometimes St. Paul himſelf, does not call himſelf an apoſtle, ſtyling himſelf only <hi>the ſervant of Chriſt:</hi> but he has added what is equivalent, <hi>Jude the brother of James,</hi> a character that can belong to none but our apoſtle: and ſurely the humility of a follower of JESUS ſhould be no objection againſt his writings, but rather be a recommendation of them.</p>
               <p>ONE great objection againſt this epiſtle, was, the apoſtle's mentioning the tradition of Michael the archangel contending with the Devil about the body of Moſes, but he has done no more than St. Paul in nameing Jannes and Jambres; namely, alleging a ſtory which was then current and acknowledged by the Jews, though nothing of it was inſerted in the ſacred writings, ſo that St. Jude reaſons with the Jews from their own authors and conceſſions, the more eaſily to convince and confute them.</p>
               <p>WE have now, we truſt, obviated the difficulties that have ariſen concerning the epiſtle of St. Jude; and Euſebius tells us, that in his time moſt churches read it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly: it is indeed evident, that before the cloſe of the fourth age, it was acknowledged as canonical Scripture, in the councils of Laodicea and Carthage, by general conſent.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. THOMAS THE APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>THE Jews, when they travelled into foreign countries, or familiarly converſed with the Greeks and Romans, were wont to aſſume a Latin name of the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or at leaſt that bore ſome affinity with that by which they were known in their own country. Thus our bleſſed Saviour was called CHRIST, anſwering to his Hebrew title <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the anointed: Simon, who was called <hi>Caphas</hi> in Hebrew, was ſtyled <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tros</hi> in Greek, both ſignifying a rock: <hi>Tabitha</hi> was called <hi>Dorcas,</hi> both ſignifying a goat: and thus <hi>Thomas,</hi> according to the Syriac import of his name, was called <hi>Didymus,</hi> a twin, which is the meaning of both appellations.</p>
               <p>THERE is no mention in the evangelical hiſtory either of the country or kindred of St. Thomas: it is however certain that he was a Jew, and in all probability a Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean. Metaphraſtes tell us, that he was deſcended from very mean parents, who brought him up to the trade of fiſhing; but at the ſame time, took care to give him a more uſeful education, inſtructing him in the knowledge of the Scripture, whereby he learned wiſely to regulate his conduct.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was, together with the reſt, called to the apoſtleſhip and not long after gave an eminent inſtance of his being ready to undergo the moſt melancholy fate that might attend him: for when the reſt of the apoſtles were diſſuading their Maſter from going into Judea at the time of Lazarus's death, becauſe the Jews lately endeavoured to ſtone him, Thomas deſired them not to hinder his journey thither, though it might coſt them all their lives: <hi>Let us go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that we may die with him;</hi> concluding that inſtead of Lazarus being raiſed from the dead, they ſhould all, like him, be placed in the chambers of the duſt.</p>
               <p>THE holy JESUS, a little before his ſufferings, had been ſpeaking to them of the joys of heaven, and had told them, that he was going to prepare manſions for them, that they might follow him, and that they knew both the place whither he was going, and the way thither; on hearing this, our apoſtle replied, that they knew not whither he was going, much leſs the way that would lead them thither. To which our Lord
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:029927_0388_0FE33AB684CE6C48"/>
returned this ſhort but ſatisfactory anſwer, <hi>I am the way;</hi> I am the perſon whom the Father hath ſent into the world to ſhew mankind the paths that lead to eternal life, and therefore you cannot miſs the way if you follow my example, and obey my precepts.</p>
               <p>THE minds of the diſciples, who had ſeen their great Maſter expire on the croſs, were diſtracted by hopes and fears concerning his reſurrection, about which they were not then fully ſatisfied, which engaged him the ſooner to haſten his appearance, that by the ſenſible manifeſtations of himſelf he might put the matter beyond all poſſibility of diſpute. Accordingly, the very day on which he aroſe from the dead, he came into the houſe where they were aſſembled, while, for fear of the Jews, the doors were cloſe ſhut, and gave them ſufficient aſſurance, that he was riſen from the dead. Thomas was not preſent at this meeting, having probably never rejoined their company ſince their diſperſion in the garden, when every one's fears prompted him to conſult his own ſafety. At his return, they told him, that the Lord had appeared to them, but he obſtinately refuſed to give credit to what they ſaid, or to believe that it was really he, preſuming it rather a ſpectre or apparation, unleſs he might ſee the very print of the nails, and feel the wounds in his hands and ſide: a ſtrong piece of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! Was it any thing more than what Moſes and the prophets had long ſince fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told? Had not our Lord frequently declared in plain terms, that he muſt riſe from the dead the third day? And could they queſtion the poſſibility of what he told them, when they had ſo often ſeen him work the greateſt miracles.</p>
               <p>THE ſtubbornneſs of Thomas, on this occaſion, might have betrayed him into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infidelity; but our compaſſionate Saviour would not take the advantage of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe obſtinacy; for, on that day ſeven-night he came again to them, as they were met at their ſolemn devotions, and, calling to Thomas, bade him look upon his hands, put his fingers into the print of the nails, and thruſt his hand into his ſide, to ſatisfy his faith by a demonſtration from the ſenſes. Thomas was ſoon convinced of his error and obſtinacy, confeſſing that he now acknowledged him to be his Lord and Maſter, a God omnipotent, as he was thus able to reſcue himſelf from the power of death. Our Lord anſwered, that it was happy for him that he believed the teſtimony of his own ſenſes; but that it was a more noble and commendable act of faith, to acquieſce in a rational evidence, and to receive the doctrines and precepts of the goſpel upon ſuch teſtimonies and aſſurances as will ſatisfy a wiſe and ſober man, though he did not himſelf behold them.</p>
               <p>AFTER the bleſſed JESUS had left this vale of miſery, and beſtowed eminent gifts and miraculous powers on the apoſtles, St. Thomas, as well as the reſt, preached the goſpel in ſeveral parts of Judea; and, after the diſperſion of the Chriſtian church in Jeruſalem, repaired into Parthia, the province aſſigned him for his miniſtry. After which, as Sempronius and others inform us, he preached the goſpel to the Medes, Perſians, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manians, Hyrcanis, Bactarians, and the neighbouring nations.</p>
               <p>DEPARTING from Perſia he travelled into Ethiopia, preaching the glad-tidings of the Goſpel, healing the ſick, and working other miracles, to prove he had his commiſſion from on high. And after travelling through theſe countries, he entered the Indian territories.</p>
               <p>WE are told by Nicephorus, that he was at firſt unwilling to enter theſe countries, fearing he ſhould find their manners as rude and intractable as their faces were black and deformed, till encouraged by a viſion, wherein he was aſſured of the Divine Preſence to

aſſiſt him. He travelled a great way into the Eaſtern countries, and even viſited the iſland Taprobane, ſince called Sumatra, and the country of the Brachmans, preaching every where with the greateſt gentleneſs, and uſing the moſt perſuaſive diſcourſes, not flying out into invectives againſt their idolatrous practices, but calmly inſtructing them in the doctrines of Chriſtianity, perſuading them by degrees to renounce their follies, well knowing that confirmed habits muſt be cured by patience and forbearance, by ſlow and gentle methods; and by theſe means he reclaimed the people from the groſſeſt errors and ſuperſtitions, to an hearty belief and reception of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>THE Portegueſe, when they firſt viſited theſe countries, after their diſcovery of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by the Cape of Good Hope, received the following particulars, partly from ancient monuments, and partly from conſtant and uncontroverted traditions preſerved by the Chriſtians in thoſe parts; namely, that St. Thomas came firſt to Socotora, an iſland in the Arabian ſea, and thence to Cranganor, where, having converted many from the error of their ways, he travelled further into the Eaſt: and having ſucceſsfully preached the goſpel, returned back to the kingdom of Coromandel, where at Mallipur, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of the kingdom, not far from the mouth of the Ganges, he began to erect a place for divine worſhip, till prohibited by the idolatrous prieſts, as well as by Sagamo, prince of that country: but after performing ſeveral miracles, the work was ſuffered to proceed, and Sagamo himſelf embraced the Chriſtian faith, whoſe example was ſoon followed by great numbers of his ſubjects and attendants.</p>
               <p>THE Brachmans were greatly alarmed at this remarkable ſucceſs, at they plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that their religion would ſoon be extirpated, unleſs ſome method could be found of putting a ſtop to the progreſs of Chriſtianity: and therefore reſolved to put the apoſtle to death. At a ſmall diſtance from the city was a tomb, whither St. Thomas often retired for private devotions. Hither the Brachmans and their armed followers purſued him, and while he was intent at prayer, they firſt ſhot at him a ſhower of darts, after which, one of the prieſts ran him through with a lance. His body was taken up by his diſciples, and buried in the church he had lately erected, and which was afterwards improved into a ſtately and magnificent fabric.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to St. Chryſoſtom, St. Thomas, who at firſt was the weakeſt and moſt incredulous of all the apoſtles, became, through CHRIST's condeſcenſion to ſatisfy his ſcruples, and the power of the divine grace, the moſt active and invincible of them all; travelling over moſt parts of the world, and living without fear in the midſt of barbarous nations, for the propagation of the Chriſtian faith.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH the ſacred hiſtorians have largely deſcribed the tranſactions of St. Peter and St. Paul, yet we find they have been ſparing in their accounts of the other apoſtles, giving us only now and then a few oblique ſtrokes and accidental remarks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Why no more of their reſpective actions were recorded by the penmen of the Holy Scriptures, is to us unknown: perhaps the Divine Providence thought it convenient that no further account ſhould be given of the firſt planting of Chriſtianity in the world, than what concerned Judea and the neighbouring countries, at leaſt the moſt eminent places in the Roman empire, that the truth of the prophetical predictions might appear, which had foretold, That <hi>the law</hi> of the Meſſiah <hi>ſhould come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> Beſides a particular relation of the acts of ſo many apoſtles, performed in ſo many countries, muſt have ſwelled the ſacred

volumes to an enormous bulk, and conſequently rendered them leſs ſerviceable to the uſe of Chriſtians in general.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtle St. Andrew was born at Bethſaida, a city of Galilee, built on the banks of the lake of Genneſareth, and was the ſon to John or Jonas, a fiſherman of that town. He was brother to Simon Peter, but whether elder or younger, is not certainly known though the generality of the ancients intimate that he was the younger: but, however that be, he was brought up to his father's trade, at which he laboured till our bleſſed Saviour called him to be a fiſher of men, for which he was, by ſome preparatory inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions qualified even before the appearance of the Meſſiah, in his public character.</p>
               <p>WE are told by the evangeliſt, John the Baptiſt had lately preached the doctrine of repentance; and was, by the generality of the Jews, from the impartiality of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the remarkable ſtrictneſs and auſterity of his life, held in great veneration. He trained up his proſelytes under the diſcipline of repentance, and, by urging on them a ſevere change and reformation of life, prepared them to entertain the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Meſſiah, whoſe approach he told them was now near at hand; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them the greatneſs of his perſon, and the importance of the deſign for which he came into the world.</p>
               <p>BESIDES the multitudes that flocked to the Baptiſt's diſcourſes, he accordingly to the cuſtom of the Jewiſh maſters, had ſome peculiar and ſelect diſciples, who more conſtantly attended on his lectures, and generally waited upon his perſon. In the number of theſe followers was our apoſtle; who was with him beyond Jordan, when the Meſſiah, who had ſome time before been baptiſed, came that way. Upon his approach, the Baptiſt pointed him out as the Meſſiah, ſtyling him <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> the true ſacrifice, that was to expiate the ſins of the world.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as the Baptiſt had given this character of JESUS, Andrew, and another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, probably St. John, followed the Saviour of mankind to the place of his abode; from whence, after ſome converſation with him, Andrew departed, and having found his brother Simon, informed him that he had diſcovered the great Meſſiah, ſo long expected by the houſe of Jacob; and, accordingly, brought him to JESUS. They did not, however, ſtay long with their Maſter, but returned to their occupation.</p>
               <p>UPWARDS of a year afterwards, JESUS paſſing through Galilee, found Andrew and Peter fiſhing on the ſea of Galilee, where he fully ſatisfied them of the greatneſs and divinity of his perſon, by a miraculous draught of fiſhes which they took at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He now told them, that they ſhould enter on a different ſeries of labours, and, inſtead of fiſh, they ſhould by the efficacy and influence of their doctrine, catch men; commanding them to follow him, as his immediate diſciples and attendants; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y accordingly left all and followed him immediately.</p>
               <p>ANDREW, together with the reſt, was ſhortly after called to the office and honour of the apoſtolate, and made choice of to be one of CHRIST's immediate vicegerents for planting and propagating the Chriſtian church.</p>
               <p>WE learn from the ſacred hiſtorian, that after the aſcenſion of the bleſſed JESUS into heaven, and the Holy Ghoſt had deſcended in a viſible manner on the apoſtles, St An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew was choſen to preach the goſpel in Scythia, and the countries adjacent. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly departed for Jeruſalem, and firſt travelled through Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia, inſtructing the inhabitants in the faith of CHRIST, and continued his journey along the Euxine ſea into the ſolitudes of Scythia.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="unknown:029927_0392_0FE33AC56E9143C0"/>ST. ANDREW afterwards arrived at Sinope, a city ſituated on the ſame ſea, and famous both for the birth and burial of king Mithridates: here he met with his brother Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtaid with him a conſiderable time at this place. The inhabitants of Sinope were moſtly Jews, who partly, from a zeal for their religion, and partly from their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous manner, were exaſperated againſt St. Andrew, and entered into a confederacy to burn the houſe in which he lodged: but being diſappointed in this deſign, they treated him with the moſt ſavage cruelty, throwing him on the ground, ſtamping upon him with their feet, pulling and dragging him from place to place: ſome beating him with clubs, ſome pelting him with ſtones, and others to ſatisfy their brutal revenge, biting off his fleſh with their teeth; till apprehending they had entirely deprived him of life, they caſt him out into the fields: but he miraculouſly recovered, and returned publicly into the city; by which and other miracles he wrought among them, he converted many from the error of their ways, and induced them to become diſciples of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>AFTER departing from Sinope, he returned to Amynſus, paſſed from thence through Trapezius, and Neocaeſarea to Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this city he paſſed by ſea to Sinope, the royal ſeat of Mithridates to encourage and confirm the churches he had planted in thoſe parts; and here he ordained Philologos, formerly one of St. Paul's diſciples, biſhop thereof.</p>
               <p>ST. ANDREW, after leaving Sinope, came to Byzantium, ſince called Conſtantinople, where he inſtructed the inhabitants in the Chriſtian religion, founded a church for divine worſhip, and ordained Stachys, firſt biſhop of that place: but being baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the city, he fled to Argyropolis, were he preached the goſpel for two years together with remarkable ſucceſs, converting great numbers to the Chriſtian faith. He next travelled over Thrace, Macedonia, Theſſaly, Achaia, and Epirus, preaching the goſpel, propagating Chriſtianity, and confirming the doctrine he taught with ſigns and miracles. At laſt he came to Petrea, a city of Achaia, where he gave his laſt and greateſt teſtimony to the goſpel of his divine Maſter; we mean, he ſealed it with his blood, and received the crown of martyrdom by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means.</p>
               <p>AEGEAS, who was proconſul of Achaia, came at this time to Patrea where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that multitudes had abandoned the heathen religion, and embraced Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity he had recourſe to every method both of favour and cruelty, to reduce the people to their old idolatry. The apoſtle, whom no difficulties or dangers could deter from performing the duties of his miniſtry, addreſſed the proconſul, and calmly put him in mind, that being only a judge of men, he ought to revere him who was the ſupreme and impartial Judge of all, pay him the divine honours due to his exalted Majeſty, and abandon the impieties of his idolatrous worſhip. The
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:029927_0393_0FE33AC6F083C108"/>
proconſul, inſtead of aſſenting to theſe arguments of the apoſtle, ridiculed him as an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator in religion, and a propagator of that ſuperſtition, whoſe author the Jews had put to the infamous death of the croſs. On his mentioning the croſs, our apoſtle took the opportunity of repreſenting to him the infinite love and kindneſs of our great Redeemer, who came down from heaven to purchaſe the ſalvation of mankind; and to obtain it, did not diſdain to die upon the croſs. The proconſul anſwered, that he might hope to perſuade the credulous multitude of the truth of what he ſaid; but, for his part, he would not liſten to ſuch a legentary tale: and if he did not comply with him, in doing ſacrifice to the gods, he would cauſe him to ſuffer upon that croſs he had ſo highly magnified. St. Andrew replied, that he ſacrificed every day to God, the only true and omnipotent being, not with fumes and bloody offering, but in the ſacrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God. This anſwer provoked the proconſul, and he committed the apoſtle to priſon; which ſo exaſperated the people, that a mutiny would have enſued, had not St. Andrew reſtored them, perſuading them to imitate the mildneſs and patience of the meek and humble JESUS, and not hinder him from receiving the crown of martyrdom, which he was now going to receive.</p>
               <p>HE was brought again the next day before the proconſul, who perſuaded him not fooliſhly to throw away his life, but preſerve it, and enjoy the pleaſures of the world. The apoſtle told him, that if he would renounce his idolatries and heartily embrace the Chriſtian faith, he ſhould, with him and the members who had believed in the Son of God, receive eternal happineſs in the Meſſiah's kingdom. The proconſul anſwered, that he himſelf ſhould never embrace the religion he mentioned; and that the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he was ſo earneſt with him to ſacrifice to the gods, was that thoſe whom he had every where ſeduced, might, by his example, be brought back to the ancient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they had forſaken. To which the apoſtle replied, that he ſaw it was in vain to endeavour to perſuade a perſon incapable of ſober councils, and hardened in his own blindneſs and folly; that with regard to himſelf, he might act as he pleaſed, and if he had any torment greater than another, he might heap that upon him; as the greater conſtancy he ſhewed in his ſufferings for CHRIST, the more acceptable he ſhould be to his Lord and Maſter. Aegeas, upon this, immediately paſſed ſentence of death upon him, not being able to reſtrain his rage any longer.</p>
               <p>THE Proconſul firſt ordered St. Andrew to be ſcourged, ſeven lictors ſucceſſively whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his naked body; and, ſeeing his invincible patience and conſtancy, commanded him to be crucified; but to be faſtened to the croſs with cords inſtead of nails, that his death might be more lingering and tedious. As he was led to the place of execution, walking with a cheerful and compoſed mind, the people cried out that a good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man was unjuſtly condemned to die. On his coming near the croſs, he ſaluted it in the following manner: I have long deſired and expected this happy hour. The croſs has been conſecrated by the body of CHRIST hanging on it, and adorned with his members as with ſo many ineſtimable jewels: I therefore come joyfully and triumphing to it, that it may receive me as a diſciple and follower of him who once hung upon it, and be the means of carrying me ſafe to my Maſter, being the inſtrument on which he redeemed me and all his people from everlaſting miſery."</p>
               <p>HAVING offered up his prayers to the throne of grace, and exhorted the people to conſtancy and perſeverance in the religion he had delivered to them, he was faſtened to the croſs, on which he hung two whole days, teaching and inſtructing the people. In the mean time, great intereſt was made to the proconſul to ſpare his life; but the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle earneſtly begged of the Almighty, that he might now depart, and ſeal the truth of his religion with his blood. His prayers were heard, and he immediately expired on the laſt day of November, but in what year is not recorded by hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="unknown:029927_0394_0FE33AC8750862B0"/>THE croſs on which he ſuffered, appears to have ſomething peculiar in the form of it, and is commonly thought to have been a croſs decuſſate, or two pieces of timber croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in the form of the letter X, hence uſually known by the name of St. Andrew's croſs; though ſome affirm that he ſuffered death on an Olive-tree, and not on a croſs.</p>
               <p>AFTER his body was taken from the croſs, it was decently and honourably intered by Maximilla, a lady of great quality and eſtate, and who, Nicephorus tells us, was wife to the proconſul. Conſtantine the great afterwards removed his body to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, and buried it in the great church he had built to the honour of the apoſtles: but this ſtructure being taken down ſome hundred of years after, in order to rebuild it, by Juſtinian the emperor, the body of St. Andrew was found in a wooden coffin, and again depoſited in the place where it was at firſt intered.</p>
               <p>WE have the following encomiaſtic character of St. Andrew, from Heſychius, preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jeruſalem, with which we ſhall conclude this account of his life. "St. Andrew was the firſt-born of the apoſtolic choir, the principal and firſt pillar of the church, <hi>a rock before the rock,</hi> the foundation of that foundation, the firſt fruits of the beginning, a caller before he was called himſelf; he preached that goſpel which was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or entertained; he revealed and made known that life to his brother, which he had not yet perfectly learned himſelf: ſo great treaſures did that one queſtion bring him, <hi>Maſter, where dwelleſt thou?</hi> which he ſoon perceived by the anſwer, <hi>Come and ſee.</hi> How art thou become a prophet? whence thus divinely ſkilful? what is it that thou ſoundeſt in Peter's ears. <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes and the prophets did write,</hi> &amp;c. Why doſt thou attempt to compaſs him whom thou canſt not comprehend? how can he be found who is omnipreſent? But he knew very well what he ſaid, we have found him whom Adam loſt, whom Eve injured, whom the clouds of ſin have hidden from us, and to whom our tranſgreſſions had hitherto rendered us ſtrangers. Thus had St. Andrew the honour of being the firſt apoſtle that preached the goſpel of the Son of God; as appears by his declaration recited above."</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW, THE APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>WE learn from the evangelical hiſtory of the election of the apoſtles, that St. Bartholomew was one of the twelve: becauſe he is but juſt named, without any further notice taken of him, the generality of writers, ancient and modern, ſuppoſe that he lay concealed under the name of Nathanael, one of the firſt diſciples that came to CHRIST. Accordingly, we may obſerve, that as St. John never mentions Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew in the number of the apoſtles, ſo the other evangeliſts take no notice of Nathanael, probably as being the ſame perſon under two different names: and as in St. John, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip and Nathanael are joined together in their coming to CHRIST; ſo in the reſt of the evangeliſts, Philip and Bartholomew are conſtantly put together; certainly for no other reaſon, than becauſe they were jointly called to the diſcipleſhip: but what renders this opinion ſtill more probable, is, that Nathanael is particularly mentioned amongſt the other apoſtles, to whom our Lord appeared at the ſea of Tiberias after his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>IT is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that Bartholomew was the proper name of this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, any more than B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r-jona was the proper name of Peter; but given to denote his relative capacity, either as a ſon or a ſcholar. If it refers to his father, he was the ſon of Thalmai, a name not uncommon amongſt the Jews: if to his ſect as a ſcholar, he
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:029927_0395_0FE33AD0DDD7DCB0"/>
was of the ſchool of the Thalmaeans, ſo called from their founder Thalmaei, ſcholar to Heber, the ancient maſter of the Hebrews. Now it was uſual for ſcholars, out of a great reverence to their maſter, as firſt inſtitutor of the order, to adopt his name, as Ben-ezra, Ben-uziel, and the like: but which ever of theſe conjectures appears moſt ſatisfactory to the reader, either will be ſufficient for my purpoſe, namely, to reconcile the difference there ſeems to be between St. John and the other evangeliſts about the name of this apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one calling him by his proper name, and the other by his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or paternal appellation.</p>
               <p>ST. Auguſtine indeed ſeemed to object, that it is not probable that our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who propoſed to confound the wiſdom of this world by the preaching of illiterate men, would chooſe Nathanael, a doctor of the law, to be one of his apoſtles: but this objection will appear to be built on a ſandy foundation, if we conſider, that the ſame argument is as ſtrong againſt Philip, of whoſe knowledge in the law and the prophets, there is as ſtrong evidence in the hiſtory of the goſpel as for that of Nathanael; and may be urged with ſtill greater force againſt St. Paul, whoſe abilities in human learning were remarkably great, and few were more complete maſters of the Jewiſh law, than that great apoſtle.</p>
               <p>THIS difficulty being removed, we ſhall proceed to the hiſtory of this apoſtle, and conſider the names of Nathanael and Bartholomew as belonging to one and the ſame, and not to two perſons.</p>
               <p>AS to his deſcent and family, ſome are of opinion that he was a Syrian, and that he was deſcended from the Ptolemies of Egypt; probably for no other reaſon than the mere analogy and ſound of the name: but it is plain from the evangelical hiſtory, that he was a Galilean, St. John having expreſsly told us, that Nathanael was of Cana in that part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Judea. His trade and manner of life are not mentioned in Scripture, though from ſome circumſtances there is room to imagine that he was a fiſherman: but however that be, he was at his firſt coming to CHRIST, conducted by Philip, who told him they had now found the long expected Meſſiah ſo often foretold by Moſes and the prophets, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, the ſon of Joſeph.</hi> And when he objected that the Meſſiah could not be born in Nazareth, Philip deſired him to come and ſatisfy himſelf of the truth.</p>
               <p>OUR bleſſed Saviour, on his approach, entertained him with this honourable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that he was <hi>an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> a man of true ſimplicity and dignity; and indeed his ſimplicity particularly appears in this, that when he was told of JESUS, he did not object againſt the meanneſs of his original, the low condition of his parents, or the narrowneſs of their fortunes, but only againſt the place of his birth, which, as he juſtly obſerved, could not be Nazareth, the Scriptures peremptorily foretelling that the Meſſiah ſhould be born at Bethlehem.</p>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was greatly ſurpriſed at our Lord's ſalutation, wondering how he could know him at the firſt ſight, being certain he had never before ſeen his face: but he was anſwered, that he had ſeen him while he was yet under the fig-tree, even before Philip called him. Convinced by this inſtance of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord's divinity, he preſently made this confeſſion, that he was now ſure that JESUS was the promiſed Meſſiah, the Son of God, whom he had appointed to govern his church. Our bleſſed Saviour told him, that if, from this inſtance, he could believe him to be the Meſſiah, he ſhould have far greater arguments to confirm his faith; for that he ſhould hereafter behold the heavens opened
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:029927_0396_0FE33AD35ADCCCF0"/>
to receive him, and the angels viſibly appearing to attend his triumphant entrance into the heaven of heavens.</p>
               <p>AFTER the viſible deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt on the apoſtles, St. Bartholomew viſited different parts of the world to preach the goſpel, and penetrated as far as the hither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. Having ſpent a conſiderable time there, and in the eaſtern extremities of Aſia, he returned to the northern and weſtern parts: and we find him at Hierapolis in Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, labouring in concert with St. Philip, to plant Chriſtianity in thoſe parts, and to convince the blind idolaters of the evil of their ways, and direct them in the paths that lead to the regions of felicity. This enraged the bigotted magiſtrates, and he was, together with St. Philip, deſigned for Martyrdom; and in order to this faſtened to a croſs: but a ſudden trembling and motion of the earth convinced the idolaters that the juſtice of Omnipotence would revenge their deaths; ſo that they took him immediately down from the croſs and diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>ST. BARTHOLOMEW paſſed from hence into Lycaonia, and St. Chryſoſtom aſſures us, that he inſtructed and trained up the inhabitants in the Chriſtian diſcipline. His laſt remove was to Adrianople in Great Armenia, a place miſerably over-run with idolatry, from which he laboured to reclaim the people: but his endeavours to <hi>turn them from darkneſs unto light; and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> were ſo far from having the deſired effect, that it provoked the magiſtrates, who prevailed on the governor to put him to death, which he cheerfully underwent, ſealing with his blood the truth of the doctrine he had preached.</p>
               <p>WE are told by ſome of the ancients, that he was crucified with his head downwards; and by others, that he was flayed alive. Perhaps he ſuffered both; for Plutarch records a particular inſtance of Meſobates, the Perſian eunuch, who was firſt flayed alive, and then crucified; and the inhabitants of Adrianople might eaſily borrow this barbarous and inhuman cruelty from the Perſians, who were remarkably ſevere in their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. BARNABAS, THE APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was at firſt called Joſes, a ſofter termination generally given by the Greeks to Joſeph; his fellow diſciples added the name of Barnabas, as ſignificant of ſome extraordinary property in him. St. Luke interprets it, <hi>the ſon of conſolation,</hi> which he was ever ready to adminiſter to the afflicted, both by word and action; as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable diſcourſes, his ſelling his own eſtate, and collecting the benevolence of others, for the relief of the poor indigent Chriſtians, abundantly teſtify. St. Jerom obſerves that his name alſo denotes <hi>the ſon of a prophet:</hi> and in this reſpect likewiſe it was well ſuited to our apoſtle, as being eminent for his endowments and prophetic gifts.</p>
               <p>ST. BARNABAS was a deſcendant of the tribe of Levi, of a family removed out of Judea, and ſettled in the iſle of Cyprus, where they had purchaſed an eſtate, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites might do out of their country. His parents finding their ſon of a promiſing geni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="unknown:029927_0397_0FE33AD4E1326DA8"/>ST. BARNABAS is firſt mentioned in the Holy Scripture, in record of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> great and worthy ſervice he did the church of CHRIST, by ſecuring it with the ſale of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in Cyprus, the whole price of which he laid at the apoſtle's feet, to be put into the common ſtock, and diſpoſed of as they ſhould think fit, amongſt the indigent fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Holy JESUS. This worthy example was followed by thoſe who were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the goods of fortune; none kept their plenty to themſelves, but turned their houſes and lands into money, and devoted it to the common uſe of the church. St. Barnabas is indeed mentioned as ſelling the moſt valuable eſtate on this occaſion; or being the moſt forward and ready to begin a common ſtock and ſet others a laudable pattern of charity and benevolence to the brethern.</p>
               <p>OUR apoſtle now became conſiderable in the miniſtry and government of the church; for we find that St. Paul coming to Jeruſalem three years after his converſion, and not readily procuring admittance into the church, becauſe he had been ſo grievous a perſecuter of it, and might ſtill be ſuſpected of a deſign to betray it, he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Barnabas as a leading man amongſt the Chriſtians, and one that had perſonal knowledge of him. He accordingly introduced him to Peter and James and ſatisfied them of the ſincerity of his converſion, and in what a miraculous manner it was brought about.</p>
               <p>THE agreeable news was brought to Jeruſalem, about four or five years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that ſeveral of their body, who had been driven out of Judea by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions raiſed about St. Stephen, had preached at Antioch with ſuch ſucceſs, that a great number, both of Jews and proſelytes, embraced Chriſtianity, and were deſirous that ſome of the ſuperior order would come down and confirm them. This requeſt was immediately granted; and Barnabas was deputed to ſettle this new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Upon his arrival, he rejoiced extremely, to ſee what progreſs the goſpel had made amongſt them; and earneſtly exhorted them to continue immoveable in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of CHRIST JESUS. And being himſelf a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt; and of faith, his charitable deeds accompanying his diſcourſes, and his pious life exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying his ſound doctrine, the people were greatly influenced by him, and very large additions were made to the Chriſtian church: but there being too large a field for one labourer, he went to fetch Paul from Tarſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who came back with him to Antioch, and aſſiſted him a whole year in eſtabliſhing that church. Their labours proſpered, their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies were crowded, and the diſciples, who before this were called amongſt themſelves <hi>brethren, believers, elect,</hi> and by their enemies, <hi>Nazare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es,</hi> and <hi>Galileans,</hi> were now called Chriſtians firſt in this city.</p>
               <p>WHILE theſe apoſtles preached in Antioch, Agabus, a prophet, gave the church notice, that there would ſhortly be a great famine thoughout the Roman empire; eſpecially in Judea. On hearing this prophecy, the Chriſtians of Antioch conſidering the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and neceſſities of their brethren at Jeruſalem, and how generouſly the rich amongſt them had exhauſted their eſtates in maintaining the poor, determined to ſend them aſſiſtance againſt the enſuing ſcarcity, which they raiſed by contributions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to every man's abilities, and ſent it to the heads of the church at Jeruſalem, by the hands of Barnabas and Paul. This famine lay heavy on Judea, during the four years government of Caſpius Fadus, and Tiberias Alexander, who, under the emperor Claudius, were preſidents of that province.</p>
               <p>AFTER the apoſtles had fulfilled their charitable embaſſy, and ſtaid ſome time at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to ſee the good effect of it, they returned again to Antioch, bringing with them

John, whoſe ſurname was Mark, the ſon of Mary, ſiſter to Barnabas; and at whoſe houſe the diſciples found both ſecurity for their perſons, and conveniency for the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their worſhip. But ſoon after the apoſtles return to Antioch, an expreſs reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was made to the church, by the mouth of one of the prophets who miniſtered there, that Barnabas and Paul ſhould be ſet apart for an extraordinary work, unto which the Holy Ghoſt had appointed them. Upon this declaration the church ſet apart a day for a ſolemn miſſion, and after devout prayer and faſting, they laid their hands upon them, and ordained them to their office; which was to travel over certain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and preach the goſpel to the Gentiles: from this joint commiſſion, Barnabas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name of an apoſtle, not only amongſt later writers of the church, but with St. Paul himſelf, and with St. Luke, in the hiſtory of the acts of the apoſtles written by him.</p>
               <p>BEING thus conſecrated <hi>the apoſtles of the Gentiles,</hi> they entered upon their miniſtry, taking with them John Mark for their miniſter or deacon, who aſſiſted them in many eccleſiaſtical offices, particularly in taking care of the poor and receiving contributions for them.</p>
               <p>AFTER their departure from Antioch, the firſt city they viſited was Selucia, a city of Syria, adjoining to the ſea; from whence they ſailed for the iſland of Cyprus, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place of St. Barnabas, and arrived at Salamis, a port formerly remarkable for its trade. Here they boldly preached the doctrines of the goſpel, in the ſynagogue of the Jews; and from thence travelled to Paphos, the capital of the iſland. Here their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was attended with remarkable ſucceſs; Servius Paulus, the proconſul, being, amongſt others, converted to the faith of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>HAVING quitted Cyprus, they croſſed the ſea to preach in Pamphyli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here they preached to the Jews in their ſynagogue; but meeting with blaſphemous oppoſition, they told them plainly, that they thought it reaſonable to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel firſt to them; but as they had ſo unthankfully rejected it, they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Preſently after their arrival, they called the church of this city together, and gave them an account of their travel, and of the great ſucceſs which had attended their preaching in the Gentile world.</p>
               <p>THEY had not long continued in this city, before their aſſiſtance was required to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a difference in this church, occaſioned by ſome of the Jewiſh converts, who
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:029927_0399_0FE33AE28A79C728"/>
endeavoured to perſuade the Gentiles that they were bound to obſerve the law of Moſes, as well as that of CHRIST; and be circumciſed as well as baptized. Barnabas endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade the zealots from preſſing ſuch unneceſſary obſervations; but all his endeavours proving ineffectual, he was deputed with St. Paul and others, to go to the church at Jeruſalem, to ſubmit the queſtion to be determined there in a full aſſembly.</p>
               <p>DURING their ſtay at Jeruſalem, Mark, in all probability, reconciled himſelf to his uncle Barnabas, and returned with him and St. Paul to Antioch, after they had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their buſineſs at Jeruſalem, and obtained a decree from the ſynod there, that the Gentile converts ſhould not have circumciſion and other Moſaic rites impoſed upon them, as they were now under the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>THE minds of the Gentiles were greatly quieted and comforted by this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nevertheleſs it did not prevent the bigotted Jews from keeping up a ſeparation from them; and that with ſo much obſtinacy, that when St. Peter ſome time after came to Antioch, he, for fear of offending them, contradicted his former practice, and late ſpeech and vote in the ſynod of Jeruſalem, by refraining from all kind of communion with the Gentiles; and Barnabas himſelf, though ſo great and good a man, was induced, by the authority of his example, to commit the ſame error; though doubtleſs, on being reproved by St. Paul, they both took more courage, and walked according to that true liberty and freedom which the goſpel imparts.</p>
               <p>AFTER this tranſaction, Paul made a propoſal to Barnabas, that they ſhould repeat their late travels amongſt the Gentiles, and ſee how the churches they had planted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in their numbers, and improved in the doctrines they had taught them. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas very readily complied with the propoſal, but deſired they might take with them this reconciled nephew, John Mark. This Paul abſolutely refuſed, becauſe in their former voyage, Mark had not ſhewn the conſtancy of a faithful miniſter of CHRIST, but conſulted his own eaſe at a dangerous juncture, departed from them without leave at Pamphylia, and returned to Jeruſalem. Barnabas ſtill inſiſted on taking him, and the other continuing as reſolute to oppoſe it, a ſhort debate aroſe, which terminated in a rupture; whereby theſe two holy men, who had for ſeveral years been companions in the miniſtry, and with united endeavours propagated the goſpel of the Son of God, now took different provinces. Barnabas, with his kinſman, failed to his own country, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus; and Paul travelled to the churches of Syria and Cilicia, taking Silas with him.</p>
               <p>THE ſacred writers give us no account of St. Barnabas, after his ſeparation from St. Paul; nor are the eccleſiaſtical writers agreed amongſt themſelves with regard to the actions of our apoſtle, after his ſailing for Cyprus: this however ſeems to be certain, that he did not ſpend the whole remainder of his life in that iſland, but viſited different parts of the world, preaching the glad-tidings of the goſpel, healing the ſick, and working other miracles amongſt the Gentiles; and after long and painful travels, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with different degrees of ſucceſs in different places, he returned to Cyprus, his native country, where he ſuffered martyrdom in the following manner: certain Jews coming from Syria to Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the goſpel, were highly exaſperated at his extraordinary ſucceſs, fell upon him as he was diſputing in the ſynagogue, dragged him out, and after the moſt inhuman tortures, ſtoned him to death. His kinſman John Mark, who was a ſpectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body in a cave, where it remained till the time of the emperor Zeno, in the year of CHRIST 485, when it was diſcovered laying on his breaſt, with St. Matthew's goſpel in Hebrew, written with his own hand.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. PHILIP, THE APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>ST. PHILIP was a native of Bethſaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. He had the honour of being firſt called to be a diſciple of the great Meſſiah, which happened in the following manner. Our bleſſed Saviour, ſoon after his return from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where he had been tempted by the devil, met with Andrew and his brother Peter, and after ſome diſcourſe parted from them. The next day, as he was paſſing through Galilee, he found Philip, whom he preſently commanded to follow him, the conſtant form he made uſe of in calling his diſciples, and thoſe that inſeparably attended him; ſo that the prerogative of being firſt called, evidently belongs to St. Philip, he being the firſt of our Lord's diſciples; for though Andrew and St. John were the firſt that came and converſed with the Saviour of the world, yet they immediately returned to their occupation, and were not called till a whole year afterwards.</p>
               <p>OUR apoſtle was not idle after the honour he had received of being called to attend the Saviour of the world; he immediately imparted the glad-tidings of the Meſſiah's appearance to his brother Nathanael, and conducted him to JESUS: ſo ready is a good man to conduct others in the paths that lead to happineſs and peace.</p>
               <p>WE have very little recorded of St. Philip by the evangeliſt, after his being called to the apoſtleſhip. It was, however, to him that our Saviour propoſed the queſtion, where they ſhould find bread ſufficient to ſatisfy the hunger of ſo great a multitude? To which Philip anſwered, that it was not eaſy to procure ſo large a quantity; not conſidering, that it was equally eaſy for Almighty power to feed double the number, when it pleaſed to exert itſelf. It was alſo to the ſame apoſtle, that the Gentile proſelytes, who came up to worſhip at Jeruſalem, applied, when they were deſirous to ſee the Saviour of the world: and it was with him our Lord had the diſcourſe a little before the paſchal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when he was going about to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="unknown:029927_0402_0FE33AE74BCAEBC0"/>WHILE the holy compaſſionate JESUS was fortifying the minds of his diſciples with proper conſiderations againſt his departure from them, and had told them, a place in the manſions of the heavenly Canaan: that he was <hi>the way, truth, and the life: that no man could come to the Father but by him, and that knowing him, they both knew and had ſeen the Father:</hi> Philip, not thoroughly underſtanding the force of his Maſter's reaſonings begged of him that he would ſhew them the Father. We can hardly ſuppoſe that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip ſhould have ſuch groſs conceptions of the Deity, as to imagine the Father inveſted with a corporeal and viſible nature; but CHRIST having told them that they had ſeen him, and knowing that of old, God frequently appeared in a viſible ſhape, he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would manifeſt himſelf to them by ſome ſuch appearance. Our Lord gently reproved his ignorance, that after attending ſo long to his inſtructions, he ſhould know, that he was the image of his Father, the expreſs characters of his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power and goodneſs, appearing in him; that he ſaid and did nothing but by his Father's appointment, which, if they did not believe, his miracles were a ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that ſuch demands were therefore unneceſſary and impertinent; and that it was an indication of great weakneſs in him, after three years education under his diſcipline and inſtitution, to appear ſo ignorant with regard to theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>WE are told by the ancients, that in the diſtribution made by the apoſtles of the ſeveral regions of the world, the upper Aſia fell to the ſhare of St. Philip, where he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf with an indefatigable diligence and induſtry, to turn the children of men from the paths of wickedneſs which lead to deſtruction, to the ways that terminate in eternal felicity: and by the conſtancy and power of his preaching, and the efficacy of his maricles, he gained numerous converts, whom he baptiſed into the Chriſtian faith, curing at once their bodies of infirmities and diſtempers, and their ſouls of error and idolatry, he continued with them a conſiderable time in ſettling churches, and appointing them ſpiritual guides and miniſters.</p>
               <p>HAVING ſeveral years ſucceſsfully exerciſed his apoſtolical office in all thoſe parts, he came at laſt to Hierapolis in Phrygia, a city remarkable rich and populous, but at the ſame time over-run with the moſt enormous idolatry: amongſt the many vain and trifling deities, to whom they paid religious adoration, was a ſerpent or dragon, of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous magnitude which they worſhipped with the moſt ſolemn reverence and devotion.</p>
               <p>BEING grieved to ſee the people ſo wretchedly enſlaved by error and ſuperſtition, St. Philip continually offered his addreſſes to heaven, till by his prayers, and often calling upon the name of CHRIST, he procured the death, or, at leaſt, the vaniſhing of this famous and beloved ſerpent. Having thus demoliſhed their deity, he demonſtrated to them, how rediculous and unjuſt it was for them to pay divine honours to ſuch odious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhewed them, that God alone was to be worſhipped as the great Parent of all the world, who, in the beginning made man after his glorious image, and when fallen from that innocent and happy ſtate, ſent his own Son into the world to redeem him; that, in order to perform this glorious work, he died on the croſs, and roſe again from the dead, and at the end of the world will come again to raiſe all the ſons of men from the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the duſt, and ſentence them to everlaſting rewards and puniſhments, according to their works. This diſcouſe rouſed them from their lethargy; ſo that great numbers were aſhamed of their late idolatry, and embraced the doctrines of the goſpel with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and ſincerity.</p>
               <p>THE great enemy of mankind, being provoked at this ſucceſs had recourſe to his old methods, cruelty and perſecution. The magiſtrates of the city ſeized the apoſtle, and
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:029927_0403_0FE33AEEB10F4BB0"/>
having thrown him into priſon, cauſed him to be ſeverely ſcourged. When this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory cruelty was over, he was led to execution, and, being bound, was hanged againſt a pillar; or, according to others, crucified: but Omnipotence did not behold this ſcene of cruelty without teſtifying his anger; for when this indefatigable apoſtle was expiring, the earth began ſuddenly to quake, and the ground whereon the people ſtood to ſink under them; but, on their conſidering it as a mark of the divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and imploring pardon for their crime, it ſuddenly ſtopt, and returned to its former poſition. The apoſtle being dead, his body was taken down by St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew, his fellow-labourer in the goſpel, and Mariamne, St. Philip's ſiſter, the conſtant companions of his travels, and decently buried; after which they confirmed the people in the faith of CHRIST, and departed from thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>THE ancient writers unanimouſly agree that he was a married man; and Clemens of Alexandria, that he had daughters, whom he diſpoſed of in marriage: but he, not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſhing between Philip the deacon, who lived at Ceſarea, with his three vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin daughters, as mentioned in the acts of the apoſtles, has cauſed ſome confuſion amongſt the ancient authors: nay, ſome have concluded, that they were one and the ſame perſon; though the one was called to the apoſtleſhip by our Lord himſelf, and the other only a deacon choſen by the apoſtles at Jeruſalem, after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them.</p>
               <p>IT does not appear that St. Philip left any writings behind him, being fully employed in miniſteries more immediately uſeful to the happineſs of mankind as an apoſtle.</p>

               <head>ST. SIMON, THE APOSTLE, SURNAMED THE ZEALOT.</head>
               <p>THIS apoſtle was, as ſome think, one of the four brothers of our Saviour, ſons of Joſeph by his former marriage; though the only proof of it is, that one of theſe was called Simon, too weak an argument to found any on, except a bare conjecture. In the catalogue of the apoſtles, he is ſtyled <hi>Simon the Canaanite,</hi> whence ſome conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was born in Cana of Galilee, and others will have him to have been the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom mentioned by St. John, at whoſe marriage our bleſſed Saviour turned the water into wine: but this word has no relation to his country, or the place of his nativity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived from the Hebrew word <hi>knah,</hi> which ſignifies zeal; and denote a warm and ſprightly temper. What ſome of the evangeliſts, therefore, call <hi>Canaanite,</hi> others rendering the Hebrew by the Greek word, ſtyle <hi>Zealot:</hi> not from his great zeal, his ardent affection to his Maſter, and a deſire of advancing his religion in the world, but from his warm active temper, and zealous forwardneſs in ſome part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THAT we may underſtand this the better it will be neceſſary to obſerve, that as there were ſeveral ſects and parties amongſt the Jews, ſo there was one, either a diſtinct ſect, or, at leaſt, a branch of the Phariſees, called the ſect of the Zealots: they were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſertors of the honour of the law, and of the ſtrictneſs and purity of religion, aſſuming a liberty to themſelves of queſtioning notorious offenders, without ſtaying for the ordinary formalities of law; nay, they did not ſcruple, when they thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to inflict capital puniſhments upon them: thus, when a blaſphemer curſed God by the name of an idol, the Zealot who firſt met him had the liberty of killing him, without carrying him before the Sanhedrim.

               </p>
               <p>WHATEVER St. Simon was before, we can have no reaſon to ſuſpect, but that after his converſion he was very zealous for the honour of his maſter, and conſidered all thoſe who were enemies to CHRIST, as enemies to himſelf, how near ſoever they might be to him in any natural relation: and he was very exact in all the practical duties of the Chriſtian religion, ſo he ſhewed a very ſerious and pious indignation towards thoſe who profeſſed religion, and a faith in CHRIST, with their mouths, but diſhonoured their ſacred profeſſion, by their irregular and vicious lives, as many of the firſt Chriſtians really did, and became heretics and apoſtates.</p>
               <p>WE are told by Theodoret, that St. Simon the Zealot was of the tribe of Zebulon or Naphthali, and that by this particular he was diſtinguiſhed from St. Simon, a relation of our bleſſed Saviour, and after St. James, biſhop of Jeruſalem, who was of the tribe of Judah; but there are ſtronger reaſons to prove this difference, the authority of Euſebius, who never calls Simon biſhop of Jeruſalem, an apoſtle, but ſays expreſsly, that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age ended with his death, who died before Simon, biſhop of Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>IT appears that St. Simon continued in communion with the reſt of the apoſtles and diſciples at Jeruſalem; and at the feaſt of Pentecoſt, received the ſame miraculous gift of the Holy Ghoſt: ſo that he was qualified with the reſt of his brethren for the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic office, in propagating the goſpel of the ſon of God; and we cannot doubt of his exerciſing his gifts with the ſame zeal and fidelity, though in what part of the world, is uncertain, ſome ſay he went into Egypt, Cyrene, and Africa, preaching the goſpel to the inhabitants of thoſe remote and barbarous countries: and others add, that after he had juſt paſſed through thoſe burning waſtes, he took ſhip, and viſited the frozen regions of the North, preaching the goſpel to the inhabitants of the weſtern parts, and even in Britain itſelf, where having converted great multitudes, and ſuſtained the greateſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and perſecutions, he was at length crucified, and buried in ſome part of Great Britain, but the particular ſpot cannot be aſcertained.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. MATTHIAS THE APOSTLE.</head>
               <p>ST. MATTHIAS not being an apoſtle of the firſt election, immediately called and choſen by the Son of God himſelf, it cannot be expected that any account of him can be found in the evangelical hiſtory. He was one of our Lord's diſciples, probably one of the ſeventy, that had attended on him the whole time of his public miniſtry, and after his death was elected into the apoſtolate, to ſupply the place of Judas, who, after betraying his great Lord and Maſter, laid violent hands on himſelf.</p>
               <p>AS the defection of Judas had made a vacancy in the apoſtolic college, the firſt thing the diſciples did, after their return from Mount Olivet, when their great Maſter aſcended to the throne of glory, was to fill up this vacancy with a proper perſon. Accordingly, Peter acquainted them that Judas, according to the prophetical prediction, being fallen from his miniſtry, it was neceſſary that another ſhould be ſubſtituted in his room, and at the ſame time requiſite, that the perſon elected ſhould have been a conſtant attendant on the bleſſed JESUS, that he might be the better qualified for bearing witneſs to his life, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and interceſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="unknown:029927_0405_0FE33AF281A3E430"/>ST. PETER having thus addreſſed the aſſembly, two perſons were propoſed, namely, Joſeph called Barſabas, and Matthias, both of whom were duly qualified for that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant office. The method of election was by lots, a way common both amongſt the Jews and Gentiles for determining doubtful and difficult caſes, eſpecially in chooſing judges or magiſtrates; and this courſe ſeems to have been taken by the apoſtles, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, by whoſe immediate dictates and inſpirations they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards chiefly guided.</p>
               <p>THAT the buſineſs might proceed with the greater alacrity and ſucceſs, they firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made their addreſſes to heaven, that the omniſcient Being, who governed the world, and perfectly underſtood the tempers and diſpoſitions of men, would immediately guide and direct the choice, and ſhew them which of the two he would appoint to take that part of the apoſtolic charge, from which Judas had ſo lately fallen. The prayer being ended, the lots were drawn, by which it appeared that Matthias was the perſon, and he was numbered amongſt the twelve apoſtles accordingly.</p>
               <p>SOON after this election, the promiſed powers of the Holy Ghoſt were conferred upon the apoſtles, to qualify them for that great and arduous employment upon which they were ſent, the eſtabliſhing the holy religion of the Son of God amongſt the children of men, in various parts of the world.</p>
               <p>THE firſt years of the miniſtry of St. Matthias, was ſpent in Judea, where he reaped a very conſiderable harveſt of ſouls, and then travelled into different parts of the world, to publiſh the glad-tidings of ſalvation to people who had never yet heard of our Saviour: but the particular parts he viſited, are not certainly known. The Greeks ſuppoſe, that he travelled eaſtward; St. Jerom, ſays, his principal reſidence was near the influx of the river Apſus into the haven of Hyſcus in Cappadocia: but the people were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably rough and uncivilized, ſo that it is no wonder that he at laſt fell a victim to their ferocity; though this did not happen till after he had long indefatigably laboured in the vineyard of his great Maſter, and brought over vaſt numbers to an acknowledgment and reception of the truth.</p>
               <p>WE are not told by what kind of death this apoſtle left the regions of mortality, and ſealed the truth of the goſpel he had ſo aſſiduouſly preached with his blood. Dorotheus ſays, he finiſhed his courſe at Sebaſtople, and was buried their near the temple of the ſun. An ancient martyrologiſt reports him to have been ſeized by the Jews, and as a blaſphemer, to have been ſtoned, and then beheaded: but the Greek offices, ſupported herein by ſeveral ancient breviaries, tell us, that he was crucified. His body is by ſome pretended to be now at Rome, where ſome relics of it are ſhewn with great veneration; while others contend, that it is at Triers in Germany. Bollandus is of opinion, that the body of Matthias, now at Rome, is that of Matthias, who was biſhop of Jeruſalem in the year 120, and whoſe hiſtory they have confounded with that of the apoſtle St. Matthias; but Popiſh legends and traditions are in no inſtance to be relied on.</p>

An anniverſary feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tival of her repreſentation in the temple is kept likewiſe on the twenty-firſt of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and it is commonly believed, that ſhe was conſecrated to God at three years of age: but not to build upon uncertainties, thus much we are aſſured by the teſtimony of an angel, that ſhe was happy above all other women in the divine favour; that ſhe was full of grace; and that the Lord was in a peculiar manner with her.</p>
               <p>WHETHER the holy virgin immediately after the annunciation, went up to the paſſover at Jeruſalem [as ſome have imagined, this being the ſeaſon of the year for it] or not, we have no account from the evangeliſt St. Luke: but this he aſſures us that a little while after ſhe ſet out for Hebron, a city in the mountains of Judah in order to viſit her couſin Elizabeth, to congratulate her upon her pregnancy, which ſhe had learned from the angel, at an age when ſuch a bleſſing was not uſually to be expected.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner had Mary entered the houſe, and began to ſpeak, than, upon Elizabeth's hearing the voice of her couſin's ſalutation, her child, young John the Baptiſt, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſupernatural emotions of joy, leaped in her womb: where upon ſhe was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and being by divine inſpiration acquainted with the myſtery of the incarnation, ſhe re-ſaluted Mary, and cried out. <hi>Bleſſed art thou amongſt women, and bleſſed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me? For lo, as ſoon as the voice of thy ſalutation ſounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

               <p>MARY having continued here about three months, till Elizabeth was delivered as St. Ambroſe thinks, that ſhe might ſee him on whoſe account ſhe principally made that viſit, returned afterwards to her own houſe at Nazareth, waiting for the time of her delivery: but when ſhe was ready to be delivered, an edict was publiſhed by Caeſar Auguſtus, in the year of the world 4000, the firſt of CHRIST, and the third before the vulgar Aera; which decreed, that all the ſubjects of the Roman empire ſhould go to the reſpective cities and places; there to have their names regiſtered according to their families. Thus Joſeph and Mary, who were both of the lineage of David, repaired to their city of Bethlehem, the original and native place of their family: but while they were in this city, the time being fulfilled in which Mary was to be delivered, ſhe brought forth her firſt-born ſon, wrapped him in ſwaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:029927_0407_0FE33B005C3AE5F0"/>
of the ſtable, whither they had retired; for they could find no place in public inn, becauſe of the great concourſe of people that were then at Bethlehem on the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; or they were forced to withdraw into the ſtable of the inn, not being able to get a more convenient place for her to be delivered in.</p>
               <p>THE angels made the birth of CHRIST known to the ſhepherds, who were at this time in the fields near Bethlehem, and who came in the night to ſee Mary and Joſeph, and the child lying in the manger, in order to pay him their tribute of adoration. Mary took notice of all theſe things, and laid them up in her heart. Some time after came the Magi, or wiſe men from the Eaſt, and brought to JESUS the myſterious preſents of gold, frankincenſe, and myrrh, having been directed thither by a ſtar which led the way before them to the very houſe where the babe lay. After this, being warned by an angel that appeared to them in a dream, they returned into their own country by a way different from that by which they came, without giving Herod the intelligence he wanted; which he pretended was in order to come and worſhip the babe, though his real deſign was to cut him off, from a jealouſy of his rivalling that artful monarch in his ſovereignty over the Jews.</p>
               <p>THE time of Mary's purification being now come, that is, forty days after the birth of JESUS, ſhe went to Jeruſalem, to preſent her ſon in the temple; and there to offer the ſacrifice appointed by the law, for the purification of women after child-birth. At that time there was at Jeruſalem an old man named Simeon, who was full of the Holy Ghoſt; and had received a ſecret aſſurance, that he ſhould not die till he had ſeen CHRIST the Lord: accordingly, he came into the temple by the impulſe of the Spirit of God, and taking the child JESUS in his arms, he bleſſed the Lord; and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to Mary, ſaid, <hi>This child is ſent for the raiſing and falling of many in Iſrael; and for a ſign which ſhall be ſpoken againſt:</hi> even ſo far as that thy own ſoul ſhall be pierced as with a ſword, that the ſecret thoughts in the hearts of many may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and laid open.</p>
               <p>WHEN Joſeph and Mary were preparing afterwards to return to their own country of Nazareth, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joſeph in a dream, bidding him to retire into Egypt with Mary and the child, becauſe Herod had a deſign to deſtroy JESUS. Joſeph obeyed the admonition, and continued in Egypt till after the death of Herod; when both he and Mary returned to Nazareth not daring to go to Bethlehem, becauſe it was in the juriſdiction of Archelaus, the ſon and ſucceſſor of Herod the great who was a cruel prince.</p>
               <p>NOW it being the conſtant practice of Joſeph and Mary to go every year to Jeruſalem, to the feaſt of the paſſover: and when JESUS was twelve years of age, they brought him with them to the capital. When the days of the feſtival were ended, they ſet out on their return home; but the child JESUS continued at Jeruſalem, without their perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and, thinking that he might be with ſome of the company, they went on a day's journey; when not finding him amongſt their acquaintance, they returned to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſeeking for him: three days after, they found him in the temple, ſitting amongſt the doctors, hearing them, and aſking them queſtions. When they ſaw him, they were filled with aſtoniſhment; and Mary ſaid to him, my ſon, why haſt thou ſerved us thus? Behold thy father and myſelf, who have ſought thee in great affliction. JESUS anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, Why did you ſeek me? Did not you know that I muſt be employed about my Father's buſineſs? afterwards he returned with them to Nazareth, and lived with filial ſubmiſſion to them: but his mother laid up all theſe things in her heart. The goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſays nothing more of the virgin Mary, till the marriage at Cana of Galilee, where ſhe was preſent with JESUS her ſon.</p>

                  <pb n="384" facs="unknown:029927_0408_0FE33B01E1E58D20"/>THE bleſſed JESUS, in the thirtieth year of the vulgar aera, reſolved to manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the world, and, therefore, went to be baptiſed by St. John, from thence into the wilderneſs, and thence to the above-mentioned wedding, to which he, with his mother and diſciples, had been invited. At this entertainment, the proviſion of wine being ſomewhat ſcanty (probably becauſe the friends of the married couple were but mean) CHRIST's mother told her ſon, they had no wine, not doubting of his power to ſupply them: to which JESUS anſwered in terms which had ſome appearance of a rebuke, <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIX great ſtone pitchers being in the room, JESUS ordered them to be filled brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water; and afterwards commanded the ſervants to fill out and carry it to the maſter of the feaſt, who, on taſting it, found it to be excellent wine. This is the firſt miracle JESUS wrought at the beginning of his public miniſtry; and from hence our Lord went to Capernaum with his mother and brethren.</p>
               <p>IT is true, we learn from the third chapter of St. Mark, that on a certain day in the year of CHTIST thirty-four, and vulgar aera thirty-one, that as JESUS CHRIST was teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a houſe at Capernaum, ſo great a crowd of people ſtood about him, that neither he nor his diſciples had time to take any refreſhment; which cauſed a report to be ſpread abroad, that he had fainted away, or fallen into a ſwoon. The virgin and the brethren or relations of JESUS came to ſee what had given occaſion to this report; and when they could not get into the houſe for the throngs of people, they cauſed a meſſage to be conveyed from one to another, till it was told JESUS, "That his mother and his brethren were at the door, and deſired to ſpeak with him." JESUS being accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their coming, and that they waited to ſpeak with him, being at that inſtant engaged in the work of his miniſtry, preaching the word of God, he made this reply, <hi>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</hi> And looking upon thoſe that were round about him, he ſaid, <hi>Theſe are my mother and brethren;</hi> declaring, <hi>That whoſoever did the will of his heavenly Father, the ſame was his mother, and ſiſter, and brother.</hi> This was what CHRIST had taught in another place, that we muſt perfer God to all human rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and give the preference to his ſervice: but this ſaying could not reflect upon his mother, who was amongſt the principle of thoſe who did the will of his heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY upon Mary's approach, a woman of the company ſaid with a loud voice, directing her words to JESUS: <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked.</hi> To which he replied, <hi>Yea, rather bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.</hi> Not intimating hereby, that ſhe who had the honour to hear him, did not deſerve to be called bleſſed throughout all generations; but that even her happineſs conſiſted more in doing the will of CHRIST than in giving him a human body, which was indeed not her own act, but effected by the power of God.</p>
               <p>WE have no further account of the holy virgin from this time, till we find her in Jeruſalem at the laſt paſſover our Saviour celebrated there; which was in the thirty-ſixth year of CHRIST, and thirty-third of the vulgar aera. In this city ſhe ſaw all that was tranſacted againſt him, followed him to Mount Calvary, and ſtayed at the foot of the croſs during the paſſion of her bleſſed Son. We cannot doubt but her ſoul was at this time pierced through, as old Simeon had propheſied, with the moſt acute pains, for the death of ſuch a Son. Yet her conſtancy was remarkable: for when the apoſtles were all frightened away from their Maſter, ſhe, with a courage undaunted, and worthy of the mother of CHRIST, continued even in the midſt of the executioners, being prepared to die with her Son, who was now become her Saviour; who being now
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:029927_0409_0FE33B03655B56D8"/>
ready to leave the world, and ſeeing his mother at the foot of the croſs, and his beloved diſciple St. John near her, he bequeathed her to him by his laſt will and teſtament, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his mother, <hi>Woman, behold thy Son;</hi> and to his diſciple, <hi>Behold thy mother.</hi> And from that hour the diſciple took her home to his own houſe, and provided for her.</p>
               <p>SOME authors of the fifth century think the virgin Mary died and was buried at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, or rather in her ſepulchre at Gethſemane, near that city, where, to this day, it is ſhewn in a magnificent church dedicated to her.</p>
               <p>THE ancient fathers of the Eaſtern and Weſtern churches, aſſerted her perpetual virginity, and St. Auguſtine tells us, that this is one of thoſe points which we ought to receive as of apoſtolic tradition, ſince the Holy Scripture gives us no more account of it, than by only remarking how fully the bleſſed virgin was reſolved to ſerve God with an entire purity. The title which hath been conſtantly appropriated to her in all ages, as often as ſhe is mentioned, is a good argument to confirm our belief concerning this: See Ezek. xliv.2.</p>

               <p>MARY, the ſiſter of Lazarus, with her ſiſter Martha, lived with their brother at Bethany, a village near Jeruſalem, Our dear Redeemer had a particular affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this family, and often retired to their houſe with his diſciples. One day (and perhaps the firſt time that JESUS went thither) Martha received him with remarkable affection, and took abundance of pains in providing a proper entertainment for him; but Mary her ſiſter continued ſitting at her Saviour's feet, liſtening to his words with peculiar attention. This Martha conſidered as an inſtance of diſreſpect, and therefore ſaid to JESUS, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone? Bid her, therefore, that ſhe help me.</hi> But our Lord juſtified Mary, by telling her ſiſter; that ſhe had choſen the better part, which ſhe ſhould never be deprived of.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS their brother, ſome time after this, fell ſick, and his ſiſters ſent to acquaint JESUS of the misfortune; but he did not arrive at Bethany till after Lazarus was dead.

believeſt thou this?</hi> Martha anſwered, <hi>Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God, which ſhould come into the world.</hi> Having ſaid this, ſhe departed, and gave her ſiſter notice privately, that JESUS was come. Mary, as ſoon as ſhe heard the welcome tidings, aroſe and went to JESUS: and, as Martha had done before her, ſaid, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> The bleſſed JESUS was greatly moved at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic complaints of theſe worthy ſiſters, and on aſking where they had buried him, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the ſepulchre.

               <p>DURING the ſupper at Bethany, Mary, to expreſs her gratitude to JESUS, took a pound of ſpikenard, a very precious perfume, and poured it on the head and feet of JESUS, wiping his feet with the hair of her head: and the whole houſe was filled with the odour of the ointment. Judas Iſcariot was highly offended at this generous action: but his Maſter vindicated Mary, and told him, that by this ſhe had performed an act preparatory to his embalment, ſignifying, that his death and burial were not far off.

               <p>THIS diſciple is mentioned by St. Paul in his epiſtle to the Philippians, where the apoſtle ſays, that Clement's name is written in the book of life. The generality of the fathers, and other interpreters, make no queſtion but that this is the ſame Clement who ſucceeded St. Peter, after Linus and Cletus, in the government of the church of Rome; and this ſeems to be intimated, when in the office for St. Clement's

On the contrary, Grocius is of opinion, that the Clement St. Paul ſpeaks of was no more than a prieſt of the church of Philippi in Macedonia. We have no certain accounts of what happened to St. Clement during the perſecution under Domitian; but we are very well aſſured that he lived to the third year of Trajan, which is the hundreth of JESUS CHRIST. His feſtival is ſet down by Bede, and all the Latin martyrologiſts, on the twenty-third of November. The Greeks honour him on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of the ſame month.

               <p>HHIS remarkable diſciple of our bleſſed Saviour was a Jew by nation, and by ſect a Phariſee. The goſpel calls him a ruler of the Jews; and CHRIST gives him the name of a maſter of Iſrael. When our Saviour began to manifeſt himſelf by his miracles at Jeruſalem, at the firſt paſſover which he celebrated there after his baptiſm, Nicodemus made no doubt but that he was the Meſſiah, and came to him by night, that he might learn of him the way to ſalvation.</p>

It happened on a time, that the prieſts and Phariſees had ſent officers to ſeize JESUS, who returned to them, and made this report, that never man ſpoke as he did. Afterwards, Nicodemus declared himſelf openly a diſciple of JESUS CHRIST, when he came with Joſeph of Arimathea to pay the laſt duties to the body of CHRIST, crucified; which they took down from the croſs, embalmed, and laid in the ſepulchre prepared for his reception.</p>

               <head>TITUS, A GENTILE CONVERT.</head>
               <p>THIS eminent perſon was a Heathen by religion and birth, but converted by St. Paul, who calls him his ſon. Titus was ſent by St. Paul to Corinth, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome diſputes which then divided the church. He was very well received by the Corinthians, and very much ſatisfied with their ready compliance; but would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from them, imitating thereby the diſintereſtedneſs of his Maſter, who ſought not theirs, but them.</p>
               <p>HE went from Corinth to St. Paul into Macedonia, and gave him an account of the ſtate of the Corinthian church. A little while after, the apoſtle deſired him to return again to Corinth, to ſet things in order againſt his coming. Titus readily undertook this journey, and departed immediately carrying with him St. Paul's ſecond letter to the Corinthians.</p>
               <p>TITUS was made biſhop of the iſle of Crete, about the ſixty-third year of CHRIST, when St. Paul was obliged to quit this iſland, in order to take care of the other church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The following year he wrote to him to deſire, that as ſoon as he ſhould have ſent Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus or Artemas to him for ſupplying his place in Crete, Titus would come to him to Nicopolis in Macedonia, or to Nicopolis in Epirus upon the gulf of Ambracia, where the apoſtle intended to paſs his winter. The ſubject of this epiſtle is to repreſent to Titus what are the qualities that a biſhop ſhould be endued with.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL's epiſtle to Titus has always been acknowledged by the church. The Marcionities did not receive it, nor did the Baſilidians, and ſome other Heretics; but Tatian, the head of the Encratites, received it, and preferred it before all the reſt. It is not certainly known by whom it was ſent nor from what place it was written.</p>
               <p>IT appears, that Titus was deputed to preach the goſpel in Dalmatia; and he was ſtill there in the year ſixty-five, when the apoſtle wrote his ſecond epiſtle to Timothy. He died at the age of Ninety-four, and was buried in Crete. His feſtival is kept by the Greeks on the 25th of Auguſt, and on the 4th of January by the Latin church.</p>

               <p>WE take notice of theſe particulars, becauſe St. Paul commends their piety, and the good education which they had given Timothy. When St. Paul came to Derbe and Lyſtra about the year of CHRIST fifty-one or fifty-two, the brethren gave a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous teſtimony of the merit and good diſpoſitions of Timothy; and the apoſtle would have him along with him; but he circumciſed him at Lyſtra, before he received him into his company.</p>

When he came to Athens, he ſent to Timothy to come thither to him; and when he was come, and had given him an account of the churches of Macedonia, St. Paul ſent him back to Theſſalonica, from whence he afterwards returned with Silas, and came to St. Paul at Corinth. There he continued with him, and the apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions him with Silas, at the beginning of the two epiſtles, which he then wrote to the church at Theſſalonica. In the year ſixty-three, when St. Paul wrote to the Hebrews, he tells them that Timothy was come out of priſon; but he gives us no circumſtances either of the impriſonment of this diſciple, or of his releaſe. In ſixty-four, when St. Paul returned from Rome, he left Timothy at Epheſus, to take care of that church, of which he was the firſt Biſhop, as he is recognized by the council of Chalcedon. St. Paul wrote to Timothy from Macedonia, the firſt of the two letters which are addreſſed to him.</p>
               <p>WE may ſafely affirm, that if he did not die before the year ninety-ſeven, he muſt be the angel of the church of Epheſus, to whom St. John writes, Rev. ii.2—5: though the reproaches which the Holy Ghoſt make to him, &amp;c. of having left his firſt love, do not ſeem to belong to ſo holy a man as Timothy was.</p>

However, he was remarkably zealous for the cauſe of religion, and full of the Holy Ghoſt; working many wonderful mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles before the people, and preſſing them with the greateſt earneſtneſs to embrace the doctrines of the goſpel of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THE Jews were highly provoked at the zeal of Stephen, and ſome of the ſynagogue of the freed men of Cyrenia, Alexandria, and other places, entered into diſpute with him; but being unable to reſiſt the wiſdom and ſpirit by which he ſpake, they ſuborned falſe witneſſes againſt him, to teſtify that they heard him blaſpheme againſt Moſes and againſt God. Nor did they ſtop here: they ſtirred up the people by their calumnies: ſo that they dragged him before the council of the nation, or great Sanhedrim, where they produced falſe witneſſes againſt him, who depoſed, that they had heard him ſpeak againſt the temple, and againſt the law, and affirm that JESUS of Nazareth would deſtroy the holy place, and aboliſh the law of Moſes. Stephen, ſupported by his own innocence, and an inviſible Power from on high, appeared undaunted in the midſt of this aſſembly, and his countenance ſhone like that of an angel.</p>
               <p>THE Jewiſh council were ſo highly enraged at the ſpeech of Stephen, eſpecially the latter part of it, that they gnaſhed their teeth againſt him: but Stephen lifting up his eyes to heaven, ſaw the glory of God, and JESUS ſtanding at the right hand of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence; upon which, he ſaid to the council, <hi>I ſee the heavens open, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God.</hi> This ſo greatly provoked the Jews, that they cried out with one voice, and ſtopped their ears, as if they had heard ſome dreadful blaſphemy; and falling upon him, they dragged him out of the city, and ſtoned him to death.</p>
               <p>IT is related in Scripture, that St. Stephen, while they were mangling his body with ſtones, was praying to God for their pardon. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> And then calling on his dear Redeemer to receive his ſpirit, he yielded up his ſoul.

               <p>BE that as it may, when the diſpute happened between Paul and Barnabas, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in a rupture, Silas joined himſelf to Paul, and became his companion and aſſiſtant in the great work of preaching the goſpel to the Gentiles.

               <p>DEPARTING from Philippi, they travelled to Theſſalonica and Berea, where they preached the doctrines of the goſpel; and Paul continuing his journey to Athens: ſent Silas thither, though they did not meet till they both arrived at Corinth, where St. Paul wrote his two epiſtles to the Theſſalonian church.</p>

               <p>IT is ſuppoſed that St. Philip was a native of Caeſarea in Galilee, it being certain that his daughters lived in that city; however, he was one of the ſeven deacons choſen by the apoſtles ſoon after our Saviour's reſurrection.</p>
               <p>ALL the Chriſtians, except the apoſtles, having, after the death of St. Stephen, left Jeruſalem, and diſperſed themſelves in ſeveral parts, St. Philip went down to preach the goſpel at Samaria, where he wrought many miracles, and converted great numbers to the faith; he alſo baptized them, but being only a deacon, could not adminiſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's ſupper.</p>
               <p>IT is probable St. Philip was at Samaria when the angel directed him to go towards the South, to the road that leads from Jeruſalem to Old Gaza, an ancient city in the route to Egypt. Philip obeyed the ſummons of the heavenly meſſenger, and there met with an Ethiopian eunuch, belonging to Candace, queen of Ethiopia; a perſon who was highly eſteemed by his miſtreſs, as well as intruſted with the care of all her revenues, and who had been at Jeruſalem, to worſhip the Almighty in that city.</p>
               <p>WHEN the chariot of this Ethiopian appeared in the ſight of Philip, the angel bid him advance towards the ſtranger: he immediately obeyed, and heard the eunuch, reading a paſſage of the prophet Iſaiah; upon which Philip aſked him, if he underſtood what he was reading? And the eunuch anſwered, How ſhould I underſtand, except ſome perſon ſhould explain it to me; deſiring Philip, that he would come and ſit down by him in the chariot. The paſſage he read was this; <hi>He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter; and as
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:029927_0418_0FE33B20C2605A48"/>
a lamb before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> Having finiſhed this paſſage, the eunuch deſired to know whom the prophet intended: "Is it, ſays he, himſelf the prophet here means, or ſome other man." In anſwer to the queſtion propoſed by the eunuch, Philip began to inſtruct him concerning the Redeemer of the world, the man CHRIST JESUS; and afterwards baptized him, and he became a member of the church of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THE ſacred writers are ſilent with regard to the actions of St. Philip, after the time of his baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch—but the Greek eccleſiaſtical writers ſay, that he left Paleſtine and travelled to Tralles, in the Leſſer Aſia, where he founded a church, of which he was both the biſhop and apoſtle; and where, after long labouring in the vineyard of his Maſter, and working many miracles, he ſlept in peace, and was buried in the church he had cauſed to be erected.</p>
               <p>HAVING now given the moſt ample account poſſible of the followers of the bleſſed JESUS, the perſons who ſpread the light of the glorious goſpel over the whole world, removed the veil of ignorance and ſuperſtition drawn over the kingdoms of the earth, and taught us the method of attaining eternal happineſs in the courts of the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem—may it be our higheſt ambition to follow their bright example, as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed CHRIST; may we imitate their faith, piety, hope, and love: then ſhall we paſs through things temporal in ſuch a manner, that we ſhall finally gain the things that are eternal, and be admitted as worthy gueſts at the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb, to adore and praiſe him, and live and reign with him in his heavenly kingdom for ever and ever.

               <p>IT may with ſome degree of truth be affirmed, that the church of Jeruſalem was founded by our Lord himſelf, as it was for ſome time cultivated and improved by the miniſtry of the whole college of apoſtles.

Ephrem, or, Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hres, or, as Epiphanius ſtyles him, Vaphres, two. 14. Joſeph, two. 15. Judas, two. We may obſerve, that moſt of theſe biſhops governed the church but a ſhort time, following one another with a very quick ſucceſſion; which, doubtleſs, was in a great meaſure owing to the turbulent and unquiet humour of the Jewiſh nation, frequently rebelling againſt the Roman powers, whereby they provoked them to fall heavy upon them, and cut off all that came in their way, making no diſtinction between Jews and Chriſtians; as indeed they were all Jews, though differing in the rites of their religion: for hithereto the biſhops of Jeruſalem had ſucceſſively been of the circumſion, the church there having been entirely made up of Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his time Narciſſus, as one from the dead, returned from his place of retirement, and was importuned by the people again to take the government of the church upon him; being highly reverenced by them, both for his ſtrict and philoſophical courſe of life, and the ſignal vengeance which God took of his accuſers: and in this ſecond adminiſtration he continued ten years, ſuffering martyrdom when he was near an hundred and twenty years old.

and this cruel fact mentioned by Macrobius, a Heathen author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark or doubt upon it. "That our Saviour had been in Egypt:" this, Celſus, though he raiſes a monſtrous ſtory upon it, is ſo far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. "That Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea; that our Saviour was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:" this is recorded by Tacitus. "That many miraculous cures and works, out of the ordinary courſe of nature, were wrought by him:" this is confeſſed by Julian the apoſtate Porphyry, and Hierocles, all of them not only Pagans, but profeſſed enemies and perſecutors of Chriſtianity.

"That St. Peter, whoſe miracles are many of them recorded in holy writ, did many wonderful works," is owned by Julian, the apoſtate, who therefore repreſents him as a great magician, and one who had in his poſſeſſion a book of magical ſecrets left him by our Saviour. "That the devils or evil ſpirits were ſubject to them," we may learn from Porphyry, who objects to Chriſtianity, that ſince JESUS had began to be worſhipped, Aeſculapius and the reſt of the gods did no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men: nay, Celſus himſelf affirms the ſame thing in effect, when he ſays, that the power which ſeemed to reſide in Chriſtians proceeded from the uſe of certain names, and the invocation of certain daemon's ; Origin remarks on this paſſage, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doubtleſs hints at thoſe Chriſtians who put to flight evil ſpirits and healed thoſe who were poſſeſſed with them; a fact which had been often ſeen, and which he himſelf had ſeen, as he declares in another part of his diſcourſe againſt Celſus. But at the ſame time, he aſſures by the uſe of no other name but that of JESUS, to which were added ſeveral paſſages in his hiſtory, but nothing like any invocation to daemons.</p>
               <p>CELSUS was ſo hard ſet with the report of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atteſtations concerning him, that though he often intimates he did not believe them to be true, yet knowing he might be ſilenced in ſuch an anſwer, provides himſelf with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retreat, when beaten out of this, namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of ſo many thouſands, at two different time, with a few loaves and fiſhes, to the magical feaſts of thoſe Egyptian impoſtors, who would preſent their ſpectators with vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               <p>THE unconverted Heathens, who were preſſed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving Jews, who had actully ſeen them, were
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:029927_0425_0FE33B37B5890460"/>
driven to account for them after the ſame manner; for, to work by magic, in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then way of ſpeaking, was, in the language of the Jews, to caſt out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who new that unbelievers, in all ages, would put this perverſe interpretation on his miracles, has branded the malignity of thoſe men, who, contrary to the dictates of their own hearts ſtarted ſuch an unreaſonable objection, as a blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and declared not only the guilt, but the puniſhment of ſo black a crime. At the ſame time, he condeſcended to ſhew the vanity and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this objection againſt his miracles, by repreſenting, that they evidently tended to the deſtruction of thoſe powers, to whoſe aſſiſtance the enemies of his doctrine then aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. An argument which,if duly weighed, renders the objection ſo very frivolous and groundleſs that we may venture to call it even blaſphemy againſt common ſenſe. It would be abſurd to imagine, that evil ſpirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their correſpondence and intercourſe with mankind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting themſelves to thoſe rites and ceremonies, which had done them ſo much honour. We ſee the early effect which Chriſtianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that number of books which were filled with the ſecrets of magic, and made a ſacrifice to Chriſtianity by the converts mentioned in the Acts of the apoſtles. We have likewiſe an eminent inſtance of the inconſiſtency of our religon with magic, in the hiſtory of the famous Aquila. This perſon, who was a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the emperor Trajan, and likewiſe a man of great learning, notwithſtanding he had embraced Chriſtianity, could not be brought off from the ſtudies of magic, by the repeated admonitions of his fellow Chriſtians; ſo that at length they expelled him their ſociety, as rather chooſing to loſe the reputation of ſo conſiderable a proſelyte, than communicate with one who dealt in ſuch dark and infernal practices. Beſides, we may obſerve, that all the favourers of magic were the moſt profeſſed and bitter enemies to the Chriſtian religion; not to mention Simon Magus and many others, we ſhall only take notice of thoſe two great perſecutors of Chriſtianity, the emperors Adrian and Julian the apoſtate, both of them initiated in the myſteries of divination, and ſkilled in all the depths of magic.—We ſhall only add, that evil ſpirits cannot be ſuppoſed to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>red in the eſtabliſhment of a religion, which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they poſſeſſed, and diveſted them of their influence on mankind; nor would we mention this particular, though it be Chriſtian authors, did it not appear from the authorities above cited, that this was a fact confeſſed by Heathens themſelves.</p>
               <p>WHEN a man is born under Chriſtian parents, and trained up in the profeſſion of that religion from a child, he generally guides himſelf by the rules of the Chriſtian faith, in believing what is delivered by the evangeliſts; the learned Pagans of antiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they became Chriſtians, were only guided by the common rules of hiſtorical faith; that is they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in common fame, tradition, and the writings of thoſe perſons who related them, together with the number, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of thoſe perſons; and being convinced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all accounts, that they had the ſame reaſon to believe the hiſtory of our Saviour, as that of any other perſon to which they themſelves were not actually eye-witneſſes, they were bound by all the rules of hiſtorical faith, and of right reaſon to give credit to this hiſtory. This they did accordingly, and in conſequence of it, publiſhed the ſame truths themſelves, ſuffered many afflictions, and very often death itſelf, in the aſſertion of them. But while we affirm, an hiſtorical belief of the acts of our Saviour might induce theſe learned Pagans to embrace his doctrine, we do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his precepts, the fulfilling of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, the miracles of his diſciples, the irreproachable lives and magnanimous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their followers, with other conſiderations of the ſame nature; but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or leſs with philoſophers of that age, it is
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:029927_0426_0FE33B393923CAD8"/>
certain that a belief in the hiſtory of our Saviour was one motive with every new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very baſis and foundation of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>A learned man of our nation, who examined the writings of our moſt ancient fathers, refers to ſeveral paſſages in Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens of Alexandria, Origen, and Cyprian, by which he plainly ſhews, that each of theſe early writers, aſcribed to the four evangeliſts by name their reſpective hiſtories; ſo that there is not the leaſt room for doubting of their belief in the hiſtory of our Saviour, as recorded in the goſpels. We ſhall only add that three of the five fathers here mentioned, and probably four, were Pagans converted to Chriſtianity, as they were all of them very inquiſitive and deep in the knowledge of Heathen learning and philoſophy.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL of theſe therefore, when they had informed themſelves of our Saviour's hiſtory, and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and followers, were ſo ſtruck and convinced, that they profeſſed themſelves, of the fact; notwithſtanding, by this profeſſion in that juncture of time, they bid farewell to all the pleaſures of this life renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted courſe of ſeverities, and expoſed themſelves to the public hatred and contempt, to ſufferings of all kinds, and to death itſelf. Of this ſort we may reckon thoſe three early converts to Chriſtianity, who each of them was a member of a ſenate famous for its wiſdom and learning. Joſeph the Arimathein, was of the Jewiſh Sanhedrim: Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, of the Athenian Areopagus; and Flavius Clemens, of the Roman ſenate; nay at the time of his death, conſul of Rome.</p>
               <p>TERTULLIAN tells the Roman governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, ſenate, and courts of judicature were filled with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; as Arnobius aſſerts, that men of the fineſt parts and learning, oratory, gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, rhetoricians, lawyers, phyſicians, philoſophers, deſpiſing the ſentiments they had been once fond of, took up their reſt in the Chriſtian religion; and who can imagine, that men of this character did not thoroughly inform themſelves of the hiſtory of that perſon whoſe doctrines they embraced?</p>
               <p>BESIDES innumerable authors that are loſt, we have the undoubted names, works, or fragments of ſeveral Pagan philoſophers, which ſhew them to have been as learned as any unconverted Heathen authors of the age in which they lived. If we look into the greateſt nurſeries of learning in thoſe ages of the world, we find in Athens, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Quadratus, Ariſtides, and Athenagoras; and in Alexandria, Dionyſius, Clemans, Ammonius, and to whom we may add Origen; for though his father was a Chriſtian martyr, he became without all controverſy, the moſt learned and able philoſopher of his age, by his education at Alexandria, in that famous ſeminary of arts and ſciences.</p>
               <p>HEATHENS of every age, ſex, and quality, born in the moſt different climates, and bred up under the moſt different inſtitutions, when they ſaw men of plain ſenſe without the help of learning, armed with patience and courage, inſtead of wealth, pomp or power, expreſſing in their lives thoſe excellent doctrines of morality, which they taught as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them from our Saviour, averring that they had ſeen his miracles during his life, and converſed with him after his death; when they ſaw no ſuſpicion of falſehood, treachery, or worldly intereſt, in their behaviour and converſation, and that they ſubmitted to the moſt ignominious and cruel deaths, rather than retract their teſtimony, or even be ſilent in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they were to publiſh by their Saviour's eſpecial command, there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of the veracity of thoſe facts which they related, or of the divine miſſion in which they were employed,</p>
               <p>A few perſons of an odious and deſpiſed country, could not have filled the world with believers, had they not ſhewn undoubted credentials from the divine Perſon who ſent them on ſuch a meſſage. Accordingly, we are aſſured, that they were inveſted with
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:029927_0427_0FE33B44A030FF50"/>
the power of working miracles, which was the moſt ſhort and the moſt convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that could be produced, and the only one that was adapted to the reaſon of all mankind, to the capacities of the wiſe and ignorant, and could overcome every cavil and every prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the ſick, and raiſed the dead, when it was publiſhed by thoſe who themſelves often did the ſame miracles, in their preſence, and in his name? Could any reaſonable perſon imagine, that God Almighty would arm men with ſuch powers to authorize a lie, and eſtabliſh a religion in the world which was diſpleaſing to him, or that evil ſpirits would lend them ſuch an effectual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to beat down vice and idolatry.</p>
               <p>WHEN the apoſtles had formed many aſſemblies in ſeveral parts of the Pagan world, who gave credit to the glad-tidings of the goſpel, that, upon their departure, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what they had related might not periſh, they appointed out of theſe new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, men of the beſt ſenſe and of the moſt unblemiſhed lives, to preſide over theſe ſeveral aſſemblies, and to inculcate without ceaſing, what they had heard from the mouths of theſe eye-witneſſes.</p>
               <p>THE ſucceſſion of biſhops was quick in the three firſt centuries, becauſe the biſhop very often ended in the martyr : for when a perſecution aroſe in any place, the firſt fury of it fell upon this order of holy men, who abundantly teſtified by their deaths and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that they did not undertake theſe offices out of any temporal views, that they were ſincere and ſatisfied in the belief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhered to what they had received from the apoſtles, as laying down their lives in the ſame hope, and upon the ſame principles. None can be ſuppoſed ſo utterly regardleſs of their own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as to expire in torment, and hazard their eternity, to ſupport any fables and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own, or any forgeries of their predeceſſors who had preſided in the ſame church, and which might have been eaſily detected by the tradition of that particular church, as well as by the concurring teſtimony of others. To this purpoſe, we think it is very remarkable, that there was not a ſingle martyr amongſt thoſe many heretics, who diſagreed with the apoſtolical church, and introduced ſeveral wild and abſurd notions into the doctrines of Chriſtianity. They durſt not ſtake their preſent and future happineſs on their own chimerical imaginations, and did not only ſhun perſecution, but affirmed, that it was unneceſſary for their followers to bear their religion through ſuch fiery trials.</p>
               <p>AMONGST the accounts of thoſe very few, out of innumerable multitudes who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity, we ſhall ſingle out four perſons eminent for their lives, their writings, and their ſufferings, that were ſucceſſively cotemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. John, who was the beloved diſciple, and converſed the moſt intimately with our Saviour, lived till A. D. 100. Polycarp, who was the diſciple of St. John, and had converſed with other of the apoſtles and diſciples of our Lord, lived till A. D. 167, though his life was ſhortened by martyrdom. Irenaeus, who was the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Polycarp, and had converſed with many of the immediate diſciples of the apoſtles, lived at the loweſt computation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewiſe cut o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>THE Chriſtians, who carried their religion through ſo many general and particular perſecutions, were inceſſantly comforting and ſupporting one another with the example and hiſtory of our Saviour and his apoſtles: it was the ſubject not only of their ſolemn aſſemblies, but of their private viſits and converſation. "Our virgins," ſays Tatian, who lived in the ſecond century, "diſcourſe over their diſtaffs on divine ſubjects." Indeed when religion was woven into the civil government, and flouriſhed under the protection of the emperors'
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:029927_0428_0FE33A9807336DF8"/>
men's thoughts and diſcourſes were, as they are now, full of ſecular affairs; but in the three firſt centuries of Chriſtianity, men who embraced this religion, had given up all their intereſts in this world, and lived in a perpetual preparation for the next, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſoon they might be called to it: ſo that they had little elſe to talk of but the life and doctrines of that divine Perſon which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory.</p>
               <p>WE cannot imagine, that there was a ſingle perſon arrived at any degree of age or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, who had not heard and repeated above a thouſand times in his life, all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of our Saviour's birth, life, death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion; eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they could not then be received as Chriſtians, till they had undergone ſeveral exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Perſons of riper years, who flocked daily into the church during the three firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, were obliged to paſs through many repeated inſtructions, and give a ſtrict account of their proficiency, before they were admitted to baptiſm. And as for thoſe who were born of Chriſtians parents and had been baptized in their infancy, they were, with the like care, prepared and diſciplined for confirmation, which they could not arrive at, till they were found upon examination to have made a ſufficient progreſs in the knowledge of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>WE muſt further obſerve, that there was not only in thoſe times this religious converſation amongſt private Chriſtians, but a conſtant correſpondence between the churches that were eſtabliſhed by the apoſtles or their ſucceſſors, in the ſeveral parts of the world. If any new doctrine was ſtated, or any fact reported of our Saviour, a ſtrict inquiry was made amongſt the churches, eſpecially thoſe planted by the apoſtles themſelves, whether they had received any ſuch doctrine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the apoſtles, or the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had preceded the preſent members of the churches, which were thus conſulted. By this means, when any novelty was publiſhed, it was immediately detected and cenſured.</p>
               <p>ST. JOHN, who lived ſo many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in thoſe emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, as the living oracle of the church; and as his oral teſtimony laſted the firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, many have obſerved, that, by a particular providence of God, ſeveral of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's diſciples, and of the early converts of his religion, lived to a very great age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might perſonally convey the truth of the goſpel to thoſe times, which were very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the firſt publication of it. Of theſe, beſides St. John we have a remarkable inſtance in Simeon, who was one of the ſeventy ſent forth by our Saviour, to publiſh the goſpel before his crucifixion, and a near kinſman to our Lord.</p>
               <p>THIS venerable perſon, who had probably heard with his own ears, our Saviour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, preſided over the church eſtabliſhed in that ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He lived till the year of our Lord 107, when he was martyred under the emperor Trajan.</p>
               <p>IRENAEUS very aptly remarks, that thoſe barbarous nations, who in his time were not poſſeſſed of the written goſpels, and had only learned the hiſtory of our Saviour from thoſe who had converted them to Chriſtianity before the goſpels were written, had amongſt them the ſame accounts of our Saviour, which are to be met with in the four evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; an inconteſtable proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy ſcripture and the tradition of the churches in thoſe early times of Chriſtianity. Thus we ſee what opportunities the learned and inquiſitive Heathens had of informing themſelves of the truth of our Saviour's hiſtory, during the three firſt centuries, eſpecially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountain-head; beſides which there were many uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted traditions, records of Chriſtianity, and particular hiſtories, that then threw light into theſe matters, but are now entirely loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="unknown:029927_0429_0FE33B47F48553E8"/>WE cannot omit that which appears to us a ſtanding miracle in the three firſt centuries, namely, that amazing and ſupernatural courage or patience which was ſhewn by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitudes of martyrs, in thoſe ſlow and painful torments that were inflicted on them. We cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at Lyons, amidſt the inſults and mockeries of a crowded amphitheatre, and ſtill keeping his ſeat; or ſtretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his ſoul amongſt the exquiſite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of ſuch a tedious execution, rather than renounce his religion, or blaſpheme his Saviour. Such trials ſeem to us above the ſtrength of human nature, and able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear duty, reaſon, faith, conviction, nay, and the moſt abſolute certainty of a future ſtate. Humanity unaſſiſted in an extraordinary manner, muſt have ſhaken off the preſent preſſure, and have delivered itſelf out of ſuch a dreadful diſtreſs, by any means that could have been ſuggeſted to it. We can eaſily imagine, that many perſons, in ſo good a cauſe, might have laid down their lives at the gibbet, the ſtake, or the block: but to expire leiſurely amongſt the moſt exquiſite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental reſervation, or an hypocriſy, which was not without a poſſibility of being followed by a repentance and forgiveneſs, has ſomthing in it ſo far beyond the natural ſtrength of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that one cannot but think there was ſome miraculous power to ſupport the ſufferer.</p>
               <p>WE find the church of Smyrna, in that admirable letter which gives an account of the death of Poycap, their beloved biſhop, mentioning the cruel torments of other early mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Chriſtianity, are of opinion, that our Saviour ſtood by them in a viſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally converſed with them, to give ſtrength and comfort during the bitterneſs of their long-continued agonies; and we have the ſtory of a young man, who having ſuffered many tortures, eſcaped with life, and told his fellow Chriſtians, that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable, by the preſence of an angel who ſtood by him, wiped off the tears and ſweat, which ran down his face whilſt he lay under his ſufferings. We are aſſured, at leaſt, that the firſt martyr for Chriſtianity, was encouraged in his laſt moments, by a viſion of that divine Perſon, for whom he ſufferd, and into whoſe preſence he was then haſtening.</p>
               <p>IT is certain, that the deaths and ſufferings of the primative Chriſtians had a great ſhare in the converſion of thoſe learned Pagans, who lived in the ages of perſecution, which with ſome intervals and abatements, laſted near three hundred years after our Saviour. Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius, Arnobius, and others, tell us, that this firſt of all alarmed their curioſity, rouſed their attention, and made them ſeriouſly inquiſitive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with ſo much ſtrength, and overcome the fear of death, nay, raiſe an earneſt deſire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been affected by all the doctrines of thoſe philoſophers, whom they had thoroughly ſtudied, and who had been labouring at this great point. The ſight of theſe dying and tormented martyrs, engaged them to ſearch into the hiſtory and doctrines of him for whom they ſuffered.—The more they ſearched, the more they were convinced: till their conviction grew ſo ſtrong, that they themſelves embraced the ſame truths, and either actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readineſs to do it, rather than depart from them.</p>
               <p>THERE are predictions of our Saviour recorded by the evangeliſts, which were not completed till after their deaths, and had no likelihood of being ſo, when they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by our bleſſed Saviour.—Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they ſhould be brought before governors and kings for his ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the Gentiles, Math. x.18. with the other like prophecies, by which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that his diſciples were to be perſecuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="unknown:029927_0430_0FE33B4977603178"/>ORIGEN inſiſts with great ſtrength, on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, pronounced at a time, as he obſerves, when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by ſo many others, that we ſhall refer you to what this father has ſaid on the ſubject in his firſt book againſt Celſus. And as to the accompliſhment of this remarkable prophecy, ſhall only obſerve, that whoever reads the account given us by Joſephus, without knowing his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hiſtorian had nothing elſe in view but to adjuſt the event to the prediction.</p>
               <p>THE ancient Chriſtians were ſo entirely perſuaded of the force of our Saviour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and of the puniſhment which the Jews had drawn upon themſelves, and upon their children: for the treatment which the Meſſiah had received at their hands that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and diſperſed people, and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and an aſtoniſhment amongſt the nations, as they are to this day. In ſhort, that they had loſt their peculiarity of being God's people, which was now transferred to the body of Chriſtians, and which preſerved the church of CHRIST amongſt all the conflicts, difficulties, and perſecutions in which it was engaged, as it had preſerved the Jewiſh government and oeconomy for ſo many ages, whilſt it had the ſame truth and vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in it, notwithſtanding it was ſo frequently in danger of being utterly aboliſhed and deſtroyed. Origen, in his fourth book againſt Celſus, mentioning their being caſt out of Jeruſalem, to which their worſhip was annexed, deprived of their temple and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, their religious rites and ſolemnities, and ſcattered over the face of the earth, ventures to aſſure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince they had committed that horrid crime againſt the Saviour of the world. This was a bold aſſertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully re-eſtabliſhed in former times, when they were almoſt ſwallowed up, and in the moſt deſperate ſtate of deſolation, as in their deliverance out of the Babyloniſh captivity, and the oppreſſions of Antiochus Epiphanes: nay he knew that within leſs than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before his own time, the Jews had made ſuch a powerful effort for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment under Barchocab, in the reign of Adrian, as ſhook the whole Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: but he founded his opinion on a ſure word of prophecy, and on the puniſhment they had ſo juſtly incurred; and we find by a long experience of fifteen hundred years, that he was not miſtaken, nay, that his opinion gathers ſtrength daily, ſince the Jews are now at a greater diſtance from any probability of ſuch a re-eſtabliſhment, than they were when Origen wrote.</p>
               <p>IN the primitive times, the Chriſtian religion ſhewed its full force and efficacy on the minds of men, and many examples demonſtrated what great and generous ſouls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its proſelytes to a very high degree of perfection, and ſet them far above the pleaſures, and even the pains, of this life. It ſtrengthened the infirmity, and broke the fierceneſs of human nature. It lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the knowledge and worſhip of him that made them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the vicious with a rational devotion, a ſtrict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it ſpread through the world, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to change mankind into another ſpecies of beings. No ſooner was a convert initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it, but by an eaſy figure he became a new man, and both acted and looked upon himſelf as one re-generated and born a ſecond time into another ſtate of exiſtence.</p>
               <p>BUT we find no argument made a ſtronger impreſſion on the minds of theſe eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan converts, for ſtrengthening their faith in the hiſtory of our Saviour, than the predictions
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:029927_0431_0FE33B54460FC9D0"/>
relating to him in thoſe old prophetic writings, which were depoſited amongſt the hands of the greateſt enemies to Chriſtianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned Heathen converts were aſtoniſhed to ſee the whole hiſtory of their Saviour's life publiſhed before he was born, and to find that the evangeliſts and prophets, in their accounts of the Meſſiah, differed only in point of time, the one foretelling what ſhould happen to him, and the other deſcribing thoſe very particulars at what had actually happened. This our Saviour himſelf was pleaſed to make uſe of as the ſtrongeſt argument of his being the promiſed Meſſiah, and without it would hardly have reconciled his diſciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable paſſage which mentions his converſation with the two diſciples, on the day of his reſurrection, St. Luke xxiv.13. to the end. Beſides the Heathen converts after having travelled through all human learning, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and ſciences, were particularly qualified to examine theſe prophecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or propoſſeſſion; ſo as to eſtabliſh in their minds the firm belief of the truth and excellency of the Chriſtian religion, beyond the leaſt degree of a doubt concerning it.</p>
