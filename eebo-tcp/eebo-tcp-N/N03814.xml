            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

"It is a noble <hi>Poem,</hi> eſteem'd by very competent Judges, far to excel all that the Wit and Devotion of Man has ever wrote upon the <hi>Dominion</hi> of GOD manifeſt in the Works of Nature;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004695_0005_100DBADBD2AC6540"/>
if we only conſider it in the Brightneſs of Ideas and Ornaments of Diction."
<note n="*" place="bottom">HENRY's <hi>Expoſ.</hi>
               </note> It begins with giving <hi>Glory</hi> in the higheſt; <hi>O</hi> LORD <hi>my</hi> GOD, <hi>thou art very Great, thou art clothed with Honour and Majeſty; who covereſt thy ſelf with Light as with a Garment!</hi> And it draws to a cloſe with my Text, "<hi>The Glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall endure forever, the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall rejoice in his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or it may be read as a <hi>Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> being in the Imperative <hi>Mood, Let</hi> the Glory of the LORD endure forever; <hi>Let the Lord rejoice in his Works.</hi> q. d. "<hi>Amen,</hi> O LORD moſt great and gracious! It <hi>is</hi> ſo, it <hi>will</hi> be ſo, and ever <hi>may</hi> it be! <hi>Let</hi> the whole Earth ever give thee Glory.</p>
            <p>Every way the Words breathe a moſt fervent <hi>Dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi> upon the Contemplation and Recitation of the glorious Work of GOD thro' the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and expreſs a raptrous <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to Him thereon; "O may the LORD have <hi>Glory</hi> from us, and <hi>Joy</hi> in all his Creatures; and never more be <hi>grieved,</hi> as He once was, that he had <hi>made Man upon the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Words are <hi>more</hi> than a Prayer: They are an <hi>Affirmation</hi> of what ever was, is and ſhall be: "Thy <hi>Glory</hi> ſhall endure to Eternity, and thy <hi>Joy</hi> in all thy Works, in thy <hi>own</hi> unchangeable <hi>Complacency</hi> in them, which is infinitely more than all the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of Angels and Saints on the Account of 'em, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>It is only the latter Part of the <hi>Text</hi> I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, and to be ſure in a poor and <hi>low</hi> manner, on ſo <hi>high</hi> a Subject, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall rejoice in his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bleſſedneſs and Glory here aſcrib'd to GOD, is <hi>Joy.</hi> Glory and Bleſſedneſs, cannot be without Joy. They are eſſential to and inſeparable from each other:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004695_0006_100DBADD5A959290"/>And GOD is the <hi>bleſſed and only Potentate</hi> in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>Joy</hi> is perfect in <hi>all</hi> his Works. Never did King or Saint come near to this, no not <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory. He wrote <hi>Vanity</hi> of Vanities on his great Works, for he err'd and ſinn'd in his doing and uſing them. GOD's Works are all perfect; <hi>"They are Verity and Judgment, and are done in Truth and Uprightneſs";</hi> and the King of Glory has a perfect <hi>Joy</hi> in the Perfection of them all; his Works of <hi>Creation, Providence</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> A perfect Wiſdom, Holineſs, Goodneſs, Munificence, Benediction ſhines forth in them; ſo that ineffable, perfect, infinite <hi>Joy</hi> muſt be the conſtant Reſult. It can be no otherwiſe for ever and ever. It muſt be <hi>without Variableneſs or Shadow of Change.</hi> The invariable Cauſe and Reaſon muſt have an invariable Effect. Perfectneſs is the Cauſe, Bleſſedneſs and Fulneſs of Joy is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. There can be neither Addition or Diminution.</p>
            <p>Altho' my <hi>Text</hi> leads me more particularly to the Conſideration of GOD's Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> yet I will ſay ſomething alſo of the Work of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. GOD ever had, hath and will have a Divine ineffable <hi>Joy</hi> in his Work of <hi>Creation;</hi> in all and every Part of it.</p>
            <p>How <hi>manifold</hi> theſe are, we may ſee thro' the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which inſtances in GOD's making the <hi>Angels,</hi> ſtretching forth the <hi>Heavens,</hi> laying the Foundation of the <hi>Earth,</hi> covering it with the <hi>Deep,</hi> filling it with <hi>Springs</hi> of Water, clothing it with <hi>Graſs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> the Food of the <hi>Cattle,</hi> and the Dwelling of the <hi>Fowl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the <hi>Creation</hi> of all theſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us how GOD expreſſed his divine Joyes; He ſaw 'em all to be <hi>very good,</hi> perfect in their Kind, and he <hi>bleſſed</hi> them, reſted and inſtituted the weekly <hi>Sabbath;</hi> a holy perpetual <hi>Reſt</hi> to Man: —How could <hi>Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004695_0007_100DBAE1058E2268"/>and <hi>Joy</hi> be more expreſſed? No wonder that all his <hi>Angels ſang together,</hi> and all the <hi>Sons of GOD</hi> in one World and other <hi>ſhouted for Joy.</hi> Job. xxxviii. 7. They ſaw the <hi>Joy</hi> of GOD in every Thing that was made, and <hi>far</hi> into the Reaſons of it. But GOD only comprehends his own Work, and <hi>his</hi> Joy tranſcends theirs infinitely, as does his Knowledge and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man</hi> was the Joy of his GOD, in the Day of his Creation: <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeneſs, and let him have Dominion.</hi> GOD made an <hi>Eden</hi> for him, put him into the <hi>Garden</hi> of Pleaſure, and fill'd him with <hi>Joys</hi> in his holy and happy State. To give <hi>ſuch</hi> a Being, muſt be an unknown <hi>Joy</hi> to to him that gave it.</p>
            <p>When we ſee but a little into the Works of GOD, O what a <hi>Joy</hi> does it give us? When we conſider his <hi>Heavens, the Work of his Fingers, the Moon and Stars which He has created!</hi> When we look down on the ſpringing <hi>Wegetables</hi> in our Fields and Gardens, — "<hi>If GOD ſo clothe the Graſs!</hi> When we <hi>ſoar</hi> after the Fowl of Heaven, as on the ſtrong Wings of <hi>Eagles,</hi> or view the <hi>goodly Wings of the Peacock</hi> at our Door! When we go down to the <hi>Sea</hi> in Ships, and the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> or the <hi>Whale</hi> play about us; — <hi>There is that Leviathan!</hi> Or be it the more terrible <hi>Crocodile</hi> near the Shore, with the <hi>Things creeping innumerable both ſmall and great Beaſts,</hi> whereof our <hi>Context</hi> ſings: How do the Silver <hi>Shoals</hi> glitter on the Hook or in the Net as we draw them up!</p>
            <p>When we ſurvey the <hi>Animals</hi> upon the dry <hi>Land,</hi> both tame and wild, meek and fierce, from the <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Elephant,</hi> to the <hi>Mouſe</hi> and <hi>Worm;</hi> what ſurpriſing Pleaſures do the Varieties of wondrous Uſe and Beauty give to our Contemplative and devout Minds!—But yet when we raiſe our Eye upon <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and look in one another's <hi>Faces,</hi> and ſee each others <hi>Souls</hi> in our Eyes and Speech; how GOD has made the <hi>Duſt</hi> into Organs of <hi>Sight</hi> and Hearing, our Hands to work,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004695_0008_100DBAE322D396A0"/>and Tongues <hi>our Glory!</hi> How he has made our Minds and <hi>Souls</hi> to think and know, to admire, love and joy! to <hi>pray</hi> and praiſe and ſerve and be happy! to give <hi>Glory</hi> and Honour and Thanks to the Fountain of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, Perfection and Bleſſedneſs! — Above all, when we find our Selves <hi>capable</hi> of a Spiritual and Divine <hi>Joy,</hi> in caſting our ſelves before the <hi>Throne,</hi> and uttering the <hi>Songs</hi> of Heaven, from which the <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Spirits never reſt; <hi>Revel.</hi> iv. 8, 9. <q>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is and is to come! — Thou art worthy, to receive Glory and Honour and Power; for Thou haſt created all Things, and for thy Pleaſure they are and were created.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, when <hi>we</hi> may at any time feel within our ſelves, any part of <hi>their</hi> Pleaſure and Delight, in <hi>our</hi> Meditations on, and ſearching into the Things that GOD has made; what muſt we then conceive of the <hi>Joy of GOD</hi> in his creating them?</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed to contemplate, in a like, low and brief manner, the infinite and inceſſant <hi>Joy of GOD</hi> in his <hi>upholding, preſerving, ſupplying</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> all his Creatures.
