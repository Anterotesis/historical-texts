            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HOW great are the trophies of inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death! How honorable the tears of this great aſſembly! How expreſſive the ſymbols of public ſorrow, which every where attract the eye! ILLUSTRIOUS SHADE, couldeſt thou deſcend from the high ſeats of glory, thou wouldeſt liſten with complacence to the ſighs of a mourning EMPIRE.</p>
            <p>PIOUS gratitude, my FELLOW CITIZENS, has this day aſſembled us in the TEMPLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS. As men, we ought to retrace the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of our obligations; and as Chriſtians, it is our duty to imprint it on the tablet of memory. We have met to cultivate the beſt ſenſibilities of the ſoul; to indulge the luxury of ſympathy; to muſe on the recollection of greatneſs no more; and to embalm with our tears the URN OF THE VENERABLE WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>THIS example we were taught by ancient RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUBLICS. At the public funeral of thoſe ATHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANS, who were firſt ſlain in the war of PELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONNESUS, an Eulogy to their memory was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Pericles. It was to animate the living to imitate the virtues of the dead. Thus likewiſe, when the great ſoul of the firſt BRUTUS winged its flight to the enjoyment of celeſtial liberty, the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038623_0003_1012A9A5E848E978"/>
Councils of ROME ordained the moſt public teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of ſorrow; and female beauty, in grief for the loſs of its noble avenger, ſhrouded its charms in ſackcloth.</p>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born Feb. 11, 1732, O. S. His early youth gave proofs that he poſſeſſed no common mind. At the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he received a naval commiſſion; but paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal affection, or rather the deſtinies of Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him for a nobler fate. The ILLUSTRIOUS HERO, whom we this day celebrate, commenced his public career by a commiſſion to Canada, then under the dominion of FRANCE. He diſcharged this truſt with induſtry, intelligence, and addreſs. His military talents were firſt diſplayed in the field where fell the unfortunate Braddock: and here the tried courage of veterans confeſſed its inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to his youth. In 1759, diſeaſe threatened his precious life; but Virtue watched over her ſon, and he lived, that he might die with the bleſſings of millions. He progreſſed in life honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and honored. As an inſtructor in arms, a repreſentative of <hi>Freemen,</hi> and a guardian of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he ſhone conſpicuous. Fortune, virtue, and domeſtic joys,<note n="*" place="bottom">He married Mrs. Cuſtis, who is ſtill living.</note> were his friends, and all united to make him happy.</p>
            <p>ROUSED from theſe peaceful ſcenes by the voice of his country's wrongs, and placed by CONGRESS at the head of an army, ſcarcely in being, without arms, undiſciplined, and ſtrong only in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its cauſe, he accepted the truſt with that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038623_0004_1012A9AA1B6653F8"/>
modeſty, which is the companion of true greatneſs. When the important commiſſion was preſented him by the Preſident of Congreſs, on the ſucceſs of which, in the view of an ill-judging world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended his glory or his infamy, "Sir," ſaid he, "though I am truly ſenſible of the high honor done me in this appointment, yet I feel great diſtreſs, from a conſciouſneſs that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extenſive and important truſt. And leſt ſome unlucky event ſhould happen, unfavorable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered by ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery gentleman in the room, that I this day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, with the utmoſt ſincerity, that I do not think myſelf equal to the command I am hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored with."</p>
            <p>IN the proſecution of our great and glorious revolutionary war, what a field of triumph opens on the mind! I might ſhow our HERO ſtruggling with difficulties, which, to minds leſs than his, would have been inſuperable; I might point to him, great in victory, but greater in misfortune. With the fortitude of CAESAR, the prudence of FABIUS, and the unyielding virtue of OLD REGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUS, he ſternly buffetted the adverſe waves of war. And ye, his companions, ye noble defenders of our country's rights; while we weep over the tomb of your IMMORTAL CHIEF, your ſervices are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engraved on our hearts, and your honor will ever be dear to fame.</p>
            <p>AT the cloſe of the AMERICAN REVOLUTION, a circumſtance occurred, in which General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038623_0005_1012A9ABAAACB2A8"/>
diſplayed a moderation, fortitude, and patriotiſm, unrivalled in the moſt virtuous peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of antiquity. Deep diſcontent had pervaded the ranks of the army. This ſpirit threatened to deſtroy the TREE OF INDEPENDENCE, juſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into our ſoil, before we had taſted its fruit. Had not OUR HERO loved his country, more than the moſt ſplendid title of dignity; had he poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſoul like that of CAESAR; he would have ſeized this happy moment, and aſſumed the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Authority.</hi> He might then have been number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the ſucceſsful conquerors of others; but his glory aſpired to the more difficult, and far nobler conqueſt of himſelf. He aſſembled around him his veteran brothers; a tear, ſuch as angels ſhed at ſpectacles of human weakneſs, dropped on his venerable cheek; he ſpoke to them of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of emiſſaries, of the honor of ſoldiers, and of the duty of citizens. He ſpoke to the reaſon, but awoke every paſſion. He retired—it was the voice of their father, which they had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to obey; and they inſtantly <hi>Reſolved,</hi> THAT THE ARMY CONTINUED TO HAVE AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTICE OF CONGRESS AND THEIR COUNTRY.</p>
            <p>THIS great EXEMPLAR of precept had now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to crown his military, by a brilliant diſplay of civic virtues. VERNON'S EDEN received the AMERICAN CINCINNATUS; but its peaceful ſhades ſerved only to increaſe the luſtre of his laurels. It was the roof of hoſpitality, the delightful reſidence of ſentiment and virtue. Thither reſorted the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038623_0006_1012A9AD3A21A338"/>
Philoſopher and Traveller; for WASHINGTON was the <hi>Star,</hi> which attracted the "wiſe men" of the world. Even KINGS and POTENTATES paid homage to his virtues, reflecting by this ſome ſhare of glory on themſelves.</p>
            <p>WERE I here to finiſh the portrait, I ſhould do injuſtice to the character of one, whom all the world admires. If as a SOLDIER he excelled, as a SENATOR he aſtoniſhed; if as a WARRIOR he was magnanimous, as a STATESMAN he was profound. His activity and bravery in the field rendered him an HOST, and his ſagacity in the cabinet raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſuperior to all political deluſion. His wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom regulated the deciſions of jarring councils; his goodneſs charmed the affections of the people, and his ARM cruſhed their enemies. Faithful to his GOD, could he be unfaithful to his COUNTRY? Not malignity, not calumny, nor envy, which loves to prey on goodneſs, can charge him with one habitual vice.</p>
            <p>AS PRESIDENT of the CONVENTION, which formed our NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, he gave it his entire approbation; and perhaps it is not too much to ſay, that to this circumſtance it owed its eſtabliſhment. AMERICANS, this is the great pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium of your honor and felicity; it connects liberty with honor, the happineſs with the rights of Citizens. It is an experiment on the queſtion, whether mankind can bear to be free. Let me tell you, if you ſuffer foreign or domeſtic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues to wreſt this invaluable inheritance from your hands, you will richly deſerve to be <hi>Slaves.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038623_0007_1012A9B178DFE7F0"/>
AMONG the many illuſtrious characters, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in our glorious ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for Independence, WASHINGTON was ſo pre-eminent, that all eyes were turned to him as a common centre; and twice, by the unanimous ſuffrages of the nation, he was declared the RULER OF THE FREE.</p>
            <p>AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, how important were his ſervices! I truſt while grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is a virtue, we ſhall not forget them. In this, were it poſſible, rather than in his military character, he is juſtly eſteemed the INSTRUMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL SAVIOUR OF HIS COUNTRY.</p>
            <p>AS a FRIEND OF VIRTUE, he firmly oppoſed the Atheiſtical opinions of the day; as a PATRIOT, he preſented his breaſt to the dangers, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his country's peace. To him, the voice of the people was always an intereſting conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but though few among the great can reſiſt the charms of popular applauſe, though none ever enjoyed more popularity than WASHINGTON, yet HE ever preferred the dictates of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible mind, to the violence of the inconſtant multitude. At a moment, when foreign intrigue ſucceeded, when the popular paſſions were raiſed into a ferment, he was requeſted not to do<note n="*" place="bottom">Sanction the Britiſh Treaty by his ſignature.</note> what his ſound judgment dictated: he firmly replied, <hi>I have determined on the duty before me.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Preſident's Anſwer to various Addreſſes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Addreſs to the people of theſe States, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining again their ſuffrages, he ſeemed to concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all his great qualities. It has juſtly been eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038623_0008_1012A9B5A7F50100"/>
the LEGACY OF A FATHER. It has been preſerved in the archives of our country; let it be deeply engraved on our minds; for the heart which conceived it ceaſes to beat, and the hand which wrote it will riſe no more. He retired again.—I aſk you, my fellow-citizens, did not our prayers go with him? did we not all ſay, 'Peace to the HERO'S reſt? May guardian ſpirits watch his declining years, and may his grey heirs, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> ſorrow, come to the grave!' But before he was to be called to the communion of CELESTIAL SPIRITS, his war-worn ſinews were again to renew their youthful vigor, and again he roſe with the Fabii and Decii to avenge his country's wrongs.</p>
            <p>IN his Letter to PRESIDENT ADAMS, in which he accepts the command of the American armies, he diſplays that ſame unappalled courage, that ſtrength of intellect, and that zeal for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's honor, which had formerly been exerted with ſucceſs againſt the power of GREAT BRITAIN. "The conduct," ſays he, "of the DIRECTORY OF FRANCE towards our country; their inſidious hoſtility to its government; their various prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to withdraw the affections of the people from it; the evident tendency of their acts, and thoſe of their agents, to countenance and invigorate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; their diſregard of ſolemn treaties, and the law of nations; their war upon our defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs commerce; their treatment of our miniſters of peace; and their demands amounting to trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute, could not fail to excite in my mind, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding ſentiments with thoſe my countrymen
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038623_0009_1012A9B737371608"/>
have ſo generally expreſſed, in their affectionate addreſſes to you. Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wiſe and prudent meaſures of your adminiſtration. Satisfied that you have ſincerely wiſhed for peace, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to avert war, and exhauſted to the <hi>laſt drop</hi> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the juſtice of our cauſe." With what ſpirit did this appointment animate every claſs of citizens; America ſeemed to poſſeſs one ſoul. The young men aſſumed the ſoldier's character, and even the enfeebled veteran graſped his arms, which he had fondly hoped would ruſt in quiet.</p>
            <p>AND why do I hear the ſolemn knell of death? Why am I ſurrounded with theſe habiliments of the grave? Why that gloom on your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? Why that involuntary tear, which I ſee ſtart from your eyes? I hear the ſad reſponſe, OUR FATHER IS NO MORE.</p>
            <p>HIS FRIENDS and COMPANIONS IN ARMS encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle his grave. You have ſeen him, like ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior form, leading you to glory and victory. You have heard him in the embattled ranks, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imating you to conteſt by motives of duty and patriotiſm; and you have ſeen him weep over the ſoldier's wounds. <hi>"How have the mighty fallen!"</hi> That countenance which beamed benevolence, and that ſtature which inſpired confidence, lie ſhrouded in death. VERNON, from the PARADISE, is converted into the MAUSOLEUM of AMERICA. Its trophies are now the trophies of death. But
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038623_0010_1012A9BA2468E470"/>
we will not forget thee. The tomb of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON ſhall be the ALTAR of LIBERTY. When ages on ages have revolved, when we and our children are numbered with the ſilent dead, thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will reſort the friends of freedom; and while his happy ſpirit beholds with complacency the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſcene, they will appeal to Heaven, that they will ſave their country.</p>
            <p>MY FELLOW-CITIZENS, by whoſe appointment I ſtand in this place, will accept my ſincere condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on this ſolemn and affecting occaſion. It is the laſt tribute of reſpect, which we can pay to the memory of a MAN, who ſtill lives enthroned in all our hearts. It is reſpectful to the revered deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is it not honorable to our nature? Yes, our tears are honorable to ourſelves! Could our WASHINGTON once more addreſs us from the BRIGHT ARMIES of the SKY, what would he ſay? 'Weep not for me, my children. Your individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and political happineſs depends on your rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence to GOD, and your devotion to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Cheriſh the virtues, and obey the laws. Watch, as with an eagle's eye, againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of demagogues; and let it be written on your hearts, as with "the point of a diamond," that <hi>foreign influence is the deſtroying angel of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE YOUNGER CITIZENS demand our ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and attention. Reſpect for the character, gratitude for the ſervices, and grief for the death of your POLITICAL PARENT, has covered you with mourning. When yet in infancy, before

time had brought into exerciſe the reflective fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties, or reaſon in any degree had matured judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; HE was in the field, fighting your cauſe, and defending your rights. If ever your ſenſibilities were awakened, it muſt be on this occaſion; for you have cauſe to weep. Study, my young friends, the HERO'S LEGACY; it will ſhew you the true intereſt of your country, and make you po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litically wife. Let the impreſſive ſolemnities of this day be fixed on your minds. And as the moſt ſacred of all duties, as you regard the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſts of yourſelves and country, preſerve your minds uncontaminated by the religious and political hereſies of the day, which will inevitably lead to the deſtruction of all government, of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial order, and of public happineſs.</p>
            <p>WE paſs to the cloſing ſcene. The AMERICAN FABIUS died as he lived, calm and reſigned. As though common mortality muſt not approach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting glory, his own <hi>firm hands</hi> performed to himſelf the laſt ſad office of humanity!</p>
            <p>SHADES of WARREN, MERCER, GREENE, and MONTGOMERY! a KINDRED SOUL arrives! it is your CHIEF! 'tis WASHINGTON! Reſt, GREAT SPIRIT, in thy native ſkies; ſleep ſweet, till the ARCHANGEL ſound:—But thy name we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; thy deeds, thy greatneſs, thy virtues, we will affectionately cheriſh, and "tell them to our children's children."</p>
