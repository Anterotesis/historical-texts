            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN this chapter, we have an account of a blind and deaf Devil being caſt out of a man, by our Saviour: upon which, the people were greatly amazed, and cried —is not this the ſon of David?—The Scribes and Phariſees, ſeeing their wealth and reputation at ſtake, ſuffered their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to caſt Reaſon out of its ſeat; and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024115_0004_0FC3A4FF1DF34C20"/>
accuſed Chriſt of caſting out Devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils. This aſſertion, was ſuch a palpable contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its nature, that it needed no refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. He only obſerved, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, that as the houſe, or kingdom, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf could not ſtand; ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, if divided, could not ſtand.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſhort of the Spirit of God, can caſt out Satan; as they acknowledged in the exorciſes of their ſons: hence ſays Chriſt, they ſhall be your judges. But if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</p>
            <p>The caſting out of Devils, argued ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power, and divine authority. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the imputation of that power to Beelzebub, involved them in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of blaſphemy; which occaſioned Chriſt to cloſe his reproof, by obſerving, that whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the ſon of man it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of accepting this reproof, and returning to right reaſon, they violently caſt off conviction, and demanded a ſign. They denied credit to the miracles he had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024115_0005_0FC3A50699472D18"/>
wrought; unleſs he would ſubmit to prove them divine, by another miracle, according to their preſcription: and his refuſal, they made the ground, or pretence, of final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>This was ſuch a flagrant act of ſpite and malice againſt Chriſt, and his works, that he called them a generation of vipers; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them of a day of judgment, and certain condemnation. And finally, in the words of our text, characteriſed their vile temper of mind; their reſtleſs and fruitleſs ſearch of reſt againſt light; and their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of the man, he walketh through dry places ſeeking reſt, and findeth none. Then he ſaith, I will return into my houſe from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſhed. Then goeth he, and taketh with himſelf ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt. Even ſo ſhall it be alſo unto this wicked generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether we conſider theſe words as plain and direct matter of fact, in the cavilling Scribes and Phariſees; or as a mere para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, directly applied to them, will be of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024115_0006_0FC3A50815AE52D0"/>
no material conſequence. They are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a deſcription of the unpardonable ſin, with the ſeveral ſteps leading thereto, and deplorable conſequence: and as ſuch, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our moſt ſolemn attention.</p>
            <p>My deſign is, to conſider theſe words in an explanitory manner, and then apply them:—Therefore,</p>
            <p>Firſtly, Let us enquire what this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit is, and how it goes out of the man.—Whether we conſider theſe words as a parable, or otherwiſe; they muſt refer to that wicked diſpoſition, with which theſe Scribes and Phariſees went out againſt Chriſt. It is not the Devil, but the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conduct of the man, which is here condemned. That <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> is uſed here in oppoſition to moral purity; to a pure and upright heart. It implies a heart wickedly and perverſely ſet againſt the truth.</p>
            <p>In this ſenſe, the Jews had accuſed Chriſt of having an <hi>unclean Spirit</hi>; becauſe he caſt out Devils, and condemned their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. So again, Paul calls that ſpirit of ſtrife and diſſention, with which many went out againſt Chriſt, a witchcraft— Galat. 3.4. In like manner, Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares theſe very Scribes and Phariſees,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024115_0007_0FC3A50997C61AF8"/>
to <hi>whited ſepulchres, full of all uncleanneſs:</hi> becauſe they appeared outwardly righteous unto men; but inwardly, <hi>were full of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and iniquity</hi>—Math. 23: 27. Thus, the <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> is a temper of wilful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and ſtubborn perverſeneſs, againſt the light of evidence and good conſcience. And ſuch, in fact, was the caſe of the Jews: to whom theſe words were applied, as I ſhall ſhew further on.</p>
            <p>Now, this unclean Spirit goes out of the man, whenever he, in words or actions, oppoſes Chriſt, the doctrines of the goſpel, or the influences of the Spirit of God: he then <hi>ſcattereth abroad.</hi> Hence Chriſt, when he reproves the Phariſees for rejecting him, and perverſely adhereing to the doctrines and traditions of men, ſays, <hi>hear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: not that which goeth into the mouth, defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man, ſuch as evil thoughts, adulteries, murders, thefts, covetouſneſs, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, deceit, debate, blaſphemy, pride, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs.</hi> And to perſons of theſe characters, he ſays, <hi>ye are of your father the Devil, and his works ye will do.</hi> Theſe are not the work of the Spirit of God, but of the fleſh: they proceed from an impure heart, and defiled conſcience: they deſpiſe Chriſt, and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024115_0008_0FC3A50B1BE03EE8"/>Thus, the unclean Spirit goes out of the man, when he purpoſely oppoſes the goſpel of Chriſt: eſpecially ſo, when, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light, he denies the divinity of Chriſt, the goſpel revelation, and method of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: or, when he broaches doctrines, which render the death of Chriſt of non ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the influences of the Spirit, a mere deluſion; imputing the works of the Spirit of God, unto Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils.—This leads me,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To conſider the effects of this going out of the Spirit, viz:—<hi>He walketh through dry places ſeeking reſt, and findeth none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the man, having ſet out againſt Chriſt, and his way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can have no aſſiſtance from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, or a revelation: but he truſts to his own beclouded reaſon, againſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom. Therefore, like a man ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſtenance, in a dry and thirſty deſert, he will be conſtantly diſappointed. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſon, cannot obtain peace againſt God: there is no reſt, in an oppoſition to the author and giver of reſt.</p>
            <p>The conduct of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, to whom theſe words were applied, will be our beſt example. They, as Rulers
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024115_0009_0FC3A50C93561A90"/>
and Teachers in Iſrael, had, for a long time, acquired great eſteem and reſpect. And, by their adherence to the ceremonial law, and traditions of the fathers, which they ſtrenuouſly inculcated on the people, they ſupported their pride and enriched their pockets. Therefore, ſo ſoon as Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his miſſion, and reproved them of ſelf-righteouſneſs and neglect of the moral law, they cried out againſt him;—that he was a babler, a wine-bibber, impoſtor and friend of publicans and ſinners. They did every thing in their power, to irritate the minds of the people, and caſt contempt on Chriſt; well knowing, that his increaſe, would be their decreaſe: for he conſtantly oppoſed, and openly rebuked them out of the law of God. Therefore, ſo far as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple received Chriſt, ſo far their ſelf righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and traditional religion would fall.</p>
            <p>This excited them to make a further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for reſt. They now denied that Chriſt had fulfiled the propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah. But this deceived their hope, as defamation had done before. The people were divided. Some cried that a great Prophet had ariſen among them: others, that he deceived the people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſt, they found confuſion and diſappointment. And in addition to their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024115_0010_0FC3A50E848326C0"/>
anxiety, Chriſt produced infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his divine miſſion. He wrought miracles publicly, tending to the glory of God, and good of man: and <hi>theſe,</hi> unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with art and juggling. By a word, he reſtored a withered hand: by a voice, he raiſed the dead: and by authoritive command, he caſt out a blind and dumb Devil. At this the people were amazed, and ſaid—<hi>is not this the ſon of David?</hi> They acknowledged him the Meſſiah, the ſeed of David, propheſied of.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and Phariſees were now more offended than ever: ye ſee, ſaid they, how we gain nothing, the world has gone out after him. Their religion, riches and honor, were at ſtake; and muſt neceſſarily give place to the reception given to Chriſt. Therefore, although they acknowledged the power of God, in caſting out Devils, by their ſons; yet they diſallowed it in Chriſt; and aroſe as one man, and came forward among the people, crying—<hi>This fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub the Prince of the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they ſeek reſt, but find none. This is ſuch a bare-faced piece of ſpite and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that Chriſt calls them a generation of vipers. Reaſon, was caſt off her ſeat: and they were conedmned out of their own
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024115_0011_0FC3A514CA55CC38"/>
mouths. <hi>If an houſe or kingdom be divided againſt itſelf, how can it ſtand? If Satan be divided, how ſhall his kingdom ſtand?</hi>—They firſt, denied the operations of the Spirit of God; and then aſſerted impoſſibilities to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>This drove them into another barren place for reſt; they next, carved out for God: <hi>Maſter, we would ſee a ſign from thee.</hi> They required him to work another mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by their preſcription, to prove thoſe divine. He poſitively denied them. For, if they would not believe in miracles, wrought in God's way, neither would they, if wrought in their own way. And the dignity of the divine perfections, forbid the working of miracles at human direction; or, for the gratification of caviling and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſpirits. This left them, ſeeking reſt and finding none. Thus, our text ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be direct matter of fact; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſpiteful temper, and malicious conduct of the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the caſe with all men, who go out againſt Chriſt, and his goſpel: they are like a troubled ſea, never at reſt. The light of reaſon and conſcience, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſturb their reſting places: they fear their own reaſoning; but are too wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to attend to the checks of conſcience,

and the evidence of revelation. Hence, they are always buſy after reſt; but to no good purpoſe; except, to greater conviction and more diſappointment.</p>
            <p>Such is the ſtate of thoſe, who deny the being of a God: <hi>for the inviſible things of God are clearly underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead</hi>; ſo that the very heathen are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, for not glorifying him as God. Here the atheiſt ſeeks reſt againſt the works of creation and Providence, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in dry places.</p>
            <p>The deiſt alſo, who denies the divinity of Chriſt, and of his goſpel, muſt oppoſe ſound reaſon and conſcience; muſt run againſt the fulfilment of the propheſies, and miracles, wrought evidently by the power of God; and theſe, atteſted by the enemies of Chriſt, and ſealed by the blood of his friends.</p>
            <p>This claſs of reſt-ſeekers, ariſe out of looſe and profane characters; who, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſt againſt conſcience, make partial interpretation of ſcripture; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently partial denial of God's word. But certainly they may as well deny the whole, as a part. The abſurdity of a partial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, is ſo obvious, that they ſoon caſt off
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024115_0013_0FC3A51ADA0B3898"/>
fear, deny, the whole, and commence deiſts in full.</p>
            <p>Human reaſon, unaſſiſted by revelation or the influences of the Spirit of God, is now their only guide. <hi>That reaſon,</hi> which at beſt, can only convince us that we have loſt the rectitude of our nature, are under the diſpleaſure of God, and unable of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to return to our duty: <hi>that reaſon,</hi> which is but an imperfect guide in any of our worldly concerns: I ſay, <hi>that reaſon</hi> is all they can bring againſt infinite wiſdom, and thoſe evidences, which have obliged them to retreat ſtep by ſtep into the barren fields of carnal wiſdom.</p>
            <p>They can now, only carve out for God. Carnal reaſon ſays, the ſcripture, with all the fulfilment of propheſies, miracles wrought, and atteſted by credible hiſtory, is no ſufficient evidence of the divinity of Chriſt. Therefore (like the Jews in the ſame caſe of inconſiſtency) they ſay, <hi>Maſter, we would ſee a ſign from thee.</hi> They deny credit to the goſpel; unleſs God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to prove thoſe propheſies and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, true; and thoſe witneſſes, who ſeal-the truth with their blood, true witneſſes, according to their preſcribing. But it is obſervable, that ſuch condeſcenſion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dignity of God. <hi>No ſign ſhall be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024115_0014_0FC3A51C5A610188"/>
given,</hi> ſays Chriſt. Thoſe given were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: if they receive not thoſe given in God's way, neither would they though gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their own way. <hi>If they believe not Moſes and the prophets, neither would they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though one aroſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such perſons are in the moſt alarming ſituation: they ſtand upon the brink of hell: one ſtep further in this way after reſt, will be irrecoverable. If they (like the Jews) make God's refuſal to gratify their cavilling, the ground of reſolute and continued rejection, of the goſpel evidence; they may probably remain here, until the great day of account. Such grounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, effectually bars the door againſt any further conviction; and conſequently, damnation muſt follow.</p>
            <p>To this, doubtleſs, Chriſt had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reference in the words before us. It was the preciſe caſe of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, to whom they were ſpoken. And we have reaſon to fear, it is the caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this day; who are going out againſt Chriſt, in the boaſt of their own reaſon: they walk through dry places, ſeeking reſt and finding none.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is obſervable, that ſuch is the caſe of every perſon in ſome degree,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024115_0015_0FC3A51DCEAFF6C8"/>
while under ſpiritual illumination and conviction. The carnal mind and Satan, will caſt every poſſible objection, in the way of believing: hence, various turnings after a quiet conſcience; but no ſeeking reſt, againſt light of evidence and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can give peace in the way or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the end.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee, that a man may go far againſt Chriſt, with an unclean ſpirit: and yet find no reſt to his ſoul.—This leads us to conſider the effect of this fruitleſs ſearch, or the nature of the man's reſolve, viz:</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I will return into my houſe from whence I came out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we note, that all who walk through dry places ſeeking reſt, do not come to this laſt reſolve. Many, who have been under great ſpiritual alarms, and reſiſted for a long time, have finally ſeen their error, repented, and received the truth in the love of it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is here ſhewing the ſtate of the infidel Jews, who rejected him wilfully, againſt clear light and ſtrong evidence. We muſt therefore conſider the man as coming to this laſt deſperate reſolve; <hi>I will return to my houſe, from whence I came out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:024115_0016_0FC3A51F6CD6E5A8"/>Two things are here worthy of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, viz. The nature of this reſolve, and the matter or end reſolved upon.</p>
            <p>With regard to the nature of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, it is obſervable, that it is a fixed and ſettled determination, without any proviſo, limitation or condition. He does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to wait longer, or ſeek further; he does not deſire more light; but is ſatisfied: and his reſolve is emphatically deciſive—<hi>I will return.</hi> I will ſeek no further: I will weary myſelf no more in this perplexing ſearch after reſt: it is all a deluſion, the work of an unclean ſpirit—<hi>By Beelzebub he caſteth out devils.</hi> The reſolve is wilful and obſtinate: he acts not the part of a wiſe man, who embraces the truth, becauſe the evidence is too ſtrong for him: but finding light and evidence too ſtrong, he reſolves to fly from it: his works are works of darkneſs, and will not bear the light. He knowingly and wilfully flies from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; rejects the fulfilment of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; denies miracles wrought by the Spirit of God: and <hi>theſe,</hi> acknowledged fact, by the enemies of the goſpel; and ſealed by the blood of its friends. Thus the Jews, tho' they could not deny fact; yet wilfully caſt off their convictions, and demanded a ſign, hoping to pacify their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024115_0017_0FC3A520F7BA8678"/>
and blind the eyes of the people. Hence Chriſt ſays, <hi>ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This wilful reſolve effectually bars the door againſt any further operations of the Spirit of God. The man dies in obſtinacy: not for want of mercy in God, or merit in Chriſt: but by denying the Spirit of God, he ſhuts the door againſt any reception of a ſpirit of conviction. And God has ſaid, that ſuch deſpite towards the Spirit of his grace; <hi>ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reſolve is no raſh, inconſiderate act, without time to reflect; but it is after go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' dry places, ſeeking reſt and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none: after repeated warnings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations; and after ſufficient and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence of the truth. Therefore, the reſolve is wilful and deliberate, mature and deciſive, againſt the light of conſcience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the influences of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The matter reſolved on is, that he will go back, <hi>into his houſe from whence he came out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to know what this houſe is, we muſt enquire from whence the man ſet out, viz. from a ſtate of a carnal reſt and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024115_0018_0FC3A5225B437A18"/>
A man before conviction, feels very eaſy and ſecure: this is the ſtate, or houſe, of every unawakened ſinner; for Satan takes care to keep it unmoleſted, until drove out by the power of God. Hence our Saviour ſays, <hi>when a ſtrong man, armed, keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a ſtronger than he ſhall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoils.</hi> The man is at reſt, while under the darkneſs of the carnal heart, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's influences: but when Chriſt comes upon him, being the ſtronger man, his peace is deſtroyed. And he goes out againſt Chriſt, with a carnal mind, aſſiſted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; which makes it an unclean ſpirit, walking through dry places, ſeeking reſt and finding none. And at length, rather than ſubmit to the light of evidence, and conviction of conſcience, he violently and wilfully caſts off all reſtraint, and returns like the dog to his vomit: He goes back to his houſe, or ſtate of carnal reſt, from whence he came out.</p>
            <p>He ſays, all this alarm and fear is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon and common ſenſe: a piece of prieſt-craft to blind mankind: a mere enthuſiaſm, and deluſion of the Devil. All the influences of the ſpirit of God, he
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024115_0019_0FC3A52911BCF848"/>
imputes to Beelzebub, the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: and embraces his influences and dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, as congenial to his own perverſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and carnal heart. He is determined, no longer to be a ſlave to this uneaſy mind: therefore, violently ſhuts his eyes, againſt the evidence of the goſpel, and influences of the ſpirit of God. Thus, the man falls aſleep in ſpiritual death: the way is no longer open to conviction: he can have nothing of a ſpiritual nature to diſturb his conſcience; and God forbids us even to pray for him. The Devil ſmiles; his palace and his goods are again in peace: and for his own ſake, he will take care that all things are agreeable to the man's ſtate of carnal ſecurity, for the better deluding others into this ſtate of final and irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ruin.—This leads,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To conſider the preparations made in this houſe, for the return of this unclean ſpirit:—<hi>And when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This heart, or houſe of carnal reſt, he finds <hi>empty:</hi> it has been left for a ſeaſon, while he has been wandering through dry places, ſeeking reſt and finding none. Chriſt, by his Spirit, had diſturbed the ſtrong man's palace: his goods had been greatly diſcomforted; the ſpirit of Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024115_0020_0FC3A52AA19B0700"/>
always makes the carnal heart, the devil's kingdom, fear and tremble. Hence he went out againſt Chriſt with pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; and ſpitefully reſolved againſt him.</p>
            <p>But this ſtate or houſe is now emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>empty</hi> of the Spirit of God. The man imputes all the influences and ſtrivings of the holy Spirit, unto Beelzebub; and thus ſhuts the door againſt himſelf: there is no room left for further conviction. That this houſe becomes empty of the means of grace, as ſuch: they operate on him direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reverſe; they drive him further from God. Thus the houſe is empty of all good; juſt fit for himſelf, or a blaſphemer of the Holy Ghoſt, and determined ſervant of Satan.</p>
            <p>This houſe is alſo <hi>ſwept.</hi> This implies, a total abſence of all ſpiritual things; they are as ſwept out; there are no remains of the Spirit's operations; but his conſcience is as ſcared with an hot iron. It cannot feel the power of ſpiritual things; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them as droſs and dung; as delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and enthuſiaſm of the Devil. He has no feelings or conceptions of ſpiritual things: but God has ſaid of him, he is joined unto idols, let him alone. Thus he not only denies the Holy Ghoſt; but God leaves him to the deluſion of his own heart, and his gods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:024115_0021_0FC3A52CE9AC51D8"/>Again, This houſe is not only <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>ſwept</hi>; but <hi>garniſhed.</hi> It is made a place of delight: not merely empty of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects; but adorned with many things, which give pleaſurable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Altho' it is moſt certain, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can give no ſpiritual joy, or any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of <hi>conſcience:</hi> yet he can do much to ſtupify it. He blinds the mind; paints ſin in gay colours; and adds delight to ſenſual gratifications. Hence, the man feels no pain, from bitter reflexions on the turpitude of his heart and life. The Devil ſmiles; the man is pleaſed; and carnal pleaſures circulate in one continued round of painted vice and diabolical rage; until he awakes to new ſenſations before the throne of God.—Or, in the ſtyle of our text; as men, when they ſet out on family life, take care to have a dwelling fitted to their circumſtances; that it is clean, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adorned, for an agreeable reception: ſo this man, by his own act, finds this houſe empty and ſwept of all good; and Satan, his ſpiritual huſband, has garniſhed it with diabolic pleaſure, for his reception. —This leads us,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To conſider the man's conduct, in taking a renewed poſſeſſion of his houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He taketh with himſelf, ſeven other ſpirits
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024115_0022_0FC3A537737EADA0"/>
more wicked than himſelf, and they enter in, and dwell there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This man does not return alone: he is not content to live in ſolitary mood; but ſeeks company. He has long been reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by notions of prieſt-craft, and religious whims (as he terms them) but now, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to his reaſon again, is determined to make up for loſt time.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt univerſally true, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have had great illumination and ſtrong convictions; when they loſe theſe convictions, prove much more looſe and profane, than before. But the man who maliciouſly denies the Spirit of God, and wilfully returns to his former ſtate of ſin and ſecurity; has no reſtraint of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence left: but ſpurred on by Satan, he gives full looſe to all his carnal appetites. Natural fear and ambition are all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul his conſcience, from acting out the ſpite and malice of devils, according to his ability.</p>
            <p>Hence, he is ſaid to take ſeven other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more wicked than himſelf. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that ſeven is uſed in ſcripture often, as a certain number for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; thus ſeven devils are ſaid to be caſt out of Mary Magdalene. It is alſo uſed,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024115_0023_0FC3A5398FA0E678"/>
as a number of perfection: thus, we read of ſeven candleſticks, ſeven viols—trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets—ſeals, plagues, &amp;c. Thus his taking ſeven other ſpirits, implies, that he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally left of God's Spirit; given up to the dominion of devils; and the luſts of his own hard heart. He is now a fit object for the Devil to vent his malice upon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt: and certainly, he will ſpare no pains, to raiſe his triumph againſt the Redeemer's kingdom. The man is pleaſed with the ſervice, and never more delighted than when railing and ſcoffing at religion. Thus we find thoſe, who have apoſtatiſed from the Criſtian profeſſion, always harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the inconſiſtency and unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Chriſtian religion: ſcoffing at the convictions of the Spirit, and terrors of conſcience, as mere enthuſiaſm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion: boaſting of their own knowledge, and high attainments of living according to reaſon: conſequently endeavouring to lead others into the like courſes; and thus running merrily down the broad way of perdition.</p>
            <p>The man, being thus given up to his own luſts, and the influences of Satan, is ſaid to <hi>take other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf.</hi> They are exceedingly different from his feelings and endeavors before, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024115_0024_0FC3A53B13C19E00"/>
while under the awakenings of the Spirit of God. He has now no ſpiritual reſtraint; but every evil paſſion reigns uncontrouled. Like a bow doubly ſtrained, he ſprings back with double force. Having been reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conviction, and obliged to ſeek reſt in dry places, he returns, determined to make up loſt time. His ſoul is poſſeſſed with devils and luſts: his heart is hell in the beginning; preſſing faſt on to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpirits are ſaid to <hi>enter in, and dwell there.</hi>—Before his wilful apoſtacy, they were not ſettled and immovable, but were often diſturbed by the ſpirit of Chriſt: but now they are ſettled and fixed in the heart: not for a month, or year; but for <hi>eternity.</hi> The man is left a prey to his luſts. He has done deſpite to the Spirit of all grace: and God ſays (concerning him) <hi>there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now paſs to the laſt diviſion of the words, viz.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>And the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident at firſt bluſh: he is now unalterably fixed in a ſtate of ſin and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. At firſt, he was not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined againſt Chriſt, and his ſalvation;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024115_0025_0FC3A53C9A48FD18"/>
but lay open to conviction: his heart ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Spirit, and acknowledged his power; elſe, would never gone out againſt him, ſeeking reſt. That he has had his day of grace, even as others, and might have accepted: but his proud heart would not bow to the croſs of Chriſt. He valued his blind reaſon, more than a divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and conviction of conſcience. He violently ſhut his eyes againſt the light: and with ſpite, rejected the Holy Ghoſt; imputing his influences to Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils. He hated God, and the works of his Spirit: and therefore rejected them and went back to his houſe from whence he came out: and finally, with other Spirits, has joined againſt God, and his method of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thus, he has ſinned with his eyes open, and has no cloak for his ſin. Pride, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and malice, are deep rooted in his heart, and prevent any further convictions: the heart is bared by a wilful obſtinacy. The Spirit, by which alone God works effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly on the heart, he contemptuouſly calls Beelzebub: conſequently, the Holy Ghoſt can operate on him in no character but of the Devil: and as ſuch, muſt drive him further off from God; and plunge him deeper into the gulph of hell. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024115_0026_0FC3A53E1747CB08"/>
to this, St. Paul ſays, <hi>it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance.</hi>—not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the want of merit in Chriſt, or good-will in God; but becauſe he does deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite to the Spirit of Chriſt, and computes his influences to the evil Spirits; by which, he muſt drive the man from God: no other effect can follow. Hence the man cannot be brought home to God on the goſpel plan; conſequently, in no way at all: there is no way open for ſaving conviction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this ſin of wilful and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rejection of the Spirit, is of ſuch heinous nature, that God has declared, <hi>it ſhall not be forgiven neither in this world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world to come.</hi> Thus, in whatever point of light we view this laſt ſtate of the man, we find it worſe than the firſt.</p>

awakenings and convictions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are in continual ſearch of reſt. At ſuch time, there is no peace in the ſoul: the ſtrong man is diſturbed by the man who is ſtronger than he. Awakened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners labour under a deep ſenſe of guilt, and direful apprehenſions of puniſhment: to which we add, that the Devil will by no means be idle on ſuch occaſions: his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is invaded. While Chriſt awakens on the one hand, Satan will ſtrive on the other, by fallacy and cunning, to lull into ſecurity, or deſpondence; or elſe, drive the man to violent reſiſtance. Thus, there is a conſtant uproar in the ſoul: contending paſſions diſtract the man.</p>
               <p>Some go out againſt their convictions, with ſtrong paſſions and violent efforts: others, more mild and trembling: but all, for a ſeaſon, go <hi>through dry places ſeeking reſt and finding none.</hi> Infidelity and pride, will not cloſe with offered mercy: yet, no man can at once caſt off all conviction, and perſuade himſelf that the influences of the Spirit are a falſehood and deluſion of the Devil. Conſequently he hurries from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to argument; from one ground of truſt to another; that, if poſſible, he may quiet conſcience; have ſome merit in his ſalvation; and maintain his carnal pride: or, as he flatters himſelf, ſupport the dignity of human reaſon, and free-agency.

Although reaſon, ſcripture and an awakened conſcience, conſtantly ſtare him in the face, and declare his utter ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſave himſelf; yet the Devil and carnal heart, extol human reaſon and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ability; preſs on to falſe argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and works of ſelf-righteouſneſs.

               <p>This fruitleſs ſearch for happineſs out of Chriſt, has very different effects on the human heart.</p>
               <p>Some grow fretful and angry againſt God, themſelves, and fellow-men: they reſolve to bear theſe diſappointments no longer; accuſe God of partiality; ſpite reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; abuſe its profeſſors; deride the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the divine Spirit; call the awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings of ſinners prieſt-craft and deluſion of the Devil; violently caſt off their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions

               <p>Others, ſeeking reſt and finding none, grow melancholy, and fall into a kind of mopiſh deſpondency: they teaſe themſelves and diſhonor God. They expected to have found peace long ago; but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deceived: their ſtate grows darker and darker: God will not regard them: He is a hard maſter: and they cannot ſee, that it anſwers any purpoſe to ſerve him. In this ſtate, they bury their talent; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the means and advantages put into their hands; and ſet down in the ſpiritual deſert, purpoſing to go no further; but if they die they die; if they live they live.</p>
               <p>Theſe are proud beggars, who ſerve God merely for hire; and not receiving wages, they leave off work; accuſe God of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and backwardneſs to pardon. Yet, in their fretful ſubmiſſion, they flatter themſelves with goſpel humiliation and reſignation. The whole, is melancholy fretfulneſs, and gloomy deſpondence. And the ordinary means of conviction being neglected, renders it very difficult to renew them unto repentance.</p>
               <p>Again, others, through a naturally care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and indolent frame of mind, grow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024115_0030_0FC3A54D19D524D8"/>
or elſe, through a too confident diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, think they have obtained pardon, when they have not. The conſequence in both is, that they grow dull in duties; cold in affection; and in great meaſure, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to their former fears and convictions: and ſo, live either in a careleſs, or over confident round of morals. Such falls from awakenings, give great reaſon to fear, that the ſpirit of conviction will not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily return.</p>
               <p>But again, this ſearch after reſt, has an oppoſite effect on others: they grow more watchful, more fearful, more engaged to look for, and perform duty. They ſee and feel the righteouſneſs of God, in putting off: yet, like the importunate widow, with the Judge, they inceſſantly aſk and ſeek. They let nothing divert them from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means of ſalvation. While they acknowledge the dog unworthy of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's bread, they plead for the crumbs which fall from the maſter's table.</p>
               <p>Theſe are humble beggers: though they ſee want, they do not feel deſerving. They cry for mercy: and any crumb, from the table of God's grace, is received with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.—This is the only proper uſe of our convictions. God is glorified: the ſinner is humbled, and in due time, may hope to be exalted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:024115_0031_0FC3A5549255D900"/>Thus we find no reſiſting of the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Spirit of God, can bring peace to the ſoul: and yet, this ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſt, will have very different effects on different perſons: of which, one only, is abſolutely fatal. All others are pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though in ſome caſes difficult and improbable,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We infer, that great danger attends the ſetting up of our wills, in oppoſition to the light of conſcience and revelation.</p>
               <p>This dethrones conſcience, and denies Chriſt. It is a fearful ſtep towards, and near approach to, that ſin which cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; yet much indulged in the preſent degenerate age. Some openly deny a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation; and many others do it implicitly: ſetting up human reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt infinite wiſdom. They will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a revelation from God; becauſe they cannot comprehend it: which, if they could, would be a ſufficient reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe it. But ſuch is the pride and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the human heart, that all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be brought up to their ſtandard. Not feeling themſelves totally depraved, they infer, that man may ſave himſelf: or at leaſt, do that good which will obligate God to ſave him.</p>
               <p>Hence they walk by their own wills, rather than a revelation: ſtrive to ſtifle all
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024115_0032_0FC3A556158CBD28"/>
convictions; and traverſe all the fields of falſe argumentation, to prove them abſurd and ridiculous. No religion, no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no convictions, or experiences are of any conſequence, unleſs ſquared by their rule, and made ſubſervient to their intereſt.</p>
               <p>However unnoticed, this conduct is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly highly criminal: and, though gilded with the name of <hi>rational,</hi> that reaſon muſt be exceedingly perverſe, which is ſubject to the human will, and repugnant to the God of reaſon. To which we add, that ſuch conduct is a near approach to the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin: the next ſtep will be irrecov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable. Let them but decidedly reſolve to follow this reaſon, in oppoſition to the light of revelation, and an awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; then, the nature of things, and a divine revelation determine them eternally loſt So that it appears exceedingly danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſet up our wills, in oppoſition to the light of conſcience and revelation, and force our reaſon againſt infinite wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We learn the peculiar nature of that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which cannot be forgiven.</p>
               <p>A man may commit many ſins and of great aggravation: he may be a long time under ſpiritual conviction, and fall from this conviction into his former ſtate of eaſe and ſecurity: yet not commit the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin. Though moſt certainly, ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024115_0033_0FC3A5579E29D510"/>
ſinning and ſuch apoſtatiſing are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly heinous in the ſight of God; and if perſiſted in, without repentance, will bring final death. Yet, in their nature, they may be pardonable.</p>
               <p>But this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is unto death, is of a peculiar colour: it is of the blackeſt die: It is a ſin of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, againſt great light, repeated warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſtrong evidence. It is a wilful, deliberate contempt of the holy Spirit: a perverſe denial of his operations, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious imputation of them unto infernal ſpirits. <hi>By Beelzebub the Prince of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, he caſteth out Devils,</hi> ſaid the Scribes.</p>
               <p>This moſt effectually bars the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any further conviction; for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can operate on the man, in no charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but of the Devil; conſequently, he lives at eaſe and ſecurity in ſin. Yet, though he finds his houſe empty, ſwept and garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his laſt end is worſe than the firſt. As he feels no troubleſome convictions; ſo on the contrary he has no approbation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; therefore no real happineſs. His pleaſures are as the madneſs of laughter, which lead down to death. He lives mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fill up the meaſure of his ſins, that God, in ages to come, may make more full and glorious diſplays of his power, in his eternal damnation.—Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:024115_0034_0FC3A5591CC92018"/>4. Let us examine ourſelves, how we have conducted under our awakenings.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that we have had great ſight, and great opportunity to know God, and the truth of the goſpel. We have ſtrong proof of the fulfilment of ancient propheſies and miracles, wrought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. The preſent diſperſion of the Jews, their continued infidelity, and ſtate of religious polity, are a ſtanding fulfilment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, and a living miracle, in proof of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>The miracles of Chriſt, together with his laſt ſign to the Jews, the ſign of the prophet Jonas, are atteſted by the enemies of the croſs, and ſealed by the blood of its friends. It is ridiculous to ſuppoſe the enemies ſhould acknowledge, or the friends lay down their lives in proof of what they knew to be a falſehood. That, allowing men common ſenſe and common honeſty, the facts are true beyond reaſonable doubt.</p>
               <p>In addition to this, every one of us, who have arrived to years of diſcretion, have felt the Spirit of God, witneſſing on our hearts the truth of the goſpel revelation. But how have we conducted under this light and knowledge? have we not ſhut our eyes, ſtopped our ears, and hardened our hearts, leſt we ſhould ſee, underſtand, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? have we not conſidered the ſervice
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024115_0035_0FC3A55AB1CD5420"/>
of God as burdenſome; of but little or no importance; a mere piece of policy and prieſt-craft? Have we not conſidered ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſpiritual awakenings, as enthuſiaſm and deluſion, detrimental to the honor, pleaſures, and intereſt of mankind? And have we not gone out againſt thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, with an unclean ſpirit, deſigning to make them appear abſurd and redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and ſtrove, by falſe argumentation, to ſet aſide the goſpel method of ſalvation? And though we have walked through dry places, ſeeking reſt and finding none; yet, have we not perverſely followed our ſearch, againſt light and reaſon, rather than em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth?—But admitting that we have received the ſpirit of conviction; how often have we grieved him to depart: how often ſtrove to caſt off convictions, and lull conſcience aſleep, by going to our cups, our beds, our work or diverſion?—And while we have pretended to cheriſh our convictions, did not our dulneſs and inattention, give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſelf-condemnation? When God has continued us under long awakenings, and delayed to anſwer our requeſts; have we not felt heart-riſings againſt him; been fretful, and ſet down in the ſpiritual deſert, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of knowing God, ourſelves and our duty?—And at other times, have we not been proud of our ſpiritual attainments, and imagined that we have obtained the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024115_0036_0FC3A55C25E56E68"/>
peace of God; when we had not ſo ſeen our own hearts, as to mourn for the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs thereof?</p>
               <p>Theſe things call for ſpeedy and ſerious attention. All oppoſition to, or neglect of the Spirit, is an high provocation to God; and very dangerous to our ſouls. They who refuſe to be brought home to God, in his way, will never come in any; but muſt die without mercy.</p>
               <p>Let us then carefully examine our hearts, reform our lives, and bring forth fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Let us receive the ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, with humbling and ſelf-abaſing thoughts; and high and admiring thoughts of the divine love and goodneſs. Let us be patient under the hand of God; wait his time, and in his way, for a bleſſing: knowing, that if ever we receive, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good we may receive, it is of grace; and ought to be received with thankſgiving.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let all who are ſeeking reſt, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, under their convictions imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately embrace offered mercy.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to find an approving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience out of Chriſt: it is ſeeking in dry and barren places. The evidences of the ſpirit, and goſpel truth, cannot be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by carnal argumentation: the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience will never find reſt from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſoning. How full of madneſs, then, to procraſtinate, while Chriſt is knocking
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024115_0037_0FC3A55D900D3120"/>
at the door of our hearts? It deſtroys peace in this life, and riſks eternal happineſs in the next. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation, while the ſpirit is ſtriving: but the morrow may be too late. Death may intervene; ſin may ſhut the door of grace; or God may ſay, <hi>He is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto idols let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The longer we put off, ſo much more is God offended, ſo much more is Chriſt ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo much more the Holy Ghoſt is grieved. We alſo grow more wilful, more ſtubborn, and more perverſe; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more likely to fall away irrecoverably. Let us then awake to a ſenſe of our danger, and of our duty: ceaſe to oppoſe God and his ſalvation. Let us no more walk thro' the barren fields of beclouded reaſon after reſt: but let us conſider our convictions as the work of God; and humbly accept of offered mercy; fervently praying God, that our convictions may be effectual to ſaving converſion.</p>
               <p>But if any of you are reſolved to go on in the way of your own hearts, and in the ſight of your own eyes, adding ſin to ſin; to make your brows as braſs, and your hearts as adamant; to ſtifle all conviction, and go back to your houſe of carnal reſt; then, go on—take your own way. But be aſſured, <hi>that the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a deſtruction from the Almighty ſhall
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024115_0038_0FC3A55F6819DA98"/>
it come: He will whet his glittering ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on judgment: He will render vengeance to his enemies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that hate him: He will make his arrows drunk with blood; with the blood of the ſlain, from the beginning of revenge upon the enemy</hi> Then ſhall the brazen brow be broke; and the adamantine heart will burſt into ten thouſand pieces: ſtifled convictions will have a fearful reſurrection, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arrows of death, to torment the ſoul throughout the endleſs ages of eternity.</p>
               <p>Awake then, oh procraſtinating ſinner, awake! Be wiſe, and conſider your latter end. Improve the preſent moments, and accept of offered mercy. Drop all your ſins, your ſorrows, your fears and doubts at the foot-ſtool of the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Ariſe with him to newneſs of life, and bring forth fruit unto God. Then the riches of God's grace will be glorified in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation: you will be accepted in Chriſt the beloved, and admitted into the ſociety of the church of the firſt born of God in Heaven, to raiſe the trophies, and ſing the triumphs of redeeming love.— Which, may God grant for the ſake of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, our aſcended Lord, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.—AMEN.</p>
