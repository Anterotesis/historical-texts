            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ABOUT a mile from a pretty town in Hampſhire, lived Mrs. Leyſter, a widow, and ſtill a young woman, with her only daughter Conſtantia, who was at the time theſe anecdotes begin near eleven years of age. The houſe in which they lived was a ſmall white building, with a lawn before, parted from harveſt fields by a ſunk fence, and commanding a fine extent of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Behind the houſe, and on the north ſide, was a little ſhrubbery ſurrounded
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031014_0006_0FEA5082D98CB1F8"/>by a green wire fence, and on the ſouth ſide the walled kitchen garden; ſo that the houſe being open only to the weſt, was ſheltered from the cold winds, and conſequently extremely warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. A ſmall village was ſituated at a very ſhort diſtance from this pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant reſidence; it was entirely occupied by induſtrious poor, who always found a friend in time of neceſſity at Fair-Lawn, for ſo Mrs. Leyſter's houſe was called. Conſtantia was, as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages will prove, a little girl of an amiable diſpoſition; ſhe had very good ſenſe, an even temper, and a kind affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart, ſo that ſhe repaid, as far as poſſible, the unremitting care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her mother. I ſay as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe it is only by a whole life of duty and virtue that a child can repay a tender mother the debt which it begins
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031014_0007_0FEA505F50BB10D8"/>to incur at the moment of its birth. The anxiety which fills the heart of a mother while a child is in the ſtate of infancy, her watchful nights, her days of fear and caution, a child cannot even imagine; and when this infant ſo anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly guarded becomes older, do the mother's cares leſſen? on the contrary, they increaſe, the heedleſſneſs of youth continually awakens them, a blow, a fall, an accident of any kind gives to the heart of a mother an exquiſite pang. But ah! if ſhe ſees, or believes ſhe ſees the leaſt tendency towards peeviſhneſs, want of feeling or obſtinacy, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed her uneaſineſs becomes inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſhe imagines all her cares are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and the only hope of her life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from her. Pardon this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, my young friends, in conſideration of its conſequence, and think as you
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031014_0008_0FEA506FDEB38328"/>read it how carefully you ought to avoid, as much as poſſible, giving pain to the hearts of your parents. Conſtantia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed knew not the extent of her obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to her mother, but ſhe knew enough to convince her that ſhe could never repay them; ſhe ſtudied therefore in every thing to be mild, tractable and and obliging; ſhe gave all her attention to thoſe leſſons her mother wiſhed her to learn, and in general was ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Mrs. Leyſter taught her to read, work and write, and alſo the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of drawing: a dancing maſter came twice, and a French maſter three times a week to give her leſſons. Muſic made no part of her plan, for as Conſtantia's fortune would not be large, Mrs. Leyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſidered an accompliſhment which requires ſo much time an unneceſſary one. Conſtantia however had a ſweet
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031014_0009_0FEA50AC39602410"/>delicate voice, and a good ear, and Mrs. Leyſter, who had conſiderable knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of muſic, took pleaſure in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, ſo that before Conſtantia was ten years old, ſhe could ſing ſeveral ſongs prettily and agreeably. In theſe pleaſing and various amuſements the days paſſed on, when one morning in the winter, which completed Conſtantia's eleventh year, after a heavy fall of ſnow which remained the depth of ſome feet on the ground the ſun ſhone out very bright, and the froſt was ſo hard that Mrs. Leyſter imagined a walk in the ſhrubbery might not be unpleaſant. The trees hanging over had prevented the ſnow from covering the walks, and Conſtantia, who had been confined ſome days by the weather, gladly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to accompany her mother. She ran ſometimes before her, ſometimes in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031014_0010_0FEA4FF437D8D448"/>another walk, with all the joy of a young bird who has juſt learned the uſe of his wings; while Mrs. Leyſter walked quickly on to keep herſelf warm, and admired the beautiful winter piece which met her view, the ſnow ſparkling in the ſun, the long icicles which hung from the trees, the branches covered with froſt work, were all agreeable to her eyes. Conſtantia at laſt came running to her mother, and taking her by the hand, ſaid, "Now, mama, I will walk with you."</p>

                  <p>In the Winter they lead the ſame kind of life; and as in the Summer they faint with heat, ſo in the Winter they tremble with cold, which all their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and furs cannot exclude, ſince they take no exerciſe to render them proof againſt it. I have tried this life, and found how little real pleaſure is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

                  <p>No, my dear, although ſhe is but thirteen, ſhe has been introduced by a miſtaken indulgence into company; ſhe has acquired a reliſh for diſſipation, and loſt that deſire which young people naturally have for the charms and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the country. But my dear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, I think we ſhall be able to go under the hedges to the village; 'tis ſome time ſince we ſaw the poor people, and perhaps in this ſevere weather they may want ſomething.</p>

                  <p>Yes, indeed—I want ſadly to know how poor Dame Burden's rheumatiſm is—I am afraid the cold will make her worſe. They then walked on a quick pace, ſtill converſing with great cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when they were ſtartled by the howling of a dog, who was concealed by the winding of the hedge from their eyes—but in a minute, as if at hearing their voices, he came running towards them, wagging his tale and whining in the moſt expreſſive manner, ſeemingly to intreat their aſſiſtance.—"Poor fellow, poor fellow!" ſaid Conſtantia. The dog then jumped up and again whined, then ran a little way forward, then ſtood ſtill looking at them, and again whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "What does this mean," ſaid Mrs. Leyſter, "this dog ſeems to implore our aſſiſtance; they are very ſagacious, let
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031014_0017_0FEA4FFD09012148"/>us follow him."—At that inſtant they heard the faint cry of an infant, and the dog ſprung out of their ſight howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt piteouſly. "What is this!"— ſaid Mrs. Leyſter, "I heard the cry of a child—good Heavens, perhaps—Let us haſten." Conſtantia quitting her mother's hand now ran lightly on, while Mrs. Leyſter followed, as faſt as the ſnow and her agitation would let her; but before ſhe had turned the corner of the hedge, Conſtantia out of breath, with her cheeks the colour of crimſon, ran back exclaiming—"mama, mama!—Make haſte, Oh, make haſte, a woman! a poor little infant!"</p>

               <p>AT theſe words Mrs. Leyſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her ſpeed, and in two minutes arrived at the place where the dog ſtood howling over the apparently dead body of a woman, in whoſe arms lay a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wrapped in a long cloth cloak. As Mrs. Leyſter advanced, ſhe diſcovered that this bundle was a young child, whoſe faint cries ſeemed to deplore the loſs of that nouriſhment it could no longer draw from the breaſt of its mother. "Unhappy woman!" ſaid Mrs. Leyſter, "I fear ſhe is frozen to death!—Good Heaven, what muſt ſhe

                  <p>See, Conſtantia, how carefully the poor creature has wrapped up her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, ſo that it ſeems not to have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt injury—poor little dear, how nice and clean it is, and the wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is decently dreſſed—Run, my child, as faſt as poſſible, to the houſe; ſend Martha and Thomas up hither, and bid them bring ſome brandy, ſome blankets and a chair—Make what haſte you can, but be careful not to fall down.</p>

The poor creature was quickly placed in the chair, and carefully conveyed to the houſe by the wondering ſervants, while Mrs. Leyſter followed carrying the baby. As ſoon as they entered the houſe, they would have carried the poor woman to the fire, under a notion of thawing her frozen limbs, but this Mrs. Leyſter forbade.</p>

                  <p>On the contrary, my dear, it will cauſe her frozen limbs to mortify direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I have already rubbed her hands and feet with ſnow, an application which muſt be continued.</p>

                  <p>Yes, that is the ſafeſt means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her—My dear Conſtance, ſend Thomas for Mr. Horland the Surgeon, and deſire he will come directly.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:031014_0022_0FEA509BCF1BFF08"/>The woman was then put to bed, and in leſs than half an hour ſtrong ſigns of life appeared, which continued to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe till the arrival of the Surgeon, who approved of all that had been done, and uſed other remedies which had the deſired effect, for in a ſhort time ſhe opened her eyes and faintly exclaimed, "Jenny!—Oh, my dear baby!"—This exclamation affected Mrs. Leyſter to tears; they flowed ſome time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her heart from the agitation which oppreſſed it ſince ſhe found this poor creature. The dog who had found his way into the bed-chamber, now jumped up, and licked his miſtreſs' hands; ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recollect him, and ſaid in a low voice, "poor Rover!" then added, "Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where is my poor Jenny!"—Mrs. Leyſter now took the infant from the arms of her ſervant, where, after being
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031014_0023_0FEA500267EA3F18"/>fed, it had fallen into a ſweet ſleep, and put it into the bed; the poor woman again opened her eyes, looked at the baby, and ſaid, "what, aſleep my child?— <hi>You</hi> are not cold—thank God you are alive!"—She then looked wildly about her, exclaiming, "Oh, where am I?— I thought I was in the ſnow—and ſo cold—I dreamed it!—But what room is this, who are all theſe?"—Mrs. Leyſter then motioned for every body to keep out of ſight, and kneeling by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſaid, "my good woman, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, you are with friends, and very ſafe, you have been ill, but try to ſleep, and you will ſoon be well again!—"My head," ſaid the poor creature, putting her hand to it, "is ſo bad, I cannot rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect any thing—But my child is here, and we are not in the ſnow—poor Rover, <hi>you</hi> are here too!" Mrs. Leyſter
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031014_0024_0FEA500EB9E02980"/>then drew the curtains, and went to the farther end of the room; ſhe ſent away every body but Conſtantia, and ſat down with her to watch the event. The poor woman was ſoon aſleep, and the dog ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down by her ſide ſlept alſo. When Mrs. Leyſter was convinced her patient was aſleep, ſhe with Conſtance left the room, and ſent Martha to ſit there while they dined. The whole of that day the poor woman paſſed in a ſort of dozing inſenſibility, though ſhe gradually amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the next morning was able to riſe for a few hours, and to underſtand by what means ſhe had been brought thither. Her gratitude to Mrs. Leyſter and all her family was unbounded and inexpreſſible; ſhe could only ſhed tears, utter broken ſentences, and preſs her child to her boſom, while ſhe lifted up her eyes to Heaven in thankfulneſs for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031014_0025_0FEA5060DBE08920"/>its preſervation, and to call down bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on her benefactors—then turning them on Mrs. Leyſter, ſhe would ſay, "Oh, Madam! my child—<hi>you</hi> have ſaved her! May God reward you by bleſſing yours!" The force of this bleſſing Mrs. Leyſter fully felt; none could ſtrike upon her heart with ſo much power as that which had her daughter for its object! In a few days the woman, whoſe name was underſtood to be Thomſon, was perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe eagerly ſtrove to aſſiſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in doing every thing they would ſuffer her to have a hand in, and about the fifth day after that in which ſhe had been found, ſhe ſent to beg leave to ſpeak with Mrs. Leyſter, a requeſt which was immediately granted, and ſhe came into the parlour with her child in her arms, curtſying and with tears in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031014_0026_0FEA504B20F88958"/>her eyes. Conſtantia, who was grown very fond of the child, took it in her arms, while the following dialogue paſſed.</p>

I had one child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this you ſee here, but it died.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031014_0029_0FEA50CFC9375448"/>his arm. Then, madam, we both ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered indeed, he with pain, and I to ſee him. My five guineas were ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, he could not work, and every thing went heavily with us!</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>A few days after this, Mrs. Leyſter accepted an invitation to dine with a lady at the town which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile from her houſe: ſhe was deſired to bring Conſtantia with her, as the lady had a daughter about a year younger than ſhe was. They arrived at Mrs. Selwyn's about half an hour before dinner time, but Maria Selwyn did not come in till juſt as they were ſetting down to dinner. Scarcely were they ſeated, when ſhe ſaid, "mama, I want a piece of pudden." "Huſh," ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, "wait till every body
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031014_0039_0FEA5012F4A02718"/>elſe is helped, if you pleaſe!" "Oh, but mama," ſaid Maria, "I like to eat my pudding before my meat, and I chuſe to have it now."—"Well then," ſaid Mr. Selwyn, "aſk your papa to to cut it for you"—"Yes, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Selwyn, "I will cut it for you directly"—which he did, to the great ſurprize of Conſtantia, who was quite unaccuſtomed to ſee a little girl behave ſo rudely. Maria Selwyn, however, always did behave ſo; ſhe was quite a ſpoiled child, and ſuffered to do juſt as ſhe liked; ſo ſhe eat enough for two little girls, and of the moſt improper things, aſking for every thing ſhe wiſhed to have, eating extremely faſt, and even putting her knife into the tarts to take out ſome of the fruit; ſhe alſo put her knife into her mouth inſtead of eating with her fork or ſpoon, and ſhe had ſo
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031014_0040_0FEA50106F733398"/>many untidy tricks at table, that a very delicate perſon would have been made ſick by her, and every body muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted: ſhe held her knife and fork ſo low, that her hand came upon part of the blade: in ſhort, ſhe was more awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and behaved worſe than any child of five years old, who has been uſed to eat with decent people. Mrs. Selwyn, indeed, ſometimes checked her with, "don't, Maria, upon my word I will ſend you from table;" but as this threat was never put in execution, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſregarded, and Miſs Maria continued to diſtreſs every body by her impertinence and voraciouſneſs. After dinner, when the fruit was ſet upon the table, any one would have ſuppoſed, that ſo far from having eaten an amazing dinner, Miſs Maria had not had any, for ſhe devoured apples, pears and nuts,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031014_0041_0FEA50B8E73070B0"/>together with almonds, raiſins and oranges, ſo as perfectly to aſtoniſh the moderate and ſimple Conſtantia. Mrs. Selwyn earneſtly preſſed Miſs I cyſter to take more fruit than ſhe ſeemed inclined to do, and turning to Mrs. Leyſter, ſaid, "I am ſure you will let Miſs Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia eat another orange"—"She is at liberty to do juſt as ſhe pleaſes," replied Mrs. Leyſter; "I have entirely ceaſed to reſtrain her in point of eating for this twelve month." Mrs. Selwyn then again begged Conſtantia to eat another orange, but ſhe declined it. When the table was cleared, Miſs Selwyn ſat very quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeemingly half aſleep in her place, till Mrs. Selwyn told her to take Miſs Leyſter into her dreſſing-room, "which," added ſhe, "you have ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one end to the other with your playthings, and even with your ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel's
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031014_0042_0FEA5091166FBA88"/>cage, though I always tell you I will not have him in my apartment!" "But, mama," ſaid Miſs Selwyn, "may we not have Roſe to play with us?"— "Yes" anſwered her mother, "if you will behave better to her than you gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do. I dare ſay Miſs Leyſter would be aſhamed to ſee you uſe her ſo ill! Ah, I wiſh you would take pattern by <hi>her</hi>!" The two children then went away, and Miſs Selwyn led her viſitor into her mother's dreſſing-room, which was indeed, as ſhe had ſaid, ſtrewed from one end to the other with play-things; ſome whole, ſome broken, and ſo various as to afford great amuſement to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, who was uſed to have but few. There were no leſs than five dolls, tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, children flying a kite, horſes and hounds, a large box with a very pretty ſhow, a magic lanthorn, and a book of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031014_0043_0FEA5116174B2668"/>prints; on the ſopha a cage with a ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and under it a baſket with a cat and three kittens. Conſtantia very eagerly looked over this extenſive collection, but finding the variety diſtracted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſo that ſhe could examine noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe left every thing but the ſhew, which amuſed her very agreeably for ſome time; in the mean while Miſs Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn was talking to her about the things, but at laſt, finding her ſo much pleaſed with the ſhew, ſaid, "dear, what do you like that ugly thing!"</p>

               <p>During this converſation Maria was eating cake and drinking coffee, till ſhe was really too ill not to be noticed, as ſhe looked dreadfully. Mrs. Selwyn rang for her own maid to wait on Maria, who, with a dreadful ſick head-ach went away, and was obliged to go to bed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. In about an hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mrs. Leyſter and Conſtance went home, and as they ſat at their ſimple ſupper, Conſtance repeated to her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the converſation which had paſſed when ſhe and Maria were alone.</p>

                  <p>YOU ſee then, Conſtantia, this is an inſtance of what I have often told you, that happineſs depends far more on ourſelves and our own diſpoſition to be contented, than on any outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. If any body had told you yeſterday of a little girl who had every plaything ingenuity could invent, full leiſure to amuſe herſelf as ſhe pleaſed, and even a little girl to play with her and wait on her; perhaps you would have thought ſhe muſt have been happy.</p>

                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>But you ſee now how little theſe things conſtitute felicity. Miſs Selwyn has ſuch and endleſs variety of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things before her at all hours, that her choice is bewildered, and ſhe becomes tired of all; they ceaſe to give her any amuſement, and ſhe is angry to find that nothing diverts her. To you, who ſee ſuch things very ſeldom, they are a ſource of great entertainment; thus you ſee that by an unlimited uſe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſures loſe their reliſh, though, taken in <hi>moderation,</hi> they enliven the ſpirits and animate the mind. Miſs Selwyn is alſo ſo accuſtomed to be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031014_0059_0FEA5100CC263EA8"/>upon, that ſhe can do nothing for herſelf, and has not even activity enough of mind or body to amuſe herſelf. Tell me, Conſtantia, ſhould you not very much diſlike to find that you wanted ſome body "to help you play."</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CONSTANCE.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, indeed, yes, mama, I was quite aſtoniſhed to hear Miſs Selwyn uſe ſuch an expreſſion!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>As to the poor little girl who waits on her, ſhe is indeed, much to be pitied; ſhe is truly a ſlave to this little feeble tyrant, who is ſuffered to torment her, without being taught that ſhe is in reality inferior to the poor girl. Children are really totally dependent on others; if
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031014_0060_0FEA4FE3A505C0B0"/>ſervants did not help them they would be miſerably ſituated; it is true ſervants are paid for what they do, but children do not pay them, and they are therefore doubly obliged to the kind parent who accommodates them with the aſſiſtance they want and cannot do without. I believe my memory will furniſh me with the words of a great French au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor * on this ſubject, let me ſee if you underſtand them. Ah "conſiderer l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fance en elle-meme y-a-t-il au monde un etre plus miſerable, plus a la merci de tout ce qui l'environne, qui ait ſi grand beſoin de pitie, d'amour, de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, qu'un enfant? Ne ſemble t'il-pas que c'eſt pour cela que les premieres voix qui lui ſont ſuggerés par la nature, ſont les ecris et les plaintes; ??Rouſſeau.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031014_0061_0FEA50F4BB341CD8"/>qu'elle lui a donné une figure ſi douce et un air ſi touchant afin que tout ce qui l'approche s'intereſſe a ſa foibleſſe et s'empreſſe a le ſecourir? Qu'y-a-t-il donc de plus choquant, de plus contraire a l'ordre que de voir enfant imperieux et mutin, commander a tout ce qui l'entoure prendre impudemment un ton de maitre avec ceux qui n'ont qu'a l'abandonner, pour le faire perir?" And again: "Les domeſtiques ont une véritable ſuperioritè ſur lui en ce qu'il ne ſauroit ſe paſſer d'eux tandis qu'il ne leur eſt bon a rien." Do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, Conſtantia?</p>

                  <speaker>CONSTANCE.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I comprehend the meaning of the ſentence, mama, but I do not entirely underſtand the words, will you be good enough to tranſlate it for me?</p>

                  <p>"If we conſider infancy in itſelf, is there in the world a being more feeble, more miſerable, more at the mercy of all who ſurround him, who has ſo great need of pity, of love, of protection, as a child? Does it not ſeem as if it were for this reaſon that the firſt ſound, which nature ſuggeſts to him are cries and complaints? That ſhe has given him a figure ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, and an air ſo touching, to the end that all who approach him may be intereſted by his weakneſs, and eager to ſuccour him? What then can be more ſhocking, more contrary to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than to ſee a child imperious and mutinous, commanding thoſe who are about him, boldly aſſuming the tone of a maſter with thoſe, who have nothing to do but abandon him to cauſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031014_0063_0FEA510679B39B40"/>Domeſtics have a real ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over him, in that he cannot do without them, while he is uſeleſs to them."</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CONSTANCE.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank you, my dear mama, what a charming leſſon this is, as well to me as all other children! I wiſh Miſs Selwyn could hear it.</p>

                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould be afraid, my dear, that her mind is too much over-clouded to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit reaſon and truth to make a proper impreſſion upon it! Another ſource of unhappineſs to her is the unbounded liberty ſhe has of eating whatever ſhe pleaſes in too large quantities. Mrs. Selwyn undoubtedly miſtakes this for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031014_0064_0FEA4FD2CB0E2F58"/>one mean of giving her pleaſure, and the conſequence is, ſhe ſpoils her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, making her perſon large, heavy, and dull, and what is worſe, ſhe injures her health, and of courſe clogs the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of her mind.</p>

                  <speaker>CONSTANCE.</speaker>
                  <p>But mama, is it poſſible any one can take pleaſure in eating too much?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas! yes, my dear; and unhappily, not only children fall into this deluſion. Many people, whoſe age and good ſenſe ought to teach them better, will perſiſt in eating ſuch things as diſagree with them, or too much of thoſe which are proper. As nothing is more degrading than the latter, which reduces human
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031014_0065_0FEA50E827394E38"/>nature to a level with the "brutes which periſh," nay <hi>below</hi> them, for <hi>they</hi> do not eat too much, ſo is there nothing more abſurd or more weak than the former ſpecies of folly! What; have we a right to riſk our health, our comfort, that of our families and friends, or even perhaps our lives, for the ſake of gratifying the taſte for a few minutes, a gratification which is ſo ſoon forgotten? Depend upon it, my dear child, from moderation and temperance alone are any laſting pleaſures to be derived</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CONSTANCE.</speaker>
                  <p>But I cannot think, mama, how any perſon can miſtake ſo much as to treat a little girl as Mrs. Selwyn treats hers!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear child, there is certainly noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031014_0066_0FEA50E0FA89EA88"/>ſo tender as the love of a fond mother. It is hard to deny any thing to a child, which ſeems at the time likely to give it pleaſure; but in a mind regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>principle,</hi> this paſſionate fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is repreſſed by the conſideration, that in the end it will render its object unhappy. A good mother is not <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> enough to endulge her own <hi>feelings</hi> by indulging her child, when ſhe knows, as a perſon accuſtomed to reaſon muſt know, that a child always indulged is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not ſo happy as one under proper controul, and that the conſequences of unlimited indulgence when this child grows up, will be frightful. The world will not humour her as her mother has done; ſhe muſt then be often thwarted if ſhe has good ſenſe; her life will be a conſtant ſtruggle between her humours and her reaſon if ſhe has not! What a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031014_0067_0FEA50F21BCE9378"/>character will hers be, at once weak and miſchievous; not knowing how to be happy herſelf, and not ſuffering any other to be ſo! The anxiety and trouble in the firſt, the hatred and miſery in the laſt, might have been ſpared her, had her mother known how to controul her! When a mother conſiders that theſe muſt be the conſequences of unbounded indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that ſhe is accountable to God for the well-being of her child, can ſhe dare to render it wretched and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal here, and hazard its happineſs hereafter!</p>

               <p>THE next morning Mrs. Leyſter received an anſwer to her letter reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mary Thomſon, by which ſhe found that her ſtory was perfectly true; and obtained a conformation of the good opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſhe had formed of her. Mrs. Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter immediately haſtened to ſet her mind at eaſe, and to impart the plan ſhe had formed for her future comfort. There was a ſmall houſe to be let in the village, and Mrs. Leyſter propoſed that Mary Thomſon ſhould take it; that ſhe ſhould keep a little ſchool to teach children to read and work, a thing much wanted in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031014_0072_0FEA50A1B078D040"/>the village, and alſo a little ſhop for pins, threads, tape, &amp;c. by which ſhe had no doubt of her getting a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able living. Mary Thomſon received this plan with the utmoſt gratitude; her only doubt was, whether the owner of the houſe would truſt her without ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and how ſhe ſhould raiſe a little money to buy a ſmall ſtock. "I am not rich," ſaid Mrs. Leyſter, "but I can afford without inconvenience to let you have a few pounds to buy a little furniture and ſtock, which you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by degrees; if you ſucceed, you ſhall repay me at the end of five years; I will be ſecurity for your firſt year's rent. I cannot do all I wiſh for you, but I will do all I can, and you ſhall be welcome to it. You ſhall dine here every Sunday, and Conſtantia will gladly be kind to her little Jenny.</p>

                  <p>My dear, you are not the firſt who has been miſtaken in this matter. Many people have in like manner, adopted a child, taken it out of the ſtation in which Providence had placed it; refined its ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, taught it various accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then, either by accident or neglect, have at their death left it to ſtruggle with a world with which it was unfit to contend. Luxury and refined ideas have already too much pervaded the lower as well as higher claſſes of people. The notion of equality is an
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031014_0076_0FEA50FD2AC6CA58"/>abſurd, an unnatural notion. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of man are never ſo well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, as in ſocieties where diſtinctions of rank and degree are preſerved. Are the ſavage tribes, where every man hunts, cooks and builds for himſelf, ſo happy as thoſe nations where every man has his diſtinct occupation? God has made a difference in his gifts, both bodily and mental, to different men; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly God has always intended a difference in degree, which theſe gifts will always preſerve. For inſtance, if five men were in an equal ſituation placed on a deſart ſhore, the wiſeſt would ſoon become governor, the moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageous would be their guard, their ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier; the ſtrongeſt would be their wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutter, their builder; the moſt agile would provide their food; the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious (for I diſtinguiſh between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031014_0077_0FEA510ADF5BBD90"/>and wiſdom) would be their mechanic. But Conſtance, I hardly know if you will underſtand all this ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation; I get a habit of talking to you on all ſubjects, hardly conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not they are intereſting to you, and this, from ſome ridiculous opinions I have lately heard, has been much upon my mind. <note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be obſerved, Mrs. Leyſter is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after the beginning of the French rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution.</note>

                  <p>For common ſervants, in my opinion it is quite ſufficient if they are taught their duty to God and man, and to read it in the Holy Scriptures. For them; eſpecially for women ſervants, <hi>I</hi> diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of learning to write. <hi>My</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has hitherto taught me, that thoſe who are inſtructed in that branch of learning, more frequently become idle ſcribblers, prying and curious into the affairs of others, than uſeful and active ſervants. I ſpeak with diffidence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for many wiſe and good people have thought otherwiſe. However, as Jenny will never, I hope, be reduced to the condition of a lower ſervant, I will allow you to teach her to read and ſpell well, to write, and the three firſt rules in arithmetic; plain work of every ſort,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031014_0079_0FEA506E4A360380"/>but no curious works. And ſhe ſhall be inſtructed by Martha in confectionary and paſtry. I will alſo have her know how to aſſiſt in cooking, in cleaning fine linen, and even doing the leſs laborious work of the houſe, that if any chance ſhould throw her out of our protection, ſhe may not be a poor helpleſs creature, a burthen to herſelf and others. Activity, and the power of providing for herſelf, are great virtues in hers, and indeed in <hi>every</hi> ſtation. And very early, I doubt not, my dear Conſtance, you will teach her the conſtant uſe of prayer and the firſt principles of religion. And as ſhe will be often with us, there is not, I hope, much reaſon to fear but her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and morals will be good. And now, tell me how you like my plan?</p>

                  <p>Nay, my child, ſuch an idea is not improbable, and I hope if it ſhould be realized, my Conſtantia would be reſigned, and conſole herſelf that her little adopted
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031014_0081_0FEA502E2496C688"/>child was better provided for. But not to dwell on ſo ſad an idea, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I will not at any time ſuffer the child to be dreſſed with any degree of <hi>finery,</hi> no ribbons, no ornaments of any kind; her dreſs ſhall be neat and clean, but no more; I will never have her taught to forget her origin, or be aſhamed of the lowly garb of her mother.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Here the converſation ended, and omitting many trifling occurrences, I ſhall let a year paſs in which nothing very material happened. Conſtantia grew and improved: Little Jenny was to her a conſtant ſource of amuſement and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. She could now talk, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia waited impatiently the end of another year, at which time ſhe hoped to begin teaching her to read. Mary Thomſon was placed in the houſe Mrs.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031014_0082_0FEA4FF2AECD4ED8"/>Leyſter had promiſed her, and ſucceeded extremely well. The ſpring was now beginning to appear, and Conſtantia ſpent much of her time in her little gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Her flowers were finer than uſual; ſhe looked forward to their blooming, and drew from air and exerciſe a fine healthy bloom, which proved the goodneſs of her conſtitution. She was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twelve and thirteen, tall and well made, with a face not indeed beautiful, but extremely pleaſing, becauſe it ſpoke ſweetneſs of temper, good ſenſe, and an affectionate feeling heart; nor was her appearance deceitful, for ſhe really poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all theſe amiable qualities.</p>
               <p>One morning the footman brought Mrs. Leyſter a letter; ſhe opened it, ſaying, "from my ſiſter!" while Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance went on with her work. "Bleſs

                        <p>THE ſyſtem of education; againſt which you have ſo often argued, I at laſt find to be erroneous. Alicia has deceived my expectations. She has been imprudent, diſingenuous, and unfaithful to her promiſe. Theſe are harſh expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and if I did not hope the error aroſe rather from habit and want of thought than from her heart, I ſhould be this day a miſerable creature; as it is, I am truly unhappy. Leſt you ſhould be too much alarmed, I will make haſte to diſcloſe the nature of the evil I lament. When Alicia was thirteen, I conſented, at her requeſt, to make her a yearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for clothes and pocket money,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031014_0086_0FEA50FA51FECFC0"/>upon promiſe that ſhe ſhould never at any time purchaſe any thing without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment. My allowance rather exceeded what had been before expended for her clothes, becauſe I knew it was in vain to expect exact economy from ſuch a girl. For the firſt quarter ſhe bought many expenſive trifles, and was in want of many neceſſary articles, ſuch as gloves, ſhoes, threads, &amp;c. I remarked to her this folly, and hoped in the ſecond quarter ſhe had corrected it. Here I allow I was myſelf guilty of a very great error: I ought to have made her ſet down every thing ſhe purchaſed, and have myſelf examined her accounts; but this, depending on her promiſe not to run in debt, I neglected to do. For this laſt quarter I have obſerved her frequently dejected, almoſt always grave, and was in pain for her health. About
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031014_0087_0FEA507F51386AB0"/>a month after I had paid her her laſt quarter, not having quite caſh enough in my purſe to pay a bill, I requeſted her to lend me two guineas. I knew it was not a month ſince I had paid her four, and as I had not obſerved ſhe had bought any thing, I concluded ſhe had almoſt the whole by her: ſhe bluſhed exceſſively, and after ſome heſitation, ſaid, ſhe had but one guinea left. "What," ſaid I; "three guineas in a month! and what are you to do till your quarter is again due?" "Oh, I ſhall not want to buy any thing." "But," ſaid I, "what have you done with it, you have nothing that I know of?" She ſtill looked exceſſively red and confuſed, and I determined to diſcover what all this meant. I will not tire you with particulars, but tell you at once; ſhe had been lead by the example of the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031014_0088_0FEA50D2F0E424D0"/>Miſs Seymours, who are always in debt, and ridiculed her ſcruples, to run in debt more than ſhe had even yet paid to her milliner, ſhoemaker and mantua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker. I repreſented to her the folly and impropriety of her conduct; ſhe ſaid it had made her exceſſively uneaſy, and after much converſation, I agreed to diſcharge her debts, which ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to ſome guineas, on two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; one, that ſhe ſhould give up half her allowance for the next year, and to break her intimacy with theſe idle girls, that ſhe ſhould go into the country for at leaſt half a year. And now, my dear ſiſter, will you exert that affection which I know you feel for me, and take upon yourſelf for a few months the care of this miſtaken girl. If you will, I ſhall feel myſelf for ever obliged to you,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031014_0089_0FEA5030E6F15C40"/>to whom I ſhall entruſt her with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit confidence, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Leyſter, however unwilling to be charged with a young perſon whoſe education had been ſo neglected, yet could not refuſe a ſiſter, whom, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever different from herſelf, ſhe ſincerely loved. She wrote, therefore, a letter of conſent, and Conſtantia one of invitation to her couſin. Conſtantia, ſhocked and ſurpriſed as ſhe was, yet made every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for her couſin, candor and good-nature could ſuggeſt, and impatiently waited her arrival; not becauſe ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any great addition to her own happineſs from it, for her couſin, ſhe was aware, loved purſuits far different from her own, but becauſe ſhe wiſhed to ſooth, by every kind attention, the

               <p>IN about a week's time Alicia ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. She was in her perſon a fine ſhewy girl, in her dreſs and air faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but her countenance wanted that ſoftneſs, thoſe ſmiles and bluſhes which adorned Conſtantia's expreſſive face, and her manner that retiring mildneſs which Conſtantia's exhibited. Conſtantia flew to welcome her, but her ſalute was coldly, even haughtily returned, and to the graver look of Mrs. Leyſter an air of ſullen pride was oppoſed. Alicia ſeemed to feel herſelf aggrieved
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031014_0092_0FEA5117DBE5FF90"/>by the obligation to viſit thoſe ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined beneath her, to be determined not to find amuſement in any thing they could offer her, and to think her fault much too ſeverely puniſhed by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a reſidence ſo unpleaſant. Not a word was ſpoken of the cauſe of her viſit, and Conſtantia recovering her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, which Alicia's coldneſs had damped, anxiouſly tried to amuſe her. After tea, Conſtantia aſked her couſin how ſhe would like to employ herſelf.</p>

               <p>Conſtantia, perceiving their opinions were ſo different that an argument would be endleſs, again propoſed a walk in the garden, which, with a ſort of indolent indifference Alicia agreed to; but this walk afforded neither any pleaſure;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031014_0095_0FEA50E5E3027A88"/>Conſtantia vainly pointed out beauties, of which Alicia had no idea. The glow of the ſetting ſun, its beams brightening the diſtant view, over which the various ſhades of ſpring were ſpread, its laſt rays ſoftening by degrees from rich purple and gold into the mild grey of twilight, afforded to Alicia no pleaſure, though Conſtantia's heart ſwelled with pleaſure at the ſight. Alicia, perceiving her pleaſure, ſaid with a ſmile of contempt:</p>

Mrs. Leyſter and Conſtantia retired to the window, that ſhe might ſpeak without reſtraint; but ſuddenly exclaiming; "Say; I will write ſoon," ſhe ran out of the room. Conſtantia much affected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained below ſome minutes, and in the mean time Mrs. Woodford's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant got into the carriage and drove away. Conſtantia then followed her couſin; ſhe found her at the window of her room, looking after the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in tears. "Ah!" ſhe exclaimed, before Conſtance could approach her, "ſhe will again ſee London and my dear mother! and I am left in this horrid place! Good God! was it <hi>my</hi> fault!" She ſtopped, hearing Conſtantia's ſtep, and with an angry tone, ſaid, "Have I not even the priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilege of being alone? I am not uſed,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031014_0099_0FEA50EFA02C1580"/>Miſs Leyſter, to be thus intruded upon! Ah, I am indeed very little uſed to any thing I can expect to meet with <hi>here</hi>!" Conſtantia, who had been half terrified by her firſt addreſs, now ſeeing her in an agony of grief, approached, and claſping her in her arms ſaid, "My deareſt couſin, I beg you to pardon me if I am an intruder; I came to ſee if I could do any thing to comfort you, but if you wiſh me gone I will leave you. But why ſhould you wiſh it? Suffer me to be your friend; ſuffer me, if poſſible, to make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py!" Alicia, ſoftened by her tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, now felt the coldneſs, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with which ſhe had hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her was melting faſt from about her heart; ſhe returned Conſtantia's embrace, and ſhed tears of affection and gratitude on her boſom. For ſome time
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031014_0100_0FEA5267F3FA0BA8"/>neither could ſpeak, but at laſt Alicia ſaid, "you are very good; better than I either expected or deſerved. You know I have much to lament; leave me, pray, my dear, I will ſoon come down." Conſtantia inſtantly left her. In about an hour Alicia came down ſtairs, her manner in a great meaſure changed. To her aunt ſhe was more reſpectful and leſs cold, and to Conſtance more affectionate. Still ſhe treated her as a child, and as being much inferior to herſelf; ſhe ſtill ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuppoſe it impoſſible that a girl educated in the country could have any accompliſhments, or be enabled to form a proper judgment on any ſubject. To read, except the light publications of the hour, ſhe had never been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed. Needle-work, and moſt of the little ingenious reſources of women in
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031014_0101_0FEA533C6DF90330"/>general, ſhe deſpiſed as beneath her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The fifth morning after her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival Conſtantia's drawing maſter came. Her port-folio and implements were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly produced. "Bleſs me, Miſs Leyſter," ſaid Alicia, "do you draw?" "A little," replied Conſtance, "but I am very fond of it." "So am I," ſaid Alicia, "though I have not practiſed lately; if you will give me a pencil I will try." "Oh, willingly," ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, well pleaſed that ſhe could find any amuſement. They then ſat down. Conſtantia's maſter gave her a ſubject, and while ſhe began the deſign, amuſed himſelf with making ſketches. Alicia began a bunch of flowers, and all was ſilent. In about half an hour Conſtance aſked her maſter ſome queſtion, and Alicia, caſting her eyes on Conſtantia's drawing, exclaimed, "Bleſs me, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031014_0102_0FEA533A1C40D578"/>do <hi>you</hi> deſign <hi>figures</hi>?" "Yes," anſwered Conſtantia, "why are you ſo ſurpriſed?" Oh, becauſe, becauſe, you ſaid you drew but a little." "Miſs Leyſter, is very modeſt, Ma'am," ſaid the drawing maſter, "but the fact is, I have very little more to teach her. Very well done, indeed; pray Ma'am look at this figure, it is Lavinia from Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Seaſons; is not the drapery well done?" "Yes, very well," ſaid Alicia coolly; then riſing, ſhe tore her own performance in two and threw it into the grate. "Dear couſin," ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, "are you tired, why have you torn your drawing?" "Becauſe I was not pleaſed with it," ſaid Alicia grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The drawing time was ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; Conſtantia's performance was greatly advanced, and ſhe was to finiſh it before her maſter came again. When
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031014_0103_0FEA5328F8CFC320"/>he was gone, Mrs. Leyſter commended the drawing, and told Conſtance ſhe had given her great pleaſure by her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. "Ah, mama," ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, "I have no merit in applying to drawing, becauſe I love it ſo much, but if it were diſagreeable to me, I ſhould be over-paid by your being pleaſed. In the courſe of this day Alicia, who fancied her couſin could know nothing becauſe ſhe had been brought up in the country, had the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortification of finding ſhe knew French much better than herſelf, that ſhe had ſome knowledge of Italian, and that ſhe danced vaſtly well. Her converſations alſo with her mother proved her ſo well acquainted with all books proper for her age, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſo much knowledge in geography, natural hiſtory, and the hiſtory of her
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031014_0104_0FEA526A5E6887D8"/>own country, beſides a thouſand little ingenious works, and that young as ſhe was, ſhe aſſiſted a great deal in the family management, that Alicia began to take ſhame to herſelf for her. Thus they paſſed a fortnight, and every day added to Alicia's concealed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her couſin; when ſhe ſaw how readily Conſtance employed thoſe hours which <hi>ſhe</hi> found ſo heavy, how happy ſhe was and how agreeable, ſhe began to wiſh herſelf like her. In look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſome books ſhe found the Tales of the Caſtle in French, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance warmly recommended to her peruſal. She took the firſt volume, becauſe ſhe knew not what to do. The ſtory of Delphine, arreſted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; her heart told her there was ſome ſimilarity between herſelf and Delphine, and between Henrietta Stein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031014_0105_0FEA52568B2370C0"/>and her couſin; ſhe bluſhed as ſhe read, and the tears ſwelled in her eyes. Mrs. Leyſter obſerved but would not interrupt her: in a few minutes ſhe ſtole out of the room with the book in her hand, and was not viſible again till dinner time; ſhe then appeared to have been weeping, and her manner was grave and dejected. After dinner they walked out. Alicia, who now began to feel real reſpect and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, walked with her arm through hers, Mrs. Leyſter ſometimes with them, ſometimes at a little diſtance gathering moſſes and plants which the ſpring produced; for ſuch a long reſidence in the country had made her a ſort of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical botaniſt. They called on Mrs. Thomſon, who received them with grateful reſpect, and little Jenny with rapture. She had been confined by a
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031014_0106_0FEA5258119F6210"/>cold, but was to come the next day to paſs two or three with Conſtantia. While Conſtance was playing with her, Mrs. Leyſter ſaid ſhe and Alicia would ſtep in and ſpeak to Dame Burden; "I will follow you in ten minutes, mama," ſaid Conſtance, and away they went. Dame Burden was a poor old woman, who had been confined many years to her bed with the rheumatiſm. They found her with every thing about her quite clean, and though in great pain, rejoiced by the viſit. "But where," ſaid ſhe, "is my dear young lady; I hope ſhe is not ill. I have not ſeen her this fortnight, and I don't know when ſhe has ſtaid away ſo long from her poor old woman."</p>

               <p>THE next morning Alicia, whoſe ſtudies and obſervations the day before had left upon her mind a ſort of painful pleaſure, who felt unſettled and diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with herſelf, uneaſy between her newly acquired conſciouſneſs of being wrong and her pride, again went to the book-caſe. The volume ſhe had been reading was up ſtairs; ſhe was too indolent to fetch it; ſhe therefore took down two <hi>new-looking books,</hi> and read two or three <hi>Dramatic Dialogues.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">By the Author of this Work.</note> At laſt ſhe turned to the little Country Viſitor, and there ſhe found confirmation that ſhe had been wrong; there ſhe ſaw
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031014_0113_0FEA532B35863988"/>a character in many reſpects like her own, placed in a ridiculous and ſtriking point of view. She was vexed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed: ſtill ſhe read on, and when ſhe had finiſhed, ſhe ſtruggled with her tears till ſhe could no longer reſtrain them, and burſting into a fit of crying, ſhe was leaving the room; but Conſtance, who was reading alſo, ran to her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, "My dear couſin, what is the matter?" "Nothing, nothing" ſobbed out Alicia. "Nothing!" replied Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, "and yet you cry ſo!—Oh, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, that cannot be!"—Mrs. Leyſter then approaching, embraced Alicia, and ſaid, "My dear child compoſe yourſelf, and do not ſtrive to ſuppreſs an emotion which does you ſo much credit!

She had by many years experience learned in what manner it was proper a young woman ſhould dreſs. Believe me, my dear, if with ſixteen guineas a year you could not keep out of debt, you would have been involved if you had had twenty or thirty. To be happy, we muſt learn to live within our income, be it what it may.

                  <p>Yes, my dear, but conſider, if every body acted thus, thoſe you employ would have no ready money to pay thoſe who work for them, and though the great ſhopkeepers may not be materially hurt, yet thoſe who muſt have their money from day to day would ſtarve if they were not paid.

                  <p>Believe me, my dear Alicia, that my earneſt manner ariſes only from my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere wiſh to convince you of your error. That you were not worſe than your companions does not <hi>juſtify</hi> you, though it <hi>condemns</hi> them. But to enforce what I ſay, ſuffer me to tell you a little ſtory of which I know the truth. When I was in London, juſt after my marriage, a young friend and myſelf were paſſing through a narrow ſtreet in my carriage, when a little boy ran directly under the horſes feet; providentially I ſaw him time enough, by pulling the check, to ſave him from being much hurt. I inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jumped out, and inquired of two or
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031014_0123_0FEA5210C5A4CF18"/>three people the accident had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whoſe child he was; they point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a mean looking houſe, where they ſaid his parents lived, and my young friend and I went in, followed by the footman carrying the child, who though meanly dreſſed was clean and pretty. A young ſickly looking woman, who was rocking a cradle with her foot, while her hands were buſily employed in making a gown, roſe with ſurpriſe to receive us, but ſhe was ſadly alarmed when ſhe ſaw the child pale and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. We ſoon compoſed her mind, and ſhe thanked us in terms above her ſtation. I promiſed to call again the next day to inquire after the child, and after ſlipping a guinea into his little hand we went away. The next day I did not fail to call, and found the child quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The young woman's thanks and manner of ſpeaking were modeſt and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031014_0124_0FEA526149FC6968"/>intereſting; there was an air of cleanly poverty about them, and ſhe ſeemed ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I made a few inquiries about her way of life, and as ſhe was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I eaſily learned the following partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulars. She had been brought up genteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but was reduced by her father's death to the neceſſity of getting her own bread. A relation has apprenticed her to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua-maker, and when her time was out ſhe ſet up for herſelf, and ſoon obtained ſufficient buſineſs to ſupport her, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the employment of two very young ladies of quality, whoſe mother at that time ſuperintended their clothes. She ſoon after married a young man who was journeyman to a great ſilk-mercer, and they went on very well till after the birth of their firſt child; then theſe two young ladies I ſpoke of before having obtained an <hi>allowance</hi> from their mother, began not to be ſo punctual in their
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031014_0125_0FEA53186AB84398"/>payments. Still Mrs. Martin worked for them. She was frequently ordered to buy linings and trimmings of various ſorts, for which ſhe paid, but was not paid again. The perſon who employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her huſband failed, and went off ſome pounds in debt, and as ſhe had now a long bill on her faſhionable cuſtomers, ſhe ventured, the next time they ordered ſomething, to hint ſhe ſhould be glad of a little money. Promiſes were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, promiſes which were never kept. Her affairs began to get deranged, as her huſband was out of employment, and was afflicted with a conſumptive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which prevented his getting any. At this unfortunate time poor Mrs. Martin lay in of her ſecond child, and her little ſtock of money was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all expended. She knew the ſum her two principal cuſtomers owed her would ſupport them till ſhe could
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031014_0126_0FEA51EC89A55470"/>get again to work, ſhe ventured therefore to ſend a note by her huſband to entreat the payment of it. But her huſband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the ſad intelligence that only one ſervant was left in the houſe, and the whole family was gone to Spa for a twelvemonth! This was a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtroke! They were ſlightly indebted to their landlady, and a few other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: theſe debts they had no means of diſcharging but by ſelling ſome of their furniture. The woman with whom they lodged took alarm, and at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that ſhe had let her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to "people who would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſell their furniture to pay her!" They were therefore under the neceſſity of removing to the poor houſe, where I found then, and where it was too much trouble to ſome of her fine cuſtomers to come.— "A mantua-maker in ſuch a vulgar place!—They were ſorry for her,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:031014_0127_0FEA524EFA6A3558"/>but henceforth they ſhould employ Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame A—r, Madamoiſelle B—, who lived in ſuch a ſquare or ſtreet!" The poor young woman, haraſſed and hardly recovered from her lying in, could now ſcarcely get work enough to find them neceſſaries. I am afraid my dear, I tire you with my long ſtory.</p>

                  <p>Her huſband was not in hopes of getting a place in an eminent ſilk-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031014_0128_0FEA531BB6358488"/>ſhop. I inquired the name of the ladies who had gone away in their debt, and found I had a ſlight acquaintance with their family. I then, after making inquiries which confirmed the truth of their ſtory, and the good opinion I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of them, drove to Mr. — the ſilk-mercer's, with whom I had laid out a conſiderable ſum on my marriage. I did not leave him till I had obtained his promiſe to employ poor Martin with a comfortable ſalary. I afterwards wrote in my own name to one of the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at Spa, and after ſeverely cenſuring their unjuſt conduct, I told them if the money was not remitted within a certain time, I ſhould write an account of their behavior to their mother. The money was almoſt immediately remitted to me, with a civil letter, and many attempts at excuſes. With this ſum I adviſed Mrs. Martin to remove to a genteel part of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031014_0129_0FEA532458C8D558"/>the town: I gave her my own cuſtom, and recommended her to many others. I had the pleaſure of ſeeing my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors ſucceed, and with very little expenſe or trouble to myſelf, I had the happineſs of reſcuing theſe poor people from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and ſeeing them in a flouriſhing way. Poor Martin's health was recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and they were both till their deaths, which happened ſoon after each other within theſe four years, the moſt grateful, induſtrious creatures I ever knew. The boy is now in the ſea ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the girl with a milliner in Bond-ſtreet, and both likely to do well. I ſee, my dear Alicia, I need not impreſs this ſtrongly on your mind. You feel how unjuſt muſt be that conduct, which may ſo eaſily involve a whole family in ruin. Beſides, if this unhappy propenſity to living beyond your income grow up with you, when you are your own miſtreſs,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031014_0130_0FEA5214EB7EFE98"/>and perhaps have the care of a family, the miſchief will become more extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: inevitable ruin to yourſelf and your family muſt enſue, for no income can equal the profuſeneſs of an extravagant, careleſs woman. Beſides, by your nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily large dealings, you involve num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in your ruin. A large tradeſman ſtops payment, becauſe his cuſtomers do not pay him, and inſtantly half a dozen ſmall families are reduced to abſolute want; they again draw in others, and there is no ſaying where the miſchief will end.</p>

                  <p>It is true. Virtue alone is the ſure baſis of friendſhip. Without it we may form intimacies, connections, and even unworthy confidences, but friendſhip can only ſubſiſt between thoſe who love vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Alicia then withdrew to write to her mother, which ſhe did in the tendereſt and moſt penitent terms. She ſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears over her letter, but they were not tears of reſentment and vexation, they flowed from a heart convinced of its errors, and taſting, for the firſt time, all the ſweetneſs of candor and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and as ſuch they at once purified and gratified her feelings.</p>
               <p>After this, tranquillity was reſtored at Fair Lawn, and Conſtantia and Alicia
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031014_0134_0FEA522673EC4838"/>became inſeparable companions. The more Alicia knew of her conſin, the more ſhe diſcovered that far from being her ſuperior, ſhe was really greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Conſtance in every deſirable acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After having received an anſwer from her mother full of pardon and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhe wrote again, begging per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to take leſſons of drawing with Conſtantia, which was readily granted, and ſhe ſet about improving in it with the more alacrity, becauſe ſhe was really fond of the art. Inſtead of contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declining, ſhe now endeavoured to find pleaſure in the ſimple but natural and uſeful purſuits of her couſin; and though her mind could not all at once gain that energy which made them ſo delightful to Conſtantia, yet by degrees they became agreeable to her. As ſhe became more acquainted with books, and particularly the poems of Thomſon and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031014_0135_0FEA51FD40450FB0"/>Cowper,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Thomſon's Seaſons and Cowper's Taſk.</note> a thouſand natural beauties ſhe had before overlooked, now charmed her eyes and gratified her heart; and learning to be charitable from thoſe ſhe was with, ſhe found that to ſacrifice an expenſive ornament or piece of millinery, by giving the money they would have coſt to the poor, gave her more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure than ſhe could have received from wearing them. Her perſon improved by exerciſe and the new virtues of her mind, her manners acquired a ſoftneſs and modeſty, and in three months time ſhe would ſcarcely have been known. Mrs. Leyſter, however, obſerved, that ſhe had not loſt, and that Conſtance had acquired one of Alicia's bad habits; ſhe waited for a proper opportunity to rebuke her for it, and it occurred. They ſat at work one morning; Conſtantia
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031014_0136_0FEA5249A7FF3260"/>riſing haſtily tore her gown (which was confined by Alicia's chair) and inſtantly exclaimed, "Oh my God, couſin, you have torn my gown!"</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. LEYSTER.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope you never will. Even if it were not extremely wicked, which it is, there is ſomething ſo bold, ſo unfeminine in a woman's uſing ſuch expreſſions, that I never can bear to hear it. My dear Alicia bluſhes and looks abaſhed. I own my dear, I have obſerved this ill habit in you with great pain, and only waited a favorable moment to tell you of it. Conſtantia has learned it of you, you I ſuppoſe learnt it of your London friends. I know too many young women think nothing of ſuch appeals to the Deity, nor of other improper exclamations. They think, I believe, that it gives them an
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031014_0139_0FEA524712FC07F8"/>air of faſhion, whereas in reality the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the people are the greateſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this way. Theſe young ladies alledge that they mean nothing by it; but what then, can they no expreſs their ſurpriſe by more decent exclamations, and without breaking an abſolute <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmant</hi>? Some of them, I am afraid, ſeldom hear the name of God, except when it "is taken in vain." For them I feel extreme pity, for their inſtructors, utter indignation. But for religious young women, thoſe who know and rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence the "Father of all," to uſe ſuch expreſſions, is really ſhocking. And if for every idle word we ſhall be called to account, as the ſcripture aſſures us, how ſhall thoſe anſwer who wantonly and wilfully are perpetually taking the name of "God in vain?" Correct, both of you, I entreat you, this terrible cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031014_0140_0FEA5334F57B6418"/>and let me never more have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reprove you on this ſubject.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Lectures like this on many errors Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia frequently received, but delivered with ſuch ſweetneſs of manner, ſuch ſtrength of reaſoning, ſhe could not be diſpleaſed with them; they every day became leſs and leſs neceſſary, and by the end of the ſix months which ſhe had promiſed to ſpend in the country, ſhe was every thing that could be wiſhed. Mrs. Woodford came at the end of that time to ſee her ſiſter and niece, and to fetch home her daughter; but Alicia, no longer preſuming, conſcious of her former deficiencies, and fearful of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhe had acquired, begged to remain another half year in the country, at the expiration of which Mrs. Leyſter and Conſtance promiſed to return with her to London. To this Mrs. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031014_0141_0FEA526594A7F2D8"/>readily agreed, and delighted with the improvement of her daughter, and the goodneſs of Conſtantia, whom ſhe had not ſeen for many years, ſhe ſtaid a month with them and then returned to London. Conſtance had now the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of ſeeing her little Jenny old enough to profit by her leſſons, and the child grew and improved as much as ſhe could deſire. When Alicia returned to London, Mrs. and Miſs Leyſter went with her. They remained ſome weeks in town, enjoying in moderation the pleaſures it affords. They then went back, leaving the grateful Alicia with her happy moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with whom ſhe ſtill remains, though a frequent interchange of viſits is kept up between the inhabitants of Fair Lawn and Mrs. and Miſs Woodford. The latter is become one of the moſt amiable young women of the age; ſhe and Conſtantia are univerſally beloved in
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031014_0142_0FEA533EB0BE4580"/>the circle of their acquaintance; and both gratefully and conſtantly allow, that they owe all their happineſs to the kind inſtructions of Mrs. Leyſter, and a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the country, which has taught them, that juſtice and moderation are the ſecureſt means of obtaining true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
