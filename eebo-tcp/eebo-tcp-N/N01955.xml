            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Our <hi>Lord</hi> appeals to the <hi>Works and Miracles</hi> which he had wro't, as a <hi>greater</hi> Teſtimony than that of <hi>John.</hi> And laſtly, He refers 'em to the <hi>Scriptures of the Old Teſtament,</hi> and particularly to the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi> 1. To thoſe Scriptures <hi>in general: v.</hi> 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (and none other were then extant but the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets) for in them ye have Eternal life, and theſe are they which testify of me.</hi> 2. To the Writings of <hi>Moſes in particular: v.</hi> 45, 46, 47. <hi>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father,</hi> (i. e.

To obtain this for us the <hi>SON of GOD</hi> was to take <hi>our Nature</hi> in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, and therein die a Sacrifice for Sin, and <hi>make his Soul an Offering</hi> by the ſhedding his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>blood.</hi> Now as <hi>typical</hi> hereof and to direct the eyes and Faith of Mankind to the <hi>Great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Death of their Saviour,</hi> GOD inſtituted to <hi>Adam</hi> and to his <hi>Poſterity</hi> until the time of the Death of CHRIST the Worſhipping him by <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;</hi> being the Offering of the Lives and blood of

                  <p>ACCORDINGLY we may be ſure that <hi>Adam</hi> practis'd himſelf, and alſo inſtructed his Children in the Mode of worſhipping GOD by Sacrifice, and in the meaning thereof.

                  <p>THUS dying <hi>Jacob</hi> at a great diſtance <hi>ſaw Chriſt's day,</hi> and it was his great Comfort and Support on his Death-bed; as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> ſays on the place. He foretells that the <hi>Scepter</hi> ſhould come into the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> that <hi>Shilob</hi> the promiſed <hi>Seed</hi> ſhould be of it; that in <hi>Judah</hi> a Government of its own ſhould continue till the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> long after the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> had ceas'd, without any Revival. And ſo it was: Our LORD came of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of all his Saints; To Him belongs the <hi>Scepter,</hi> and He is the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</hi> In the day when the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected him, they confeſſed the Scepter departed from themſelves: <hi>We have no King but Caſar,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and again, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.</hi> See John 18.31. &amp; 19.15.</p>
                  <p>On theſe grounds we ſay then that our LORD JESUS is the CHRIST, the promiſed <hi>Shiloh;</hi> juſt about whoſe time on Earth <hi>the Scepter departed from Judah,</hi> and upon their diſperſion the <hi>Nations
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002324_0024_0FDB23E0A0640DA0"/>were Converted to Christ</hi> and taken into his Church; which is the Kingdom of GOD in the World. Gen. 19.18. <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS I have given a <hi>Specimen</hi> out of the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his <hi>firſt Book</hi> which is called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> by which we may ſee how much he wrote of CHRIST; and that if we believe his Writings we muſt needs believe in Chriſt, that He is the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and the Saviour of Men.</p>
                  <p>THE time would ſail me ſhould I now look into <hi>the other Books of Moſes,</hi> to interpret what he there writes concerning <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Deliverance of the <hi>Jewiſh Church out of Egypt</hi> was a great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Type of the <hi>Redomption of Souls</hi> from the more cruel and miſerable ſervitude of Sin and Saran: The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was an Eminent figure of the Son and Lamb of God ſlain for us; our <hi>Sacrificed Saviour:</hi> The <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven was a figure of Him the <hi>true Bread,</hi> and bread of <hi>Life:</hi> The water from the <hi>ſmitten Rock</hi> which followed the thirſty Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and ſatisfy'd 'em, was a figure of the Overflowing and <hi>ever flowing refreſh. wants and Conſclations</hi> for every famiſhing and thirſty Soul from a <hi>Smitten Saviour:</hi> The <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Tabernacle; Priesthood, Sacrifices;</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial <hi>Uncleanneſſes</hi> and <hi>Cleanſings;</hi> were full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Myſtery pointing to <hi>Christ,</hi> His Natures, Offices, Sacrifice and Benefits: And finally, The <hi>Moſaical Festivals</hi> and <hi>Solemnities;</hi> the Day of <hi>Atonement,</hi> the feaſt of <hi>Penticoſt</hi> and <hi>Tabernacles, Trumpets</hi> and <hi>New Moons,</hi> the <hi>Sabbatical Year</hi> and the "<hi>Jubilee,</hi> did in many reſpects refer to <hi>him:</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians, The Law was a School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>THE Converſion of <hi>Mr. Monis</hi> to Chriſtianity, is an Effect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace. The Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his Converſion appears in what is here Exhibited, in that he has notably confuted the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Old-Teſtament,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to believe. Here is alſo aſſerted and proved, <hi>the Deity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

There will a time come when there ſhall be a General Converſion of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation.</hi> There have been ſome of that Nation brought home to Chriſt, who have proved Bleſſings to the World. In ſpecial <hi>Emanue! Tremelius</hi> was ſuch an one, whoſe dying Words were, <hi>Vivat Chriſtus, et pereat Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi> Let Chriſt Live, and let Barrabas Die.

                  <p>IT is moreover True, that many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Jews,</hi> who have been Converted or rather Perverted to Popery, have after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MANY other Examples I might mention but I forbear. There is no cauſe to fear that <hi>Mr. Monis</hi> will Renounce his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, ſince he did embrace it Voluntarily and Gradually, and with much Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  <p>ONE thing I would intreat of you, (which in caſe you will be willing to grant unto me, I am in great hopes you love your Souls, and hear that brotherly affection and love towards

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dear Brethren,</hi> I can't but think ſome of you are very much troubled at my proceedings, but this I would deſire and heartily beſeech of you, to know and be fully perſwaded, that the Christian Religion (the Proteſtant I mean) is not ſuch a one as you take it to be, but it is the best of all Religions, and <hi>ſo far as I know</hi> the cleareſt from Superſtitions of any whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>THE Doctrine of the ever bleſſed Trinity (that you very much ſtumble at) is not an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous one (as you thro' a miſtake do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) but a true and certain one, that God has been pleaſed to reveal in his Word, i. e. <hi>in the Old Teſtament</hi> from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (<hi>vide, the third Diſcourſe</hi>) altho', not with that clearneſs as <hi>He</hi> did afterwards in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which I most ſurely and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002324_0041_0FDB240883492BD8"/>certainly believe to be the Word of God, as well as the Old; becauſe I cannot ſee any ſubstantial reaſon that can be alledged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the Authority of the <hi>New,</hi> but the ſame may be brought to deſprove the veracity of the <hi>Old;</hi> and ſo to the contrary the ſame Reaſons that any <hi>Rabby</hi> whatſoever may bring to prove the Truth of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the rest of his Words, the very ſame may be with equal strength improved to evidence the certainty of Chriſt's Wonderful Works and Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>INDEED if I had declared my ſelf, to be one of the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> Communion, I ſhould not Wonder, in caſe I was cenſured by the leaſt of you, becauſe that would be nothing elſe but practically to deny the Law and the Prophets, &amp;c. But ſince I have not (God forbid that I or any of you ſhould,) and my embracing the Proteſtant Religion, I did it not raſhly, but upon mature thoughts and deliberation (as you may ſee by the following Diſcourſes, and more of this Nature that I do deſign to acquaint you with, if God by His moſt holy will and pleaſure, ſhall open the way for it.) I hope you will follow the Advice of our Countryman ELELL, left recorded for your imitation, in the Second Chap. of MASSECHETH AUBOTH, § 4.</p>

This Maxim is ancient and infallible, and ſo common that nothing can be more obvious to the beholders. We have heard or ſeen ſeveral inſtances of this Nature, not only in Worldly Affairs, but even in Spiritual alſo. We read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.39. how the Great <hi>Doctor Gamaliel</hi> uſed this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for the Deliverance of <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> from the hands of their Perſecutors, ſaying, <hi>If it be of God ye cannot overthrow it,</hi> i. e. if the Doctrine which theſe Men teach is founded upon Mens Foundation (as that of <hi>Teudas,</hi> and of <hi>Judas the Galilean</hi> were,) it ſhall certainly periſh; but in caſe their Doctrine, is founded upon a ſure and good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,

The Jewiſh <hi>Senate</hi> as ſoon as they heard him ſay ſo, were convinced with the ſtrength of the Argument, and reſted from killing them; and they being delivered, went on to teach and preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Temple, and in every houſe daily: and becauſe the Foundation which the Apoſtles did lay their Doctrine upon, was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> For this reaſon it not only flouriſh'd, but it hath laſted ever ſince, and ſhall endure for ever.

                  <p>THESE are the chief Arguments, or Objections that I remember the Modern <hi>Rabbins</hi> do make to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves by, and with them do oppoſe their True <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and are the only ones, which I think deſerves Notice, ſo far as to beſtow any pains in Anſwer to them. (Hoping in Caſe I ſhall anſwer them in full, with God's Bleſſing it will make ſuch a deep Impreſſion on the Hearts of my Brethren, as to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and Publickly Confeſs it.) viz.</p>
                  <p>The</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, Argument is, <hi>THAT at the Coming of the Meſſiah, there ſhall be a great War, called the War of Gog and Magog, and the Army of ſaid King ſhall conſiſt of a certain Dwarf kind of People which ſhall come againſt the Meſſiah, and he, the Meſſiah, ſhall overcome him, and kill him by the Breath of his Mouth.</hi> This their Opinion is grounded upon the 38th, and 39th, Chapters of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and they argue thus; Since ſaid War never was as yet, neither when Chriſt came, nor afterwards, ergo, The Meſſiah is yet to come.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>TO underſtand what the Prophet ſays, according to the Interpretation which their Modern <hi>Rabbins</hi> have newly Invented, (who apply ſo many different Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to maintain their Chimaerical notions, as I could make it appear if I had a mind to expoſe them) I think it is nothing but a Folly, and I am ſure if the Spirit of Truth had not left them, they could very quickly ſee with what kind of Food they have been
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002324_0050_0FDB241996336920"/>fed of late by ſome of their <hi>New upstart Rabbins.</hi> Particularly ever ſince they took ſuch an Averſion &amp; Hatred to all Religions in the World, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the beſt of all Religions, even the Religion of our <hi>Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and have left the good old way, which their ancient <hi>Rabbins</hi> did conſtantly put upon the Prophetical Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay,</p>
                  <p>THAT there ſhall be a War, and <hi>a Great one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> in the Latter end, <hi>I Believe,</hi> becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet plainly ſays ſo; But that this War ſhould be at the firſt Advent of the Meſſiah, and that the Meſſiah's Enemies ſhould be a parcel of Dwarfs (as they Dream,) <hi>this is altogether falſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe Nations mentioned in theſe Chapters which ſhall join together with King <hi>Gog</hi> in this War, are very well known in the World, (if we underſtand it Literally) as the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> Deciphered in <hi>Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Toobaul;</hi> the <hi>Mahometan Perſians</hi> in <hi>Pauraſs;</hi> the <hi>Arabian Ethiopians</hi> in <hi>Kooſh;</hi> the <hi>Libyians</hi> in <hi>Poot;</hi> the <hi>Galatians</hi> in <hi>Gomerr;</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>

                  <p>I cannot but admire the <hi>Jewiſh Nations</hi> Notion to believe, this War ſhould be in the firſt advent of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> ſince one of the principal Arguments which they alledge againſt the certainty of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being come, is that general Peace that ſhould be in his days, and for ever more after, as we ſhall underſtand anon. And yet they argue againſt us becauſe there was he War; how could it be a War (and of ſuch quality and quantity as this is deſcribed by the Prophet in theſe two Chapters) and yet be Peace? Or how could it be a general Peace in his days, and for evermore after, and a War in the ſame time? Theſe two things Peace and War, are ſo contrary one to another, that can never be reconelled in the World as the <hi>Jewiſh
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002324_0052_0FDB241F0ED62820"/>Nation</hi> do believe, i. e. To be all in one ſelf ſame time and perſon; therefore ſince both Prophecies are true, becauſe both proceed from the Fountain of Truth, we muſt certainly conclude they ſpeak of two different times, as we ſay, i. e. the Peace time, at the firſt advent of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Wars time, ſome time before his Second Coming.</p>
                  <p>FOR the Confirmation of my Aſſertion, I will quote one ſingle paſſage more out of their own <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> and then conclude with this Argument, viz.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>NOW out of theſe Sentences I gather Two things; <hi>firſt,</hi> that the time of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the time of <hi>Gog</hi> are two different Times, and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that Chriſt was to be a <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> contrary to what they are willing now to own, becauſe they ſay, <hi>that be ſhall kill the wicked with the Speech of his Lips,</hi> and I ask, who is that that could or can kill another Man like himſelf with a ſingle Breath only? Did ever any Man do ſuch a thing? Or can any Man kill the leaſt viſible Creature by the Breath of his Mouth only, much more a Man?

                  <p>IF I was of the Opinion of ſeveral Divines, and even of ſundry <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> I could make it appear that all thoſe places they quote to uphold their Opinion, and ſeveral more ſcattered up and down in the Old Teſtament, are already fulfill'd in their Deliverance from the <hi>Babylonian Captivity;</hi> and likewiſe that the Ten Tribes, which <hi>Shalmanezer</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> carry'd Captive to <hi>Halah</hi> and <hi>Haber</hi> by the River <hi>Gozan,</hi> and in the Cities of the Medes, as we read in 2 Kin. 17.6. &amp; 18, 11; are either totally loſt, or at leaſt they are ſo mixed and mingled with thoſe Nations where they were carried, that their return in a diſtinct Body as they were before their Captivity, is next to impoſſible.</p>

BUT ſince I cannot ſee ſo clearly into the Expoſition of the ſaid Prophecies as they do, I beg leave to diſſent from them in this point; Becauſe at that time, i. e. at their return from <hi>Babel,</hi> neither the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> nor the whole <hi>Two</hi> did return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at that time they were not ſcattered all over the World, and therefore they could not be gathered from whence they were not; and the words ſeems plainly to declare they ſhould be ſcattered, becauſe in Iſai. 11.11, 12. it is ſaid, that the <hi>Diſperſed of Judah ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the four Corners (or Wings) of the Earth.</hi> Therefore I am prone to think this Prophecy does ſpeak of the ſtate and condition, the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> are now under, ſcattered up and down the whole World, and that God doth here promiſe to gather them as they were before.</p>
                  <p>BUT this one Thing I would put the <hi>Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in mind of, i. e. that altho', I grant their return, and plead for them, againſt thoſe that underſtand it otherwiſe; yet let them know, and be fully perſwaded, that this return will never come to paſs, till they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and <hi>Goell,</hi> i. e. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> can't bear to hear this <hi>Condition,</hi> becauſe (they ſay) nothing of that nature is mentioned in theſe places. Therefore my buſineſs at preſent is to make it appear, that this <hi>Condition,</hi> i. e. of <hi>their Converſion to Chriſtianity</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; elſe, I know they will never be ſatisfy'd; (and pray God they may after.)</p>
                  <p>N.B. AS it is a thing granted of both ſides <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that God is Infinite, Unchangeable, and Righteous, to fulfill all his Promiſes, ſo likewiſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002324_0056_0FDB242895E05398"/>we muſt certainly conclude and believe, that the ſame Spirit of Truth which communicated the Will and Mind of God to one Prophet, the ſame was with another, and altho' they ſeem ſometimes to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict one another; nevertheleſs, they all ſpeak true, and the fault lies in us, who have not ſenſe enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, ſo as to reconcile them together, and make them ſpeak one and the ſelf ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>NOW the way and Method that we muſt take to reconcile thoſe Places which ſeems to contradict one another is, to have a recourſe to another place in the very Word of God, which ſpeaks of the ſame thing with more clear expreſſions, and not to depend upon the Explication of any Man whatſoever (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, i. e. to the Pope,) becauſe in the very <hi>Word</hi> of God we ſhall find ſufficient Light to inlighten us in any thing that we are in need of. Now if we read ſome places in the Bible, and take them ſeperately from any other, we ſhall find very plainly the downfal of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> ſo as they ſhall never riſe more. As in Hoſ. 1.6. We read thus, <hi>I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael, but I will utterly take them away.</hi> So likewiſe in Amos 5.1, 2. <hi>Hear ye this word which I take up againſt you, even a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation O houſe of Iſrael: The Virgin of Iſrael is fallen, ſhe ſhall no more riſe; ſhe is forſaken upon her land, there is none to riſe her up.</hi> In Iſai. 6.10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, &amp; ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee withtheir eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</hi> And ſeveral more.</p>
                  <p>AND if we look in other places (as thoſe cited by the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi>) we ſhall read in them every thing contrary to other Prophets Predictions.</p>
                  <p>NOW to ſay any otherwiſe, than that both ſpeak true, is the ſame as denying the Canon of the Bible, and to own both, ſeems too groſs a folly for any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Perſon? What muſt we then do? Deny all we dare
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002324_0057_0FDB242A16065DE0"/>not: Own all we cannot: What then? We muſt have a recourſe, as I ſaid before, to other places in the Bible, where we ſhall find Light enough to enlighten us to underſtand ſuch Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>THE Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpeaking upon the ſame Subject in another place, foretells the Salvation of his People, with the Addition of a Shepherd, even <hi>David his Servant,</hi> which God will ſet up to ſeed and rule over them as a Prince, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>THE Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> treating upon this very ſame point in the 3d Chap. ver. 5th. ſays theſe notable words, <hi>Afterwards ſhall the children of Iſrael re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King, and ſhall fear the Lord and his Goodneſs in the latter days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is more wonderful in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the condition of the ſaid deliverance, Chap. 3d. 8, 9. which runs thus, <hi>For it ſhall come to paſs in that day ſays the Lord of Hoſts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they ſhall ſerve (or worſhip) the Lord their God, and David their King, whom I will raiſe up unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE in theſe places we find a full anſwer, and an intire reconciliation to the aforeſaid places. i. e. their return doth depend upon this <hi>Condition,</hi> that they ſhall ſeek the Lord their God, and <hi>David their King,</hi> as in <hi>Hoſea;</hi> and that they ſhall ſerve (or worſhip) the Lord their God, and <hi>David their King,</hi> as in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah;</hi> and to prevent any miſ-interpretation of the words, <hi>David their King,</hi> for <hi>King David,</hi> (as the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> do,) the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> uſes the word <hi>AUKIM, I will raiſe</hi> in the future Tenſe, to ſignify the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to riſe from the Dead, and this <hi>King David</hi> indeed was to be their King, and him they muſt ſeek and ſerve in the ſame way and manner as they ſeek and ſerve their God, even the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> mentioned together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both are of one ſelf ſame Subſtance, equal in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002324_0058_0FDB242E2BB2EB90"/>Power and Glory from all Eternity. And no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> leaſt they ſhould think this way of Paraphraſing the words, <hi>David their King</hi> as I do, to be ſomewhat out of the true way, I will quote one ſingle Authority (of a great many that are to be found among their <hi>Rabblns</hi>) which ſays the ſame as we do word for word, and then conclude this Argument.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Targum,</hi> upon the 5th. verſe of the 3d. Chap. of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> paraphraſing the words, and <hi>they ſhall ſeek the Lord their God &amp; David their King,</hi> ſays the following words, <q>
                        <hi>After this the children of Iſrael ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in Contrition, and they ſhall ſeek the Service of the Lord their God, and they the Meſſiah the Son of David their King.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW I hope they will be convinced, that their return and being gathered as they were before, depends altogether upon ſeeking and obeying the Lord their God, and the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who is already come, and who is their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> elſe in vain do they expect to be delivered, ſaved, and brought over again to the former Glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, THE Third Argument they bring to prove the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is yet to come, is becauſe (they ſay) <hi>a Third Temple is to be built at His Coming;</hi> and this they prove out of what is written in the laſt Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and more particularly of the 12th, and 13th. Verſes of the 6th. Chap. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>And ſpeak unto them ſaying, thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying, Behold the Man whoſe Name is the Brench and be ſhall grew up out of his place, and he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, even he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and he ſhall bear the Glory, and ſhall ſet and rule upon his Throne, and the Counſel of Peace ſhall be between them both.</hi> And now they argue thus, Since a Third Temple is not built, which is the true mark, and inſallible Sign, <hi>ergo,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is yet to come.</p>

As ſoon as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> underſtood that this lying Doctrine had made ſuch an impreſſion in the Ears and Hearts of the People, ſo that they would not leave off going aftray, and return to God with a ſincere Repentance, and a true Obedience, as he in God's Name, ſeveral times had admoniſhed them; The word of the Lord came to him and bid him go and ſtand in the gates of the Lord's houſe, and proclaim the following Edict, not to a ſingle Perſon or Company, but in the preſence of

Truſt ye not in lying words, ſaying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> i. e.

The Words, <hi>This is none other but the houſe of God,</hi> imply, that he ſaw it Ruined, and the words, <hi>and this is the gate of heaven,</hi> imply, that he ſaw it Rebuilt and Compleated for the future.</q> [Which Interpretation of that Text, I would not be thought any otherwiſe to improve than as it ſhows us that the Ancient <hi>Rabbins</hi> knew nothing of a third Temple.] And in a more Ancient Author than this, we read (in the Book called <hi>Bereſhith Rabbau</hi> upon the firſt verſe of <hi>Geneſis</hi>) the following words, <q>
                        <hi>Rabby Hijau, ſaid in the beginning at the Creation of the World the Holy and Bleſſed One,</hi> (i. e. God) <hi>ſaw the Temple Built, Ruined, and Rebuilt, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>BUT that they may be fully ſatisfy'd in this point, ſo as not to live with ſuch falſe hopes, I will quote one paſſage more of one of their biggeſt Expoſitors, whom they call for his great underſtanding the true meaning of the Scriptures <hi>Dzna Hautoran, the Ears of the Law,</hi> (becauſe as they ſay, by his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </gap>. 6.12, 13. <hi>And ſpeak unto him, ſaying, Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of bosts, ſaying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the man whoſe name is the BRANCH, and he ſhall grow up out of his place, and be ſhall build the temple of the Lord: Even he ſhall build the temple of the Lord, &amp; he ſhall bear the glory, &amp; ſhall ſit and rule upon his throne, and he ſhall be a prieſt upon his throne, &amp; the counſel of peace ſhall be between them both.</hi> Which they alledge to diſprove the veracity of Chriſt's coming; and then conclude this Argument. His words are as following, <q>
                        <hi>Whoſe name is the Branch,</hi> this is <hi>Zerubabel</hi> aforeſaid, and ſome lay this ſignifieth <hi>the king Meſſiah; and this fabrick is to be underſtood of the Second Temple.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW ſince they have ſo great Veneration for this <hi>Rabby,</hi> and he ſays that this Building is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Second Temple, let them be ſilent, and be convinced, I beſeech them, that the Third Temple is never to be Built, (whatever their new up-ſtart <hi>Rabbins</hi> do teach, feeing it is proved with as many Authorities as any Judicious Perſon can deſire to have for the Satisfaction of any doubt whatſoever,) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is already come; and with this belief, and obeying what He hath commanded, I hope they will be gathered from all parts where-ever they are, even ſince the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, into their Country, in a National Body as they were in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, and be Settled, and Build Churches, as many and as pompous, as their hearts ſhall wiſh; and ſerve and worſhip the True and the Living God through Chriſt; and be eſtabliſhed for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, THE Fourth Argument which they bring to prove their Opinion, is, <hi>That every thing,</hi> i. e. <hi>every Creature ſhall be as it was before Adam's fall, without being hurtful, but innocent, and live in peace
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002324_0063_0FDB24391DB506B8"/>one with another.</hi> — This they prove with what Iſai. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. ſays, which runs thus. <hi>The wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them: And the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie together, and the Lyon ſhall eat straw like the Ox: and the ſucking Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Child ſhall put his band on the Adders Den: they ſhall not burt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain,</hi> &amp;c. And they argue thus, Since theſe things ſhould come to paſs, at the time of Chriſt's coming, and we never ſaw nor heard, that ever the Creatures act ſo, but they are as fierce as ever they were; <hi>ergo,</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is not come.</p>
                  <p>TO this I anſwer, that altho' ſome of their new upſtart <hi>Rabbins</hi> for to uphold their Opinion or Belief, do maintain that this Prophecy is to be underſtood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, I beg of them not to be ſo eaſily drawn aſide from the Opinion of their Old Teachers, and then I am fully ſatisfy'd they will quickly embrace the true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>

But the Prophecy is to be underſtood in an Allegorial ſenſe, and the beſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory that can be found, Conformable to the Orthodox opinion, is, That thoſe Men and Nations which before the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were proud and fierce as Lyons and Wolves, and the reſt of the Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Creatures mentioned in the Text, at <hi>his</hi> coming ſhall all grow as meek and pliable as <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>Kids</hi> are, by ſubduing their Wills to the Obedience of Chriſt's Laws, and they ſhall feed together, i. e. of the Word and Sacraments, all alike without any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, even from the King to the Peaſant, they ſhall all be ruled, by the ſame Laws and Directions that Chriſt ſhall preſcribe, and they ſhall Live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet one with another, not hurting one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, either in Eſtate or Name. This has been punctually fulfilled at Chriſt's coming (and ever ſince by all the True and Sincere Chriſtians) in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſo many cruel and ſavage fort of Men, they rendring Obedience to Chriſt's Laws, became as tame and tractable as any whatſoever, becauſe the Laws of Chriſt teach nothing but Humility, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt Pride and Arrogancy, as is well known to all his followers. And</p>
                  <p>NOW ſo long as they can't prove that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and others of this nature are to be underſtood F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5thly, THE fifth Argument they alledge to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Opinion is, <hi>that when the Meſſiah ſhall come and for ever more after his coming till the Worlds end, there ſhall be a general and univerſal Peace all over the World.</hi> This they prove out of Iſai. 2.4. which runs thus, <hi>And they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their ſpears into pruning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books; Nation ſhall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> And they argue thus, Since a General and Everlaſting Peace is promiſed by the Prophet in this Place, to be in the Time of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the contrary of which we daily ſee, (that not only the Wars are not ceaſed ſince Chriſt's Coming, but on the contrary, they have increaſed daily, not only with the ordinary way of fighting, that was in uſe in thoſe days; but even with a new Invention of Fire Arms, never heard before a few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ago,) therefore (they ſay) if all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could be anſwered, this is unanſwerable, becauſe the words are plain, i. e. <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more. Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is not come at yet.</p>
                  <p>TO this I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>I know ſome to avoid this Argument, would have the Prophet ſpeak here, of that inward Peace of Conſcience, that every Good Chriſtian enjoys that follows the Laws of Chriſt; which Peace is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Peace. Some underſtand this place for that Eternal Peace, that ſhall be in the Church after the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be brought together, under
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002324_0066_0FDB243FD5DF0790"/>one Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls; and that then (and not before) this Prophecy ſhall be fulfill'd. Some would have this Prophecy to be already fulfill'd in that General and Univerſal Peace that was thro' the whole World in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Time, as we read in Luk. 2.1. <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe days, that there went out a decree from Ceſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed.</hi> This laſt Opinion I am apt to think is what the Prophet meant in this place. But the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> are very ſtiff in denying of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the words, <hi>Neither ſhall they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> War any more.</hi> And tho' this ſeems the ſtrongeſt Argument they have againſt Chriſt's Coming, and ſeems to have the beſt face and colour to uphold their Opinion, I deſign in a few Minutes time to ſhow the Rottenneſs of it, hoping if they will ſeriouſly conſider it, they will all come and look on Him, whom (with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jarrs and Contentions) they have pierced.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, That God by His Prophet, never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that after the coming of Chriſt, a perpetual Peace ſhall be in the World, becauſe if he had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, we ſhould all live in Peace and Tranquility, ſince <hi>He</hi> is come, and being the contrary we daily ſee and feel, <hi>ergo,</hi> we may certainly conclude, that he never meant ſo.</p>
                  <p>BUT the true and genuine meaning of this Prophecy is, God declares that at Chriſt's coming ſo long as He was upon Earth bodily, and no longer, the World ſhould enjoy Peace. And this for Two Reaſons, Firſt, To ſhow that He was the King of Kings, and therefore ſo long as he was upon Earth, none ſhould be ſo daring, as to take up Arms one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing their Lord and King was upon Earth. And Secondly, Becauſe after his Death, not only his Enemies, but even thoſe that are true-hearted Chriſtians ſo long as they are in this World, are liable to fall under a great many Temptations, and be left of God for a while, (for Reaſons to Him only
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002324_0067_0FDB244159739448"/>reſerved) and ſo ſwerve from that temper and way of Peace that Chriſt their Lord and Maſter had dictated to them.</p>
                  <p>NOW according to this Prophetical Prediction, the Thing came to paſs juſt exactly as he foretold it, becauſe ſo long as Chriſt, was upon Earth perſonally, we read of a General and Univerſal Peace that was thro' the World in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Reign, and after his Death the Wars begun to break out again as it was formerly, not only between one Nation and another, but even among Chriſtians themſelves.</p>
                  <p>IT is not worth their while to argue from the Words. <hi>Neither ſhall they learn War any more,</hi> any thing to diſprove the veracity of this Interpretation, becauſe that Word which they and other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Tranſlated <hi>More,</hi> in the Original is, <hi>Gnod,</hi> which Word, although ſometimes tis underſtood <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>for ever,</hi> this is very ſeldom, and for the moſt part, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And in caſe this proof will not ſatisfy them they may go and read what that Famous <hi>Rabby, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

AND now ſince Chriſt is already come, and none but <hi>Fools, Reprebates,</hi> or <hi>Obſtinates</hi> do deny it, and yet the War is not ceaſed from the Chriſtian World (at leaſt) we may certainly conclude, that this Word <hi>More</hi> in this Place, is to be underſtood <hi>for a little while,</hi> as it came to paſs, i. e. in that only while that Chriſt was upon Earth.

                  </p>
                  <p>SEEING they are all grounded upon the 2d verſe, of the 2d Chap of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I ſhall handle them together.</p>
                  <p>THE Verſe runs thus, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, that the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the bills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW they argue thus, Since we ſee that your Chriſt is come above 1700 Years ago, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord's Houſe, never grew ſo as to be higher than it was before is coming; Neither do all the Nations in General without exception, acknowledge him to be the <hi>true Meſſiah.

That altho' ſaid expreſſion ſometimes ſignifieth as I ſaid, yet in this place 'tis to be underſtood as they ſay, even that <hi>he</hi> is to come at the End of the World, becauſe it may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at any time, and place, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was not to come at the end of the World, as they ſay, either by the Scriptures, or by their own Authors.</p>
                  <p>BY the Scriptures, in the fulfillment of the Time that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> preſcribed; viz. the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come, at the time that the Seventy Prophetical Weeks was ended. And if we could be certain when theſe Seventy Weeks begun, it could be demonſtrated and plainly made to appear, that Chriſt came juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at the time appointed.</p>
                  <p>BY their own Authors I find in the <hi>Talmud Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth Sanedrin, Chap. Heleck,</hi> a famous Deſcription when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come, which deſerves to be ingraven and kept for a Monument to all Ages. The words are as following, <q>

                  <p>UPON this laſt quotation the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins,</hi> argue thus, Altho' ſaid Sentence is ſo as I ſay, yet there are theſe words at the end of it, <q>

                  <p>NOW to avoid ſuch cenſures and reflections as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are made by Perſons upon thoſe that diſſent from them, I will quote one Paſſage more very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, wherein any body may plainly diſcover, that according to the Traditions receaved among the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> a great many Hundred Years before Chriſt's coming, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come at the time He did, and not before or after. And I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely deſign not to criticiſe upon ſaid Tradition, but only repeat it, and calculate the time.</p>

                  <p>A Great many more inſtances I might bring, to prove my aſſertion, but becauſe I know the wiſe Men among
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002324_0075_0FDB2451D510E608"/>them do own it, I ſhall wave it, concluding, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this Place the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays, that <hi>All the nations ſhall flow into it;</hi> he means not <hi>All</hi> without Exception, as the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> do ſuppoſe, but ſome only. And it is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>and ſome of the Nations ſhall flow into it.</hi> But as to this Expoſition I expect they will argue thus.</p>
                  <p>Namely,</p>
                  <p>IT is true that the Word <hi>Roll</hi> ſometimes ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>a part of the whole</hi> as I ſaid, but ſince the ſame Word, ſometimes ſignifieth <hi>All,</hi> the meaning o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this Place is not to be underſtood as I ſaid, but as they ſay. And therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>THAT this Particle <hi>Roll</hi> in this Place, preciſely muſt be underſtood as I ſaid, and not as they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the <hi>Prophet Micah</hi> 4.1. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth this very ſame thing, <hi>He</hi> ſays the ſame that the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah</hi> does, except the Word <hi>Roll, all</hi> viz. <hi>And People ſhall flow into it;</hi> and not <hi>all the People</hi> to teach us, that not all the World ſhall ever come to the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but ſome of each Nation only. This we ſee daily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                  <p>FOR altho' the Church hath increaſed into a great Multitude, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt has been carry'd thro' the whole World, and a great many Nations are Converted from Paganiſm, and have bowed their knees to the Lord of Glory, i. e. ſubmitting their Obedience to His moſt holy Will and Pleaſure, yet according to Mr. <hi>Tavernier's</hi> Computation, L. 2. C. 8. p. 90. If we ſhould divide the People of the World into 30 Parts, we ſhould find that Chriſtians, (not Proteſtants only, but even of all ſorts of Sects and Perſwaſions) do make 5 Parts only, the <hi>Mahomitans</hi> 6, and the <hi>Heathens Idolaters</hi> 19. Which plainly ſhows, <hi>that although many be called few are choſen, becauſe ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002324_0076_0FDB24559C3F1058"/>which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Let us then conclude theſe three Points with a Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of the True and Orthodox meaning of this Prophecy which is as follow,</p>
                  <p>AND it ſhall come to paſs in the Laſt days, i. e. <hi>in the days of the Meſſiah,</hi> that the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe, i. e. <hi>the Church of the Lord which is founded and establiſhed upon a Stone or a Rock, that was Cut out without hands and became a great mountain.</hi> Shall be eſtabliſhed in the Top of the Mountains and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, i. e. <hi>Flouriſh and increaſe, overcoming all oppoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her.</hi> And all Nations ſhall flow unto it, i. e. <hi>Some Nations, or ſome of each Nation, a Remnant of each ſhall come and ſubmit themſelves to the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt their Redeemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE 9th, and Laſt Argument they bring to prove the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is yet to come, is, <hi>That Chriſt at his coming ſhall not abrogate any thing of the Law of Moſes, but the ſaid Law (not only the Moral, but even the Ceremonial) ſhall be kept to the World's end. And ſince we ſee that by the coming of your Chriſt not only all the Ceremonial part is aboliſhed, but even ſome of the Moral alſo (as the keeping of the Sabbath) ergo</hi> He <hi>is not the true Meſſiah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Prophets.</hi> This fond opinion they ground upon the 20th, 21ſt Verſes of the 59th Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in Jacob ſays the Lord. As for me this is my Covenant with them ſays the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, not out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor cut of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſays the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, IF we underſtand this Prophecy Literally, it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002324_0077_0FDB24571EDE8EB0"/>ſpeaks nothing concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but only of the Redeemer that was to deliver them from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus King of Perſia,</hi> is queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, the Redeemer here intended, as we read, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p>BUT 2dly, If we underſtand this Place Typically, I am prompt to think it makes more for our ſide than for theirs: and the Covenant here mentioned, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame that the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 21.31, 32, 33.) ſpeaks of. And this new Covenant that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to eſtabliſh at his coming, is that which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays in this Place, ſhall not depart from the Church, which is that very ſeed ſpoken of, in Chap. 53.10. <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall proloug his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> And ſince this was to be a <hi>Law,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> (which Words are in the Old Teſtament Synonymous Terms, as we Read, that the very Decalogue which is called a Law, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.44. is called a Covenant in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28.) made with Chriſt's People according to his Holy Will and Pleaſure, the expreſſions are with the Affixy of the 2 P. M. S. i. e. <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee,</hi> that is upon Chriſt, and it is as much as if it had been plainly ſaid, that the Word and Spirit ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from him, nor from his holy Seed after Him, but ſhould continue for ever till the end of the World, and that the Old Covenant made with them in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time ſhould be aboliſhed, as the Apoſtle to the Heb. 8.13. obſerves, when he ſays,—<hi>And in that he ſaith a New Covenant, be hath made the firſt old, now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> This is the True and Genuine meaning of theſe Propheſies, and not (as they falſly ſuppoſe) i. e. that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould not abrogate the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> This is not our opinion only, but even their own Authors and Expoſitors underſtood it ſo alſo. And becauſe I am not willing to be too Proli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, as I could it I had a mind to explain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. &amp; 49.9. and I know that a quotation of one of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> (to

                  <p>IN that Ancient and famous Book of theirs called <hi>

                     </hi> upon the laſt Word of the 11. Chap. of Eccl. are the following words, <q>
                        <hi>Vanity, the Law which a man learns in this World</hi> (i. e. before the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah) is vanity, in compariſon of the Meſſiah's Law.</hi>
                     </q> This ſentence plainly ſhows Two very remarkable things, 1ſt, That there ſhould be Two Laws, one before Chriſt's coming; and another after. And 2dly, That the Law before <hi>His</hi> coming is nothing but a meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>AS for the other part of the Argument, in which they ſuppoſe that ſince Chriſt's coming the 4th Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is aboliſhed, I ſhan't meddle with it at this time, becauſe (beſides that it has been anſwered by ſundry Learned Divines at large before now) it would take me a great deal of time, in handling of it, with all the Branches belonging thereunto.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some are apt to think the idolatrous Worſhip of the <hi>Romiſo</hi> Church is the Cauſe of it, becauſe (they ſay) ever ſince the Jewiſh Nation have paid ſmart enough for the Sin of Idolatry, which they were addicted to before the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt Temple, ſuffering ſo many Troubles, Afflictions and Calamities, as both ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Hiſtories have left us an Account of, they took ſuch an Averſion to ſaid Sin, and ſo abhorred thoſe that commit it, that nothing can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it: Aud therefore, when the Romiſh Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and ſundry other Sorts of Prieſts and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of the Romiſh Communion, do engage with any

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> SOME are of Opinion, the Reaſon of their being ſo long unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>verted, is to be attributed to the Lives and Convertation of ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, who live not according to the Rules of Morality; whence, without further Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the Jews conclude the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> SOME do think the Reaſon that hinders their Converſion, is their Stubborneſs and Stiffneck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, becauſe they are not willing to give Ear to what is recorded, minding nothing but their own Intereſt and Pleaſure, and therefore God (as it were) has left them, and they can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and they bring ſundry Examples out of the ſacred Oracles for to prove their Aſſertion.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002324_0083_0FDB2463576712D8"/>for to be eſtabliſhed and propagated; and ſo concluding, the Chriſtian Religion to be one of them, elſe the Chriſtians would not force <hi>them</hi> with ſuch ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly.</hi> SOME do imagine, the Differences that have been in the Proteſtant Church, have been the Cauſe of their remaining unconverted. Without further Examination, when they ſee ſo many Jarrs and Debates among them, every one upholding their own Opinion to be the beſt and the trueſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing the others: <hi>They ſay,</hi> Let them firſt agree among themſelves, and afterwards we will conſider what to do. [This I know to be true by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> SOME do ſay, the Reaſon of their not being converted, is to be attributed to the great Fondneſs they have to their <hi>Rabbies</hi> or Teachers, ſince they take it for granted <hi>they</hi> are infallible in their Doctrine: Whatever they teach in Publick or Private, by Preaching or by Conferring, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly conclude all they ſay to be true, under a Suppoſition, that they would not teach a thing which they really thought to be falſe, and cauſe by their Doctrine the Ruin of others: And ſo ſome charge the Want of their Converſion to their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers altogether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly.</hi> SOME ſay the Reaſon of their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted as yet, is, becauſe <hi>they</hi> curſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Children after them in the Time of Chriſt's Crucifixion, as it is recorded in Matt. 27.25. <hi>Then anſwered all the People, and ſaid, His blood be on us, and on our Children.</hi> And therefore, ſince they are under the Curſe, they are of Neceſſity ſo blind with a ſpiritual Blindneſs, that they can't ſee the Light of the everlaſting Goſpel, and have (as it were) before the Eyes of their Underſtanding, a Vail that hinders them from apprehending the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002324_0084_0FDB24649E1FC2F0"/>great and true Myſteries, preſcribed in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly and laſtly,</hi> SOME are apt to think, the Reaſon of their Unbelief does proceed from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Yoke of the Law, and ſo under a Curſe, as the Apoſtle ſays to the Galatians, 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Curſe; for it is written, curſed is every one that continueth not in</hi> all <hi>things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Therefore (they ſay) ſo long as they are under a Curſe for not being able to obey the whole Law, and won't come out of that Bondage, and embrace Chriſtianity, they are as (it were) left, and ſo they remain unconverted.</p>
                  <p>THESE are the Eight chief Reaſons (which I can remember) our Divines do give for their Unbelief: But with Submiſſion, I am prone to think, another may be given; for altho' thoſe aforeſaid ſeem to carry ſome Weight in them, yet if we examine each diſtinctly, we ſhall find ſuch Flaws in them, which will ſhow the Uncertainty of them. Namely,</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe that live among Proteſtants might be convinced of the reality of Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not worſhip Images, nor bow down to Stones and Stocks as the Papiſts do, but do preach againſt ſaid Manner of Worſhip, and teach that it is contrary to the Word of God, as may be plainly ſeen in all their Writings.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Second,</hi> If the Lives and Converſation of ſome few Perſons ſhouldly in the Way of their Converſion, the Lives and Converſation of a great many eminent and Orthodox Chriſtians of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church of ſundry Sorts and Ranks, who live up to their Profeſſion, ſo far as in them lies, and particularly among the Clergy, would take off the Force of their Objection.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Third,</hi> Thoſe who are not employ'd in worldly Buſineſs and Mammon, (as I know a great
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002324_0085_0FDB2467E5910120"/>many are) and who do live a contemplative and ſpeculative Life, ſhould not be hindred from being converted, ſince nothing ſtands in their Way to fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and harden their Hearts or to ſtop their Ears: And theſe we know are thoſe very ones which do uphold their Opinion with their vehement prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and teaching the common ſort of People, contrary to the Truth.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Fourth,</hi> Thoſe that live under the Protection of ſundry pious and religious Princes, ever ſince they can remember, protected by the Laws of the Country where they live, (as in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Dominions, and ſundry others,) ſhould be converted, and invite the reſt of their Brethren to come, live and do as they did, and be all in one Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> under one Protection, with Peace and Liberty of Body and Mind.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Fifth,</hi> Altho' the Proteſtants did and do differ among themſelves, and have had ſundry Jarrs and Animoſities concerning Religion, of which the learned World is ſenſible, nevertheleſs, they all agree in the main Point, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is already come for the Salvation of all thoſe Sinners that believe in him; and their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are nothing concerning any fundamental Point in reality, but indifferent ones.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Sixth,</hi> Altho' in general they are ſo fond of their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Kiddar</hi> ſuppoſeth, yet the learned among them do make a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe Doctrines which they take to be <hi>oral,</hi> recorded in the <hi>Talmud, Bedraſhim,</hi> &amp;c. and thoſe private Expoſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which a particular <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> puts forth; as it may be teſtify'd by thoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentlemen that are acquainted with their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Seventh,</hi> That Curſe they took upon themſelves and their Children after them, recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.25. in the Time of Chriſt's Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002324_0086_0FDB246914CC7298"/>may be anſwered with what is recorded in Luk. 23.34. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Eighth</hi> and laſt, It may be anſwered, the Word <hi>Koll</hi> that ſignifieth <hi>All,</hi> is not in the Original, as may be ſeen in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.26.</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE I ſay, ſince we ſee ſaid Reaſons may be anſwered, and <hi>they</hi> remain in their <hi>Judaiſ</hi>—, another may be offered, which I think is unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Namely,</p>
                  <p>I TAKE all the Reaſons already named, and a great many more that may be offered of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be nothing but the Effects of that principal Reaſon that is the Cauſe of it; which is (ſo far as I am able to ſearch) that which is recorded in the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans, 11.25. <hi>Blindneſs in Part is happened to Iſrael, until the Fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> The Jewiſh Blindneſs, which is the Cauſe of their not being converted, the Apoſtle calls a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and conſidered as ſuch, we muſt not be very forward to gueſs at it, more than it has been revealed. The Apoſtle tells us, this will laſt <hi>till the Fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in. Then</hi> it ſeems to intimate, <hi>they</hi> ſhall come in as a Nation together with the Gentiles, under one Shepherd, and not before, as the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> 10.16. doth ſay, <hi>And other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold; them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice; and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd;</hi> meaning the Jewiſh Nation. And,</p>
                  <p>THESE Words <hi>In Part</hi> of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> make me think, it intimates the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſome Part of the Nation have, <hi>i. e.</hi> their <hi>Rabbies</hi> or Teachers, which do keep to reſt of the Common People in the ſame Way with them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> not able to ſee that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is already come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002324_0087_0FDB246E1A992888"/>
NOW, ſince I have ſhewn (ſo far as I can ſee) which is the true Reaſon of their being unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let us inquire, which are the chief Points theſe two Churches, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> do differ in.</p>
                  <p>IF we examine the Creed of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, we ſhall find the <hi>true Christians</hi> do agree with them in all Points of it, except one; Namely, We Chriſtians believe Chriſt is already come, and they (the Jews) that he is to come: And this is the chief and principal Point theſe two Churches do differ in; and it is as the Hinge whereon the whole Controverſy between them doth hang.</p>
                  <p>THAT <hi>they</hi> are to believe, according to their Principles, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is to come, is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, ſeeing it is the Twelfth Article of their <hi>Creed,</hi> according to <hi>Maimonides</hi> upon the <hi>Miſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Sanedrin Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THAT <hi>we</hi> believe that <hi>He</hi> is already come, is queſtionleſs, becauſe whoſoever among us ſhould deny it, is no more a Chriſtian, as whoſoever believes among the Jews that he is already come, is no more a Jew.</p>

                        </gap>
                     </hi> was called the Son of the Living God in the New-Teſtament, none but thoſe that never read it, nor have heard of him, are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002324_0091_0FDB247699867450"/>But that he is ſo call'd in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the beſt Jewiſh Authors or <hi>Rabbies</hi> of old, is my preſent Buſineſs to prove, <hi>i. e.</hi> before they had took ſuch an Antipathy againſt all Sorts of Religion but their own.</p>
                  <p>PLAIN Text is that which is recorded in the ſecond Pſalm and laſt Verſe, which ſays, <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> i. e. <hi>adore,</hi> or <hi>embrace the Son,</hi> becauſe he is not only a Man, but God alſo.</p>
                  <p>THAT this Verſe ſpeaks concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is clear &amp; manifeſt by the Context: In the ſecond Verſe of ſaid Pſalm it is plainly expreſſed, <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſit themſelves, and the Rulers take Counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE plain Teſtimony of their Authors is to be found recorded in that famous and renowned Expoſitor among them, <hi>Then Ezra,</hi> who ſays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſaid Verſe as follows, <q>
                        <hi>Kiſs the Son, Behold, ſerve the Lord (with Fear) is referrring to the Lord Jehovah; and kiſs the Son, refers to his Chriſt; and the Word Bar is to be underſtood as in</hi> Prov. 31.2. <hi>What my Son, and what the Son of my Womb; and ſo is written in the the 7th</hi> Verſe, <hi>Thou art my Son.</hi>
                     </q> It is not <hi>He</hi> only that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it ſo, but before him, thoſe that are in more Authority among them underſtood it ſo alſo, as may be ſeen in that famous Book call'd, <hi>Medraſh Tehelim,</hi> upon ſaid Pſalm, which I omit for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake.</p>
                  <p>THE biggeſt Difficulty the modern Jews do oppoſe againſt ſaid Expoſition, is this, They ſay, (when they talk with thoſe who underſtand lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing of the Hebrew Tongue) the Word that is tranſlated in our Engliſh Bibles <hi>Son,</hi> in the Original is not <hi>Ben</hi> but <hi>Bar,</hi> which Word ſignifieth not a <hi>Son,</hi> but ſomething elſe; and they bring plain Examples for it, by which they do ſilence thoſe that know no better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002324_0092_0FDB2479F474D540"/>
BUT ſuch Shifts to oppoſe the Truth will not always do. To anſwer ſaid Objection, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite only to ſend them to that famous Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the Hebrew Tongue, compos'd by that learned and famous Author <hi>Rabbi David Kinchi,</hi> (whom they all acknowledge to be a <hi>None-ſuch,</hi>) call'd <hi>Sheraſhim,</hi> and there they will find this Word <hi>Bar</hi> ſignifieth the ſame with <hi>Ben, a Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT ſince I am upon this Word <hi>Bar,</hi> I think it is proper to give my Thoughts upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the true Intelligence of it, we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome great Myſteries of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, comprehended in this ſingle Monoſyllable, <hi>Bar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Word <hi>Bar,</hi> ſo far as I can learn, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Three Things: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. A Son.</item>
                        <item>2. Pure, or clean: And,</item>
                        <item>3. Corn, or Food.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Firſt,</hi> As in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.2. What my <hi>Son,</hi> and what the <hi>Son</hi> of my Womb.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Second,</hi> As in <hi>Job.</hi> 11.4. For thou haſt ſaid my Doctrine is <hi>pure,</hi> and I am <hi>clean</hi> in thine Eyes.</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Third,</hi> As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.25. Then <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> commanded to fill their Sacks with <hi>Corn,</hi> or <hi>Food.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN all theſe Places, the Original is expreſſed with one Word, namely, <hi>Bar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW ſince we have diſcovered and found out the true Meaning of this Word <hi>Bar,</hi> I am apt to think, the Author of the <hi>Second Pſalm,</hi> who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpoke by Divine Inſpiration, ſat down the Word <hi>Bar</hi> and not the Word <hi>Ben,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Son,</hi> more immediately, not by Chance or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, as ſome prophane Writers do, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially, to ſhow and teach that Chriſt that was to come in the Fulneſs of Time, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002324_0093_0FDB247B1550B5F8"/>to be a <hi>Son</hi> of the Moſt High, as the Word <hi>Ben</hi> would ſignify, but that <hi>He</hi> was to be a <hi>pure and clean Son,</hi> indeed, without Spot or Blemiſh; and not only ſo, but that he ſhould be the true <hi>Corn and Food</hi> indeed to all thoſe that believe in him.</p>
                  <p>THAT he was the Son of the Living God, is evident in this Pſalm 2.7. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son;</hi> and in Mat. 3 17. <hi>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT he was <hi>pure and clean</hi> is plain in Iſai. 53.9. <hi>He had done no Violence, neither was any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in his Mouth;</hi> and in Heb. 4.15. <hi>Yet without Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT he was the true <hi>Corn or Meat</hi> indeed, is manifeſt in Pſal. 72.16. <hi>There ſhall be a handful of Corn upon the Top of the Mountains;</hi> and in Joh. 6.55. <hi>For my Fleſh is Meat indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO demonſtrate plainly that this Pſalm ſpeaks concerning the Meſſian, by their own Authors, the Book called <hi>Medraſh Tehelim,</hi> upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Plalm, <hi>v,</hi> 8. has this Sentence, <q>
                        <hi>R.

                  <p>A GREAT many more Inſtances I might bring to prove my Aſſertion, as what <hi>Rabbi Selomon Iarchi</hi> ſays upon ſaid Pſalm; but thoſe that are alledged will be ſufficient, till I find any Body whatſoever ſhall oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>OF this great <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of the Living God, the Prophet ſays, <hi>The Government ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002324_0094_0FDB247CEFC06938"/>his Shoulder.</hi> Theſe Words may be underſtood in two Ways, either in a metaphorical or in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Senſe. If we take them in a metaphorical Senſe, they may allude to the Way and Manner of his Government all over the Univerſe in General, as a Viceroy under his Father, or to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all over his Church, ſeeking her Welfare, to her utmoſt Advantage in a peculiar Manner, as we read in Mat. 11.27. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father;</hi> and in John 13.3. <hi>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his Hands.</hi> But if we underſtand it literally, it may have a Reference to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Croſs,</hi> which he bore upon his Shoulder, as in John 19.17. <hi>And he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Croſs, went forth,</hi> &amp;c. by which Action He overcame all his Enemies, and cauſed the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>NOW after the Prophet hath told us the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> of Chriſt, in the aforeſaid Expreſſions, in the next Place he declares unto us his <hi>Godhead:</hi> And therefore,</p>
                  <p>THIS great Point of Divinity, ſo myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo profound, and ſo fathomleſs, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it was revealed, it would never be believed, the Prophet opens unto us, in ſaying, that his Name ſhall be called, <hi>Wonderful, Counſellor, a mighty God, and Everlaſting Father,</hi> (as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal carries it.)</p>
                  <p>FOUR particular Names the Prophet does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the Jewiſh Church in particular, and to the whole World in general, that the true Meſſiah (who was to come ſix hundred Years after) was to have, as particular Marks to diſtinguiſh him from the falſe ones: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Wonderful.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Counſellor.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>A Mighty God.</hi>
                        </item>

AND ſince all the Four Titles aforeſaid belong to God and no one elſe, if we find them attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> we may certainly conclude <hi>He</hi> is the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and not a <hi>Man</hi> only, but <hi>God</hi> alſo. Therefore let us examine each one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular without Partiality, and we ſhall find the Truth thereof clearly appear to our Sight.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>WONDERFUL.</hi> This Title may have Reference to one of three Things, or to all three together: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. TO <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miraculous Works.</item>
                        <item>2. TO his wonderful and ſupernatural Way of Conception. And,</item>
                        <item>3. TO the aſtoniſhing Work of Man's Re demp tion. And,</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> TO his <hi>miraculous Works.</hi> If we could examine all <hi>Christ's</hi> Works, we ſhould find he did more miraculous and wonderful Works in his Life-time, than all the Prophets together, even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>THAT the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to come, was to perform great and wonderful Works, ſuch as none but God is able to act or perform, (to ſhow that he was to be the true God himſelf,) is clear and manifeſt, by what the ſame Prophet ſays in the 35th Chapter of his Prophecies: Therein I find four certain Marks, wherewith we ſhould know the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> from any falſe one, at the Time of his coming, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> we underſtand ſaid Prophecy as ſome do, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is the moſt genuine way of any that I know.)</p>
                  <p>THE Words of the Prophet are as follow: <hi>Say to them that are of fearful Heart, Be ſtrong, fear not; Behold, your God will come and ſave you.</hi> And then follow the Marks of ſaid Saviour, in the 5th and 6th Verſes: Namely, <hi>Then the Eyes of the Blind ſhall be opened, the Ears of the Deaf ſhall be unſtopped: Then the lame Man ſhall leap as all Hart, and the Tongue of the Dumb ſhall ſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002324_0096_0FDB25015ABE7F20"/>
ALL theſe four Marks, and a great many more, we find recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.30. agreeing to our Chriſt as the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: <hi>And great Multitudes came unto him, having with them thoſe that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and caſt them down at Jeſus Feet, and he healed them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BY the Tokens of his wonderful Works he anſwered to <hi>John the Baptist</hi>'s Diſciples, when he ſent to him, to know whether he was the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was to come, or was not; as we read in Mat. 11.4. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Go and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee; the Blind receive their Sight, the Lame do walk, the Lepers are cleanſed, and the Deaf hear; the Dead are raiſed up, and the Poor have the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached to them:</hi> Which Anſwer plainly ſhows the Veracity of his Miſſion, and the Certainty of his being the <hi>Christ</hi> promiſed to the World a great many Ages before him: For, Who ever was? Who is? Or, Who ever ſhall be able to perform ſuch wonderful and miraculous Works? Certainly none but <hi>He,</hi> who is the very <hi>Wonderful indeed</hi> in all his Actions. None but one that is God as well as Man, could act as he did. Let all the Powers above or beneath, or both together, convene and join For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and try whether they can do the ſame. If they cannot, as certainly they can't, then let us be aſſured whoever did thus is the true <hi>Meſſiah, God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT may have Reference to Chriſt's <hi>wonderful and ſupernatural Way of Conception,</hi> namely, of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> overſhadowed by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without any carnal Copulation.</p>
                  <p>WHAT greater Wonder than this can there be? This ſupernatural and wonderful Way of Chriſt's Corception is recorded, firſt in the old Teſtament,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002324_0097_0FDB11DDA55914B8"/>as it ſhould be; and ſecondly, confirmed in the New, as it was.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IN the Old Teſtament, <hi>as it ſhould be,</hi> we and it in Iſai. 7.14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and bear a Son;</hi> (this is the very ſame <hi>Son</hi> that we are diſcourſing upon,) and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. when he ſays, <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a Woman ſhall compaſs a Man:</hi> Which Words, with Submiſſion, I verily think are to be underſtood of Chriſt's wonderful Conception, becauſe it was a new Thing indeed, and a thing never heard before, <hi>i. e.</hi> that a <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould conceive and incompaſs a Man; elſe, if it was by the ordinary Courſe of Nature, what new Thing would that be? And if it was by the Knowledge of a Man, then ſhe was no more a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: And the Prophet calls her a Virgin when ſhe ſhould conceive; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was done by none, or without Man's Knowledge, (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the ordinary Courſe of Nature,) but in a ſupernatural Way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. CONFIRMED in the New Teſtament, <hi>as it came to paſs.</hi> We find it recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.18. giving an Account how the Birth of Chriſt was, he ſays the following Words, <hi>The Birth of Chriſt was on this wiſe, when as his Mother Mary was eſpouſed to Joſeph, before they came together, ſhe was found with Child of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, ſince the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, was to be conceived in a different Way from others, namely, in a ſupernatural Way without the Knowledge of any Man; and ſince <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ſo conceived as the Evangeliſt plainly doth relate and affirm, let us be entirely ſatisfied that <hi>He</hi> is the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was promiſed of old; and ſo to his Conception the Word <hi>Wonderful</hi> may have a Reference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THIS Word <hi>Wonderful</hi> may have ſome Reference to the <hi>astoniſhing Work of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002324_0098_0FDB248120FC80F8"/>This Thing, take it as it is, is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and ſo aſtoniſhing, that the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did greatly admire, and deſire to look into it, as it is recorded in the 1 Pet. 1.12. <hi>Which Things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THEREFORE, Let us conclude this Point, that this Word <hi>Wonderful</hi> doth refer to his <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works,</hi> or to his <hi>ſupernatural Way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> or to his <hi>aſtoniſhing Work of Redemption</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> or to all of them in <hi>general:</hi> And let all thoſe that can't ſhow any other Perſon to whom theſe Things belong, ſtop their defiled Mouths and Railings, and cry with us, in Admiration, the Words of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 104.24. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works, in Wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE ſecond Title the Prophet gives to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to come, is, <hi>Counſeller.</hi> This Title may be applyed to Chriſt in two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Namely, with reſpect,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. TO the good Counſels <hi>He</hi> gave to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Hearers, when he was upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. TO the Publication of the New Teſtamant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> WITH reſpect to the <hi>good Counſels he gave to his Diſciples and Hearers, when he was upon Earth.</hi> This is ſo infallibly true, that I do not remember any Body, directly or indirectly, did ever accuſe him of ſtirring up the People of any Rank or Quality, againſt any of their Superiours; but the contrary we may ſee in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſecond Chapter throughout.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT refers to the <hi>Publication of the New Testament.</hi> This was prophecied above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before his coming, by the Prophet Jer. 21.31, 32. <hi>Behold, the Days come faith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael, and with the Houſe of Judah: not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the Day
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002324_0099_0FDB248298205888"/>that I took them by the Hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANY Body may plainly ſee, that the Prophet in this Place doth prophecy now God would make a <hi>new Covenant,</hi> and give a <hi>new Law</hi> to his Church at the Fulneſs of Time, at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> quite different from that Law he gave them at the Time of their coming out of Egypt; a Law which we ſhould be guided by, becauſe on the fulfilling what is therein contained, doth depend the Salvation of our immortal Souls.</p>
                  <p>THE Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> of late, when they are preſſed with this Prophecy, anſwer, That it is not to be underſtood as we ſay, (namely, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is to give a new Law for us to be guided by,) becauſe the Word <hi>Law</hi> is not expreſſed in the Verſe, but a <hi>Covenant,</hi> which doth imply a new Reformation of the old Covenant, or elſe a new Confirmation of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, that in this Place the Word is <hi>Berith,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Covenant;</hi> but I find the Law which God gave in Mount <hi>Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> to the Jewiſh Nation in particular, is called <hi>Berith</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as in Exod. 34.28. <hi>And he wrote upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Words <hi>Nauberith</hi> of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments.</hi> In both Places the Expreſſion is alike, <hi>i. e. Berith;</hi> and if the Law was called <hi>Berith,</hi> and the New Teſtament is called <hi>Berith</hi> alſo, I do not ſee what Difference they can ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> between the two <hi>Berithiyoth <hi>Covenants.</hi>
                     </hi> Neither do I ſee but that the <hi>ſame Words</hi> being uſed thus, may be very well brought to prove the Publiſhment of the New-Teſtament, as a new Law after Chriſt's coming.</p>
                  <p>BUT they ſay again, that this Anſwer is not ſufficient, becauſe the Word <hi>Torau</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a <hi>Law</hi> more immediately, is not expreſſed in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002324_0100_0FDB2486B0A61230"/>the Text; and in Caſe the Prophet had meant, that a new Law ſhould be given at Chriſt's coming, he would ſay <hi>Torau,</hi> and not <hi>Berith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO anſwer this Objection, I think 'tis requiſite only to perſwade them to read with Attention the following Verſe, and there they will find how the ſame Prophet calls this very <hi>Covenant</hi> which he calls before <hi>Berith,</hi> by the Name <hi>Torau.</hi> The 33d Verſe runs thus, <hi>But this ſhall be <hi>Nauberith the</hi>
                     </hi> Covenant <hi>that I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe Days, faith the Lord, I will put <hi>Torauthee,</hi>
                     </hi> my Law <hi>in their inward Parts,</hi> &amp;c. where we ſee the Prophet called the <hi>Covenant</hi> which he mentioned before, <hi>my Law,</hi> to remove all manner of Doubts of its being underſtood for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they ſay.</p>
                  <p>BUT it may be the Brightneſs of God's Word will not at once let them ſee the Truth of our Doctrine; as a great many times it happens to thoſe who from the Dark, on a ſudden come, or are brought to the Light, that the Clearneſs and Brightneſs of the Sun, makes them to be blinder than they were before, not Becauſe the Sun is dark in it ſelf, but becauſe they are ſo naturalized to Darkneſs, that the Excellency of the Sun's Light is too ſtrong for them: Therefore I ſhall take another Method with them, to let them ſee the Brightneſs of our Doctrine if I can, namely, by quoting to them ſome of their own Authors, by which Means, I hope to bring them by Degrees out of Darkneſs, to ſee the Brightneſs of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> even to the Knowledge of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Doctrine preſcribed by him in the New Law, or the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>IN that famous Book called <hi>Mechiltau</hi> upon the Words of the 9th Verſe of the 26th Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which ſays, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you,</hi> has the following Sentence, viz. <q>
                        <hi>And I
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002324_0101_0FDB2488A18ED9D0"/>will establiſh my Covenant with you, not as the firſt Covenant was which you have anulled and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but a new Covenant that ſhall endure for ever, as it is written, Jer.</hi> 31.31. Behold, the Days come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael, and with the Houſe of Judah.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THESE Words do plainly ſhow, that the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies of old,</hi> underſtood that God would give a new Law at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and they prove it from this Text alſo, whatever the <hi>modern Rabbies</hi> do underſtand now.</p>
                  <p>AND becauſe by the Mouth of two Witneſſes every thing is to be eſtabliſhed, I ſhall bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſs of their own, which will atteſt the Certainty of our Doctrine, and then in caſe they wont hearken to it, but remain in their <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> I ſhall leave the Caſe with him who is able to open their Underſtanding, in the Time appointed according to his Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>IN that ancient and famous Book of theirs, called <hi>Medraſh Koelleth,</hi> upon the laſt Word of the 11th Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> is recorded the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sentence, <q>
                        <hi>Vanity; <hi>The Law which a Man learns in this World is Vanity in Compariſon of, or before the</hi>
                        </hi> Meſſiah's <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>OUT of ſaid Sentence any Body may plainly ſee, not only that they call it expreſly the <hi>Meſſiah's LAW,</hi> but that they alſo ſay, <hi>this</hi> is ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the <hi>former,</hi> that the firſt Law is a meer <hi>Vanity</hi> in Compariſon to the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's LAW,</hi> and not <hi>COVENANT,</hi> to avoid any Miſtakes for the Time enſuing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE third Title the Prophet gives the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is, <hi>A mighty God.</hi> This is a Title that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot ſhow any thing elſe but that he is <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi> The Name <hi>Ale,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>strong God,</hi> (from the Root <hi>Auyall He
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002324_0102_0FDB248A179DA398"/>ſtrengthned,</hi>) and which King <hi>David</hi> gives to <hi>God the Father,</hi> in Pſal. 95.3. <hi>For the Lord is a great God,</hi> the Prophet gives to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in this Place. Whereas, in caſe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be a Man only, as the modern Jews (and ſandry Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in the Church did and do) ſuppoſe, I am apt to think the Prophet would never have call'd him <hi>Ale Gibbor, <hi>A mighty God.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE modern Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> to avoid this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulty, do ſay, that the Name of <hi>Ale, God,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a great many Times in the Scriptures, a <hi>Judge,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore out of this Place the Divinity of Chriſt cannot be proved. To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>ALTHO' it is true, as they ſay, yet among all thoſe Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are called <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Gods</hi> in holy Writ, we never find that any of them are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>Aloim</hi> only. Therefore if I find a Place where Chriſt is called with the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and fearful Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is the ſame by which God the Father is known, I hope they will be ſatisfied he is God alſo; ſince this is a Name called the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> which they have in ſuch <hi>ſuperstitious Veneration,</hi> that they wont pronounce it, not only upon common Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (for this would be a very pious and religious Principle indeed,) but refuſe to call upon God by this Name even in their publick or private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in reading the holy Scriptures, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without Warrant.</p>
                  <p>THE Place where Chriſt is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is plainly to be ſeen in the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. which is as follows, <hi>Behold, the Days come ſaith the Lord, I will raiſe upon David a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgment and Justice in the Earth. In his Days Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, <hi>Jehoush</hi> our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002324_0103_0FDB248BB3026538"/>
THIS Prophecy they do acknowledge to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and in it we plainly ſee, how the Prophet called him <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to teach us the great and high Myſtery of the <hi>Godhead</hi> of Chriſt; becauſe the Deliverance of the Church from the Captivity of Satan, was to be wrought by one that had the Power over him, and not by Man; for this was impoſſible for any to perform, except God himſelf, who was and is her true <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Deliverer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN the modern <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies</hi> are preſſed with this Argument, they ſay, that the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not a Name given to God only, but to ſundry other Things alſo, as in Gen. 22.14. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> called the Name of that Place where he was to ſacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac, <hi>Jehovah</hi> will ſee;</hi> and not only <hi>Abraham,</hi> but even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, after <hi>Joſhua</hi> fought and diſcomfited the <hi>Hamalikites,</hi> did build an Altar unto the Lord, and called it <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſaying, <hi>Jehovah Neſee, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                     </hi> 17.15. <hi>Gideon</hi> the Captain, after he had ſuch good News, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he
ſhould not die for the <hi>Sight</hi> he had ſeen before, did build an Altar unto the Lord, and called it <hi>Jehovah Shallow</hi> Judg. 6.24. The Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.35. after he gave a Deſcription of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> rerreſtial (as they ſay) he called it <hi>Jehovah <hi>there.</hi>
                     </hi> Therefore (they ſay) ſince we ſee, ſaid Name is applied by ſuch Pillars of the Church as <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to other Things, <hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt to a <hi>Mountain,</hi> the ſecond and third to <hi>Altars,</hi> and the fourth to a <hi>City,</hi> and all are inanimate Creatures, far below the Dignity of a Man, and yet no Body can ſuppoſe, becauſe they are ſo called, that they are God; with much more Reaſon may we attribute ſaid Name to the Meſſiah as a <hi>Man,</hi> who is of more Dignity than Stones are, without his being more <hi>God</hi> than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>BUT ſince the Anſwer to this Objection, which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002324_0104_0FDB248FC894BB48"/>ſeems to have ſome Weight in it, has been diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given by ſundry of our Divines, I ſhall not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it at large, but only bring a couple of Authorities of their own ancient <hi>Rabbies,</hi> very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical with them, which ſhall ſhow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of what they argue, and eſtabliſh the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Doctrine. Theſe are as follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE firſt is <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who in his famous Book called <hi>Mora Neboohim,</hi> in the ſixty-firſt Chapter of the firſt Part, treating upon the different Names, or Attributes which we find the Prophets did give to God, ſays thus, <q>
                        <hi>All the Names of the moſt High which are found in the Books, (i. e.</hi> of the Bible,) <hi>are derived from his Actions, and that which has no Derivation in it, is only one,</hi> i. e. <hi>the</hi> Tetragrammaton, <hi>which is appropriated to the moſt High only; therefore it is called a</hi> declared <hi>Name, which ſignifyeth the very Eſſence of the moſt High, with clear Demonstration, in which there is no Equal or Partner with him. But the reſt of his Names, i. e.</hi> Judge, Mighty, Righteous, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, God, <hi>&amp;c. are all Names which declare the Effects and Derivation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the</hi> Tetragram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton <hi>Name is unknown as yet as to its certain Derivation, and therefore it is attributed to him only.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE ſecond is that which is recorded in that ancient Book of theirs, called <hi>Medraſh Achau,</hi> which is an Expoſition upon <hi>Lamentations.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſixteenth Verſe of the firſt Chapter, and upon the Words, <hi>Becauſe the Comforter is far from me,</hi> it brings in the following Sentence, <q>
                        <hi>Rabbi <hi>Abau</hi> the Son of <hi>Rahaunah</hi>
                        </hi> (it being asked him before what the Comforters Name was to be) <hi>ſaid, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is his Name, as it is written in Jer.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.5. And this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſneſs.</q>

NOW, out of ſaid Authorities I gather two Things of a very great Conſequence, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Name called the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> is of ſuch Excellency and Veneration, that it is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed only to God, as the Supream Being, and no none elſe, becauſe they are all Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Comforter</hi> of Iſrael was to be called by ſaid Name; from whence I draw a very fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, even according to their own Principles, that Chriſt the <hi>Comforter</hi> was a true <hi>God,</hi> ſince he is called in the Scriptures by that Name which none but God is to be called by
<note n="*" place="bottom">How the Scriptures are to be underſtood, when the ſaid Name is given to ſundry Things. ſee <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Selomo Jarchi</hi> upon ſaid Texts.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS Doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>DIVINITY,</hi> is ſo certain and ſo true an one, that altho' a great many Hereticks in and out of the Church did queſtion it, I find one of the firſt Writers in the primitive Ages, calls whoſoever ſhould preach that there was but one God alone, ſo as to take away the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt, a <hi>Devil,</hi> and an <hi>Enemy of Righteouſneſs.</hi> (<hi>Ignatius</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>NOW, ſince we have juſtified our Cauſe, (even by their own Authorities, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Son of Man</hi> is not only a <hi>Man</hi> but <hi>God</hi> alſo,) I ſhall go on to conſider the fourth &amp; laſt Title the Prophet gives to the Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly and lastly,</hi> THE Meſſiah is called an <hi>Everlaſting Father.</hi> Here as to this Title we muſt be very careful how we underſtand it; for altho' the Prophet called him ſo, yet he doth not mean in that Senſe of Divine Paternity, and with that peculiar and evangelical Epithet whereby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in our Creed, the <hi>first Perſon</hi> of the ever bleſſed <hi>Trinity;</hi> becauſe if we ſhould underſtand it ſo, we ſhould fall into a groſs Error (God forbid:) But this Title of <hi>an Everlasting Father,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002324_0106_0FDB249256B7A898"/>in this Place, as attributed to the <hi>Son</hi> in an allegorical Senſe, or as a relative Title, and no more.</p>
                  <p>TO underſtand ſaid Title fully, it is requiſite to have recourſe to the Original, and after a due Enquiry, with all Reverence and Submiſſion, we hope to find the true Meaning of it. And ſo far as I can learn, this Word <hi>Father,</hi> that in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is <hi>Aubee</hi> hath ſix Significations: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. IT ſignifieth a <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Natural Generator.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. A <hi>Patriarch.</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>4. A <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. AN <hi>Inventor</hi> of a new Thing.</item>
                        <item>6. AND laſtly, A <hi>Deſire.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the firſt, Gen. 47.1. <hi>Then Joſeph came and told Pharaoh, and ſaid, My</hi> Father <hi>and my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>FOR the ſecond, Deut. 17.5. <hi>For a</hi> Father <hi>of many Nations I made thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the third, 2 Kings 2.12. <hi>And Eliſha ſaw it and cryed, My</hi> Father, <hi>my</hi> Father, (when he was not his Father, but his Rabbi.)</p>
                  <p>FOR the fourth, 1 Sam. 24.11. <hi>Moreover, my</hi> Father, <hi>ſee,</hi> &amp;c. (He was not his Father, but his King.)</p>
                  <p>FOR the Fifth, Gen. 4.21. <hi>He was the</hi> Father <hi>of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ, i. e.</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of theſe Inſtruments.</p>

                  <p>IN all theſe Places, we find the Original to be expreſſed in one Way, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Word <hi>Aubee;</hi> agreeable to which I am prone to think, the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah was to be call'd a <hi>Father,</hi> in all the Meanings aforeſaid, except the firſt.</p>
                  <p>NOW (to avoid any Miſtakes) let us examine each one in particular,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:002324_0107_0FDB2493DA952918"/>
JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <hi>Father,</hi> not as a Generator, as I ſaid before, but as a <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> and he was ſo, as in Mat. 19.28. <hi>And Jeſue ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his Glory, ye ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <hi>Patriarch</hi> of many Nations, as he is the Father of all thoſe that believe in him to be juſtified; as in Acts 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe are justifyed from all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <hi>Doctor,</hi> or a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and ſo he was, as in Joh. 3.2. <hi>Nichodemus came to Jeſus by Night, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <hi>King,</hi> as in Zech. 9.9. <hi>Behold, thy King cometh unto thee.</hi> And in Rev. 17.14. <hi>And the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST was to called an <hi>Inventor,</hi> as he was to invent and inſtitute another Sort of Government, far better than the former, for the Propagation and Welfare of his Church, as he is the Head of it; as in Eph. 5.23. <hi>Even as Chriſt is the Head of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <hi>Deſire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has been always deſirable to all Nations, even to this Day, by thoſe that wait for him; as we read in Hag. 2.7. <hi>And the Deſire of all Natione ſhall come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I NOW paſs to the third Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE third Point of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Prophet ſpeaks of in this Place, is to ſhow <hi>what ſort of Government the Meſſiah ſhould bear, and how long it ſhould last.</hi> This is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002324_0108_0FDB2498884A5468"/>declared in the laſt Part of the Text; namely. <hi>The Prince of Peace; of the Increaſe of his Government and Peace no end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TWO Points are comprehended under this Head: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>WHAT Sort of Government he ſhould bear.</hi> And,</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>HOW long it ſhould laſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the firſt, When the Prophet has a mind to declare, that Chriſt's Government ſhould be with Peace and Amity, with Love and Union, without Jarrs and Debates, he ſays, <hi>The Prince of Peace;</hi> and in a way of <hi>Anadiploſis,</hi> he repeats the ſame at the End. This Manner of Government we find Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did preach, and nothing elſe, as it is plain to be ſeen in ſundry Places of the New Teſtament, Mat. 9.50. <hi>And have Peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>Live peaceably with all Men.</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow Peace with all Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THIS is that univerſal Peace the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.4. doth foretell ſhould be at the Time of Chriſt's Appearance; and ſo it came to paſs, as may be evidenced in that General Peace that was thro' the whole World at the Time of his coming; as we read in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1. Concerning the Tax that was ſaid upon all the World by <hi>Caſar Augustus</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
                  <p>HERE the Jewiſh Doctors as the chief Oppoſers of Chriſtianity, argue thus: <hi>Jeſus</hi> cannot be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed by the Prophets, becauſe he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that he did not come to ſend Peace on the Earth, but <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Variance</hi> one againſt another, as we read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.51. And all the Prophets in General foretold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I OWN that Chriſt ſaid ſo, not becauſe I can't help it, but becauſe ſaid Expreſſions do prove and ſhow the Veracity of our Doctrine, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it aright. If we examine the Words that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002324_0109_0FDB2499E1D5CDE0"/>Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, we ſhall not find he ſaid, that he came to make War, (as they ſay,) but in <hi>Matthew</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>to ſend a Sword,</hi> and in <hi>Luke,</hi> to <hi>give a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion:</hi> Which Words are to be underſtood thus.</p>
                  <p>FOR the great Diſſaffinity that there is between <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> for the great Unequality there is between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> and for the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion there is between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> Chriſt foretels, (as one that knew all things, as one that knew what would come to paſs between his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and thoſe that deny'd him,) that the time would come, when the preaching of his everlaſting Goſpel would make a Diviſion between theſe two Parties, as if a Sword had cut them aſunder; not becauſe the Nature of the Goſpel it ſelf is to bring Diviſions and Jarrs among the true Believers, for we know to the contrary, both by Records, and (what is more convincing) by our own Experience: But from the great Enmity that there is between God and Satan, the Diviſion between the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doth proceed, as contrary and oppoſite one to the other. But the Goſpel it ſelf produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good Will and Friendſhip among true Believers, as it is recorded in Acts 4.32. <hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of one Heart, and of one Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>HOW long ſaid Government ſhould last.</hi> This is plain and manifeſt in the next Words, <hi>Of the Increaſe of his Government and Peace no End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF we examine Hiſtories, we ſhall find that all the Monarchs and Potentates of the World that have been ſince the Creation, have proved hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very frail and periſhing ones, (altho' they ſhew to be as firm as Rocks, in the Time of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Government, as the Chronologers are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well informed,) except the Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>This,</hi> inſtead of decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, every Day grows bigger and bigger, altho' it
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002324_0110_0FDB249B851F9988"/>began with the moſt unlikely Means imaginable. So this Dominion the Prophet ſays, ſhall never come to an End, but ſhall be permanent and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever; <hi>Of the Increaſe of his Government and Peace no end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Meaning of the Words, <hi>No End,</hi> (that in the Original is <hi>Rets</hi> from the Root <hi>Kautzautz He did cut,</hi>) is as much as to ſay, <hi>It ſhall never be cut off,</hi> but it ſhall increaſe every Day till the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do come in, and next the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation,</hi> as a Body, being all under one Shepherd, the great Biſhop of Souls, and until the Work ſhall be finiſhed, and our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn every thing to <hi>God the Father,</hi> with ſubduing all his Enemies under his Feet, and deſtroying all his Adverſaries, even Death it ſelf, and all the <hi>Elect</hi> obtain and enjoy everlaſting Happineſs with him in eternal Glory, as it has been promiſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THE fourth and laſt Point of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the Prophet ſpeaks of in this Prophecy, is, <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>from whom the Meſſiah ſhould proceed.</hi> This Point has two Conſiderations: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. HOW. And,</item>
                        <item>2. FROM whom.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the firſt, <hi>How.</hi> This may be anſwered two Ways.
<list>
                        <item>1. Negatively. And,</item>
                        <item>2. Affirmatively.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>NEGATIVELY:</hi> Not of a married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as other lawful Children are, which by the Courſe of Nature are born and propagated. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>AFFIRMATIVELY:</hi> Of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>immaculate Virgin,</hi> and not from any Virgin whatſoever, but from one whoſe Name was to be called <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002324_0111_0FDB249CDCAF98F0"/>
THESE two myſterious Points the Prophet doth foretel in the Word, <hi>Of the Increaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO underſtand this Doctrine, 'tis requiſite for us to have recourſe to the Original, elſe it will be never underſtood.</p>
                  <p>THE Word in the Original is <hi>Lemar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a, Of the Increaſe,</hi> Said Word is wrote with a final <hi>Mem</hi> in the middle, contrary to all the Grammar Rules; and it is that only Word which is wrote ſo in the whole Bible. It is not to be ſuppoſed to be the Printer's Fault, but the contrary; in caſe it was not ſo wrote, it would have been counted an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                  <p>I AM prone to think, the Penman of this Book, with a great and particular Providence, did write it ſo, to ſhow us the Doctrine we are upon. To prove that it is done providentially, it requires us only to take Notice, how the Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the Preſervation of the holy Scriptures, have taken the Care to advertiſe their Synagogue, for the Preſervation of ſaid Word, and to write it in the ſame Manner, and no otherways, altho' they underſtood not the Meaning of it; and I am apt to think ſince the Beginning it was kept ſo, as we have it now. I remember the Words of one of their Rabbies commenting upon ſaid Word, wrote with a <hi>Cloſe,</hi> or final <hi>Mem</hi> in the Middle, ſays thus, <hi>Mem cloſed</hi> (in this Place) <hi>a cloſe or a myſterious thing ſignifyeth."</hi> And tho' he doth not tell what, either becauſe he would not, or becauſe he knew not; nevertheleſs, he knew that ſo it ſhould be, and that ſo it was from the Beginning, otherwiſe, if he (or any other) knew any thing to the contrary, they would certainly, have told it. In the Margin of ſome of our corrected Bibles, I find this <hi>Advertiſement</hi> ſet down as a <hi>Monument,</hi> that every Body ſhould take Notice of it, i. e. <q>
                        <hi>A cloſe Mem</hi> (muſt be ſet) <hi>in the middle of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002324_0112_0FDB24A0AA35A618"/>Word.</hi>
                     </q> Therefore to think that all the <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> and <hi>margin Writings</hi> in Company with the Antiquity of the Book, ſhould be ſet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded caſually and by Chance, I cannot join with thoſe that think ſo, but believe it doth ſignify theſe two Points: Namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>HOW.</hi> And,</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>FROM whom</hi> Chriſt ſhould proceed.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ FOR the firſt, <hi>How.</hi> If we take notice of the Shape of ſaid Letter, we ſhall find it ſhaped with four Corners, thus, □ cloſed in all Parts, to ſhow that the Mother of our Lord was to be a <hi>pure Virgin,</hi> cloſed without being known by any Body carnally, but overſhadowed by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>FOR the ſecond, <hi>From whom.</hi> Not from any <hi>Virgin</hi> whatſoever, but from one whoſe Name was to be called <hi>MARY,</hi> and no other. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered in ſaid Letter, which is the firſt of the Letters which the Name <hi>Miriam</hi> or <hi>Mary</hi> begins with, and according to this Prediction, in the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time it exactly came to paſs, as we read in Mat. 1.18. <hi>Now the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt was on this wiſe: Whenas his mother Mary was eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Joſeph, before they came together, ſhe was found with Child of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And the ſame is recorded in Luk. 1.27.</p>
                  <p>TO confirm this Doctrine, 'tis to be obſerved, that the Scripture for the moſt Part, when it mentions Chriſt's Mother, it doth it with both Names together, i. e. <hi>Virgin,</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, ſince I have been long enough in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Meaning of this Prophecy, how it is to be underſtood, according to the Catholick Senſe of it, it is time for me to take a View of what the modern <hi>Jewiſh Witters</hi> or <hi>Rabbies</hi> do ſay upon it, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that bear the biggeſt Sway now-a-days in their Synagogue. And with what has been ſaid,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002324_0113_0FDB24A227F45520"/>I hope the Fallacy of their Interpretation will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear clearly to our Sight.</p>
                  <p>THE modern Jewiſh Writers, ſuch as <hi>Rabbi Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h Ben Jſrael</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Jſaac Abrabanel, &amp;c.</hi> do, firſt, <hi>Affirmatively</hi> ſay (whatever their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſaid to the contrary) that the Child the Prophet here ſpeaks of in this Place, and in the 7th Chapter, is concerning <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> King <hi>Abaz</hi>'s Son, becauſe in his Days they were delivered from the great Oppreſſion that the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Confederacy of two great and mighty Kings, i. e. <hi>Razin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who did convene together with the Strength of their Armies againſt <hi>Abaz</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as in the 7th Chapter of this Propheſy; and in this Senſe God was with them in a wonderful Manner, and delivered them with ſuch unexpected Deliverance; and he, King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was the Child <hi>I manuel</hi> foretold by the Prophet, becauſe in his Days God was with them in a wonderful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, NEGATIVELY,</hi> (they ſay,) The Child ſpoken of by the Prophet, has no Reference at all to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> for three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> (THEY ſay,) How is is poſſible, that that which was to come ſix hundred Years after, could be taken for a Sign of Comfort of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the Terrors and Dangers they were under at the Time when the Prophet delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Meſſage? Would it be a Comfort to any Man that was lame, or weak, or with any Bodily Diſeaſe, to tell him ſuch News, namely, that his Poſterity five or ſix hundred Years after he was dead and rotten, ſhould be ſound, ſtrong, and in good Health? What cares any Body for ſuch News; or what does any Body care for ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, ſo long as he that ſuffers is not to be the better for it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:002324_0114_0FDB24A3D5810528"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE ſecond Reaſon why this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy cannot be underſtood of the Meſſiah, (they ſay) is, becauſe the Word is in the Preterite Tenſe, <hi>Vauikrau, And he called.</hi> Whereas, if it was a Prophecy that was to be underſtood of a Thing which ſhould come to paſs ſome hundreds of Years hence, the Word would be <hi>Vackaura, And he ſhall be called,</hi> in the future Tenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE the third Reaſon why it doth not concern the Meſſiah, (they ſay) is, becauſe all the Titles deſcribed in it, as. <hi>Wonderful, Counſeller, A mighty God,</hi> and <hi>An everlaſting Father,</hi> are Titles belonging properly to God, and not to Man; and only the Title of <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> is the Title of the Perſon the Prophet ſpeaks of, which is King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or any Body elſe whatſoever, the Meſſah excepted, as the Accents do ſhow.</p>
                  <p>THESE are the chief Arguments which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be taken Notice of, or are worth anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Therefore I ſhall firſt make it appear, that the Words of the Prophet cannot be underſtood of King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and ſecondly, I ſhall anſwer ſaid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in full; and then conclude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> TO prove this Prophecy could not be underſtood of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> three very ſtrong Reaſons may be brought or offered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> HIS Reign not being perpetual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent for ever, as the Prophet ſays, <hi>Of the Increaſe of his Government and Peace no end.</hi> But the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we read in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. that becauſe he rebelled againſt <hi>Sanherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> the War went ſo far between them, that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>'s King came againſt him, and took all the fenced Cities of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was forced to buy the Peace of him for the Sum of 300 Talents of Silver and 20 Talents of Gold, which amounts (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Clark's</hi> Computation) to the Sum of

                        <abbr>s.</abbr>
                     </hi> Sterling. Now I ask, Is this to have Peace in his Dominions without end?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> IF we conſider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.2. we find King <hi>Abaz</hi> his Father did reign ſixteen Years. Therefore it conſequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not be leſs than Nine Years old when this was foretold by the Prophet. Now I ask, How could he be the Child whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Conception and wonderful Birth was here foretold, ſince he was already born, and by no other Way but by the ordinary Courſe of Nature, contrary to the Prophet's Words, that he was to be of a Virgin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IF we could ſearch all the Hiſtories of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> or any other whatſoever, either of the Jewiſh Writers, or any other Nation, we ſhould not find that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ever called by the Name <hi>Imanuel,</hi> neither as a proper, nor as an appellative Name: Therefore I do greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, how the modern Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Rabbi Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> a Man of ſuch great Learning as he was, in his <hi>Confiliador,</hi> doth maintain ſaid Opinion, without Warrant, or any Colour of Truth.</p>
                  <p>NOW ſince we have made it appear, that this Prophecy cannot be underſtood of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as the modern Jewiſh Rabbies will have it, let us go to the next, namely, to ſee whether we can An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Objections; and in Caſe we can (as doubtleſs we ſhall) the Whole Truth will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear and come to Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> IF we examine the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtext, we ſhall find the great Sorrow &amp; Affliction King <hi>Ahaz</hi> was under, when he ſaw two mighty Kings joining Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affliction (which certainly was great) that his Majeſty King <hi>Ahaz</hi> was under, ſent the Prophet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> to Comfort him with theſe agreeable &amp; Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Words; <hi>Take heed &amp; be quiet, fear not neither be faint bearted, for the Two Tails of thoſe ſmoaking fire Brands, the Counſels &amp; Devices theſe two Kings have took againſt thee &amp; the Houſe of David, ſhall not prevail; thus ſaith the Lord, it ſhall not stand, neither ſhall it come to paſs,</hi> &amp;c. and then the Prophet, to eſtabliſh him in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Love,</hi> the <hi>Great Love</hi> that God the Father both to Mankind, to ſend his beloved Son into the World out of the Stock of <hi>David,</hi> how could ſaid <hi>Son,</hi> or ſaid <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> come from ſuch a Stock, in caſe it was deſtroyed and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at that Time, as <hi>he</hi> thought it would?

Therefore I ſay, what greater Aſſurance could he have for his Deliverance? or, What greater Comfort for his Afflictions, than to have ſuch News brought to him by a Prophet? Surely none. If ſo,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002324_0117_0FDB24AA043ACF38"/>let us conclude, that altho' the Promiſe was not to come till a great many ages and Generations, after he was Dead and Rotten, yet it was a great Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Deliverance, and a great alleviation of the preſent Afflictions he was under; ſince, if <hi>he</hi> &amp; the whole Stock ſhould periſh as he feared, the Thing appointed would never come to paſs, which is contradictory in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE Second Argument is, That the Prophet ſpeaks in the Preterite Tenſe, &amp;c. I think it would be a great deal in their Way (as 'tis uſual to ſay) never to Argue it, ſince it is a Thing that we find very common in the Holy Writs, to expreſs the Future Tenſe with a Preterit Expreſſion, to ſhow the certainty of the Thing foretold, as if it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and I am fully ſatisfied they know it as well as we

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> AS to the Third Objection, That all the Titles of the Text belong to God, till it come to the laſt, namely, <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> I think, with what is already ſaid, it remains fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>i. e.</hi> that all thoſe Titles in general belong to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> not as a Man only, but as a God alſo.</p>
                  <p>To prove that ſaid Titles belong properly to the Perſon Nominated, and not to the Nominator, If they could but ſee the Truth, they could not help owning it, becauſe the Running of the Text doth ſhow it: For in Caſe they ſhould have a reference to the Nominator and not to the Nominated, as they would have it to be, the Text would be thus, <hi>Vauikrau Dela Yognetz are Guibox Iubee griaud eth Shemo faur Shaulome, And the Wonderful Counſeiler, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father ſhall call his name the Prince of Peace.</hi> But ſince the Text ſays, <hi>And his Name ſhall be called, Wouderful,

                        </gap> Prince of Peace,</hi> it doth clearly ſhow, that all thoſe Titles do properly belong to the Perſon <hi>Nominated,</hi> namely, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as God and Man, and not to the Nominator to God alone, as already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Accents, they plead for it, for to prove their Sophiſtical Interpretation, I am willing at any Time and Place, to make it appear, that the Accents ſet under the Words <hi>Iubee gnaud Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father,</hi> ſnow the Certainty of our Doctrine, and Contradict theirs, following the Rules of ſaid Art, which I omit at preſent, ſince it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now ſince I have proved with God's Aſſiſtance, four Principal Points of Chriſtianity that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Prophecy; Namely, 1. <hi>The coming of the Meſſiah. 2. What ſort of Perſon ſaid Meſſiah ſhould be. 3. What kind of Government he ſhould bear, and how long it ſhould last.</hi> 4. And laſtly, <hi>How and from whom ſaid Meſſiah ſhould proceed,</hi> with all the Branches therein contained, not only by the Authority of the Old and New Teſtament, (as both infallible) but even with the Authority of thoſe that will not own that <hi>he</hi> is already come, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have anſwer'd their Principal Objections, which they object againſt the Orthodox Meaning and Interpretation of ſaid Prophecy, I ſhall conclude with a Word of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>

The Fruits that are obtained by the Meditation and Contemplation thereof are ſo raviſhing, that none can declare them in full: Even thoſe who do enjoy them, find them ſo much above their Capacities to expreſs, ſo much beyond their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to declare, and ſo ſublime to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and rehearſed, (if ever they might come to be heard) that it would not be comprehended and underſtood. It is the firſt fruit of the Spirit ſaith the Apoſtle Paul to the Galatians. <hi>Gal. 5.22.</hi> and therefore how can any, that are Deſtitute or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſuch Spirit ever come to underſtand any thing of it? Carnal Men Laugh at the Truth and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002324_0123_0FDB24B71C580AE0"/>Orthodox Points of Chriſtianity, for lacking of Faith to believe them. The Doctrine of Chriſt crucified was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a Stumbling-block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fooliſhneſs, becauſe for want of Faith they could not be perſuaded of the Truth thereof, but it was counted in their fooliſh Conceits and carnal Minds, nothing but Fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>NOW, under this Word <hi>BELIEF</hi> are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Points of the Chriſtian Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and all, I am prone to think, King <hi>David</hi> aimed at, when he expreſſed theſe Words, <hi>I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> becauſe he being 2 Type of Chriſt, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come out of his Loins, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his pondering and meditating upon the Truths and profound Myſteries that were to be revealed to the Church in the Fulneſs of Time, he cryed out, <hi>I believed;</hi> implying in theſe Words, that altho' he knew he ſhould not ſee that Day, nevertheleſs he was fully ſatisfied all thoſe Myſteries, which in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time God would reveal to his Elect were true; and the Reaſon of the Expreſſion, <hi>I was greatly afflicted,</hi> may have a Reference to the Condition he foreſaw the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> would be in for their Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>AMONG the great, deep, and fathomleſs Points of Divinity, which God of his infinite Mercies was pleaſed to reveal, <hi>i. e.</hi> to open more clearly than he did before to his Catholick Church, is the great Myſtery of the <hi>ſacred &amp; bleſſed Trinity.</hi> This Point I do now deſign to prove, not to be a new Doctrine ſince Chriſt, as the modern <hi>Jews</hi> thro' a Miſtake ſuppoſe, but from the very Beginning, with clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations out of the old Teſtament, and their own authentick Authors, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that have the true underſtanding of the Law and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, (as they ſay,) called by them, <hi>Baugnaula Bohmath hauameth, the Masters of the True
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002324_0124_0FDB24B8CF08C910"/>Science,</hi> i. e. their <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Authors, ancient and modern, and anſwer the Objections that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will bring forth</p>
                  <p>AND before I begin, I implore God's Aſſiſtance, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 51.15. <hi>O Lord, open thou my Lips, and my Mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy Praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Point is of ſuch Weight, and of ſuch great Importance, that except a Man believes it, he can never be ſaved; becauſe, to believe in God the <hi>Son</hi> as our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. and in God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. (Titles and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging properly to God, becauſe none but God only can redeem and ſanctify our Souls, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.7. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.8.) and at the ſame Time to deny the Coequalneſs and Coevalneſs of ſhe three Perſons from all Eternity, ſeems to be ſo contrary to that Idea which the whole World of Mankind have of a God, that nothing can be more weak and abſurd in it ſelf than this is: And I am ſure ſuch as do believe this Doctrine (as the <hi>Arians</hi> did of old, and ſundry other Sects ſince) do believe in more Gods than one, contrary to what the Scriptures teach, and they themſelves pretend to affirm. And if we confider the thing aright, we ſnall find this Blaſphemous Doctrine of denying the Coequality of the three Perſons, hath been a great Stumbling-Block to the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi>'s Converſion, as well as the worſhiping of Images by the Papiſts, there being no other Difference between theſe two Opinions only this, <hi>viz.</hi> One worſhips Idols <hi>in actu,</hi> namely, the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the other <hi>in potentia,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Arians,</hi> &amp;c. and of the Two, I think, (if I may paſs my Judgment,) the laſt is the worſt, for two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> BECAUSE the Poiſon of their idolatrous Worſhip is mantled under the Cloak of ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002324_0125_0FDB24BA1D0C4780"/>which they make to be like a Noſe of Wax, to twiſt and twitch which way they will, to ſerve their Turn: Whereas the Papiſts, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay for to uphold their Opinion, or, whatever they pretend to alledge in Defence of their Image Worſhip, yet the Words of the ſecond Commandment ſtand as Witneſſes and as Monuments, againſt their deviliſh Doctrine and Diſtinction of <hi>Latria, Dulis,</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulta,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> BECAUSE ſince the <hi>Papiſh</hi> Worſhip is ſo plainly and openly performed, every body who hath any Light (in the leaſt) in the Sacred Oracles, doth plainly diſcover the Falſity and Erroneouſneſs thereof, and are aware of it; But the <hi>Arians;</hi> &amp;c. do carry on their Work ſo cunningly, and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes ſo Sophiſtically, and their Worſhip is ſo much like the true and Orthodox one, <hi>Ape like,</hi> that it is very difficult to perceive wherein the Gangreen lies, without it be by a good underſtanding Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and therefore it is the more dangerous to be Snared and caught by them, particularly to the weak and unlearned; Wherefore as I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, 'tis true and infallible what <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>BUT ſince my Deſign at preſent, is not to meddle with the <hi>Artans,</hi> I ſhall leave them, and turn my Face towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are my Brethren accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, and for whom my Heart is ready to burſt, when I Seriouſly think on them, to ſee them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But before I begin to quote the Authorities, for to prove my Aſſertion, I think 'tis very proper to give them to underſtand, what we mean when we ſay, We believe that God is ONE in Nature and Eſſence, and THREE in Perſons, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and afterwards make it appear, that their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> even the chief among them of old, and of late, underſtood and believed the ſame in Subſtance as we do; and the True Chriſtians and they, differ only in Terms.</p>
                  <p>IN quoting their Sayings, I do purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not to Criticiſe upon the Words, leaſt they may ſay, that I draw and make them ſay what I have a mind to, but only quote &amp; Tranſlate them Faithfully, and let them Judge afterwards.</p>

                  <p>NOW to go thro' the great and manifold Train of Scripture Proofs, for to demonſtrate my Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Anſwer all the Objections thereof, this would grow to a great Bulk contrary to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign at preſent, and likewiſe it would prove a Task ſomewhat unneceſſary for me to undertake, being it has been done already before now, by ſuch as are more able than I am, and in likelyhood, than I am like to be.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing that the End of his Life was very nigh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.1. was willing before his Death, to make a Recapitulation of all the Laws of God unto his People, with ſome wholſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; that ſo after his Death they might never blame him for being careleſs in diſcharging his Duty towards them. Therefore, after he had repeated the moral Law, as the unalterable Word till the World's End, he tells them in General of a Colloquy that paſs'd between them, of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of him to be a Mediator between God and them, the Lord's hearing their Words, his Wiſhes for their keeping their Hearts towards God all their Days, to fear him, to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Counſel to them, and finally, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God's Favour towards them, in caſe they would follow his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, becauſe the End of the Law was the Obedience of it.</p>
                  <p>AFTERWARDS he begins to particularize to them ſundry Obligations and Duties which were incumbent upon them, and the firſt that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the great and profound Myſtery of the <hi>Godhead, Three</hi> in Perſons, and <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Eſſence,</hi> with theſe Words, <hi>Hear O Iſrael, the Lord, our God, the Lord, is One.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002324_0140_0FDB24DC2D41A5C8"/>to my Brethren in particular, and to all in general.</p>
                  <p>THE Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſo full of Myſtery, and there are ſo many profitable and delectable Things (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſpiritual) to be gathered out of it, as can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be thought of any, even the wiſeſt that ever was, (in caſe we do not run too faſt upon Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, as moſt of the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> do.)</p>
                  <p>THIS is ſo certain, that it is the Opinion of a great many and worthy Divines, that <hi>Moſes</hi> Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God to let him ſee his Glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. was to let him ſee the high and deep Myſteries which are included in his ſacred and everlaſting Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> the great and dreadful Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (which whoſoever names vainly is worthy of Death.)

It is contrary to the holy Nature of my Name to be comprehended in full by any Creature whatſoever, therefore 'tis better to deſiſt. Nevertheleſs, I will grant you ſo far, that you ſhall obtain ſo much and ſo great Honour of me, that you ſhall ſee my back Parts, but my Face ſhall not be ſeen, <hi>i. e.</hi> you ſhall acquire ſo much Knowledge, and underſtand more of the Nature of my unſearchable Name, than any of the Saints that went before you ever did, even the Patriachs themſelves, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.2, 3. Therefore, let us with all Humility and holy Fear, ſee if we can find ſomething included in this fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Name, that may prove for our Inſtruſtion and ſpiritual Comfort.</p>
                  <p>THAT the holy and moſt bleſſed Trinity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> OUT of this Name the Cabaliſtical Authors do form ſeveral Different Names, and all are in the ſame Eſteem and Veneration among them, as the very Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious not to Reveal any of them to any Body, even of their own Nation, except it be to a Man accepted in General for a wiſe, pious, ſober, and blameleſs Perſon from his Infancy, according to the ſtrict Rules of Religion. Some of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſort of Names are as follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Name of 45 as they call it, which is formed thus, <hi>Bode Vau Dauleth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a Juleph, Vau Juleph Vau, Ea Juleph,</hi> The Numeration of ſaid Letters together as they are wrote amounts to 45.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE Name of 52 as they call it, which is formed thus, <hi>Yode Vau Dauleth, Ha Ha, Uau Uau, Ha Ha,</hi> following the ſame Rule, it amounts to the Number of 52. A great many more they do form, which I omit at preſent not being to my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THEY have three different Ways of Numeration, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> they called <hi>Miſpaur

The ſecond is that Way of Reckoning, which never riſes higher than 9. <hi>e. g.</hi> from <hi>Juleph</hi> to <hi>Jeth</hi> is 9, and then begins again, from <hi>Yode</hi> to <hi>Tzadde</hi> is 9 alſo, and then again, from <hi>Kuph</hi> to <hi>Tzadde <hi>final,</hi>
                     </hi> makes 9 like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The third is that in which the final Letters are not to be counted higher than their Equals, <hi>e. g. <hi>Cauph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>auph</hi>
                     </hi> amounts to 20 each, and not 20 and 500, as the common Way is, and ſo all the reſt of the double or final Letters follow the ſame Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly and laſtly,</hi> AS they numerate by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> ſo they do alſo by the Punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſaid Letters, and ſo every Tittle or Point amounts to 10, the <hi>Pautauh</hi> to 6, and the <hi>Caumetz</hi> to 16. And when they want any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to make up the Sum of what they are a going to ſhew or teach, ſometimes they make it up by the Number of Letters, ſometimes by the Number of Words, and ſometimes by both.</p>
                  <p>THESE Five Premiſes will be ſufficient at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to make appear the Truth of what I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſert, even according to their Cabaliſtical Principles.</p>
                  <p>NOW obſerve, Our ſovereign Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called a <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe he is the true and beloved Son of the living God; him we are all obliged to obey, and follow his Laws and Directions, as in Mat. 17.5. <hi>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE more immediate Word for a Son in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is <hi>Ben,</hi> this amounts according to the third Rule of Reckoning to 52, which is the ſame
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002324_0143_0FDB24E1DE4A1AC8"/>Numeration of the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Way of Spelling of it. Again,</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>Idam</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul ſays to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 15.45. <hi>The firſt Man Adam was made a living Soul, the last</hi> ADAM <hi>was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> Now the Word <hi>Idam</hi> following the ſame rule amounts to 45, and ſo likewiſe the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> according to the firſt Way of Spelling of it amounts to 45. and ſaid Name is called by them <hi>Idam</hi> alſo in ſeveral places of the Book <hi>Zohar</hi> aforeſaid, p. 98. &amp; 117. (for Brevity ſake I omit the Words, but I am ready to ſhow hem at any Time when demanded of me.)</p>
                  <p>A great many Myſteries and high Secrets the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſtical <hi>Rabbies</hi> do pretend to know, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they are included and Incloſed in this Name of 45. aforeſaid, and altho' I am ſure they teach a great many Chimerical Notions, Nevertheleſs, very often they ſay ſomethings which are nothing but pure Chriſtianity, cloathed under different Terms, for want of the true Knowledge of the everlaſting Goſpel. One that juſt now came into my mind I will Rehearſe, that ſo the Truth of my Aſſertion, may be made to appear, and I am more free in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, becauſe it is very much to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>THEY teach that God created the World with the Name of 45. and they prove it out of Prov. 3.19. <hi>The Lord by Wiſdom hath founded the Earth.</hi> The Word in the Original is <hi>Bahohmah,</hi> and they turn ſaid Word, which is tranſlated, <hi>By Wiſdom,</hi> according to their way of explaining the moſt part of the Scriptures, thus, <hi>Bahohmah Bacoauh Mau,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Wiſdom, By the Strength of <hi>Mau</hi> i. e.</hi> by the Strength of the Name 45, ſaying, <hi>The Lord by the Strength of this Name founded the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002324_0144_0FDB24E5CF955D58"/>
NOW I beg any to conſider what Doctrine this is, but the ſame that is recorded in <hi>John,</hi> at the Beginning of his holy <hi>Evangelium,</hi> John 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the ſame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS WORD aforeſaid is the true <hi>
                        <hi>Mau,</hi> i. e.</hi> the true <hi>Idam,</hi> which amounts to the Number of 45, as the Word <hi>Mau</hi> doth, which was from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Eternity with <hi>Jehovah the Lord,</hi> which amounts to 45 alſo, as aforeſaid, to ſhow that the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> are all one, of the ſelf ſame Numeration, <hi>i. e.</hi> of one and the ſelf ſame Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>NOW, having found out that the two firſt Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity are included in the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> let us ſee whether we can find the third Perſon alſo.</p>
                  <p>THE third Perſon in the Hebrew is called <hi>Rooauh Eaukodeſh.</hi> This Name amounts (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſecond way of Numeration, and the fifth, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Punctation) to the Sum of 101. Now, take Notice, ſince the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is neither made, created, nor ingendered of the Father or of the Son, but proceedeth from both, one and the ſame Subſtance, ſo likewiſe we ſhall find his Name proceeds from them alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> The Name of God the Father, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> amounts to 26, according to the ſecond Rule. <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is called in Gen. 18.3. and more plainly in Mal. 3.1. <hi>Audonauy,</hi> which Name amounts to 65, by the firſt Rule of Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Both together makes 91, and with the Addition of the eight Letters of both Names, and the two Names themſelves, according to the fifth Rule, come to be in the whole 101 alſo, to ſhow that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> proceedeth from both, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </p>

B.</hi>) of theſe Three Lights aforeſaid, they explain the Text in Deut. 32.39. <hi>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me,</hi> as it is plainly to be ſeen in the Book <hi>Zohar</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, <hi>Page</hi> 22. The Truth of this Doctrine leads me to Think,</p>
                  <p>THAT when we read in the old Teſtament, that the Saints of old, as King <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. did crave any Mercies or Favours of God <hi>for his NAME ſake,</hi> It was as much as if they had asked it in the Name of the whole TRINITY, becauſe in his Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> all the THREE Perſons are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as I ſaid; and therefore they were ſometimes anſwered, if the Thing by them deſired, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his moſt holy Will and Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, from what has been ſaid, whoſoever fears the Lord, or hath any regard for his Soul,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002324_0146_0FDB24E89F435B60"/>may eaſily diſcern how great and high a Sin it is for any Body to be guilty of the Breach of the third Commandment, and likewiſe what is the Reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MORE I might ſay to prove this Doctrine, even by the Authority of the Jewiſh Writers of this Science, not only upon <hi>Dent.</hi> 6.4. but upon ſundry other Texts of the Scripture: But with what has been already ſaid, I hope I have plainly and fully demonſtrated, that the God which we adore and hope to be ſaved by, is not <hi>three Gods,</hi> (God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid we ſhould ſay ſo,) but only One living and only true God; One in Subſtance and Eſſence, but Three Perſons, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> all equal in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
