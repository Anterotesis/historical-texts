            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the Dedication was accepted, and approved, by the respectable character, to whom it was addressed, and in the press, previous to the unfortunate event, which deprived science and mankind of that orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to both, the author is induced, rather from a sentiment of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> than <hi>vanity,</hi> to insert the following Note, the last effort of a mind, the faculties of which were never impaired.</p>
            <p>"Mr. BOWDOIN this morning had the pleasure of receiving Mrs."—'s very polite billet, accompanied with a manuscript Poem, "entitled, <hi>"The Virtues of Nature."</hi>

            <p>"Her intention of dedicating it to him does him great honor, and "as such he shall accept it, as coming from the well-directed pen of "the ingenious PHILENIA.</p>

            <p>The volume would be enlarged by that Lady's adding to it from "her budget of poetry, such a number of pieces, as would make it "respectable, not only for the matter, but for its size.</p>
            <p>"Mr. BOWDOIN would propose that the manuscript should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main where it is, for a day or two, to give Mrs. BOWDOIN and "her daughter, Lady TEMPLE, an opportunity of reading it.

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FROM an idea of being original in my subject, I was induced to undertake the following Tale. The manners and cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the</hi> Aborigines <hi>of North America are so limited and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they have scarcely engaged the attention either of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher or the Poet. Acquainted with some of their interesting ceremonies from tradition, I became desirous of gaining further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and gratefully acknowledge myself indebted to the obliging communications of General</hi> LINCOLN, <hi>for most of the local rites and customs alluded to, where I have not quoted any other authority. The opportunity his public commission, in the late negociations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and the Southern Indians, has afforded him to acquire the best information, added to the respectability of his character, will render his authority unquestioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As my principal design in attempting the Poem was to amuse my retired hours, and to gratify a few amiable friends, it is alone in compliance with the solicitations of those friends, that I have been prevailed upon to expose it to the public eye; but I am led to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that, deficient as the Poetry really is, it will convey some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, from the collection of many particulars which are not generally known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The grades of human nature, and the various propensities and avocations of mankind, in their different states and societies, must always be greatly interesting to the view of the philosopher; and even the most trifling production may become useful, if it serves to throw light on so important a subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may perhaps be objected, that I have given my favourite</hi> Ouâbi, <hi>a degree of insensibility, with respect to the love of</hi> Celario, <hi>incompatible with the greatness and superiority of his character: To this I reply, that the mind, unpracticed in deception, can nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be capable of suspicion; and that not having known the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean vices, he could have no idea of their existence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022684_0006_0FB9FBB183445978"/>
               <hi>It may also be imagined, that, considering the exalted virtue and resolution of</hi> Azâkia, <hi>which could lead her even to death for the man, to whom she was contracted, her ready compliance with the proposition of</hi> Ouâbi, <hi>and the joy she evinces on that occasion, form an unpardonable contradiction; but it must be remembered, that from the customs and laws of every country its manners and morals are derived.</hi> Azâkia, <hi>bound to her husband by every tie, would not deceive him; but when he expressed a wish to resign her, she could have no idea of his insincerity; so much is</hi> truth <hi>the characteristic of a state of nature: It then became a duty, a</hi> virtue, <hi>to pursue the first wish of her heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am aware it may be considered improbable, that an amiable and polished European should attach himself to the persons and manners of an uncivilized people; but there is now a living instance of a like propensity. A gentleman of fortune, born in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and educated in all the refinements and luxuries of Great Britain, has lately attached himself to a female savage, in whom he finds every charm I have given my</hi> Azâkia; <hi>and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his inclination, has relinquished his own country and connections, incorporated himself into the society, and adopted the manners of the virtuous, though uncultivated Indian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many of the outlines of the Fable are taken from a prose story in Mr.</hi> Carey's <hi>entertaining and instructing Museum; but as the opening scene of that narrative was rather deficient in decency, and the conclusion, in my opinion, very little interesting, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely changed it in those respects, and have introduced a variety of customs, the description of battles, and many other circumstances, which appeared essential to</hi> poetry, <hi>and necessary to the plot; still I acknowledge myself indebted to that production for many of the events, and for the names of the characters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Should any be induced to think that I have given too many perfections to a rude uncultivated savage, let them read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

apostrophe by a celebrated French author.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">M. Mercier.</note> "I glanced my eye rapidly over the scene, and in a vast country, to us hitherto unknown, I saw a naked Indian, having nothing but God and nature above him, enjoying the benefits which offer, without analysing them. His body was supple and robust, his eye lively and piercing, his ear attentive, in his deportment a certain air of haughtiness, of which we have no kind of idea in our degenerate climate. He seems even more graceful and majestic when beside his female compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, his eye is milder, his countenance more serene." <hi>But the authority by which I have been influenced, and from which I feel myself justified, is</hi> William Penn, <hi>founder of Pennsylvania, whose manners and principles could not admit of exaggeration, or extravagancy of expression. In his letters to his friends in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he describes the North-American Indians in the following terms.</hi> "For their persons they are generally tall, straight, well built, and of singular proportion: they tread strong and clever, and mostly walk with a lofty chin: the thick lip and flat nose, so frequent with the East-Indians and blacks, are not common with them; for I have seen as comely, European-like faces among them of both sexes, as on your side the sea. And truly an Italian complexion hath not much more of the white, and the noses of several have as much of the Roman."</p>
            <p>"They are great concealers of their own resentment, but in liberality they excel; nothing is too good for their friend. Their government is by kings; every king has his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and that consists of all the old and wise men of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nothing of moment is undertaken without advising with them, and what is more, with the young men too. It is admirable to consider how powerful their kings are, and yet how they move by the breath of the people. I have

had occasion to be in council with them; while any one spoke, not a man of them was observed to whisper or smile, the old grave, the young reverend, in their deportment; they speak little, but fervently, and with elegance; I have never seen more natural sagacity, considering them without the help (I was going to say the spoil) of tradition." <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by such authorities I flatter myself, allowing for the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able embellishments of poetry, that I shall not be considered an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast in my descriptions. The liberal reader will, I trust, make many allowances for the various imperfections of the work, from a consideration of my sex and situation; the one by education inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to weakness, the other from duty devoted to domestic avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And I am induced to hope, that the attempting a subject wholly American will in some respect entitle me to the partial eye of the patriot; that, as a young author, I shall be received with tenderness, and, as an involuntary one, be criticised with candor.</hi>

               <l>ACROSS the vast Atlantic tide,</l>
               <l>Down <hi>Apalachia's</hi> grassy side,</l>
               <l>What echoing sounds the soul beguile,</l>

               <l>As kindness to the ear of pain,</l>
               <l>Splendid as noon, as morning clear,</l>
               <l>And chaste as ev'ning's pearly tear;</l>
