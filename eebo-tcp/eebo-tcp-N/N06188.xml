            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>HAIL great Historians with your generous Fire,</l>
               <l>Lay down your Books a while for to enquire,</l>
               <l>A home born Story, and Discriminate,</l>
               <l>Man's budding, blooming, ripening, withering State;</l>
               <l>His first Approach is with a rusul Roar,</l>
               <l>More senseless than a Beast, nor half the Pow'r;</l>
               <l>But soon arrives to wear a graceful Smile,</l>
               <l>Which gains him such exceptance for a while,</l>
               <l>That Weaponsless he conquors ev'ry Foe,</l>
               <l>Nor Cares, nor Fears, nor Malice Undergo.</l>
               <l>Thus see the Resurrection of the Spring,</l>
               <l>The Buds shoot Forth the merry Birds do Sing:</l>
               <l>All nature Shouts, and Ecchoes to their Song,</l>
               <l>To reap the Favours waited for so long.</l>
               <l>But to proceed, the Infant grows a-pace,</l>
               <l>When numerous Evils get upon his Chace, </l>
               <l>All fully Bent to crop him in the Bud,</l>
               <l>And spill his Name, his Fortune, and his Blood,</l>
               <l>The worst of all were in his Nature Bred, </l>
               <l>And thus the filly Creature is Betray'd:</l>
               <l>Some Friends he hath would fain his good Insure,</l>
               <l>Yet many ways his Evils they procure;</l>
               <l>But there is one whose Pow'r and Grace extends,</l>
               <l>Can save the Wretch, to whom we him Commend.</l>
               <l>The next we see advancing on the Stage</l>
               <l>Is vig'rous Youth all in his blooming Age;</l>

               <l>His Temper mild, and a rare Symmetry</l>

               <l>Come noble Youth, and waft along in Pleasure,</l>
               <l>Taste all delights without Restraint or Measure;</l>
               <l>But know these Favours are so dearly bought,</l>

He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Yes, and that it was the privilege of all the Saints in Glory, which they Improve according to the largeness of their Desires. I asked him if the Saints in Heaven knew what was acted on this Earth? He answered so much as concerns the Kingdom of </hi> Christ, <hi>and no more. I asked him if the Saints had a Prospect of Hell? He answered Yes, when they had a mind to. I asked him what the Pains of Death were? He answered to me, it was little or nothing, I was immediately Transmitted into Glory. I asked him how it seemed to the Soul to Exist without the Body? He answered there is nothing wanting, it feels no lack, but in some Respects it seems as tho' it had a Body, &amp; used the Tongue in ascribing Praises to</hi> God, <hi>and was Active in Worship. And then I awake and was Refreshed, thinking on my Dream, without any fear, or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable awe of Ghostly Death, but a tho' I had had a real Visit from a dear deceased Father, and Saint from Heaven,</hi>

               <l>O Help! Eternal Instant help Invoke,</l>
               <l>Ye Churches, least this heavy awful Stroke,</l>
               <l>Prove Insupportable to us Indeed,</l>
               <l>Which makes our Souls in tenderest Passions Bleed.</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Watts</hi> is set that Bright and Glorious star,</l>
               <l>Which oft conducted Strangers from a-far;</l>
               <l>To come by Faith, and view their Sav'ours Seat,</l>
               <l>And pay their humble Tribute at his Feet.</l>
               <l>Ye Heaven Born Souls, whom his Seraphic Lays,</l>
               <l>Has oft Inspir'd to shout your Makers Praise.</l>
               <l>Those sacred Reliques still your Minds engage,</l>
               <l>They shall Survive, to Bless from Age to Age.</l>
               <l>No Celebrated Mortal knew thy Worth,</l>
               <l>No Skill but such as thine, can set it Forth:</l>
               <l>And where can that be found but where thou art,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Gabriel</hi> now must act that friendly Part.</l>
               <l>And all the Golden Harps have full Employ,</l>
               <l>To Sing him Welcome, and to Magnify,</l>
               <l>Wisdom and Grace that caus'd a lump of Clay,</l>
               <l>T' inclose a Star of so Divine Array.</l>
               <l>To write his Character I never can,</l>
               <l>It so exceeds my Muse's narrow Plan.</l>
               <l>Nor will the noblest Bard's <hi>Hy-per-bo life,</hi>
