            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Conſiderations, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO employ the pitiful invention of tyrants to ſupport the freedom of republics——to introduce laws into the commonwealths of America, that have been long reprobated by wiſe and good men in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of Europe—to revive the exploded doctrine and practice of teſts—marks ſuch an extreme degree of folly, that one would imagine men of common underſtandings would endeavour to palliate the enormity of the act by the abolition of it, as ſoon as the cauſe which gave riſe to it had ceaſed to exiſt. Who, that had not conſulted the ſtatutes of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, would believe that in a country, that had been for upwards of a century the ſeat of liberty, ſcience and religion, a law ſhould exiſt, that deprived nearly one half of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the privileges of citizens; and this too in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year after the peace, which confirmed the liberties and independence of America?</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to make any remarks upon this law, I beg leave to inſert the following copy of the teſt.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>By the act of October 1, 1779, all male white inhabitants of the ſtate, who had not taken the teſt required by the act of June 13, 1777, in due time, were required to take the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018770_0003_0FA81AF04A714378"/>
foregoing oath or affirmation within certain limited times, viz. in Cumberland, Bedford, Northumberland and Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on or before the firſt day of December next enſuing; in Lancaſter, York, Berks and Northampton, within thirty-five days after the paſſing of ſaid act; and in the city of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and in the counties of Philadelphia, Bucks and Cheſter, within twenty days after the paſſing thereof—other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be incapable of electing or being elected into, or hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any office or place of truſt within the government, ſerving on juries, or keeping ſchools, except in private houſes.— After the times above ſpecified, they were for ever excluded from taking the oath or affirmation, and were deprived of the privileges and benefits of a citizen who complied with the ſaid act.</p>
            <p>The firſt objection that I ſhall make to this law is, that it is contrary to the principles of free government. Liberty conſiſts in being governed by laws made by ourſelves, or by rulers choſen by ourſelves. This is the true definition of liberty. The men who are disfranchiſed by this law are, therefore, in a ſtate of ſlavery. Repreſentation and taxation ſhould go hand in hand. If this is not true, the late glorious revolution was a rebellion.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. This law (if, after what follows, it deſerves the name of a law) is contrary to the conſtitution of the ſtate. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is the palladium of the liberty of a free country. It is the rule of legiſlators, as laws are the rule of the people whom they govern. Every part of a conſtitution ſhould be ſacred, and hence the conſtitution of Pennſylvania requires, that every member of the Aſſembly, before he takes his ſeat, ſhould ſubſcribe the following oath: <q>I do ſwear or affirm, that, as a member of this Aſſembly, I will not propoſe or aſſent to any bill, vote or reſolution, which ſhall appear to me injurious to the people, nor do or conſent to any act or thing whatever, that ſhall have a tendency to leſſen or abridge their rights and privileges, as declared in the conſtitution of this ſtate; but will in all things conduct myſelf as a faithful, honeſt repreſentative and guardian of the people, according to the beſt of my judgment and abilities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſays the teſt law? It is certainly an "abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment" of the privileges of nearly one half the inhabitants of the ſtate. It is contrary to the 7th and 8th articles of the bill of rights, and to the 6th and 17th ſections of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which declare <q>That all elections ought to be free, and that all freemen having a <hi>ſufficient common intereſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:018770_0004_0FA81AF0CE556348"/>
and <hi>attachment</hi> to the ſtate, have a right to elect officers, and to be elected into office. That every member of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and <hi>property,</hi> and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield her perſonal ſervice when neceſſary, or an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent thereto</hi>
               </q> (which the non-jurors have done by their double taxes and militia fines) <q>But <hi>no part</hi> of a man's <hi>property</hi> can be juſtly taken from him, or applied to public uſes, without <hi>his own conſent,</hi> or that of his <hi>legal</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Every freeman of the full age of twenty-one years, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſided in this ſtate for the ſpace of one whole year next before the day of election for repreſentatives, and paid public taxes during that time, ſhall <hi>enjoy the right of an elector.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Repreſentation in proportion to the number of taxable inhabitants is the only principle which can at all times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liberty, and make the voice of a <hi>majority of the people</hi> the law of the land.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But further—the conſtitution ſays, <q>In all proſecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by himſelf and his council, to demand the cauſe and nature of his accuſation, to be confronted with the witneſſes, to call for evidence in his favor, and a ſpeedy public trial by an <hi>impartial jury of the country,</hi> without the unanimous conſent of which jury he <hi>cannot be found guilty.</hi>
               </q>—Bill of rights, article 9th.</p>
            <p>Now, if a man cannot be convicted of the moſt trifling offence, except by a jury of twelve men, why ſhould he be deprived of his liberty by an act of the legiſlature? This ſummary mode of inflicting puniſhments is contrary to all our ideas of a free government. I am perſuaded, that if nine out of ten of the non-jurors in Pennſylvania were to be tried by a jury of twelve of thoſe men, who paſſed the law of October 1, 1778, or who approved of it in the Council of Cenſors, or who now continue it in force, by refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it, that they would be pronounced not guilty, and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the rights of citizenſhip. Hence ariſes the ſafety and the ineſtimable value of that mode of trial. I honor the Cenſors for that conſtruction of the conſtitution, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Judges and Magiſtrates independent of the power of the Aſſembly, and amenable only to a tribunal of twelve men.— But is the character of a Judge or a Magiſtrate of more conſequence than the freedom of two-fifths of a ſtate?—
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018770_0005_0FA81AF1558BDA98"/>
Shall juries determine in the one caſe, and the Aſſembly in the other?—I cannot conceive of an idea more repugnant to the principles and honor of the late revolution, than an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly taking away the liberties of ſeveral thouſand citizens, without the formality of a fair and impartial trial. Had theſe men committed any crime? No. Had they created inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in any part of the ſtate? No. Why then ſhould we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the heavieſt of all puniſhments upon them—not baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—not death—but SLAVERY.</p>
            <p>Excluſive of the natural prejudices which many people have againſt oaths of abjuration and allegiance in the time of war, there are two objections to the preſent teſt, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevented its being taken by many people. It is an oath requiring <hi>activity</hi> in ſupport of the independence of America. This could not be taken by thoſe ſects of chriſtians who hold war to be unlawful, at a time when <hi>arms</hi> were the only means of ſupporting our independence. And 2dly. the oath had a retroſpect to paſt actions. This was both impolitic and tyrannical. There was a progreſs in the minds of moſt men upon the ſubject of the late controverſy. Some were rouſed into reſiſtance by the apprehenſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant danger, while others did not decide in our favor, till they were undeceived by witneſſing Britiſh perfidy and barbarity. Now this law cut off all ſuch recruits to the American ſtandard, many of whom, in our ſiſter ſtates, have been the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and active foes to Great-Britain. But again—the law impoſed reſtraints upon the conſciences of thoſe whoſe wiſhes were favorable to the cauſe of America from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Could the whig, whom fear, or the citizen, whom age, or ſickneſs, or poverty, detained in the route or ſociety of the enemy, and who was compelled by contributions of proviſions, manufactures or quarters, indirectly "to aid, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and abet the king of Great-Britain, &amp;c." ſubſcribe this teſt? No; he could not. Why then ſhould perſons in this predicament be deprived of the privileges of citizens?</p>
            <p>The limitation of the time given for taking this oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes a material part of its folly and injuſtice. It was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle year of the war, at a time when its duration and iſſue were uncertain. It was a ſtroke that ſevered one of the ſinews of the ſlate. What ſhould we think of part of a crew in a leaky ſhip, in the middle of the Atlantic, who, out of reſentment to one half their ſhip's company for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take their turn at the pump for one night, ſhould ſwear, that at no time during the remaining part of the voyage they ſhould take their turn at the pump, even though
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018770_0006_0FA81AF2173DE3E0"/>
they repented of their negligence, and ſhewed a diſpoſition afterwards to ſhare in the toils or danger of the voyage? Certainly we ſhould blame ſuch conduct. But juſt ſo has the ſtate of Pennſylvania acted towards a great body of her citizens during the late war.</p>
            <p>The preſent teſt law was paſſed at a time when news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, the vehicles of our laws, had a partial circulation thro' the ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">The law for the gradual Abolition of Slavery, paſſed March 1, 1780, allowed <hi>ſix</hi> months for all ſuch perſons as owned Slaves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter them, otherwiſe, after the expiration of that time, they were to be free. Notwithſtanding the intereſt all Slave-holders had in complying with this law, yet we find many hundreds of them loſt their ſlaves from their ignorance of it. Some of theſe Slave-holders lived within 12 miles of the city of Philadelphia. The news papers at that time circulated only in the city.</note> It was paſſed too at a time when there were but few Magiſtrates, and thoſe ſo remotely ſituated, that it was in ſome caſes difficult, and in moſt expenſive, to gain acceſs to them. From theſe two cauſes, I am perſuaded, there are ſeveral thouſand non-jurors in Pennſylvania, among whom are may valuable whigs. I could mention ſome of theſe, who are officers in the militia, and who have never declined duty or danger in the ſervice of their country.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. The teſt law is highly <hi>impolitic.</hi> Monteſquieu (whoſe writings are oracular in all free countries) ſays, that "men who enjoy more, or who poſſeſs leſs liberty than the reſt of a community, are always the enemies of the liberty of that community."</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to conceive what muſt be the ſentiments of the non-jurors, by aſking ourſelves what our feelings would be in their ſituation. If they are not the enemies of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—if they do not with hold their contributions to the commerce and agriculture of the ſtate—if they do not ſicken at its proſperity, and rejoice in its misfortunes—if they do not refuſe to pay taxes—in a word, if they do not hate their uſurpers and maſters—it is becauſe a great majority of them are under the influence of principles, which render them as much the objects of affection and admiration to wiſe and good men, as they are the ſubjects of hatred and oppreſſion of our government.</p>
            <p>It is incumbent upon a free people, to guard againſt the contagion of ſlavery. Sights of diſtreſs, unrelieved, always harden the heart. Slaves living among freemen will gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leſſen the horrors of ſlavery, and the charms of liberty.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018770_0007_0FA81AF2F8B833E0"/>
Beſides, who knows how long theſe people may endure their ſituation with patience?</p>
            <p>Lord Chatham repealed the American ſtamp-act, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that "three millions of people, reduced to a ſtate of ſlavery in America, would be fit inſtruments for enſlaving the whole of the Britiſh empire." Two-fifths of the inhabitants of Pennſylvania may ſoon acquire ſuch a majority, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their arts or their wealth, as to enſlave the reſt of the ſtate. It has been thought, that the preſent race of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh kings have been made more arbitrary, by transferring the habits of government acquired in Hanover to the Britiſh empire. The ſame men who rule ſlaves, ſhould never make a law for freemen. The abſolute maſters of the lives and properties of the non-jurors, are dangerous legiſlators in a free country.</p>
            <p>Friends and Fellow-citizens, think what you are doing, when you inſtruct your rulers to continue the preſent teſt-law. The power of the ſtate will not divide, ſo as to gratify you all. Moſt of you will probably never riſe beyond the ſurface of private life. Why, then, ſhould you riſque your <hi>own</hi> liberty, without the leaſt chance of deriving any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from taking away the liberties of <hi>other</hi> people? Extend liberty to your neighbours, as you wiſh to preſerve your own. Liberty differs from almoſt every thing elſe that is precious, in this, that the more your neighbours poſſeſs of it, the more you will enjoy yourſelves.</p>
            <p>From the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, which admits fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to a vote after one year's reſidence, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the teſt law is big with evils of a moſt alarming na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The government, in a few years, muſt neceſſarily fall into other hands. Men with European ideas of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſoon occupy the ſeats of our preſent rulers. The Britiſh farmer, who paid his proportion of taxes to carry on the late war againſt us, and even the Britiſh officer, who aſſiſted in deſolating our country, will in a little while, by means of the votes of their countrymen, ſupplant the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican patriot and ſoldier, who purchaſed our freedom with their fortunes or ſcars.</p>
            <p>Rome was undone by ſtrangers getting her government into their hands, and introducing foreign prejudices, cuſtoms and vices among them. If our conſtitution cannot be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let us remedy that defect in it, by admitting the non-jurors to a ſhare in the government, in order to balance the undue and dangerous weight of foreigners. The non-jurors are attached to our ſoil by birth, education and property,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018770_0008_0FA81AF5B3EC6390"/>
and (if they can be permitted) are willing to add to theſe ties, the more ſacred tie of an oath or affirmation of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. Theſe men can have no intereſt unconnected with our own. Born under the protection of the ſame laws with ourſelves, educated in the ſame ſchools, and connected with us by the ancient ties of friendſhip and buſineſs, they are our natural friends and fellow-citizens. Our liberties, and the conſtitution of the ſtate, will therefore be ſafe in their hands.</p>
            <p>By the ninth ſection of the teſt law, a non-juror cannot ſerve on juries. This is an evil likewiſe, which has produced great miſchief and danger to the ſtate. It throws an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal ſhare of the burden of government upon the jurors. It delays, and thereby increaſes, the expences of Courts, both to individuals and the ſtate. It moreover renders property leſs ſecure, and the deciſions of jurors leſs ſatisfactory, by obliging the Sheriffs, in ſome inſtances, to drag jurymen into courts, who are not qualified, by knowledge or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to decide upon the liberties or property of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>But there are other conſiderations which ſhould have great weight with us, in perſuading us to reviſe our teſt-law. The Court of Britain is unfriendly to us. Her power and intereſt in foreign Courts are employed to traduce our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and forms of government. The Monarchs of Europe are collecting anecdotes of our country, by means of their emiſſaries, in order to check the emigrations of their ſubjects, by holding up the miſeries and diſtraction of our republics. Nor is this all. There is ſuch a thing as emulation without jealouſy, and contention without ſtrife. Our ſiſter ſtates have manifeſted both towards us ever ſince the declaration of independence. They are bending their whole force to rival and ſupplant us in trade, ſea-ports, and inland navigation. Several of them have already become reſpectable from their <hi>union.</hi> They bring the minds of their citizens to a focus in all their laws. It is only by healing our diviſions, that we ſhall diſappoint our foreign enemies, and it is only by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every member of the ſtate equally free and happy, that we ſhall recover our ancient pre-eminence, as a ſtate, in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, commerce, wealth and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Once more. The public debt contracted by the late war is ſtill unfunded. Whether it will be funded upon a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental impoſt, or upon ſtate taxes, is ſtill uncertain. But can it be expected that the non-jurors will pay their proportion of taxes, which amounts to two-thirds of the whole, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018770_0009_0FA81AF72F015728"/>
either way, while they are unrepreſented in our legiſlature? It is true, there is a compelling power in government—But tax-gatherers themſelves have contracted ſo much of the ſpirit of the peace, that they revolt at the idea of ſeizing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty for taxes. Beſides, every one knows how eaſy it is to delay for years the payment of taxes, without refuſing them; and yet theſe delays materially affect the credit and intereſt of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>Again. The exigencies of the ſtate have been ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire paper money. To introduce this money into general circulation, and to ſupport its credit, the concurrence of every member of the ſtate, who handles money, is abſolutely neceſſary. Now, the non-jurors compoſe a large proportion of the merchants, millers and traders of the ſtate, who, it is well known, are that body of people who give money its greateſt circulation. Can it be expected, that theſe men will receive this money? Can it be expected, that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to relieve the diſtreſſes of men who enſlave them, or keep up the credit of a government, in which they have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt? If they do—they muſt be more, or leſs, than men.</p>
            <p>The duties of the war have nearly worn out the jurors. It is high time to call upon every citizen of the ſtate, who is qualified by education or virtue, to bear his part of the drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of government. While the jurors are ſerving their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the Aſſembly, upon juries, and in all the offices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the collection of taxes, the ſupport of the poor, and the care of the public roads, the non-jurors are engaged in the purſuits of private intereſt, and amaſſing wealth, the weight of which can never, in their preſent circumſtances, be thrown into the ſcale of government. It becomes us to conſider what the conſequences may be, of their throwing it into the ſcale that is <hi>oppoſed</hi> to our government.</p>
            <p>Every body complains of the difficulty of borrowing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at the legal intereſt. The Bank has been accuſed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of this difficulty, but without foundation; for the difficulty was the ſame as it is at preſent before the inſtitution of the Bank. The true cauſe of this difficulty is to be ſought for in the teſt-law. The principal part of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the ſtate is in the hands of non-jurors; for they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs two thirds, or perhaps more, of the <hi>productive</hi> property of Pennſylvania. Now, can it be expected that theſe men will lend money upon intereſt, when they have no ſhare in our government, when they have no vote to protect them againſt the operation of a tender law, and no ſecurity againſt being precluded from recovering their debts by the ordinary courſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018770_0010_0FA81AF760D10FE0"/>
of juſtice? I am not ſurprized at ſome of theſe people hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately remitted their caſh to Europe, and lodged it there, at an intereſt <hi>below</hi> the legal intereſt of our ſtate.</p>
            <p>Every view we can take of the teſt-law, ſerves only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our apprehenſions from it to the liberties and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>I ſhould like to believe that human nature was improving, from the lights which religion, ſcience, and the principles of liberty, have diffuſed over the world. But I am afraid that mankind, in different ages, only change their vices and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. In vain do we boaſt of the toleration of all religious ſects in our government, while we perſecute for <hi>opinions</hi> in politics. The ſame ſpirit which excludes theſe ſects from the privileges of citizens, would probably revive the days of Archbiſhop Laud among us, if religious tenets were equal obſtacles to the power of the ſtate, with the reviſion of the teſt-law.</p>
            <p>But I will go further.—The principal part of the non-jurors are Quakers, Menoniſts, Swingfielders and Moravians, all of whom are <hi>principled</hi> againſt war. The teſt-law, in its preſent form, therefore, is an invaſion of the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a direct act of perſecution for conſcience ſake. It is a violation of the ſecond article of the Bill of Rights, which ſays—<q>Nor can any man, who acknowledges the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, be juſtly deprived of any <hi>civil right</hi> as a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, on account of his religious ſentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worſhip.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I know it has been ſaid, that many of theſe people were tories during the war. If they were after the paſſing of the law, I ſhould not have been ſurprized at it. For as they ſaw ſlavery before them in the journals of Pennſylvania, as well as in the records of the Britiſh Parliament, I do not wonder that they preferred foreign to domeſtic tyrants.</p>
            <p>But I deny that this was the caſe. I believe that a greater proportion of active whigs are to be found among them, than of tories. A great majority of them were neutrals, and ſome of theſe ſo extremely ignorant of the nature of the controverſy, and of the events of the war, as to enquire, when they heard of the victories or defeats of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, to which ſide they belonged." Compare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our non-jurors with the conduct of the tories in our ſiſter ſtates. Have we ever heard of a ſingle inſurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? Did thoſe of them, who remained in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in the year 1777 and 8, addreſs the commanding offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Britiſh army? What proportion of new levies
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018770_0011_0FA81AF8AF5A5080"/>
did they draw from our populous ſtate? While New-Jerſey furniſhed them with ſix regiments, and North-Carolina lent them one third of their ſtate, they were never able to muſter more than 120 recruits in Pennſylvania. The ſpirit of the non-jurors was hoſtile to nothing but war. They opened their houſes alike to the officers of the Britiſh and American armies. Their agriculture fed our army, their taxes were at all times three-fourths of the whole contributions of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, and their arts furniſhed a large proportion of thoſe manufactures which cloathed our ſoldiers. In a temple ſo glorious as the fabric of liberty, erected by means of the late war, the moſt trifling ſervice performed to the building ſhould not be forgotten. If thanks are not due, certainly toleration is, to every man who ploughed a furrow, or ſhod a horſe, for the benefit of the American army.</p>
            <p>How diſhonorable to Pennſylvania, after comparing the conduct of our non-jurors with the conduct of the tories in our ſiſter ſtates, that Pennſylvania is the only ſtate in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that has not reviſed or repealed her teſt-laws! Even in North and South-Carolina, where many of the tories car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried arms, the whigs have ſhewed the magnanimity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as well as the ſpirit of liberty and wiſe government, by admitting every man to equal privileges in their ſtates.</p>
            <p>The Quakers were the original inhabitants of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. They encountered all the hardſhips of ſettling on bare creation. They diſcovered a new art of ſubduing ſavages, by the integrity of their intercourſe with them. To their wiſdom, induſtry and benevolence, Pennſylvania, for half a century, owed all her fame and happineſs. Look at the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compoſed by the founder of the province, and examine the laws that were paſſed by the Quakers, while they poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the power of Pennſylvania. In neither of them is a ſingle article or ſection to be found, which abridges any man of the rights of conſcience. The power and offices of the province were open alike to men of every nation and ſect, with themſelves. When Maſſachuſetts-Bay refuſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a crew of diſtreſſed Iriſh emigrants even to land up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſhores, Pennſylvania opened her arms to receive them. When a body of Germans met with unexpected diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, after landing in New-York, the Quakers gave them protection, and thus afforded encouragement for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their countrymen to follow them to this land of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Humanity would drop a tear, if the ſucceſſors or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of theſe men ſhould be found to be among the moſt violent in oppoſing the reviſion of the teſt-law, and thereby
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018770_0012_0FA81AF8E1BA2BA8"/>
of reſtoring the Quakers to the dignity and happineſs of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—But further,—ſuppoſe we ſhould diſcover a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of thoſe people, who are oppoſed to the reviſion of the teſt-law, to have alternately ſworn allegiance to King George, and the ſtate of Pennſylvania, according as the arms of the one or the other prevailed during the late war. I am able to produce a liſt of the names of theſe people, and of the days on which they were transferred, backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to their different maſters. Do you think, my friends, to cancel your guilt in theſe tranſactions, by perſecuting the non-jurors? They certainly acted an honeſt part, compared with the part you have acted. They deceived neither party. America never counted them among the number of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, nor did General Howe ever tranſmit their names to the Secretary of State, as converts from rebellion to royalty.</p>
            <p>I cannot help introducing a remark upon the teſt-law of Pennſylvania, in which it differs from the teſt-laws of Great-Britain and Ireland. By the former, the door of office and power ſtands conſtantly open to the diſſenters from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church. By the latter, all the privileges of freemen are offered to the Catholics, upon their abjuring the doctrines of the Church of Rome. All the powers and arts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been employed to force theſe teſts upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Here there was a mixture of miſtaken benevolence with tyranny. But the teſt-law of Pennſylvania holds out nothing but unmixed tyranny and perſecution. It bars the door for ever againſt repentance and converſion. It proclaims perpetual war againſt uniformity in government, and thus renders the ſtandard of diſcord the true arms of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>There is another compariſon of the teſt-law, which places it, if poſſible, in a more odious light. It is with the law for aboliſhing ſlavery, paſſed March 1, 1780.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit and letter of the conſtitution are preſerved by this law. It does not admit free Negroes, it is true, to the privilege of voting, but then it exempts them from taxes A free Negroe is in a ſafer and more honorable ſituation in Pennſylvania, than a Quaker who has not ſubmitted to the teſt-law. This fact ſhould excite the more diſtreſs and ſhame, when we recollect, that it was the example and publications of the people called Quakers, that diſſeminated thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equal liberty and humanity thro' the ſtate, which at laſt produced that excellent law for the gradual abolition of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>I know it has been urged, that if the non-jurors are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their rights, they will combine, and reſtore the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018770_0013_0FA81AF996DBE208"/>
ſtate back to Great-Britain. The men who urge this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reviſion of the teſt-law certainly do not believe it. The paſſive principles of the non-jurors forbid it.—Can it be poſſible, that ſocieties, whom neither the threats nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of the principal officers of the Britiſh army in the year 1777, after they had conquered the city of Philadelphia, could prevail upon to contribute a ſingle act of friendſhip to them, or of hoſtility againſt the Americans, can be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to diſturb the peace of a ſettled government, in order to bring about a re-union with Great-Britain? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe revolts at the idea.</p>
            <p>Equally abſurd and groundleſs is the fear, that the non-jurors will repeal the law for puting an end to proprietary influence in Pennſylvania. Who began and continued the controverſies with the late Proprietaries about quitrents?— The Quakers. Who oppoſed them in all thoſe incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and exactions, which have lately been pointed out in one of the reports of the Council of Cenſors?—The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Who attempted to reſcue the ſtate from the dominion of the proprietary family in the year 1764, and to place it under the protection of the Crown?—The Quakers. Is it poſſible, that theſe people can ſo far forget their antient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and principles, as to revive a power which they ſo long reprobated, checked and oppoſed? I would as ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Hannibal lived and died in friendſhip with the Romans.</p>
            <p>I was ſorry to hear an argument againſt the reviſion of the teſt-law made uſe of in the Aſſembly, in September laſt, which was exploded in our controverſy with Great-Britain. We were told, "that the non-jurors were <hi>virtually</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented." This mode of repreſentation was proved, in the years 1773 and 1774, to be virtual nonſenſe. What is there to prevent a non-juror from being doubly taxed?—Nothing. Who can plead his cauſe in the Aſſembly?—No one. He holds his property—nay more, the <hi>remains</hi> of his liberty, and even his life, at the <hi>mercy</hi> of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>But, as an apology for the continuance of the teſt-law, we are told, that the non-jurors do not wiſh to have it reviſed or repealed. If this be true, the ſtate of Pennſylvania is in the laſt ſtage of political indiſpoſition. A phyſician always puts on a ſerious countenance, when a diſeaſed limb loſes its power of feeling. The whole body, when this is the caſe, is in danger. If two-fifths of the ſtate are reconciled to ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the remaining three-fifths hold their liberty by a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tenure. But I deny that the non-jurors are ſatisfied
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018770_0014_0FA81AFA54713EF0"/>
with their preſent ſituation. They complain loudly ſince the peace, and expreſs the utmoſt anxiety to enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of freemen. Their patient ſubmiſſion to the teſt-law during the war, aroſe from their diſinclination to ſhare in government, while it was compelled to employ its forces in a buſineſs that was foreign to their principles.</p>
            <p>There is one more motive, I cannot call it an argument, in favor of the continuance of the preſent teſt-law. It has been ſaid that the jurors, by defending the ſtate with arms, have acquired an excluſive right to the power of it. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, I might only ſay, that dominion founded in arms, or rather in <hi>oaths,</hi> (for the moſt violent of the jurors never bore arms, except on muſter-days) is as abſurd as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion founded in grace. But I beg leave to aſk the people who urge this motive for continuing the teſt-law, whether any one of them ever performed a tour of duty, or rendered any eſſential ſervice to the ſtate, without being <hi>paid</hi> for it?— and whether the money which paid them did not come chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the pockets of the non-jurors?—Yes. Aſk the tax-gatherers, and they will tell you that <hi>two-thirds</hi> of all the effective taxes that have been collected ſince the year 1779 have come from the non-jurors.—They will tell you further, that they have been collected with the leaſt murmuring and the moſt punctuality from theſe people. Now, if money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the ſinews of war, then the non-jurors have ſuſtained a material part of the weight of the late revolution in the ſtate of Pennſylvania. To their induſtry and arts, the ſtate owed a great part of the ſupplies which ſupported the continental army for ſeveral years; and to their taxes, chiefly, ſhe owes the pre-eminence which ſhe enjoys over her ſiſter ſtates in the Continental Treaſury. But again,—if this motive is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the power of the ſtate is to be founded in whiggiſm, or arms, then a preference ſhould certainly be given to thoſe men, who have done and ſuffered moſt for the ſtate. Theſe men, every one muſt acknowledge, are the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Pennſylvania line. No claſs of citizens, I am ſure, will reprobate this idea more ſincerely than thoſe officers and ſoldiers themſelves. To their immortal honor let it be recorded, that they are almoſt to a man ſtrenuous advocates for equal liberty to every member of the ſtate. They have long ago forgiven and forgotten the inſults of the diſaffected, and the neutrality of the non-jurors. This conduct will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey their names with infinitely more honor to poſterity, than all the inſignia of the order of Cincinnatus.</p>

Guſtavus Vaſa recovered the throne of Sweden with a handful of men, recruited in a ſingle day in the province of Dalcarlia. Not more than one fourth part of the inhabitants of England took part in the civil war between King Charles and his parliament.

            <p>In our ideas of tyranny, we are too apt to ſuppoſe that it can be derived only from monarchy or ariſtocracy.

            <p>An induſtrious man, with frugality, who pays his taxes punctually, is at all times a valuable member of a republic.</p>
            <p>A man who manufactures and ſells more than he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, adds to the wealth and proſperity of his country.</p>
            <p>A man with good morals, who peaceably ſubmits to ſuch laws of his country as are not againſt the dictates of his conſcience, let his political and religious principles be ever ſo erroneous, is a better citizen than a man of diſſolute morals, with the pureſt principles in religion, and the freeſt in government.</p>
            <p>The non-jurors in Pennſylvania are in general an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, frugal, temperate body of people. Whatever their political principles may be, they are for the moſt part genuine republicans in dreſs and manners. If they have erred—nay more, if they have ſinned during the late war, we ſhall conſult the freedom and proſperity of the ſtate by forgiving them. If we are wiſe, we ſhall do more—we ſhall protect and cheriſh them, as the ſureſt reſources of the wealth and independence of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>If the enemies to the reviſion of the teſt-law believe in the divine authority of the ſcriptures, I would beg leave to recommend to their ſerious conſideration thoſe paſſages in the old teſtament, which contain ſuch terrible accounts of the judgments of God againſt oppreſſors. But if theſe examples are ſuppoſed not to apply in modern times, let
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018770_0017_0FA81AFD5AC5B6C8"/>
them conſult the writings of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. In every page of theſe, they will find principles and precepts repugnant to the ſpirit of the teſt-law.— Where is the man that can lay his hand on his heart, and ſay, that, by depriving the non-jurors of the right of ſuffrage, "he does to others, as he would have them, in like circumſtances, do to him?"—The words of our Saviour, in his ſermon upon the mount, are calculated to beget forgiveneſs, by motives of the moſt intereſting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. "If ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes."—Mat. vi. 14.</p>
            <p>If there are any men who perſevere in enforcing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the teſt law, after this quotation, I have only to recommend to them not to repeat the Lord's Prayer, in their addreſſes to their Maker. It will be an inſult upon the Majeſty of Heaven, to aſk for the forgiveneſs of any one ſin, while they refuſe to forgive their leſs offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brethren.</p>
            <p>I paſs over the diſputes, delays and frauds, which the teſt-law has introduced at elections in moſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſtate. I take no notice likewiſe of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpretations which have been given of this law by different parties, in their deciſions upon controverted elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe things have for ſeveral years excited di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, ſhame, and the moſt painful apprehenſions in the breaſts of every lover of Pennſylvania. TAXES, and a peaceable ſubmiſſion to all ſuch laws as are not contrary to the dictates of conſcience, ſhould always be conſidered as the morality of citizenſhip. To connect the right of ſuffrage with a certificate of an oath, or the records of a Magiſtrate's office, without appealing to the Aſſeſſors books, is as abſurd, as it would be for a man to plead his title to the kingdom of Heaven, by producing at the Supreme Tribunal nothing but a regiſter of his baptiſm.</p>
            <p>It muſt afford the livelieſt pleaſure to a truly good man, to contemplate the effects of the late peace upon the human mind. The Britiſh and American ſoldier now meet as friends, and talk over with pleaſure the ſcenes of diſtreſs and danger, in which they oppoſed each other in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018770_0018_0FA81AFE17A836A0"/>
the field. The Britiſh and American merchant exchange commodoties with each other, and mutually contribute towards each other's wealth and happineſs. The Britiſh and American ſailor now hail each other on the deſerts of the ocean, and kindly relieve each other's wants and diſtreſſes. The inflexible whig, and the once obſtinate tory, now meet in the ſame legiſlature in the ſouthern and eaſtern ſtates—tranſact buſineſs in the ſame committees— and vie with each other in their exertions to ſupport the intereſts and independence of their reſpective ſtates. Even the Indian ſavage meets the American Commiſſioner at the ſame Council fire, ſmokes with him the ſame pipe, and buries his hatchet, with the reſentment of his former ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in the ſame grave. In a word—we every where hear the echo of the ſong of the Angels at the birth of our Saviour, "Peace on earth, and good will to man." Every thing breathes reconciliation and brotherly love—except the teſt law of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>I cannot help adding a thought here, which I am ſure will have weight with all good men.</p>
            <p>The preſent feeble and partial operation of the goſpel in the world renders wars not only unavoidable, but <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi> But if we believe in the propheſies of the Old and New Teſtaments, we muſt look for a time, when the inſtruments of war ſhall be converted into the implements of huſbandry, and when the pacific principles of the goſpel ſhall ſo far change the tempers and manners of mankind, that even the beaſts of prey ſhall learn from the human ſpecies to put off their ſavage natures, and to live in harmony with each other.</p>
            <p>In what manner this revolution (ſo long and ſo devoutly expected) ſhall be brought about in the moral world, we know not,—but moſt probably it will be by <hi>natural</hi> means, and by cauſes of a <hi>progreſſive</hi> operation. Who knows whether thoſe ſects of Chriſtians, who ſo uniformly and ſteadily bear a teſtimony againſt war, may not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divine Providence as the receptacles of thoſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful principles, which are finally to prevail over the whole
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018770_0019_0FA81AFF080BDC38"/>
earth? Who knows, whether Heaven has not intended the progreſs of theſe principles to be <hi>gradual?</hi> Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we know, was once propagated gradually from the little province of Judea, by a few fiſhermen, over every civilized part of the globe. The ſeeds of the reformation were ſowed in England by Wickliffe, in the year 1362, nearly two hundred years before they ſpread themſelves through every part of the nation. But we have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the progreſſive operation of juſt principles within the compaſs of our own knowledge, that applies directly to the caſe in queſtion. It is ſcarcely forty years, ſince a few men in Pennſylvania, who were branded as enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, firſt bore a teſtimony againſt the ſlavery of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. Theſe principles ſpread gradually, and in the courſe of a few years were adopted as part of the ſyſtem of doctrines of the people called Quakers. From them, and by their induſtry, they have been propagated, by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> means, through all the middle and eaſtern ſtates of America. Pennſylvania has done homage to them in her ſovereign and legiſlative capacity. The ſlaves of the ſouthern ſtates feel a pleaſure, when the name of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania ſounds in their ears; and even the native African has learned to except our ſtate, from the execrations he pronounces againſt Chriſtian tyrants and man-thieves. Theſe principles of <hi>equal</hi> liberty have not ſtopped in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. They are travelling along the Cheſapeake, and have found advocates on the banks of Aſhley and Cooper rivers, in South-Carolina. In a few years they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have their full operation upon the minds of our ſouthern brethren, and produce laws for the abolition of ſlavery ſimilar to our own. Now, may not the pacific principles of the Quakers be propagated in the ſame manner, and with the ſame ſucceſs, as their principles with reſpect to the ſlavery of the Negroes? In order to favor the propagation and operation of theſe pacific prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, it certainly becomes us to admit theſe people, in the time of peace, to a ſhare in our government. War is the buſineſs of ſavages. It begets vice and debt in all
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018770_0020_0FA81AFF8EDBFC50"/>
civilized nations. It is agreeable to monarchs, becauſe they derive their glory and an encreaſe of power from it. But PEACE is the buſineſs and intereſt of republics. It favors liberty, promotes induſtry, and is the parent of all political happineſs. I do not wiſh to conſider the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ocean as the barrier of our benevolence, when we wiſh for perpetual peace, but I maintain that the love and ſpirit of peace are abſolutely neceſſary for the ſafety and proſperity of the United States. Thoſe men will make the wiſeſt legiſlators for America, who oppoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes by negociation, and decide diſputes by arbitration. In the preſent feeble ſtate of the confederation, I conceive there is nothing left to us, to render the union of the ſtates perpetual, but to call into our aid, in every way that we can, the pacific principles of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Freemen of Pennſylvania, conſider what you are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The nations of Europe are watching to ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by adopting republican forms of government, we have added to, or diminiſhed, the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The next ſeven years, more than the laſt ſeven years, will determine their conduct, whether it will be beſt to aſſert their freedom, or to prefer a leſs evil to a greater, by ſubmitting to the tyranny of monarchical government. The fate and liberty of the world, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, are now ſuſpended by our example. If we trample on the firſt principles of juſt government—if we violate the moſt ſacred parts of our conſtitutions—if we enforce laws that are impolitic and inhuman—we ſtrengthen the chains of ſlavery in Europe—we defeat the ſchemes of thoſe benefactors of mankind, who are now ſtriving, by their writings, to ſhake the thrones of tyranny, and thus check the laſt efforts of mankind, to reſtore human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to her natural and original dignity.</p>
            <p>I beg pardon, if, in the courſe of theſe conſiderations, I have ſaid any thing, that has offended thoſe members of the legiſlature who enacted the preſent teſt-law, or who, by refuſing to reviſe it in the two laſt ſeſſions of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018770_0021_0FA81B02642937A8"/>
Aſſembly, have continued it in force. The law was paſſed at a time when clouds and darkneſs covered the ſtate. The laſt year was devoted by the conſtitution to enquiries, that were calculated to awaken jealouſies, and inflame the paſſions. It is now ſunſhine, and the paſſions of the ſtate are again huſhed into repoſe. Let an act of amneſty then be paſſed in our minds, of all the errors that have been committed in government by parties and individuals. Let reconciliation, more refreſhing than the dew of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, deſcend upon our mountains, and let brotherly love, more fragrant than the ointment that was poured upon Aaron's head, flow down upon the ſkirts of the ſtate, and let us all once more embrace each other as friends and members of the ſame political family.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with the following obſervation:</p>
            <p>If neither a regard to the principles of free government, nor to our conſtitution—if neither policy nor humanity— if neither intereſt, nor a regard to the honor or ſafety of the ſtate—if the terrors of divine judgments recorded in the old, and the precepts of benevolence and mercy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the new teſtament—have no effect upon us in producing a reviſion of the teſt law—if a monopoly of the power of the ſtate is a more deſirable object with any body or ſect of our citizens, than the preſervation of its liberties—I beg leave to ſuggeſt to theſe people, that their ſchemes of ambition will certainly be diſappointed; for the teſt law muſt neceſſarily in a few years loſe its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The ſons of non-jurors, with the addition of the ſons of the moderate part of the jurors, increaſe in the ratio of three to one above the ſons of the preſent ruling party. Theſe will, in a few years, produce a new chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel for the power of the ſtate. But if human nature is the ſame in Pennſylvania, as it is in the other ſtates, the teſt-law will probably repeal itſelf in a much ſhorter time. However ſteady the luſt for power or offices may be in the leaders of a party, the party themſelves will not long be actuated by that principle. Parties, like individuals, when left to themſelves, ſoften, after the gratification of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018770_0022_0FA81B03DD4D8A88"/>
into moderation and gentleneſs. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and good offices produced among our citizens by means of commerce will naturally ſpread more and more every day, and thus revive ancient friendſhips and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections among us. The ſame men, who laſt year voted for Aſſemblymen to oppoſe the reviſion of the teſt-law, may probably reject them for continuing that law at the enſuing election.</p>
            <p>I do not wiſh to ſee ſuch frequent changes of our rulers, much leſs do I wiſh to ſee thoſe irremediable evils and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable animoſities take place in Pennſylvania, which muſt ſucceed the diſſolution of the law in the manner that has been mentioned. I can ſcarcely conceive of a more agreeable ſight, than an Aſſembly preferring what is <hi>juſt</hi> to what is <hi>popular</hi>—reſtoring the conſtitution of the ſtate to its original and true meaning in all its parts—burying in oblivion every cauſe of ſtrife—combining the ſtrength and affections of the ſtate into a focus—and, laſtly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to divide the power and offices of the ſtate equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among all ſocieties.</p>
            <p>Should the preſent Aſſembly yield to the voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reaſon and religion, and open the doors of freedom in Pennſylvania to all her children, by reviſing the teſt-law, they will acquire a pre-eminence for wiſdom over all their predeceſſors, and render their fame as extenſive, and their names as immortal, as it is now in their power to render the happineſs and proſperity of Pennſylvania.</p>
