            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>PARISHIONER.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, I am diſſatisfied with a part of your public conduct, and am come to open my mind freely to you, if you will be ſo kind as to allow me an opportunity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MINISTER.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am now at leiſure, and at your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and your honeſt frankneſs gives me pleaſure. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me alone to let me know the objections you have againſt any part of my conduct, is to act a friendly part. It is more kind and chriſtian-like, than to keep your thoughts to yourſelf, to engender a ſecret diſaffection in your heart.—It is much more friendly than to rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me behind my back, all round the pariſh. And you may be quite aſſured, that not only now, but in all future times, I ſhall with pleaſure liſten to any objections againſt my public adminiſtrations propoſed in a friendly, candid manner; and will be ready to be ſet right, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am wrong; or to let you know the reaſons of my conduct. For next to the light of God's countenance, and the approbation of my own conſcience, I prize the good opinion of my fellow-men: And particularly, I greatly prize the teſtimony of the conſciences of my own people in my behalf. To your conſcience, therefore, I am now willing to approve myſelf. Open your mind without the leaſt reſerve.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have lately moved into the pariſh; I had own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the covenant in the town I came from;—my other children have been baptized—we have now another child born; and I hear you refuſe to baptize the children of any but thoſe who are in full communion: This gives me pain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot give you pain, without feeling pain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But you would not deſire, that I ſhould go counter to the will of my Lord and Maſter, while acting in his Name, as his miniſter; nor would this be a likely means to obtain a bleſſing for your child. And if I am warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the goſpel of Chriſt to baptize your child, you are very ſenſible, my reputation, and every worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, will join to prompt me to it. You will eaſily make a convert of me to your opinion, if you can point out one text of ſcripture to juſtify that common practice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have not ſtudied the point. I cannot mention any text of ſcripture; but it is the cuſtom where I was born and brought up; and I knew not but that it was the cuſtom every where, 'till I moved into this pariſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, it is not the cuſtom every where; it was not the cuſtom where I was born and brought up; and there are many churches in the country, that are not in the practice. At the firſt ſettling of New-England, there was, ſo far as I know, not one church that allowed baptiſm to the children of any but thoſe whoſe parents were one or both in full communion. About 40 years after the firſt church was formed, this cuſtom was brought in by a Synod that met at Boſton 1662. Many miniſters and churches zealouſly oppoſed it at the time, and even to this day, the cuſtom is not become univerſal: And of late a conſiderable number of churches, who had adopted the practice, have laid it aſide. It is not practiſed at all in the church of Scotland, as I have been informed by a Rev. Gentleman of an eſtabliſhed reputation, who has lately been invited, and who has removed from thence, to the Preſidency of New-Jerſey College. And it is certain
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011172_0005_0F857FC23B0F6668"/>
the confeſſion of faith, catechiſms and directory of the church of Scotland, make no mention of it; Neither is the practice mentioned in the Say-Brook platform, which has been generally received by the churches in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut; for the council which met at Say-Brook, did not ſee cauſe to adopt that practice, although it had been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Synod at Boſton.—But if you had not ſtudied the point before you owned the covenant; and if you took it for granted, that it was right, merely from education, yet you are able to let me know in what views, and from what motives you owned the covenant: As I ſuppoſe you meant to act conſcientiouſly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>It was the common opinion that none ought to join in full communion, and come to the Lord's table, but thoſe that were godly, that had on a <hi>wedding garment, leſt coming unworthily, they eat and drink damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But it was thought that graceleſs perſons might own the covenant, and have their children baptized; and this was my opinion, and I acted on theſe principles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, and I ſuppoſe the generality of people in the country, that own the covenant, in theſe times, act on theſe principles: But it was not ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Synod in 1662, who firſt brought in the practice, were not in this ſcheme. It was known, and owned, and publicly declared on all hands, in the time of it; <q>That the Synod did acknowledge, that there ought to be true ſaving faith in the parent, according to the judgment of rational charity, or elſe the child ought not to be baptized. <note n="*" place="bottom">See a Defence of the Anſwer and Arguments of the Synod, &amp;c. againſt the Reply made by the Rev Mr. <hi>John Davenport,</hi> Paſtor of the Church at <hi>New Haven.</hi> Preface, pag. 23, 24.</note>

               <p>But, Sir, I am ſurpriſed! Is this true? Was this really the opinion of thoſe who firſt brought in this practice?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, it was indeed their opinion, if we may give credit to their own declarations. No man who was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011172_0006_0F857FC2DFAD96B0"/>
for this practice, was of more note than the Rev. Dr. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Mather, of Boſton, who was a member of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and afterwards wrote in defence of this practice; and no author can in more expreſs language declare his ſentiments. Theſe are his own words, in a pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A diſcourſe concerning the ſubject of Baptiſm, wherein the preſent Controverſies that are agitated in the New-England Churches are from ſcripture &amp; reaſon modeſtly enquired into,</hi> pag. 52, 53. <q>In the fifth place, it may be alledged, that the perſons in queſtion, either have to the judgment of charity, a juſtifying faith, or not. If not, they, and conſequently their children, are not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizable. If yea, then they are forthwith admittable to the Lord's ſupper.</q> Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. I do readily acknowledge, that as it is only a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith which giveth right to baptiſm before God; ſo it is the profeſſion or viſibility of this faith, that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth right thereunto before the church. Some have maintained that a <hi>dogmatical hiſtorical</hi> faith, or a faith of <hi>aſſent</hi> to the truth of the goſpel, doth entitle to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But the common proteſtant doctrine againſt the papiſts, ſpeaketh otherwiſe. Though a man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the holy ſcriptures ſay concerning God and Chriſt, yet if he doth not conſent with his heart, that this God ſhall be <hi>his God,</hi> and this Chriſt <hi>his Saviour,</hi> he hath not right to baptiſm in the ſight of God; or if he doth not <hi>profeſs</hi> ſuch a <hi>conſent,</hi> (which is implied in the proportion before us, when it is ſaid concerning the perſons in queſtion, that they <hi>gave up themſelves to the Lord</hi>) he cannot juſtly claim baptiſm. In moſt churches in the world, men own the creed, (called the Apoſtles) before baptiſm. Now therein they ſay, I believe [in] God, and not only I believe God, viz. with a faith of aſſent only in the underſtanding. Now to believe <hi>in</hi> God, implieth a <hi>conſent of the will,</hi> chooſing this God for my God. And conſidering that in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, there is a profeſſion of repentance for paſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011172_0007_0F857FC3B12D8210"/>
and an engagement to walk in newneſs of life for time to come, <hi>Mark</hi> i. 4.2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 9 And that it cometh in the room of circumciſion, which was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 11. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by remiſſion of ſins is ſealed, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 38. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is not promiſed to any faith but juſtifying; alſo that baptiſm is ſaid to ſave, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 21. And they that are baptized are ſaid to be in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 17. And to have communion with Chriſt in reſpect of his death and reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 12. I ſay, from theſe and many the like conſiderations, I am fully perſuaded that it is not a mere hiſtorical, but juſtifying faith which giveth right to baptiſm.</q>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But if this was in fact the caſe, I cannot conceive what room there was for the half-way covenant! For ſuch perſons might conſiſtently profeſs to comply with the whole covenant, and not ſtop half-way in practice, but come up to all ordinances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You are right in this obſervation. Perſons ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, who have been brought up under the light of the goſpel from their infancy, by pious parents, and godly miniſters, and now adult, and become godly themſelves, profeſſing and practiſing accordingly; are in a judgment of rational charity, as fit for the Lord's table, as to offer their children in baptiſm. Nor is it merely a privilege they may claim, to come to the Lord's ſupper along with their chriſtian brethren, and join with them in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the death of Chriſt; but it is their indiſpenſible duty. They are bound to do it by the expreſs command of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> xxii. 19. <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> And to neglect it, is practically to renounce the authority of Jeſus Chriſt. And is it right for miniſters to teach the diſciples of Chriſt to live in the breach of the leaſt of his commands?</p>

               <p>You may hear, for theſe are his words: (P. 54.)— <q>It will not follow that theſe perſons are immediately to be admitted to the Lord's table, or to the privileges of full communion. For <hi>more full and ſatisfactory eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of regeneration and of chriſtian proficiency, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in order to admiſſion to the Lord's table, than in order to baptiſm.</q> And if you will read <hi>Mather</hi>'s <hi>Magnalia,</hi> you will ſee, that they inſiſted on <hi>Initial grace</hi> in order to baptiſm, but ſuppoſed greater attainments neceſſary in order to the Lord's ſupper. But if that command of Chriſt is binding on weak chriſtians, who are indeed real chriſtians, <hi>Luk.</hi> xxii. 19. To ſay they are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lord's table, is to ſay, it is not lawful they ſhould obey the command of Chriſt. So this half-way-covenant while it teaches for doctrine the commandment of men ſets aſide the command of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>I am in the ſame opinion—nor can I ſee any room for the half-way-covenant on <hi>Mather's</hi> ſcheme: But I have heard that <hi>Stoddard's</hi> ſcheme favours the preſent practice.</p>

               <p>This is a miſtake. Mr. Stoddard of Northampton, never practiced the half-way, i. e. he never admitted any to have baptiſm for their children, but thoſe who were in full communion, and he expreſly declares that thoſe who have been baptized in infancy, and owned their covenant, are obliged in duty to come to the Lord's table. Yea, he ſays, (appeal p. 63, edit. 2.) <q>It is a ſcandal if they do not, and the church may call them to an account for their neglect. It is a viſible contempt caſt upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</q> He held the Lord's ſupper to be a converting ordinance: And that unconverted men knowing themſelves to be ſuch, might lawfully come. And that it was as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to come to the Lord's ſupper, as to baptiſm, (p. 77.) ſo that there was no room for any half-way-covenant or half-way-practice, on his ſcheme. For unconverted men knowing themſelves to be ſuch may on his ſcheme come not only half-way, but to all ordinances, and to one as well as to another.</p>

               <p>I never heard of theſe things till now, and I know not what to think or what to ſay. It ſeems as if the half-way-covenant, and the half-way-practice, could not be made conſiſtent on any ſcheme.</p>

               <p>If the covenant owned is the covenant of grace, and if the parent acts underſtandingly and honeſtly in the affair, he is a good man, he has a right before God to baptiſm for his children, and an equal right to the Lord's ſupper: Yea, that command of Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 19. renders it his indiſpenſible duty to attend the Lord's ſupper. <note n="*" place="bottom">Under the Jewiſh diſpenſation it was lawful for an Iſraelite, not hindered by any external impediment, voluntarily to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the paſſover, if he was ceremonially unclean. But under the goſpel an Iſraelite indeed, of ſufficient age and underſtanding, and not hindered by any natural impediment, may not voluntarily abſent himſelf from the Lord's ſupper, unleſs diſqualified by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uncleanneſs, by his own perſonal wickedneſs unrepented of, or for which he has not made goſpel ſatisfaction. And ſuch an one is equally unfit to offer his child in baptiſm. Num. 9.13. Mat. 5.23, 24.</note> But if the covenant owned is not the covenant of grace, thoſe who have owned it have in the ſight of God no right to either of thoſe ordinances which are ſeals of that covenant, and of no other: No more right than if they had given their aſſent to any chapter in the apocrypha.—Did you never hear it obſerved and talked of, that thoſe who own the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant make as full and large a profeſſion as they who join in full communion?</p>

               <p>Yes.

               <p>If you pleaſe, ſir, I will repeat the covenant we uſe when any join in full communion, the ſame that was read to me by my miniſter, when I joined to the church about three and thirty years ago. A brief ſummary of it is this,— <q>You do now in the preſence of the dread Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, and before angels and men, in

            <sp>

               <p>So far as I am acquainted, the forms in uſe all over the country, a very few inſtances excepted, are very much alike. The only difference of any conſequence lies in practice. I think it my duty, in private, as well as public, to explain the covenant, and to ſee to it, that perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it before they make it, and know what they are about to do, and are ſufficiently inſtructed that it is a wicked thing to <hi>lie to God with their mouths and flatter him with their lips.</hi>

               <p>Very well, ſir, no doubt this is a miniſter's duty. But, alas for me, I never knew what I was about, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the import of the words, I publicly gave my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto. I knew myſelf to be unconverted.—I meant to own the covenant, as the phraſe is, and have my children baptized; but I had no deſign to profeſs godlineſs, or to pretend a real compliance with the covenant of grace. This godly people may do: But it had been great hypocriſy in me to do it. To lie to men is bad, but to lie to God is worſe. I ſuppoſed that owning the covenant was what the unconverted might do.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard of a few churches where the miniſters have of late drawn up a new form for thoſe who own the covenant, eſſentially different from that which is uſed when any one is admitted to full communion; which new form deſignedly leaves out the covenant of grace, and contains a profeſſion, which unconverted men may make, and yet ſpeak true. And this, with greater propriety, may be called the half-way-covenant, although indeed, it does not go half-way, and gives no right to thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which are ſeals of the covenant of grace. Beſides, God never did propoſe any covenant to mankind, but which required real holineſs on man's part; and any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhort of this, is a mere human device. It is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for doctrine the commandment of men, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs orders of Jeſus Chriſt to his apoſtles, and all their ſucceſſors. Mat. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I command you.</hi>—The covenant with Adam, required perfect holineſs, without any proviſion for pardon in caſe of tranſgreſſion.—The covenant at Sinai, written on the two tables of ſtone, called <hi>the tables of the covenant,</hi> containing ten commands, according to our Saviour's interpretation, required them <hi>to love God with all their heart, and their neighbour as themſelves,</hi> in which the ſum of all virtue conſiſts; (Mat. 22.37—40.) But however it made proviſion for pardon to the true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, through ſhedding of blood, but not for impenitent ſinners, Lev. 26. 1 Kin. 8. And it is acknowledged on all hands, Antinomians excepted, that repentance toward God, and ſaith toward Chriſt, are required in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, as revealed in the goſpel. Theſe ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous covenants, therefore, are not from heaven, but of men.</p>

               <p>Baptiſm, you know, is adminiſtered <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In baptiſm, therefore, you dedicate your child to God the Father, through Jeſus Chriſt his Son, to be ſanctified by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011172_0014_0F857FCCB44B3CD0"/>
the Holy Ghoſt; and ſo give up your child with all your heart to the Lord for ever, to be educated for God, and to be for him, and for him alone, in time and to eternity. And do you love God to that degree, as thus to give him your child for ever; if ſo, why do not give yourſelf to God, firſt of all? You love your child, but you love yourſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Firſt of all then ceaſe to be cruel to your own ſoul; no longer practically renounce your own baptiſm, by turning your back on God and the Redeemer; but act up to its genuine import; give yourſelf to God, through Jeſus Chriſt his Son, that you may become the temple of the Holy Ghoſt; and thus ratify what your parents did for you, when they dedicated you to God in baptiſm. This is that owning of the baptiſmal covenant which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at your hands. Then bring your dear child, and conſecrate it to God in ſincerity and truth. This is the way, the right way, for a bleſſing. But if inſtead of this, you are moved only by cuſtom, by a ſenſe of worldly honor, by pride and ſhame; and deſire that holy ordinance to be adminiſtered to your child from unholy motives, as Simon Magus deſired the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt to anſwer his carnal ends: God knows it, and all the world will know it at the day of judgment.—Pray, how was it when your other children were baptized? And how is it in general to all appearance when people own the covenant and get their children baptized? Are they brought up for God? Or only to ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures? Look through the country, wherever you are acquainted, the youth learn to dreſs, to ſing, to dance; but do their parents appear to underſtand, that they have devoted them to God? And is this evidently their great concern to bring them up for God? But to leave others, and to attend only to your own heart. Can it be true, that you have a heart to give your child to God, and yet not a heart to give yourſelf to him? Think of it, my dear ſir.</p>

               <p>I thank you for your kind viſit. I aſk the favour of another hour, when you are at leiſure.—I am always at your ſervice—and might I be a means of your ſalvation, it would give me joy, while I live, and after I am dead, thro' eternal ages.—I only add, if you will read what the late learned, pious <hi>Preſident Edwards</hi> wrote on the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for chriſtian communion, printed at Boſton; and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Green</hi>'s pieces on the ſame ſubject, printed at New-York; you may in them ſee the truth confirmed, and objections anſwered more largely. And if after all you ſhould deſire farther converſation on this ſubject, I will be ready to attend when ever you will be ſo kind as to call upon me.—Only come it all times, as you have at this, in a ſerious, friendly, candid ſpirit; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, this is one of the moſt intereſting, ſolemn and important ſubjects. Adieu, my dear Sir.</p>
