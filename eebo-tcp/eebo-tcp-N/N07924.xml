            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Brief REMARKS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE author of the Halifax letter, who now affects to call himſelf only the editor, begins his defence with "a ſerene and compoſed ſurvey of a ſtorm, taken in a calm, after the tumult of the waves had ſubſided." This is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the methodical diſpoſition of his ideas, and of the regularity and clearneſs of his modes of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He gives us a flouriſh on the "blood and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe treaſure of her ſubjects that Great-Britain has laviſhed for the ſecurity of the colonies, as well as her own importance and dignity." Were none of thoſe ſubjects Americans? Was no part of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſums raiſed by the northern colonies? It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged with gratitude, and hath very generally impreſſed the deepeſt ſentiments of duty and loyalty, that his preſent and late Majeſty, with their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parliaments, were graciouſly pleaſed to give the colonies far greater protection, ſupport and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, than had ever been received from all the Princes their royal predeceſſors together. But our notable editor ſhould not have forgotten that theſe colonies ever diſtinguiſhed themſelves by the moſt unbounded loyalty. Their inviolable attachment to the preſent eſtabliſhment in his Majeſty's illuſtrious family; their love to the Britiſh conſtitution and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, from which, under God, they derive their greateſt happineſs, have been, at all times, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010116_0003_0F7CE91F67FB2350"/>
by ſome of the moſt inveterate of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. That the northern colonies on the continent have ever exerted their moſt ſtrenuous efforts in the common cauſe of the whole empire, will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but by thoſe who are fearleſs of ridicule, and intirely loſt to any ſenſe of honor or ſhame. I will alſo venture to affirm, they will be ever found ready on any future occaſion, to convince thoſe of their miſtakes, who may entertain any kind of doubt of their loyalty. I believe there were few ſo terrified and alarmed, even in theſe dark and gloomy days of the American commanders preceding an Amherſt, a Wolfe and a Monkton, as to have "gladly compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a barrier at Albany." It was eaſy to foreſee that a change of Generals would bring on ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a change of meaſures, as at leaſt, to ſecure his Majeſty's ancient territories. The event of things happily proved this, and a great deal more. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe days, and own I was one who was greatly terrified and alarmed at the rapid progreſs the French were ſuffered to make, while ten thouſand of the beſt troops in the world were kept parading at Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax, and ſpent the ſummer in mock-battles and ſieges. If the editor then had his reſidence there, I preſume he was well pleaſed to ſee the Britiſh forces ſo wiſely employed, while the Canadians were bringing fire and ſword into the bowels of the continent. I am pretty certain, he and all thoſe of his ſtamp in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, would have been grieved at an Albany barrier, for this plain reaſon; they were in hopes to join in chanting <hi>Te Deum</hi> with their French Catholic Brethren in the churches, chapels and meeting-houſes of Boſton, New-York and Newport. Upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, during the war, they manifeſted their joy and exultation at any little ſucceſs of the French—
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010116_0004_0F7CE9205FD8B5C0"/>
but kept vigils and ſevere faſts when they were drub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The Halifaxian is at this time very intimate with a ſet of gentry who are in combination to vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify the colonies, and depreciate every ſervice they have rendered the crown. He is at no loſs any ev'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to find ſome <hi>of his old gang,</hi> who, if fame ſpeaks true, as I believe ſhe does for once, have crack'd many a bottle of true ſterling to the health of J—m-y S—t, as theſe pretty lads call him when they are about half ſeas over, and imagine themſelves out of danger. Such is the little, dirty, drinking, drabbing, contaminated knot of thieves, beggars and tranſports, or the worthy deſcendents of ſuch, collected from the four winds of the earth, and made up of Turks, Jews and other Infidels, with a few renegado Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians &amp; Catholics, and altogether formed into a club of ſcarce a dozen, at N—p—t. From hence proceed Halifax-letters, petitions to alter the colony forms of government, libels upon all good coloniſts and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and every evil work that can enter into the heart of man. Theſe are ſome of the gentry, who all of a ſudden are become the moſt loyal ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; and have had the impudence to attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade all England that the reſt of the coloniſts are as great rebels as ever appeared in arms for the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not excepting thoſe choice friends, of, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apothecary and barber-ſurgeon of a man of war Dr. Smallbrain, the lying hiſtoriographer, of the firſt expedition to Louiſbourg, whom he has bro't the <hi>beau monde</hi> to call the <hi>inſurgents</hi> of 1745. Our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his adherents, have from time to time, in the NewportMercury and elſewhere <hi>ſub roſa</hi> talked pretty loudly of "dragooning the coloniſts into better manners," and ſaid, "G—d d—m their blood, they ſhall ſoon ſee the difference between martial and

            <p>I ſhould not have thought the above vain threats worth citing, but as they ſhow what a bleſſed advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any adminiſtration hath in the editor and his <hi>junto.</hi> What an opinion ſhould we have of our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, if, which God forbid, it were to be formed from what we know of theſe wretches? Should the editor think it againſt the laws of Polemicks to apply to him, or the Halifax letter-writter, who choſe to be anonymous, even what I know hath been ſaid by divers of the <hi>junto,</hi> let him recollect that the ſame editor in the defence of the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath not only
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010116_0006_0F7CE922E1BFC158"/>
made the writer of the vindication of the colonies anſwerable for every thing that hath been thought, ſpoken, written, printed or publiſhed in America, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticatholicon,</hi> for ſeveral years paſt. He hath without ſufficient authority, affirmed, that the author of the <hi>Rights of the Britiſh colonies aſſerted and proved,</hi> and the writer of their <hi>Vindication</hi> againſt the editor's foul aſperſions, is the ſame perſon. This, if true, he did not know, and therefore in <hi>foro conſcientiae</hi> approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to leeſing-making. Does this ſhow his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and ſerenely ſweet diſpoſition of avoiding any thing that looks like a perſonal conteſt. He certainly muſt be loſt to all ſenſe of honor, or when he was not only treated like a gentleman, but with infinitely more lenity than he deſerved, and nothing ſaid that could be called naming him, he would not have uſed this expreſſion, "The rights of the Britiſh colonies aſſerted, of which this Boſton writer was the author." This is certainly equivalent to naming who he thinks the writer of the Vindication, as the author of the Rights aſſerted gave his name to the public. Not content with this, he has made the writer of the Vindication anſwerable for pieces which he declares he never ſaw, 'till he read them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. He has made him intimate with gentlemen he never heard of, and confederate with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he never gueſſed at. The writer of the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has more than once ſaid in my hearing, "that he knows not any more than the dead who that Providence writer" is, but he believes him to be a match for all the Jacobites &amp; Jew-jobbers in Newport.</p>
            <p>With regard to the preſent ſubject, I ſolemnly declare, and defy the Editor to prove the contrary, and I have heard the author of the Rights of the Britiſh colonies aſſerted, ſay as much, I never was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010116_0007_0F7CE923478F9F88"/>
directly nor indirectly concerned in, or knowing to the compoſing or publiſhing of one pamphlet or other piece, by the Editor cited, or any other, except the Rights of the Colonies aſſerted, and the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which I own I was the publiſher, and the author of the firſt is well known; and if there is any thing offenſive in either, I am heartily ſorry, and am well aſſured the author never intended any ſuch thing, and has given me authority in his name, humbly to aſk pardon for the leaſt iota that may have diſpleaſed his ſuperiors, humbly imploring as he at firſt expreſſed his diffidence of himſelf, that they would candidly impute any ſlip to the "agony of his heart, rather than to the pravity of his will." I as much diſapprove of many things that have been publiſhed, as the Editor pretends to. But in a point of ſuch importance, and in regulations at leaſt new, is it to be wondered at, that there ſhould be ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſentiments? Should any imprudencies have eſcaped any, all "candid Philanthropes," but ſuch as the Editor, will make benevolent allowances for, thoſe who have been born and bred in the wilds of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and have had little opportunity to learn the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean urbanity and manners, unleſs they could take them from a few ſtrollers, ſtraggling pedlars &amp; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which were the principal ſchool-maſters of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the letter writer converſed with, before the late war, ſince the opening of which, many fine gentlemen have viſited the colonies. As the country becomes poliſhed, I hope it will grow in virtue and good manners &amp; avoid the leaſt appearance of any thing that may offend. The colonies have been long indulged with a more ample ſubordinate legiſlation, than the wiſdom of adminiſtration thinks the good of the whole Empire will admit of their enjoying any longer.

on Great-Britain was never tho't of, much leſs wiſhed for or deſired. During the laſt war, his late and preſent Majeſty were graciouſly pleaſed to avail themſelves of all the aids in the power of their loyal ſubjects the northern coloniſts, by the royal requiſitions ſignified by their reſpective miniſters of ſtate, to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provincial aſſemblies. In conſequence of theſe, and of our lives and fortunes being ever devoted to their Majeſty's ſervice, men from time to time were chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully raiſed, and monies granted by the provincial repreſentatives of the people, who in reflecting on the honour and happineſs of being enabled to ſerve their King &amp; country in this way, had alſo the pleaſure of contemplating their own importance in ſociety.—No diſagreeable ſentiment this, even to the "good and virtuous men" of the Editor's acquaintance, if <hi>many</hi> ſuch there are. The buſineſs of the provincial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the future, will probably be confined to the "little low local affairs of their petty corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations," as they are conſidered by the Editor. A very great friend of the colonies, as he is pleaſed to ſtyle himſelf, in a late M. Gazette, has carried the matter ſo far, as to ſay in effect, that the American colonies are of no more importance, than the moſt inſignificant ſettlements on the coaſt of Africa.—That the inhabitants of Cape-Coaſt-Caſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who may not conſiſt of more than a captain, two ſubalterns, fifty non-commiſſion officers and privates, ten ſtrumpets and their brats, have as much pretence to hope to be be indulged with returning members of parliament as all N. America, which has at this preſent writing, nearly as many inhabitants as there are in Scotland or Ireland, more than three millions of which are whites, and as great a proportion of them, as in any part of the Britiſh empire, without any reflection,

true and loyal ſubjects, who fear God, honour the King, reverence his parliament, and daily pray for the proſperity of Great-Britain. Am I a man, and muſt not ſpeak? Tears relieve me a moment! Thank God there is no law humane or divine, againſt treating a Halifax letter-writer as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Tho' ſome of the colonies ſhould not in all things think with the very ingenious, learned, polite and delicate writer of a pamphlet intitled, <hi>Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lately made concerning the colonies, and the taxes impoſed on them conſidered;</hi> yet none but the bigoted N—t Editor would thence infer, that all the continent of America were about to become <hi>inſurgents.</hi> As there cannot be the leaſt doubt but the views of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration are intentionally the beſt and wiſeſt; ſo the law preſumes with me, that they are really ſo on the whole. We at this diſtance can ſee but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly. Tis the duty of all humbly and ſilently to acquieſce in all the deciſions of the ſupreme legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I will, however, preſume to utter one ſhort prophecy, namely, that nine hundred and ninety nine in a thouſand of the colonies, will never once entertain a thought but of the moſt profound duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal ſubmiſſion and obedience to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of our moſt gracious Sovereign, and to the authority of parliament, in all caſes and poſſible contingencies. Any informations of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſition in the coloniſts, tranſmitted from America, upon a ſtrict enquiry, will be found to be at leaſt very great miſtakes.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned the pamphlet, intitled, <hi>Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.</hi> but as a friend of mine, who is much pleaſed with that performance, and at his leiſure, is preparing a critical and candid review of it, with a ſincere deſign to conciliate as far as poſſible every

man in America to the ſyſtem of meaſures there diſcuſſed, it is needleſs to make many obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on it here, eſpecially as the bare naming it in a day, much more any compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the Halifax letter, will, I fear, be conſidered as an outrageous affront to the real merit of the European, if ſo, I aſk his pardon for it. The reader will there find the coloniſts, not only treated like men, but gentlemen, and Britiſh ſubjects.—None of your Draconic laws, nor inquiſitorial grid-irons to broil hereticks on, are liſp'd, or I believe tho't of, much leſs openly threatned and wiſhed for, as by the Halifaxian.—We ſee the traces of genius in every ſentence, often in the choice of a ſingle letter in the alphabet.—The tenderneſs of a parent, the prudence of a Neſtor, the legiſlative ſkill of a Solon, and a Lycurgus are diſplayed, inſtead of the rage, malice and fury of an Oreſtes, tearing out the bowels of his mother, ſtabbing his ſiſter, killing his own ſons and his daughters, and plucking out his own eyes; all which are very faint traits of the madneſs of the Halifaxian. In the European we alſo find a perfect knowledge of our conſtitution, laws, political intereſts, internal police, and ſtate of trade and commerce thro' the globe.—Of all this in the Halifaxian, verily nothing. The European tells us, we are a part, an eſſential part of the empire of Great Britain, and a beloved part, entitled to every benefit of the beſt conſtitution on earth. The Halifax Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar will not allow his countrymen any greater rights and privileges than the Creoles allow the Ethiopians, or his brother Sythians afford their captives. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid eſt vocis ac linguae omne in iſtum turpiſſimum calumniae queſtum contuliſti!

Dare you behold the light? Dare you face the forum, the city and the aſſembly of your injured fellow-countrymen?" I ſhall paſs over what the Editor ſays of the Providence writer, as he calls him, and of the honourable gentleman, except where he has bro't the Vindication in queſtion. Thoſe gentlemen are able to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this doughty champion for Great-Britain, as he vainly ſtiles himſelf. The Editor, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his charge againſt the colonies, of diſloyalty and diſaffection to Great Britain, has been grubbing up all the little pieces that have been publiſhed in any of the News-Papers on the continent. He will have it again, contrary to what he muſt know to be true, that "numberleſs pamphlets" have been publiſhed upon the occaſion. If prior to the Halifax letter, he can name above four, and one ſince beſides the Vindication againſt him, I will give him the weight in gold of all that have been publiſhed. This dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator has given the author of the ſentiments of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh North-American, a place in his black catalogue. The Editor's grand charge is againſt the motto of this piece, taken from Phaedrus, which being only a fable of an old man and his aſs, ſurely none but a jack-aſs could have been offended at it. Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus could be no offender againſt the ſtatutes of G.B. Phaedrus was certainly no ſubject of Great Britain, nor could he know any thing of her munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal laws and cuſtoms. But the treaſon is not in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010116_0012_0F7CE928D180DD90"/>
the motto it ſeems, but "the application of the above fable to the ſubject of taxing the colonies, ſhews clearly the author's opinion, that under the preſent parliamentary regulations, it is matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference what Prince we are ſubject to, whether a George or a Lewis, as a certain gentleman expreſſed it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Halifax defence, p 8.</note> The humanity and philanthropy of this attack on a gentleman who has been long in a very ill ſtate of health, and now unable to anſwer for himſelf, is very remarkable. What an eagle-eyed fellow is this Editor, and would be governor, at eſpying plots, treaſon and rebellion, in all but his own club? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Phaedrus his aſs tho't it a matter of indifference whoſe pack ſhe carried, therefore the <hi>North American</hi> is of opinion, that it is a matter of indifference what prince or power we are ſubject to, whether a George or a Lewis. This is exactly of a piece with the law, the truth, the ſincerity, the logic and philanthropy of the Editor in his other productions. As to the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of George and Lewis, the author of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments has no concern in it.—'Tis ſuppoſed to relate to an expreſſion wilfully miſrepreſented by the Editor, and was very different from the manner in which it is cited. Thoſe who pleaſe may ſee the whole ſtory in the vindication of the houſe of repreſentatives of M. B. publiſhed about three years ſince, and never attempted to be anſwered; in which 'tis clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, if I remember rightly, for I have not ſeen the book for ſome time, that the words really uſed, and as clearly intended, had quite an innocent mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and the author of that expreſſion, if what went before and immediately followed is taken with it, may defy the Editor to ſhow any thing diſreſpectful in it. The perſon, who uſed the words, thus, ſcandalouſly falſly and knowingly miſrepreſented, could boaſt a

ſeries of ſervices yielded to his Majeſty and his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious predeceſſors, by himſelf and anceſtors, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as thoſe the Editor and his junto have on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhown their deſire of yielding the pretender; but he repines not at others reaping the fruit of his as well as of the labours of thoſe from whom he is deſcended.<note n="*" place="bottom">"He does not mean to be vain when he ſays" all this, and could add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is quite as "independent in ſpirit and circumſtances as the Editor, and has no favors to aſk of the people," nor of any man, who like the Editor vainly thinks himſelf of a ſpecies above human nature</note> But he means not to be vain in boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his independency of ſpirit and purſe, which the Editor ſo fooliſhly puffs and vapors about. He knows the dependency of man on man, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he has to expect from the philanthropy of modern politicians. The Editor complains moſt bitterly of "inhuman treatment," particularly in the Boſton pamphlet, as he politely calls it. What inſtance has he pointed out to ſupport this charge? By his own account of matters, he has received the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by this Boſton-pamphlet he ever received by any diſcipline in his life. I gueſs he will not receive half ſo much good by all the rewards he may receive from home, as the grand apologiſt of Great Britain. Theſe rewards of his merit from <hi>Apollo,</hi> he gives broad hints he ſoon expects. But he ſays, I have fitted him for any misfortune in life, freed him from all future fears of purgatory, and the pains of h—ll; both which he had reaſon enough to dread, were it only for the almoſt unpardonable ſin of being the author and Editor of the Halifax letter. By my help he flatters himſelf he is become an Achilles and a Salamander. He tells his readers, he can now ſafely travel thro' the infernal abode, and drink ſire and brimſtone, as ſweetly as if it were nectar and ambroſia. Poor man, I fear he boaſts a little too

much of his armour againſt the fiery darts he may yet have to encounter, from an old archer, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſage he will ſoon make, without any poſſible aſſiſtance he can receive from the cuſtom-houſe or me.</p>
            <p>He gives a very unfair and falſe analyſis of the Halifax letter. He ſays, "all the points he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prove were (amongſt others) 1. That "the New-England colonies privileges, as corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions created by the crown, are fixed and aſcertained by their chartets." 2. "That theſe charters give them no exemption from the juriſdiction of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment." Theſe propoſitions are ſo ſelf-evident, that no man can poſſibly be ſuppoſed to diſpute them, or even to have ever admitted the leaſt doubt of them. The amount of the firſt is, no more nor leſs than, that, <hi>a charter is a charter,</hi> of the ſecond, that, <hi>the parliament of Great-Britain is the ſupreme legiſlative of the whole Britiſh empire.</hi> Theſe are two won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſcoveries the univerſe is obliged to this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax genius for. Had he ſtopped here, or with his other four wonderful propoſitions, he never would, at leaſt by me, have been tho't worthy of a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſin of ſcribbling. Does monſieur Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor forget theſe aſſertions of his in the letter? "The relation between modern colonies and their mother ſtates, is formed by political compact." This opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, if true, would make it ridiculous for him to have attempted his laborious ſearch after the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abſtract relation which he confeſſed his noddle would furniſh him with no notices of. How will he excuſe himſelf from the nonſenſe in ſuppoſing, as he does, that a natural relation ſubſiſted between ancient ſtates and their colonies; and yet, that it cannot enter into the heart or head of a man, to conceive any ſuch relation between modern ſtates
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010116_0015_0F7CE92AA9149618"/>
and their colonies? He was preſſed with this abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, by his own confeſſion, in the letter; he was preſs'd with it in the vindication; and he was ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with it when he compoſed his defence, that he was not able to ſay a ſingle word about it. I would aſk this great lawyer a few more queſtions in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm he ought to be much better acquainted with than I fear he ever will be. Does he think his allegiance to his moſt ſacred and gracious Majeſty GEORGE the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is <hi>natural?</hi> Dares he now deny this as in the <hi>junto</hi> room heretofore, and affirm the ſame thing of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> only becauſe he was the ſon of an <hi>Italian,</hi> and for any thing that can be now certainly proved to the contrary, might be lineally deſcended from Taffy the fiddler, and <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Lillibullero to a very beautiful Queen?<note n="*" place="bottom">Who liv'd a thouſand years ſince.</note> Is the immortal diſtinction between "perſonal and political rights already forgotten," my dear <hi>Martinus Scrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus?</hi> Above all, don't you remember, my dear boy, what you once ſaid in a manner, it is too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or palliate that "the ſeveral New-England char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aſcertain, define and <hi>limit</hi> the reſpective rights and privileges of each colony," and that the ſaid ſelf ſame colonies "have no rights independent of their charters?"

"Charter rights and privileges are aſcertained and defined in and by charters." 2. "The colonies have no charter rights or privileges independent of their charters."

the Halifax gentleman, <hi>an alter et idem, neſcio ſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile credo,</hi> have heads for this argument. It requires ſomething more than a muſical genius, or a catcher of butterflies, to reaſon clearly and concluſively on the origin and principles of government; how much more—not being myſelf qualified, I cannot certainly ſay. How ſilly a fellow muſt you be, Mr. Editor, to charge your moſt humble ſervant with "diſingenuity, to ſay no worſe of it," only becauſe by your own confeſſion he plainly pointed out the fallacy of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that eſcaped your ſagacity? Am I under any promiſe or obligation to ſwallow the errors of one man more than of another? How can I be a falſe brother to honorable gentlemen, to whom I have not the happineſs of being known, or charged with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting them, and the party of truth, the only party I recognize, becauſe I think ſome of them are a little miſtaken in their reaſonings on the non-eſſentials of politicks? What depravity and inſincerity in all this? Thy head is certainly turned; you are as viſionary as any fanatic preacher, as you politely and indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately call the diſſenting clergy.</p>
            <p>Among other ſurprizing myſteries, the Editor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that an "implicit is the ſame with an expreſs denial of the authority of parliament." I hope he will not ſay an inadvertent implicit denial is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to one that is not only expreſs, but evidently premeditated. I muſt confeſs, however, that I ſhould not be more aſtoniſhed at this than at another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that "a meer humble doubt of the equity of an act of parliament, is the ſame thing with a down right denial of the authority of parliament." This calls up a ſaying of Mr. Hamilton to a certain attorney-general of New-York, much ſuch a lawyer as the Editor, "A man" ſays he, at New-York, may
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010116_0017_0F7CE92F14C4F4A0"/>
make very free with his God and his king, but he muſt take ſpecial care what he ſays of a miniſter, or of a plantation governor," as nearly as I remember. The more the Editor flutters and flounders on, the more he expoſes, even in the opinion of ſome of his beſt friends, his ſhameful ignorance of the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of law, and of the Britiſh conſtitution. Reader, take this ſhort account of the "little <hi>modicum</hi>" of knowledge that appears in either of the Editor's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. He took a journey to Boſton in the depth of laſt winter, to exhibit his talents of ſinging before a certain auguſt aſſembly, remarkable for the beauty and politeneſs of thoſe of both ſexes who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. In the courſe of his reſidence here, for the amuſement of the gay and the pretty, he happened as I conjecture to overhear a few expreſſions which fell from the mouths of ſome learned men about that time, and has been theſe two months further mangling, chewing and retailing the "cud of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics", as I think Swift expreſſes it, ſo I will not be anſwerable for the indelicacy of the expreſſion, ſhould it affect the ſtomach of our fine gentleman; for to do him juſtice, tho' he would lick the ſpittle and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a— of a great man, he cannot bear the tho'ts of tobacco ſmoke, nor the name of another plant of no bad ſmell, but of a curſed bitter taſte and touch, and to which he is ſaid to have his averſion from indefeaſible hereditary deſcent. This <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> I knew not, and if I had, was not half angry enough with him to allude to it, when I wrote before, nor ſhould I now, had not his behaviour to his country proved that he hath the conſcience of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman, the heart of an aſſaſſin and the impudence of a billingſgate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>To be ſerious, the ſource of parliamentary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is clearly derived from God, the author and creator of all things, principalities and powers. By his unerring laws of nature, ſocieties, communities, and great ſtates are formed in miniature, flouriſh and grow into mighty empires, and tumble again into ruins, that in their fall ſhake the whole univerſe. The various forms are in the opinion of ſome, left to what is called the free-will of man, and the compact of the whole with the whole, expreſs or implied. Others think even the form is as mechanical in its generation as the ſubſtance, and that the whole is to be reſolved into what is called power. Which of theſe opinions as the world generally goes is the truth, is of no great importance: thoſe who want my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt, do what few perhaps ever will think it worth while, take the pains to read and underſtand the meaning of the writer of the pamplet called The

ſhould be practiſed upon, without allowing the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies an <hi>actual</hi> repreſentation. An equal repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole ſtate is, at leaſt in theory, of the eſſence of a perfect parliament or ſupreme legiſlature." I think it impoſſible for any man that well conſiders the whole paſſage, to miſtake my meaning, or to find any thing in it repugnant to my former principles, or to truth; eſpecially, if with the Editor he conſiders me as the author of <hi>The Rights of the colonies aſſerted, &amp;c.</hi> which for the preſent he may, or may not, as he pleaſes. I certainly was or was not. If I was, there is a clear and expreſs recognition of the authority and juriſdiction of parliament, not only in the above paſſage, but, in the only piece beſides I ever wrote upon the ſubject of colony taxation, as appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of a doubt, in the paſſages cited in page 27 of the Vindication, which I might here repeat with ſome additions to the ſame purpoſe. After this for the Editor to ſay I ever denied or queſtioned the juriſdiction of parliament, will be conſummate. If he has been pleaſed to father upon me the hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox opinions of others I am no way privy to, he muſt take the conſequences. If he ſays I did not write the pamphlet intitled, <hi>The rights of the Britiſh colonies aſſerted, &amp;c.</hi> then the worſt I have done is to quote this paſſage from it, page 27 of the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. "When the parliament ſhall think fit to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the coloniſts a repreſentation in the houſe of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies will be as clear as their power is at preſent of doing it without, if they pleaſe." The Editor had ſo poor ſucceſs in ratiotination, by his own confeſſion, when he attempted a confutation of his honor in catagoricks, that he has prudently avoided any further uſe of Ramus and Burguſdicius. He contents himſelf only with hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010116_0023_0F7CE93749E26928"/>
at ſomething inconſiſtent here with my recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he calls it. It is very difficult—to deal with people who have ſuch a contempt for letters and ſyllables, that they will not be at the trouble of learning to read, without which they never can know the meaning of words. Be it known to this great profeſſor of the <hi>Belle Lettres,</hi> that in the Engliſh tongue the word <hi>Equity</hi> is uſed variouſly; ſometimes it is, as it may be applied, ſynonimous with <hi>law, juſtice, right,</hi> or <hi>reaſon.</hi> So the word <hi>Power</hi> is moſt commonly, ever ſo in acts of parliament and law-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which this man's clients have an <hi>equitable</hi> right to be aſſured he knows ſomething of, ſynonimous with <hi>authority, right of legiſlation</hi> &amp; <hi>juriſdiction.</hi> In natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral philoſophy <hi>power</hi> means a meer phyſical quality, that may be explained with the cauſe of gravitation in bodies, and the tendency of ſome ſouls to the centre. Now my dear M-rt-n, with the help of this ſpelling- book, attempt to read the paſſage once more, which, according to the plain ſenſe of it, may be thus varied in expreſſion, without any other alteration. "When the parliament ſhall think fit to allow the coloniſts an actual repreſentation in the houſe of commons, the reaſonableneſs of their taxing the colonies, <hi>externally and internally,</hi> will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be as clear to all, but the weak and obſtinate, as their preſent juſt conſtitutional and legal power and authority of doing it without, if they pleaſe, is and ever was to me: they being the ſupreme legiſlative authority of Great-Britain and its dominions, and the only juriſdiction that I know of, who can finally and lawfully determine the queſtions, whether and how long 'tis reaſonable a continent of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, numbers and importance, ſhall be taxed, without being allowed a repreſentation <hi>in fact,</hi>

as they now have in law, or virtually as ſome expreſs it, in the houſe of commons. The three branches of the ſupreme legiſlative, on my principles of politicks, which exactly coincide with the main principles of the incomparable writer of the new regulations conſidered and vindicated, clearly repreſent the whole Empire. Let the Editor here recollect the leave he was pleaſed to give us in the cloſe of his letter, where he began to open the method and plan of the diſcourſe he had nearly finiſhed. "The diſpute between Great-Britain (ſays he) and the colonies, conſiſts of two parts. Firſt, the juriſdiction of parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—and ſecondly, the exerciſe of that juriſdiction." The firſt, I ſay, is unqueſtionable, and ever was with me. Under the ſecond head, his highneſs was graciouſly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to permit "full liberty to remonſtrate, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, write pamphlets and news-papers, without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to prevent any <hi>improper</hi> or <hi>unreaſonable</hi> impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Halifax Letter, p. 21.</note> With regard to this, I have ſome ſcruples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think the parliament infinitely the beſt judges. Therefore I ſhould think it every one's duty to be very careful not to charge the ſupreme legiſlative with <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> proceedings. The law of parliament is, that the parliament cannot err. And 'tis a maxim of the common law, that the King can do no wrong. The conſtitution, reaſon, the nature of ſovereignty and of a ſupreme legiſlative, all concur to make it neceſſarily the duty of all ſubjects to acquieſce in the preſumption that even the inmoſt intentions of the ſupreme power, have ever for their favourite object the good of the whole community. Theſe are maxims &amp; principles, without a due attention to which, no government could ſubſiſt. Government

being in ſhort the dernier reſort for law &amp; juſtice, there can be no appeal from it, as there would be if private opinions and interpretations could have any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or were allowed to be ſet up and conſidered as of any weight in the ſcale againſt it. But general rules hinder not, nor were deſigned to prevent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and humble enquiries after truth and reaſon. Should this be the caſe, it would tend much to ſtop the progreſs of all human improvement. The Editor to be ſure is bound by his conceſſion, that the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> of meaſures may be diſcuſſed, this is <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ad hominem</hi> as to him, and ſhould not be taken back. We have better authority than his, I mean among others, the opinion of the author of the <hi>New Regulations conſidered,</hi> who, I am certain, is ſo fair and honeſt an enquirer after truth, that he would be freely willing others ſhould enquire for themſelves, as well as he. If none were to enquire into the reaſon and meaning of laws, we ſhould have no judges nor lawyers, unleſs perhaps ſuch as the Editor. I have ever tho't that the whole ſcience of law, and the fair and juſt practice of it, was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtudy, interpretation and right application and execution of the reaſon, meaning and intention of the laws, and conſequently of the legiſlative. There is nothing in all this that can in the leaſt impeach their power, right and authority to make laws. To apply this reaſoning to the preſent times, the author of the book called the new regulations, &amp;c. is of opinion with me "that the colonies are juſtly bound by all acts of parliament wherein they are named." That the parliament have a "clear, juſt equitable and lawful authority, from the nature of a ſupreme legiſlative or ſovereign power of a ſtate, and by the Britiſh conſtitution in particular, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010116_0026_0F7CE9398B6FFA80"/>
internal and external duties and taxes on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and to make any other laws they think fit, which when made are equally binding upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts if named, as general acts are on the ſubjects within the realm".<note n="*" place="bottom">See the book, and the rights of the Britiſh colonies aſſerted and the Vindication, againſt the Halifax letter.</note> I have the honor alſo to agree with the European writer, that the <hi>coloniſts are virtually, conſtitutionally, in law and in equity to be conſidered as repreſented in the honourable houſe of commons.</hi> This I endeavored to prove, and think I have done it, as inconteſtably, tho' perhaps no man in Britain could have proved that and a thouſand other very important points, ſo handſomely as this writer has done. We have the honor of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our doctrine approved by the Newport Editor, who I dare ſay will allow it, will be ſomewhat of a greater honor ſtill, when the ſtamp act ſhall have paſſed the ſupreme legiſlative, which if done before the publication of the defence, as is moſt probable, it was not known to the Editor, nor could be; for all the intelligence yet arrived, is a copy of the reſolves of the honourable houſe of Commons. I therefore leave it to the Editor to reconcile to truth his poſitive aſſertion, that, the ſtamp act is paſſed, when we have not yet heard of more than an order to bring in a bill agreeable to the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and the reſolves of the honourable houſe. The falſity he begins his appendix with, is this. "Since the aforegoing ſheets were committed to the preſs, ſeveral veſſels have arrived from London, and brought intelligence that the act of parliament for levying a ſtamp duty on the colonies is actually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed." Whether 'tis or 'tis not paſſed, would not alter the courſe of my argument. I have not a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010116_0027_0F7CE93A34C1FB40"/>
to ſay againſt the juriſdiction or authority of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, never having entertained the leaſt doubt of it, nor to my remembrance ever expreſſed any: But on the contrary; have ever expreſſed my opinion of its exiſtence and extention through the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the ſtrongeſt terms, as I have above moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſhewn. Nor ſhall I preſume to ſay a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word on the expediency and public utility of this meaſure, after the adminiſtration have ſo long had it in contemplation. I humbly, dutifully, and loyally preſume, and could give my reaſons for it, if I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſupreme legiſlative of Great-Britain do, and muſt know infinitely better what they are about and intend, than any without doors. Thoſe who can entertain any doubt of this, are referred to <hi>the new Regulations conſidered,</hi> for ample conviction. But the Editor, if he pleaſes, may, and according to his ſyſtem, he will have a right "modeſtly to repreſent his poverty and inability to pay taxes," inſtead of ſpending his time in wool-gathering and abuſing the colonies; inſtead of teaching people to ſpin and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture wool before they know where to get it, as he &amp; the Dr. have been employed for theſe 12 months, with regard to the good people of R.-Iſland, for no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end but to excite the jealouſy of the Britiſh manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, and that the coloniſts might incur the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the adminiſtration. The Editor with his topping "independent ſpirit" and pockets full of R.-Iſland old tenor, ſtrutting in the fleeceings of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who furniſh him with a ſheep-paſture, he will never reſign but for a government, can with but a bad grace plead for favor or promotion, <hi>in forma pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris.</hi> The terreſtial Dr. at his elbow would give him the lie, and tell him he was a ſimpleton, for that many of his countrymen who have viſited Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010116_0028_0F7CE93D30576590"/>
could depoſe, and that ſafely, that one good farm on Rhode-Iſland, is worth all the Highlands in ſome Britiſh countries. We muſt not plead poverty till there is an end of the ſcandalous conſumption of Holland's Tea, and Weſt-India produce in this country. The bane of the northern colonies has been Holland and Weſt-India goods. With regard to ſome of thoſe of New England, there has been another very impoveriſhing drain, —they have ever bought great part of their bread, and it ſeems at preſent impoſſible to perſuade them even to attempt to raiſe it. Theſe are the fine projectors, whoſe heads are full of preſent manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Thoſe are a very fit object for thoſe who neither have, nor can in leſs than fifty years have the materials to work if permitted; eſpecially wool, which has made ſuch a noiſe. The province which has by far the greateſt proportion of ſheep in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, has not more than ſufficient wool to furniſh its inhabitants with hoſe; mitts they muſt go without.</p>
            <p>I have had ſome peculiar opportunities to get the exact number of the inhabitants, and am as well informed as I think poſſible, of the quantity of wool. I have reaſons for not inſerting either here. But whoever has a mind to make the leaſt inquiry in any province but one, will find the people muſt go with bare feet, unleſs they can procure European made ſtockings. The manufactures of Great-Britain, are out of danger at preſent from the manufactures of America. I wiſh there was no greater danger from any other countries. Having made a ſhort digreſſion from the Defence, tho' not from the Editor, to ſhow the abſurdity of any project for an American woollen manufacture. I return to the Herculean taſk, which the Editor and ſome few others it ſeems ſtill think he has
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010116_0029_0F7CE93DD6E6B778"/>
impoſed upon me of clearing myſelf from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or the heinous crime of retracting my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, when convinced of them, which laſt ſeems in the opinion of the Editor, to be by far the moſt aggravated tranſgreſſion of the two, tho' he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a ſneering commendation, which has much more of the hiſſing and grinning of Pandemonium, than the angelic joy ſhown on the return of a prodigal, or penitence of any other ſinner. I will now ſhew not only that the Editor has not pointed out any contradiction in the Vindication, but alſo that it is poſitively conſiſtent with itſelf, and alſo with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine advanced in the Rights of the colonies aſſerted, and with the truth. The Editor has not pretended to cite any paſſage, either from the Rights aſſerted, or the Vindication, againſt him, that contains any thing that is an expreſs denial or even a direct queſtion of the juſt power right and authority of the parliament over the colonies. He cites the former part of the paſſage above-mentioned, page 22, and compares it with theſe words taken from the Rights of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies aſſerted, "When the parliament ſhall think fit to <hi>allow</hi> the coloniſts a repreſentation (i. e. as the Editor takes it, and as it was meant) a repreſentation in fact in the houſe of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies will be as clear as their power is at preſent of doing it without, if they pleaſe." Now let the Editor keep ſight of the dictinction he made, which I grant is a juſt one, and almoſt the only one I have known him make, and his difficulty to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile me muſt vaniſh. I have to do only with him at preſent. 1. "The juriſdiction of parliament." 2. "The exerciſe of that juriſdiction." With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the firſt, he has endeavoured to ſhow that "it is attached to every Engliſh ſubject, wherever he be."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010116_0030_0F7CE93EE7D37AF8"/>"The <hi>common law</hi> has eſtabliſhed it as a rule or maxim, that the plantations are bound by Britiſh acts of parliament, if particularly named: and ſurely no Engliſhman, in his ſenſes will deny the force of a common law maxim. In a word, the force of an act of parliament, over the colonies, is predicated upon the common law".<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter p. 10.</note> I have ſaid in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, <hi>It is certain</hi> that the parliament of Great-Britain hath a juſt, clear, equitable and conſtitutional right, power and authority, to bind the colonies, by all acts wherein they are named". I have alſo aſſerted that the "parliament of Great-Britain hath a juſt and equitable power and authority to impoſe taxes on the colonies, internal and external, on lands as well as on trade. This is involved in the idea, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The paſſages cited in the Vindication from the rights of the colonies aſſerted, of which he ſuppoſes I am author, are as full to the juriſdiction of parliament, as any the Editor has written. So far we are now certainly agreed by the Editor's confeſſion in the defence, viz. That the juriſdiction of parliament is out of any queſtion between us, and it was ever out of any doubt with me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Point is in the exerciſe of parliamentary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. With regard to this the Editor allows, pag. 21. That arguments may be urged for or againſt particular meaſures, and that thoſe arguments may be drawn from the topics of "<hi>expediency, utility, propriety and reaſon</hi>" or of their oppoſites". "And this with a ſpirit of freedom". I would hope he means fair to his readers. He ſhould have confined this liberty to the time when meaſures and bills are pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. After they have received the ſanction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, much leſs is allow'd to be ſaid than before.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010116_0031_0F7CE93F762344A8"/>
The ſafeſt way in ſuch a caſe is humbly to acquieſce in the deciſions of parliament, and the diſpoſals of providence. This I moſt ſincerely and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve do, and adviſe all men to do the ſame. The ſupreme legiſlative of Great-Britain, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, if the ſtamp act is paſſed, relating to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, have, as they have an undoubted right to do, impoſed internal as well as external taxes on us, and as they have tho't it expedient, reaſonable, nay abſolutly neceſſary, in the preſent circumſtances and exigencies of the ſtate, laboring under a debt of 130 millions. I wiſh, and begin to hope, it may on the whole be for the intereſt of all parts of the Empire.</p>
            <p>But with regard to the Editor, I would aſk him, if while a bill is pending, arguments may be urged from <hi>reaſon,</hi> expediency, &amp;c. for or againſt it, why not from equity, equality and inequality? May not the propriety or impropriety of a meaſure be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the equity, reaſonable equality, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable inequality. This is all I contend for, which is ſhort of the Editor's claim, who reſerves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of writing and publiſhing, for any thing that appears, after a bill is paſſed the parliament, which is more than I think ought to be allow'd with the great freedom at leaſt, which he contends for. My reaſon is, ſuch freedoms allow'd, with regard to the right, exerciſe of a juriſdiction, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances, would bring government, and all courts into contempt. If the editor therefore thinks I have been inconſiſtent, he muſt think he has been much more ſo, as I ſhall ſhew in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the perſecution he complains ſo loudly of as an infringement of his liberty and the liberty of the preſs. One can't but ſmile at the courage and conſiſtency of this hero. When 'tis for his intereſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010116_0032_0F7CE940D56B1010"/>
the coloniſts have no rights, no liberties nor privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges independent of charters. He calls the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the colony by name a calf, and in effect with him the whole general court the ſame, and traitors into the bargain, for approving the governor's book, which I take it was publiſhed with their aſſent, if not at their deſire, tho' this is only my own conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the piece is ſaid in the title page to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by authority. The ſcene changes, the general aſſembly reſent the inſult, the printer is ſent for, I ſuppoſe more to frighten him than any thing elſe; the champion Editor fell into panics which he has not got rid of ſince. The affair was managed with candor, the governor not appearing, which I ſuppoſe was the reaſon that the lieutenant-governor, who was not ſo immediately attacked, preſided. After a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſweating, the printer was very prudently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to his beloved trembling Editor. Inſtantly the Newport-Mercury began the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of injured <hi>liberty and property.</hi> The <hi>tribunitian</hi> veto then ſounded as loud in this notable paper, as formerly the <hi>clanking</hi> of chains and the marching of <hi>dragoons.</hi> But this laſted only three or four weeks, when the noble courage of the Editor revived again, and having found his great independent ſoul, which on this tragical occaſion, fame ſays lay two or three days hid in a hay-mow or a hen-rooſt, he ſet about his defence, in which he deſcribes with ſerene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his hair-breadth eſcape. It will be at leaſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be poſſible, that the general aſſemblies have a juſt power and lawful authority to commit for contempt. If they have ſuch a right, I reaſon thus from Martinus againſt M-r-t-n and company.— The aſſembly had a good, clear, juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right, power and authority to have committed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010116_0033_0F7CE941344FA9A0"/>
M-rt-n and his <hi>printer</hi> to <hi>limbo,</hi> for calling them a parcel of fools, coxcombs, calves, knaves, ſmugglers and rebels. If they had ſo committed them, it could not have been complained of as againſt juſtice or equity, they having a right to commit. But yet a commitment would have been againſt reaſon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as it might either have made them too conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, or have cramped the liberty of the preſs. The end being anſwered as it was hoped by the pannic, they were diſmiſſed. What is there contradictory in all this? What is there wrong but the Editor's ſtill perſiſting to abuſe a government that has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſo much lenity towards him? Sure I am, that if my ſuperiors in Europe or America have taken any umbrage at any thing I have ſaid or written, I am ſorry for it, and whether they forgive me or not, I promiſe I will do my utmoſt not only never to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them again, but in all things try to convince them I am not the man, the malice and ill-will of ſome have induced them to repreſent me. I have been ſo large in proving that the Editor has not ſhewn any inconſiſtency in me, that moſt I flatter myſelf will be of the mind, I have proved that the whole I have advanced on the ſubject is conſiſtent. But to convince all, even the moſt obſtinate, I muſt offer a word or two more. The paſſage cited by the Editor above, taken with the context and whole tenor of the book, and if the Editor pleaſes with the <hi>Rights of the colonies aſſerted</hi> too, prove that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was placed, not on a denial or ſuggeſtion of the want of power and authority in the parliament to tax the colonies. All that I ever pretended was, that an American return of members ſeemed to me but a reaſonable indulgence, upon the exerciſe, or rather reſumption into their own hands, of that part
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010116_0034_0F7CE941B6245A00"/>
of ſupreme legiſlation which, conſiſts in raiſing taxes for the ſupport of government, the protection and defence of the whole empire. I never ſaid nor tho't the coloniſts could demand or claim <hi>ex debito juſtitiae,</hi> as Lord Coke has it, an actual repreſentation in the houſe of commons. Upon the reaſonableneſs of an actual American repreſentation I placed my foot, and built my only hope and deſire, and that not for myſelf, nor for the Americans only, but becauſe I thought it would be for the intereſt of the whole empire, and be one means of anſwering ſome very great purpoſes, and among others, that of moſt perfectly conciliating the obedience and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of every individual in the empire to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlative of Great-Britain, a grand object, which has been juſtly tho't worthy the views and contemplation of Majeſty itſelf, and is by our moſt gracious Sovereign accordingly recommended for the advice and aſſiſtance of his greateſt council, in his laſt ſpeech, from the throne, truly worthy a Britiſh-born Prince, and a patriot King.</p>
            <p>It was determined in parliament laſt year that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxes ſhould be raiſed on the coloniſts. I ſuppoſe that internal taxes are granted and impoſed before now. This it was eaſy to foreſee any time theſe ſeven years would ſoon be the caſe. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable that we are virtually and in law repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the houſe of commons, and in the whole parliament. But after all this, there may be a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whenever the adminiſtration ſhall pleaſe to make one of it, namely, whether notwithſtanding the undoubted power and authority of Great-Britain to tax her colonies, and altho' they are already vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented in the houſe of commons, and as part of the whole with the whole in the ſupreme
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010116_0035_0F7CE94274AF7128"/>
legiſlative of the whole, yet as the American do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions are ſuch a vaſt portion of territory, and contain ſo many good and loyal ſubjects, it is or may not be expedient and for the public utility to indulge them with the election and return of a few members. But this being a matter not of right but of favor, if deſired, muſt be humbly aſked as ſuch. For tho' as Lord Coke ſays, the return of members in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is a matter of right in, and not of grace to, the privileged boroughs, &amp;c. yet the caſe of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts is different. Theſe never had a right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn members. Therefore it muſt be an indulgence when granted. The general aſſembly here tax and think they have a right to tax their out towns. Thoſe towns do and muſt think themſelves rightly taxed, when they have all other privileges but that of returning a member. Whether and when they ſhall receive this priviledge depends on the determination of the aſſembly. And when once granted it becomes a right, and they are ever after entitled to a writ <hi>ex debito juſtitiae.</hi> The caſe is juſt the ſame between Great-Britain and her colonies. The parliament of Great-Britain has a right to tax London. London has a right to return members. Theſe are diſtinct independent rights. Some great towns there return no members, yet are taxed. Theſe when it ſhall be tho't proper, will be actually repreſented; and when the adminiſtration thinks it reaſonable, it can permit an actual repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the colonies. There can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree without a judge, who that is we have ſeen. The parliament will ever conſult the good of the whole. To make my meaning clear to the meaneſt capacity; the juriſdiction and authority of a court is one thing, the manner of exerciſing that juriſdiction is another.

This matter ſhall be exemplified from the court of a juſtice of the peace, to the high court of parliament. A juſtice has a legal, juſt and equitable authority, to try a cauſe of 40<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. He tries the cauſe, gives judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment erroneouſly. His judgment is yet a juſt judgment and an equitable judgment, if his error was thro' a blameleſs ignorance of law, or of ſome fact, one of which is to be preſumed. Here are three things, 1. A right to hold courts, or of juriſdiction. 2. This right of juriſdiction actually and honeſtly exerciſed. 3. A right of appeal in the party againſt whom an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment is given. This will hold in the higher executive courts, 'till we come to the dernier reſort of the common law, the houſe of Lords. Even the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of Great-Britain is but a kind of appeal from ſtrict law, to more free, generous and equal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of juſtice, reaſon and good conſcience. There is ſomething ſimilar with regard to the parliament. Government knows of no appeal from their deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is true, they being as to the ſubject next in power and authority to God. Their juriſdiction, power and authority, thro' the whole ſtate and its dependencies, is uncontroulable. They exerciſe it on ſuch objects as they think fit. All that can be done is a meek and patient acquieſcence in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, with a humble hope that as all humane deciſions and determinations depend ultimately upon a knowledge of facts and circumſtances, when new light from thence appears, that the ſupreme legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ever watchful and vigilant for the good of the whole, will appeal of itſelf to its own further expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and information, and alter ſuch former laws as they ſhall think fit. On this proceſs is founded all repeals, additions to and amendments of laws, which are but ſo many further reſearches of the univerſal

mind of the ſtate, for its own preſervation, proſperity and grandeur, which are ever the ſame thing with the good of the whole, <hi>Magna eſt lex et praevalebit. Sulus populi ſuprema lex eſt &amp; eſto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Editor boaſts of his "freedom from a daſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardly, temporizing ſpirit that dares not ſpeak out what every body knows to be true." One would think there was no great heroiſm in telling all the world what they knew before. The Editor has quite miſtaken his talent again, it certainly lies in ſpeaking out boldly in many inſtances what neither he or any body elſe knows or believes to be true. I don't ſay this is the caſe in the revival of the trite obſervations upon the illicit trade between the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Holland, and other parts of Europe. He ſays this is a "vaſt prejudice to Great-Britain and her manufactures," and he might have added, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite damage and hurt to the colonies themſelves. Not only the intereſts of the fair trader, but the character, the lives and health of the whole continent have eventually been ſacrificed, or ſubjected to great danger, for the emolument of a few contraband tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this way, and their patrons in each province. Many in a province have never been able to thrive, it would ſoon ſpoil the buſineſs. But why does not the Editor ſpeak out, and tell all he knows of this trade? I defy his noble courage to do it. A word or two from ſo important a perſonage, might be very ſeaſonable. Why does he not tell the miniſtry of the only poſſible method to ſtop ſmuggling from Europe, and that without any ſeverity? Let him give not only the out-lines, but the whole of a bill for this purpoſe on the back of a card, that would execute itſelf, and render it as impoſſible for him and his friends to trade from any part of Europe but Great-Britain, to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010116_0038_0F7CE946F7BA0978"/>
advantage, as from the moon. If he knows not how to effect this, which e'er long muſt be effected, let him learn a modeſt ſilence. The Editor has confeſſed, that money is nearly if not altogether his <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi> He ſays he is not "ſo ignorant of the world as not to know that money is almoſt become the ſupreme good; and the obligations of conſcience and duty, are but feeble reſtraints, when proſpects of great gain preſent themſelves! <hi>This is true every where.</hi>" He then gravely proceeds to prove it is true of every <hi>one.</hi> After this, the reader may if he can, doubt whether God or mammon is the moſt deſirable object of, and moſt ſerved by this hero.</p>
            <p>The Editor's contemptable flirt at a Proſodian, and his <hi>auceps ſyllabarum,</hi> reminds me of what I have ſeen in a MS. the antiquity of which indeed does not pretend to vie with the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

And 'tis ſubmitted to the impartial public, whether 'tis not now compleat. The whole paſſage is ſo perfect a deſcription of ſome lawyers, not only in Cicero's time but at this day, that I have ventured to prefix the whole paſſage to theſe remarks, where if they properly belong, in the name of truth let them remain, I deſire the reader not to transfer them. If any have a better claim to them than I and their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible indefeaſible</hi> known claim, can in a court of equity be ſupported, let them go, I am not over fond of them.

and Guthries, no Engliſh tranſlation of Cicero, I freely render it thus. "And ſo my Lord Editor, you think a learned lawyer is in himſelf nothing, unleſs to compleat and give the laſt poliſh to his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and fit him for practice and accumulation, he is properly taught to become all things to all men and women too. He muſt, according to you, be a fine gentleman, a ſly, artful petty-fogger, fraught with a good ſtock of low-cunning and braſs, a maſter of grimace, a ſpouter of plays, a bawler of forms, with a voice ſit for the common cryer of a court, <hi>adeptus veré,</hi> at repeating maſs mattins and other muſty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies: To crown all, he ſhould be a delicate chanter of <hi>Lillibullero,</hi> and other ſongs ancient and modern."</p>
