            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is well known, that my ſituation in this wilderneſs is very remote from the metropolis of this province, for which reaſon I have commonly failed of receiving at all, or in ſeaſon, the proclamations given out by government for anniverſary Faſts and Thankſgivings; for which reaſon I have, at the return of ſuch ſeaſons, propoſed to the church and aſſembly, meeting here, to agree among ourſelves upon ſuch days, as we thought to be moſt ſuitable for ſuch ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and we have obſerved them accordingly; and when I have afterwards received the Governor's proclamation, I have never read it, as we had already performed the very thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and required therein, on another day; and ſuppoſed that a further obſervation of it was out of the reaſon of his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and this I have done repeatedly without the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any, or apprehenſion of danger of its being underſtood as expreſſive of the leaſt diſreſpect to authority. But this fall, agreeable to the preſent ſituation of North-America, I waited ſome time to hear that the Continental Congreſs had appointed a day for a general Thankſgiving, as they had done for a Faſt, in hopes that we might have the pleaſure of keeping it in concert with the other colonies, as we did the Faſt, having never heard that they had referred it to the ſeveral colonies to appoint a day for themſelves, or that the Congreſs of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had any deſign to appoint one. While I was thus wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I accidentally ſaw a Connecticut print, wherein was the Governor's proclamation appointing the <hi>16</hi>th day of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be obſerved, as a Thankſgiving in that colony; from whence I thought it reaſonable to conclude, they had knowledge of the doings and deſign of that Congreſs; and had formed their own appointment accordingly: and as the uſual term was fully
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:015220_0004_0F9784FF1E6B23D0"/>
come, I did, on Lord's day, November <hi>12</hi>th, propoſe to the church, and a full congregation, whether, for the afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd reaſons, it was not ſeaſonable, and would not be moſt likely to act in concert with other colonies, if we ſhould appoint the ſame day as Connecticut had done? And after due delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and mentioning and conſidering the moral grounds and reaſons inviting and calling us thereto; I put it to their vote, in which the church and congregation concurred in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>nem. con.</hi> and accordingly that day was publicly and ſolemnly obſerved by us, as an offering to God, for the many favours and bleſſings of his goodneſs to us and our land the laſt year, agreeable to what had been particularly mentioned and agreed upon when we appointed the day.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday, the next week, a Delegate returning from the Congreſs at Exeter, put into my hand their proclamation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the <hi>30</hi>th day of November to be obſerved as a Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving throughout the province. But as we had kept the day, and fully done what was deſired in the proclamation, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as I uſed to do in ſuch caſes, there would be no occaſion for reading it. The people in this town and Norwich, places neareſt to us, having kept thankſgiving as well as we, and I thought none could think it adviſable, nor even lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it; nor the deſire or intention of the congreſs, that any, under our circumſtances, ſhould do ſo; and accordingly I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reading it on the ſabbath, Nov. <hi>26,</hi> not expecting a word would ever have been ſaid about it: But I ſoon heard there was a great clamour in the neighbourhood, and that it was ſpreading faſt abroad, as though we were like to be all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done—that I ſhould be ſpeedily ſent for to Exeter, <hi>150</hi> miles, to anſwer for it before the congreſs, as a tory, and ſhould not fail to be judged an enemy to my country, if I did not keep that day as an anniverſary Thankſgiving, when no reaſon was urged for it but purely and ſolely out of reſpect to the advice of the congreſs.</p>
            <p>On hearing this I ſent out and invited my neighbours to
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:015220_0005_0F9784FFCD9EF810"/>
come and join our evening prayer in the college-hall, and took that opportunity to diſcourſe them on the head, and appealed to them as my witneſſes, that I had ever been, from the firſt, ſteadily and firmly attached to the conſtitutional rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the colonies, and that upon all proper occaſions I had given full teſtimony of all due reſpect to congreſſes; and they could witneſs I had ſo done in appointing our late thankſgiving; and had not been wanting in endeavours, many ways, to aſſiſt and help the colonies, in their ſtruggles hitherto, for a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; and had been as ready to ſacrifice my intereſt and all, for that purpoſe, as any of them; but the making ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn offering to God as had been propoſed, purely and only out of reſpect and obedience to the advice of congreſs, would be an open affront to the King of Zion, unprecedented in America, and expreſſive of a principle abhorred by all proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Some deſired, and accordingly I ordered that the proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be read; and ſome diſcourſe upon it was ſoon very falſely and injuriouſly repreſented abroad, which made ſome anſwer thereto in my ſermon neceſſary; otherwiſe alſo there had been no occaſion for mentioning this ſmall circumſtance here. But notwithſtanding all I could ſay, there were ſome who yet thought we muſt do it to ſave our reputation, and ſeem'd to think me very unadviſed, that I would not do it to ſave my own; but I let them know that I ſhould not ſave it at ſo dear a rate. I told them, if they had a deſire to have a lecture upon that day, they might. And though I thought myſelf unable to preach it, there were a number of young preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſent, who might ſerve them, and were welcome to my pulpit; they ſeem'd not ſatisfied with that, as ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſign they aim'd at. And on Wedneſday, a little before night, they ſent one, as their committee, to enquire whether I would not conſent, that they ſhould call in a miniſter to preach a thankſgiving ſermon the next day, in the college hall. I turned my thoughts on what would likely be the ſhocking conſequences, in our preſent diſtempered ſtate, either of my granting or denying their deſire; and could ſee no alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:015220_0006_0F9785008E5B6A40"/>
but to tell the meſſenger, I would endeavour to preach them a ſermon there myſelf; and any who ſhould think it to be their duty, might call and keep it as an anniverſary thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; and thus we might appear uniform therein, as we were all agreed ſo to abſtain from ſervile labour and recreations as not to interrupt one another. And thus the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was introduced. But three days had not paſſed, before I heard that reports of this affair had been propagated various ways, nearly as ſwiftly as a poſt could carry them, &amp; as falſe as could be neceſſary to their being well calculated to alarm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the zealous liberty-men, as they affect to be becalled, (but may more properly be termed furious non-conſtitutional men) and a great variety of paſſions and principles, ſeemed to operate on this occaſion. Some diſtreſſed, for fear I had, or ſhould incur the diſpleaſure of congreſs or committees—ſome convinced, I had truth and God on my ſide, and nothing to fear—ſome ſeemed ſtill to retain the principle, that civil authority, or advice of congreſs, was binding in this, and other ſacred matters—ſome ſeemed concerned to prove, that the doctrine I had delivered, was conſiſtent with their having obſerved the ſolemnity again, agreeable to the deſires of congreſs— others profeſſing they had kept the day only on political reaſons—others zealous to make out that I had been guilty of ſome treaſon againſt the congreſs; but unhappy for the lyars, they had not taken care firſt to agree among themſelves—and a doleful ſmoke we have; perhaps, as to the reaſons, nature, quality and tendency of it, not much unlike to that in Rev. <hi>ix.2, 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been more particular in this relation, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports gone abroad, are very various. And I am now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to offer to my neighbours, a ſummary of the ſermon, in this unpoliſhed dreſs, not becauſe there have not been vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns publiſhed to the world already, unanſwerable upon the ſubject, but becauſe I apprehend there is preſent neceſſity of ſomething of this nature; and hope there may be ſome real advantage thereby to the more ignorant, who have not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to read what has been better written upon the head,
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:015220_0007_0F97850156B61258"/>
and who need to be adviſed of the preſent danger we are in from that quarter.</p>
            <p>Should ſome crafty enemy to the power of godlineſs, with a Jeſuitical head, as well as heart, have influence in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded congreſs, at a time when the work of God ſhould be revived, and young chriſtians, in the height of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections, not endowed with more prudence than to run into ſuch miſtakes and feibles as have heretofore been common to ſuch, and the enmity of a carnal and lawleſs multitude be raiſed againſt them, on account of their religion, as has alſo been common in ſuch a caſe, and as Chriſt aſſures us we are to expect at ſuch a time; how many occaſions, may we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will eaſily be found, (and eſpecially if lying ſhould ſtill continue in faſhion) to induce ſuch a diſtempered congreſs to interpoſe and adviſe to many things, which the conſciences of loyal ſubjects to the king of Zion would never ſuffer them to comply with; not, even though lawleſs and ſavage mobbs, and parties of ruſſians, ſhould combine to put the ſame in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in ever ſo harſh and lawleſs a manner; and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be countenanced by that advice, which by general conſent, ſhall have, at leaſt, the force of a law to juſtify them. God grant we may never ſee ſuch things as theſe, but ſuch there may be, and it is our prudence to be upon our guard. Yea, the preſent fears and trembling of ſo many, under apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſhocking conſequence, I am now expoſed to ſuffer for my preſent non-compliance, is, I think, ſufficient evidence of great danger from this quarter, and eſpecially if we ſhould be ſo intimidated as to encourage the evil, by yielding one inch to any authority but Chriſt's, in his kingdom. And if theſe things be feared at ſuch a time as this is, what ſhall we have to fear, when alſo from other motives, they ſhall be inſpired, as they are wont to be, by a clear, ſhining of that light which ſhall reprove their ungodly deeds!</p>
            <p>A good civil conſtitution, which provided well for the rights of conſcience, and in the hands of ſuch as were otherwiſe, and
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:015220_0008_0F9785020D567590"/>
at other times, well qualified for government, has often been perverted at ſuch a time, through the heat of their temper, to the great injury and oppreſſion of the godly, who ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any to have been defended and ſecured by law, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their natural and juſt rights. And if the power of natural enmity againſt the light be ſo great, as to induce wiſe men, and rulers, to oppreſſion, notwithſtanding all the reſtraints of a good civil conſtitution, and the weighty conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations they are furniſhed with, what have we to fear, when we have no conſtitution, nor wholſome laws, nor any to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any orders at all, but ſuch as may be dictated by diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearts, to ſerve a cruel deſign? <hi>If the foundations be removed, what ſhall the righteous do?</hi> Then he that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from evil,</hi> and becomes a follower of Chriſt, <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf a prey.</hi> And if chriſtians, at ſuch a time, ſhould think it more ſafe and prudent for them to yield to the temptation, and withdraw from their allegiance to Chriſt, by openly and profeſſedly ſubjecting themſelves at all, to any uſurped dominion in his kingdom; let them conſider that they do then, and thereby, receive the mark of the beaſt in their forehead, and have debaſed themſelves to a baſe ſtate of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to the Man of Sin; and wholly cut themſelves off from all grounds of confidence in God, in an evil day, and ſtand intitled and expoſed to the heavieſt plagues. Rev. <hi>xviii.4.</hi> And however ſmall their offence may appear to them at preſent, they will ſoon find it is not only the wrath of God, in common with other ſinners, which they have to fear, but the wrath of the Lamb, when he ſhall appear to aſſert and vindicate the rights and honors of his kingly office.

                  <p>JESUS ANSWERED, MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD: IF MY KINGDOM WERE OF THIS WORLD, THEN WOULD MY SERVANTS FIGHT, THAT I SHOULD NOT BE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIVERED TO THE JEWS: BUT NOW IS MY KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM NOT FROM HENCE.</p>

            <p>THE Jews, moved with envy againſt CHRIST, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with having given out that he was king; and as what was moſt likely to incenſe and ingage the Roman ſtate againſt him, they had repreſented that he deſigned to ſet up a kingdom in oppoſition to their's: And to anſwer to this charge, he is now brought before Pilate, who examined him whether their charge againſt him was true or falſe. JESUS aſks Pilate, how he came by that information? v. 34.
<q>Sayſt thou this of thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or did others tell it thee of me?</q>
Not that he was unwilling to own it, and all he had ſaid, for this he does freely afterwards; but to let him underſtand,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015220_0011_0F978506F88AF1F0"/>
it was ne'er the more to be believed, becauſe ſuch men as his accuſers were, had ſaid it, and offered to ſwear to it; for they would as ſoon lie to ſerve ſuch their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſign, as ſpeak the truth; and therefore he could have no evidence of the fact which he might ſafely rely and act upon, nor was any evidence ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, while the minds of the multitude were ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, ſhort of his hearing and knowing the things himſelf. To which Pilate replies, "Am I a Jew?" q. d. I am not intereſted in your affairs, but only as you are complained of, and brought before me by your own nation. "What have you done?" In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, JESUS denies their charge, in the light and ſenſe in which they had laid it; or that he had ever ſaid any thing at all of ſetting up a kingdom that ſhould in the leaſt interfere with, or any manner of way be prejudicial to their civil ſtate; but owns he is king of a kingdom of quite another kind and nature, in our text: "My kingdom is not of this world." And that he might effectually remove all grounds of fear or ſuſpicion, which they had endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire from this quarter, he mentions an eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, between his kingdom, and the kingdoms of this world, viz. That his ſervants would, on that occaſion, appear with a martial ſpirit, and with carnal weapons to deliver him from the Power and malice of the Jews.
<q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews.</q>
And to ſatisfy him more fully, he repeats it again, "But now is my kingdom not from hence."</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>THAT CHRIST's kingdom, that is, his viſible church in the world, is not of this world, nor has it any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015220_0012_0F978508542EF630"/>
to, or neceſſary connection with, the kingdoms of this world.</p>
               <p>AND that which I ſhall attempt in this diſcourſe, is,</p>
               <p n="1">I. JUST to point out ſome eſſential differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween CHRIST's kingdom in the world, and a kingdom of this world, or a worldly kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">II. GIVE you ſome reaſons, why it is not lawful, but a ſin againſt GOD, and an open affront to JESUS CHRIST to repeat what we did a fortnight ago, by keeping this day as an anniverſary thankſgiving, purely on and only out of obedience and reſpect to civil authority, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the congreſs. And,</p>
               <p n="1">I. POINT out ſome eſſential differences between CHRIST's kingdom, &amp; the kingdoms of this world. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. CHRIST's kingdom is his by purchaſe, Acts xx.28.
<q>Take heed—to feed the church of GOD, which he has purchaſed with his own blood.</q>—
His propriety in it is ſuch as no earthly kings can make any pretention to:—Worldly kingdoms belong to them only by ſtipulation with the ſubjects, or by a civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſuch as the light of nature or reaſon dictated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. CHRIST's kingdom is built, and reſts wholly upon him, as the only baſis and foundation of it.
<q>Upon this rock (meaning himſelf) will I build my church.</q>
So in this relation to the church, and on account of its dependance upon him, he is often ſpoken of under the metaphor of a foundation ſtone, a tried ſtone, a chief, corner ſtone; and it has been not only once built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this foundation, but is upheld, continues and reſts
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015220_0013_0F978508D1690800"/>
wholly upon it, and can have no being or exiſtence a moment without him; and has no other ground of confidence that it ſhall continue, but the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all-ſufficiency of the founder, who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<q>that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</q>
Mat. xvi.18. But nothing like this is the caſe with the kingdoms of this world; their foundation is a civil conſtitution, and their rights and privileges are ſecured and defended by civil and natural means.—
<q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. CHRIST's kingdom has no civil bounds or limits, but wherever he ſends the goſpel, there it is among any and all nations and languages. Mat. xiii.38. <hi>The field is the world.</hi> The body is but one, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant the members may be from one another, or unlike as to any natural or civil circumſtances. But natural or worldly kingdoms are circumſcribed, and limited by lines and boundaries.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IN a worldly or natural kingdom, the ſubjects retain many natural rights and liberties, which are the birth-right which the GOD of nature has granted, and none has right to take them away. But ſo it is not in CHRIST's kingdom—there is no ſuch thing as a natural right in this ſpiritual kingdom. None has right ſo much as to be, or do, or enjoy the leaſt thing in this kingdom, but by grant from CHRIST, and they have it only in and by his right.</p>
               <p n="5">5. CHRIST is the only ſource of all power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this kingdom: He only can give laws and ordinances to it, and he only can appoint officers, and inveſt them with authority to execute the ſame, Mat.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015220_0014_0F9785099B3B6B98"/>
xxviii.18. Theſe are the gifts which, on his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he gave to men; and they are as much his, and from him as if he had ſent angels immediately from heaven commiſſioned to perform the ſame work. Pſalm lxviii.18. Eph. iv.8—11, 112. And his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, both ordinary and extraordinary, as there was occaſion, he hath ſet in his miſtical body, for the edifying the ſame, as much as GOD has ſet the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the natural body, and appointed them their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective offices, for the benefit of that. See 1 Cor. xii.v.18, to the end. And the higheſt office any ſuſtain in this kingdom, is only declarative and executive; to declare the will of CHRIST, and obey his orders in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the ſame. All the potentates and men upon earth, ha'nt power to conſtitute and authoriſe the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt judicature, not ſo much as an arbitration, for the tryal and deciſion of the ſmalleſt matter in this kingdom; but an attempt to do it would be a bold affront to the kingly office of CHRIST: and the like in a worldly kingdom, would be accounted and puniſhed, as treaſon and rebellion againſt the prince. And the brotherhood, as well as the officers of the church, would do well to take care that they do not intrude upon the kingly office of CHRIST: as they always do when they take, or claim right to take one ſtep in eccleſiaſtical mattes, in, &amp; for which they are not commiſſioned and authoriſed by CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THE kingdom of CHRIST is ſpiritual, but other kingdoms are earthly and worldly.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) THE life of it is ſpiritual. The ſpirit of life in CHRIST JESUS, is the only principle of life in this kingdom. And this was CHRIST's only errand into this world, to give life to it. <hi>I am come, that ye might have life.</hi> John x.10.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) THE light of it is ſpiritual. The book of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015220_0015_0F97850A4F110A58"/>
revelation is the only ſun which guides and directs it, and all the affairs of it. And the church can no more do without that, than the world can do without the natural ſun.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) THE laws of it are ſpiritual; they reſpect, firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and chiefly, the heart, or ſpiritual part, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to rule, direct and controul the conſciences of men: But ſo it is not with the laws of earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which operate no further than the outer man.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) THE officers in this kingdom are all ſpiritual, and as much ſo in the character of CHRIST's officers, as if they were unbodied ſpirits, ſent immediately from heaven, to perform their reſpective offices.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) THE ordinances of this kingdom are all ſpiritual, and not carnal: Theſe are the means, in the hand of the ſpirit, of propagating this kingdom, begetting and increaſing the life, and promoting the growth, the health, ſtrength and beauty of it; all which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: they are the food and phyſic of CHRIST's family, and they who enjoy a fullneſs of them, have a feaſt of fat things. Iſa. xxv.6.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Rewards and puniſhments, and all the weapons for warfare, in this kingdom, are ſpiritual: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are ſealed in the blood of CHRIST, contain all the rewards propoſed; and the cenſures of the church, and the threatnings denounced againſt the impenitent tranſgreſſor, are all the puniſhment to be inflicted in this kingdom. Mat. xviii.17.</p>
               <p>And thus I have hinted, and but juſt mentioned ſome eſſential differences between CHRIST's kingdom, and the kingdoms of this world. I come now,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:015220_0016_0F97850B18804338"/>II. TO give you the reaſons why it is unlawful, and would be an open affront offered to JESUS CHRIST, to keep this preſent day, as an anniverſary thankſgiving, and ſo, without any new moral reaſons, repeat what we did a fortnight ago, purely, and only out of obedience and reſpect to civil authority, or advice of the congreſs.</p>
               <p>BUT here I would premiſe, and deſire it may be well obſerved, that I may not be miſrepreſented,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT I am, and always have been, diſpoſed to ſhew all due reſpect to the advice of congreſſes; and think it to be of great importance ſo to do, under our preſent diſtreſſing circumſtances; and ſhall be glad at any time, when I can conſiſtently with reſpect and duty to CHRIST, the Head of the Church, to comply with their deſire in joining with them in Faſts and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, or in any other reaſonable and lawful matter: and if any ſhall repreſent my refuſal this day, to repeat the offering of a ſolemn anniverſary thankſgiving to GOD, and that purely and only out of reſpect to their advice, as being expreſſive of any diſreſpect to them, more than to any human authority under heaven, will make a falſe and abuſive repreſentation of it. The only reaſon why I refuſe to do it is becauſe I think it would be an open affront to the kingly office of CHRIST, and for no other reaſon do I refuſe to do it. Nor,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do I alledge, as any reaſon at all, againſt my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, any ſeeming oppoſition held forth in the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our congreſs to that which is the object of the Continental, though I had no diſpoſition to join with, or approve of, any ſuch oppoſition, ſhould it appear; for I look upon the provinces, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, to be bound, and that it is of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015220_0017_0F97850BD3E9CF10"/>
to the colonies, in this very dark and critical ſtate of our civil affairs, carefully to obſerve, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to the advice and direction of that body of wiſe and prudent counſellors, who are appointed by the colonies for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>NOR is any ſeeming inconſiſtency, or want of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their directing us to pray for reſtoration of former union, on conſtitutional principles, when they have broken up our conſtitution, or ſuffered it to be done, and introduced ſomething of their own inſtead thereof. Nor their directing us to pray for reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former union between the crown and colonies, and yet not ſo much as mention the king, who is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal in that matter. Whether theſe remarks are juſt, or only the miſapprehenſion of the meaning of terms, or whether they were through the inacuracy of the ſcribe, and inadvertency of the congreſs, amidſt their crowd and hurry of buſineſs, I don't determine; but ſhall leave it to others, as I think ſmall matters ought not to be inſiſted upon, at ſuch a day, when our public affairs are ſo tender and delicate; but ought, as much as may be, to be covered with the mantle of charity, and paſſed over in ſilence. And I would not now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, did not the miſrepreſentations already made, and I ſee like to be made of this matter, oblige me to it. And I now ſolemnly declare, that theſe things make no part of my objection againſt ſuch a ſolemn offering to GOD this day; and whoever ſhall repreſent them to be the reaſon, or any part of my objection thereto, will repreſent me falſely, and be guilty of great abuſe. Nor,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do I object that what we have done, was done as well as it ought to be, and on that account, needleſs to be repeated. We have, no doubt, much reaſon to be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015220_0018_0F97850C8D79C0B8"/>
humbled before a heart-ſearching GOD, for great defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in our offerings to him that day; however, the aſſembly was full, as uſual, and their behaviour decent, orderly and ſolemn; and I have no reaſon to think that we ſhould keep it more acceptably to GOD, if we ſhould repeat it this day, for ſuch reaſons as have been urged; but on the contrary, it would be unlawful, and an open affront offered to JESUS CHRIST, and that for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THERE are no other moral reaſons propoſed in the proclamation, inviting or calling us to it, than were duly conſidered by us when we kept the day the week before laſt, which were the proper ſubject matter of an anniverſary thankſgiving at the end of the year, viz. the ingathering of the fruits and products of the earth; the many public and ſignal deliverances and mercies of the laſt year; which we are aſſured, by GOD himſelf, are the proper ſubject matter of thankſgiving at the cloſe of the year.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS ſolemnity was properly introduced by right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority, and all that authority, below CHRIST, which was eſſential to make the offering binding upon us, viz. by ourſelves, deliberating upon the moral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, and ſolemnly agreeing therein, and by our unanimous vote, binding ourſelves to make the offering jointly and religiouſly to GOD. This being done in a matter that is reaſonable and lawful, we became bound by our own act to perform unto GOD our vow; and this is all the human authority by which any can be bound in ſuch matters. There is nothing binding in any proclamations for ſuch ſolemnities, excepting what is uſually expreſſed in the laſt clauſe, viz. <hi>And all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile labour, and vain recreations, are hereby forbidden on ſaid day</hi>;—which only reſpects public peace and order,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015220_0019_0F97850D4E45EE40"/>
which is properly within the ruler's province; but all the religious matter of it is only counſel, advice and exhortation. And if the moral grounds and reaſons propoſed be juſt and right, people are by them called of GOD thereto, and will be aggravatedly guilty if they neglect it, while the civil ruler is going before, and granting them his aid and aſſiſtance therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN our appointment and obſervance of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, we had proper reſpect to, and were governed and directed therein (as I underſtand the people of theſe colonies have profeſſed to be) by the will of GOD inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to us in his word, and particularly by the ancient inſtitution and ordinance of GOD to his people Iſrael; wherein they were directed by ſuch a ſolemnity, at the end of the year, publicly and unitedly to acknowledge the bounties of divine providence, eſpecially in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of his goodneſs to them in the produce of the earth the year paſt. And by this and other ordinances; as the firſt ſheaf, the firſt of their dough, &amp;c. he would have them know, and bear in mind, that they lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his goodneſs ſtill, and were as much indebted to him for daily ſupplies, as when they were day by day, fed with manna from heaven. See Exod. xxiii.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt obſerve the feaſt of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou haſt gathered in thy labours out of the field.</hi> So chap. xxxiv.22, &amp;c. The moral reaſons of which, ſo far as they are the ſame, are equally binding upon us as they were upon them. But obſerve, neither in the reaſon of the thing, nor in the inſtitution itſelf, is there the leaſt intimation that it was ever to be repeated in the ſame year: ſo that, ſo far as we acknowledge the obligation of that example and inſtitution, or the moral reaſons of it, our repetition of it, would be properly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, that is, <hi>ſuper ſtatutum,</hi> above the ſtatute, or above what is appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015220_0020_0F97850EE533DD60"/>AND moreover, by this ſecond act, or a repetition of the ſame, we ſhould implicitly declare the firſt to be null and void, which to do in this caſe, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, ſolemn mockery, and trifling with the great JEHOVAH: for ſo far as we are directed, governed, or bound by that ordinance of GOD to Iſrael, or the moral reaſon of it, there is no more propriety in our repeating it now, than in repeating the ordinance of baptiſm to the ſame ſubject, or the ordination of men to the ſacred miniſtry. But,</p>
               <p n="4">4. THE repeating this ſolemnity as an offering to GOD, purely out of reſpect to the authority of man, or through fear of incuring the diſpleaſure of man if we neglect it, which is all the reaſon that is urged, or can be aſſigned for our ſo doing, is an open affront to CHRIST, and a bold invaſion of his prerogative, as king in his kingdom, and ſuch reſpect to foreign power, as no earthly prince would bear from a ſubject of his kingdom. We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly aſſured, that CHRIST's kingly office is very dear, and I may ſay, peculiarly dear to him; he has given us this evidence that it is ſo, above any other truth, viz. that he himſelf died a martyr (i. e. a witneſs) for this, and no other truth. This he himſelf declares, upon his tryal before Pilate, when, in anſwer to Pilate's queſtion upon the ſubject, (John xviii.37) he ſays, <hi>I am a king</hi>; and adds, <hi>For this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice,</hi> i. e. that truth which he had then profeſſed, and was then bearing witneſs to. And this is what the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle refers to, 1 Tim. vi.13. <hi>Who before Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late witneſſed a good confeſſion.</hi> His good confeſſion was that he was King, and for that confeſſion he ſuffered what he did.—This was the great crime which the Jews,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015220_0021_0F97850FD334A040"/>
his enemies, charged againſt him; for this he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, arraigned, tried and condemned before Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pilate; and for this confeſſion he was delivered into the hands of mercileſs perſecutors, who mocked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided him in this character, by putting a purple robe, and a crown of thorns upon him, and a reed, inſtead of a ſceptre, in his hand, the mock habit of a king; and for this he ſuffered moſt extreme agony, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the ghoſt upon the croſs; and this was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on his croſs, Luke xxiii.38. <hi>And a ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS: And every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice</hi>; that is, every one that cordially receives this truth which I bear witneſs to, will hear my voice as his king, i. e. he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and obey me. In this character GOD diſtinguiſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured and dignified him, when he raiſed him from the dead, Pſalm ii.6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my king upon my holy hill of Zion</hi>; which the apoſtle tells us, was fulfilled when GOD raiſed him from the dead. Acts xiii.33. and in this character he is ſtill diſtinguiſhingly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father, Eph. i.22. <hi>And hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church.</hi> And in this character he had the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the heavenly hoſt at his aſcenſion; and will have them again at his ſecond coming. And in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he will be eternally honored by ſaints and angels, while they join and ſing, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory and bleſſing.</hi> Rev. ix.12. And, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if CHRIST be ſuch a king, and his kingly office has coſt him ſo dear, it is not a ſmall offence for mortals, boldly to intrude upon it, or yield to any authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, or as ſuperior to his in his kingdom. But let them be wiſe, <hi>and kiſs the Son, and ſerve him with fear, and keep his law as the apple of their eye, leſt he be angry, and they periſh from the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:015220_0022_0F9785104D4A1598"/>5. THIS principle on which it is propoſed that we ſhould keep this day as a thankſgiving to GOD, is the very eſſence of popery; the very cardinal principle, on which a door opens ſufficiently wide enough to let us directly into all the ſuperſtition and idolatry of that church; and there never was any other door to it. See what are the leading characters of the Man of Sin, 2 Theſſ. ii.4. <hi>Who oppoſeth, and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that he as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God</hi>; that is, he claims power and authority in matters of religion, and his authority he inforces, and will have ſubmiſſion yielded to it, rather than to GOD's, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of CHRIST's kingdom. And when men are once ſo void of reſpect to the kingly office of CHRIST, as to yield this point, through any temptation, they are then at the beck of the Man of Sin, and have ſet their face to wander after the beaſt; and have received his mark in their forehead: that is, they profeſs ſubjection, and openly yield obedience to human power in ſpiritual matters. The <hi>forehead</hi> is the part moſt viſible, and therefore the place moſt ſuitable for a public mark of diſtinction. So their profeſſion of reſpect, and public acts of obedience to human authority, in CHRIST's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is the great moral mark of diſtinction, by which they may certainly be known; and this mark ſhould we now wear, if we had this day complied with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of ſuch a ſolemn offering to GOD, and that only upon ſuch grounds and reaſons as have been urged.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THIS is the very principle of perſecution for CHRIST's ſake, and the great and only door at which it has come into the church, under chriſtian princes, from time to time. And what rivers of blood has this very principle produced! There is no claſhing of rights,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015220_0023_0F9785130A439428"/>
laws, liberties or intereſts of theſe kingdoms, one with another; but when each keeps within its own ſphere, there is perfect peace, and they mutually and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſerve and promote each other. But when civil power encroaches an inch upon CHRIST's prerogative, a ſanctified and enlightened conſcience can never be compelled to a compliance; and if they are of the truth, and hear CHRIST's voice, no inſtruments of cruelty will avail any thing in this attempt. And whether ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts be made, by reproach, or threats, or ſtripes, or faggots, or any other way of ſuffering, to bring them an inch towards a compliance with ſuch authority, it is properly perſecution for CHRIST's ſake.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ANY, even the leaſt yielding in this caſe, is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a direct and leading ſtep to a flood of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, however remote it may ſeem at preſent. The evil don't alter its nature, becauſe thouſands never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is, but as ſecurely run into it, as into any other acts, and imagine they have done no harm; it is yet an affront offered to CHRIST, and renouncing alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him; and that which they would rather part with their lives, and all, as others have done, than to be guilty of it, if their conſciences were only enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſanctified. So it is not at all leſs dangerous, or the more remote from us, becauſe thouſands make light of it, and think it to be but a little thing, and the danger too remote to demand their care or thoughts about it. Many are ſo ſtupid as to think after this ſort of the height of impiety, and all manner of immoralities; and think it ſtrange that you run not with them into the ſame exceſſes; and will reproach you for your tenderneſs of conſcience. This has commonly been the religious ſtate of things, and this always the way in which the myſtery of iniquity has made its way into the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015220_0024_0F9785140048D0A0"/>
church of GOD. They may ſay,
<q>what ſo great harm in keeping an anniverſary, and performing religious rites in memory of ſuch and ſuch eminent ſaints whoſe names ought to be kept in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? What ſo great a thing is the making a croſs with your finger upon your forehead, or breaſt, a few times in divine worſhip, or changing a garment, and a thouſand other things, ſmall and indifferent in themſelves? Your non-compliance with them, as they are injoin'd by authority, and approv'd and practiſed by the multitude, will expoſe you to many and great evils; the rulers will take you in hand, and will countenance parties of ruffians in a very courſe manner of dealing with you, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
But theſe things, little as they are in themſelves, are ſo great when injoin'd by human authority, and to be performed in religious worſhip, out of reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to man, that ſuch by thouſands as were of <hi>the truth,</hi> and had <hi>heard Chriſt's voice,</hi> have choſe rather to meet death, in its greateſt outward horrors, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the leaſt of them, and that becauſe it would be an open affront to CHRIST's kingly office, an act of high treaſon and rebellion againſt the King of Zion. And as it is in other vices, our compliance in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will make way for another. It will make the practice familiar, put a reputation upon it, and weaken the hands of ſuch as are of the truth, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to teſtify againſt it.</p>
               <p>IF ſuch power ſhould be acknowledged, in matters of religious worſhip, or any ſpiritual ſacrifices and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to GOD, what a ſhocking door would be open, for precepts, or authoritative advice, in a thouſand things which would not be complied with; and who knows what trying ſcenes would enſue? I tremble at
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015220_0025_0F978514112E02A0"/>
the conſequences, and eſpecially in a part of the country where experienced chriſtians are ſo rare, and ſo obſcure, and the religion in faſhion ſo much in the form only, without the power.</p>
               <p n="8">8. SUCH a compliance as has been propoſed, would be a very diſgraceful, and it may be a very pernicious precedent, to thoſe that ſhall come after us; and ſuch a precedent as I am reſolved, by the grace of GOD, not to leave, to be improved in any degree for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encouragement of ſpiritual tyranny and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in future times. GOD grant me courage and fortitude to meet death a thouſand times, in any form, rather than yield one inch towards ſuch a compliance, or do that whereby my dear pupils, the preſent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this ſeminary, or any in a future ſucceſſion, ſhould be led to think, that the founder of it did not eſteem ſuch a treatment of the kingly office of the great REDEEMER, to be a crime of the blackeſt die; and ſuch a ſolemn offering profeſſedly to GOD, only upon ſuch grounds and reaſons, and for ſuch a purpoſe, as have been (or under our circumſtances can be) urged, to be the height of profaneſs and impiety, in his eyes who ſearches all hearts, and cannot be deceived by any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes.</p>
               <p>IF I were only in a private capacity, I might poſſibly be excuſable, in enjoying my own opinion, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing agreeable thereto in ſilence. But conſidering my public character and connections, I look upon it to be my duty, on the preſent occaſion, and under the preſent alarming ſituation of our civil, and eſpecially our religious affairs, to bear this public teſtimony againſt ſuch an encroaching evil, before the day of calamity which is threatened in conſequence of it ſhall commence;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015220_0026_0F978514CD99DF60"/>
and hope it may be a means to awaken numbers to a due conſideration of the nature and importance of that which I have offered; and ſo ſerve, either to prevent the ſtorm which is threaten'd, or moderate the rage and fury of it if it ſhould ariſe. But I cloſe this diſcourſe with ſome</p>

            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>IN a word of exhortation to all, and eſpecially to the members of this ſeminary, whom GOD in his providence has committed to my immediate care. The great peace and unanimity that has now ſo long ſubſiſted among you, and which appears to be, in ſome good meaſure, upon the beſt and moſt permanent principles, muſt be acknowledged to be a ſignal favour and ſmile of heaven; and the continuance of it will, under GOD, be our beſt defence and ſecurity, in a day of temptation, when your loyalty to CHRIST, may be tried by frowns and by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by promiſes and threatnings, and every motive that can be ſet before you. And ſurely, it is your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be prepared for ſuch a time: And that you may ſo be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. LOOK thoroughly into this ſubject, and form your judgment and principles therein by the word of truth, and not by the floating, undigeſted opinions of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, giddy, ſtupid, unprincipled multitude, who would carry all before them by their ſcoffs, deriſion, and furious clamours againſt you; and are the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to erect the pile for your execution, if they had any to juſtify and vindicate them in ſo doing. If you look well into this matter, you will find this truth to be of the ſame nature and importance, and as much to juſtify your holding faſt the principle, as there ever
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015220_0027_0F978515A27F9E88"/>
was when clouds of witneſſes ſeal'd the truth of it with their blood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. SEE that you have true principles of loyalty to CHRIST in your hearts; ſuch as real knowledge of, and acquaintance with him—ſupreme love to him—a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith and confidence in him—full contentment with his great and precious promiſes, as your only portion and heritage forever—and that hope which looks to them, and is an anchor to the ſoul, ſure and ſteadfaſt —with a pure love, and fervent charity one towards another—and a ſpiritual mind that the word of GOD may dwell in you richly. And this it is to be <hi>of the truth,</hi> as CHRIST ſays in the afore cited text, and ſo <hi>you will hear his voice, and follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF we be rooted and grounded in theſe, and other graces of the ſpirit, we ſhall endure the trial, and do honour to our divine maſter, in a day of temptation; but otherwiſe, our courage will fail like Peter's, who, though firſt and higheſt in profeſſion of attachment to his maſter, was firſt and baſeſt in a cowardly denial of him, when the hour of trial came. And without this, we ſhall all be like chaff, expoſed to be turned, and blown about by every wind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BE not diſmayed at the firſt appearance of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for CHRIST. Temptations of this kind, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt ſucceſsful at their firſt attack. The croſs is always the moſt formidable at a diſtance—Peter found it to be ſo; when it is once taken up, it is eaſy and light. Matt. xi.30. The apoſtle therefore bids us abſtain from all appearance of evil. 1 Theſſ. v.22. And to the ſame purpoſe, in a caſe ſimilar to our's, ſays, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not.</hi> Col. ii.21. And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015220_0028_0F9785164E6A9510"/>
to this was the adviſe of a godly divine, ſuffering in this very cauſe, who, in his parting charge to his flock ſays, "Touch not a bracelet of the ſcarlet whore." It is much eaſier to keep our ground, than to recover it when we have given way to temptation ever ſo little.</p>
               <p n="4">4. CONSIDER well how many and how great the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are, which CHRIST has ſet before you, to excite and enable you to perſevere in a loyal adhearance to him at all hazards. How noble the cauſe! How ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient the aid provided for you therein! How honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the combat, under ſuch a Captain and Leader! How ſure the victory! How peaceful your end! And how rich and glorious your eternal reward!</p>
