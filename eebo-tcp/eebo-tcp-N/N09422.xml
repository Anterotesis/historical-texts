            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE APPEAL FARTHER DEFENDED.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Author of <hi>an Appeal to the Public, in Behalf of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in America,</hi> publiſhed his general <hi>Defence</hi> of it, he was in Hopes of having no farther Occaſion to appear in the Controverſy about AMERICAN BISHOPS. Not that he looked upon what he had written as unanſwerable; for he knew that there is a Sort of People that can <hi>anſwer</hi> any Thing; but he believed that enough had been ſaid on the Subject, on both Sides, to enable the Public to judge of the Matter in Diſpute. The Caſe of the American Epiſcopalians had been fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated, in Order to ſhew the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of their having reſident Biſhops; on the other Hand, Objections in ſufficient Quantity, had been offered againſt ſuch an Appointment; and a particular Reply had been made to every Objection that had been urged or ſuggeſted: And when a Controverſy is carried on thus far, the By-ſtanders, in his Opinion, are commonly as able to form a proper Judgment of the Merits of the Cauſe, as after the Diſputants have proceeded to Rejoinders, Sur-rejoinders and Rebutters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:012007_0009_0F8940DF2DD571B8"/>WHETHER Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> is of a different Opinion or not, is beſt known to himſelf. As he has not thought proper to tell what Motives excited him to <hi>reſume</hi> his Pen in this Controverſy, the Reader is left to diſcover them for himſelf, as well as he can; and if he ſhould happen to miſtake, in a Matter of ſuch high Curioſity, it may not be his own Fault. Surely it could not be the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> attending ſuch an Employment! For my Part, I am unable to conceive that any Man can be <hi>fond</hi> of the rough and diſagreeable Work of public Controverſy, more eſpecially at the Doctor's <hi>Time of Life:</hi>—Unleſs he ſhould be in the Condition of old <hi>Henry Valeſius,</hi> of whom his Biographer informs us, in Words which I ſhall leave for the Doctor to tranſlate, that
<q>natus Annis <hi>ſeptuaginta,</hi> nec ſibi ipſe videbatur Senex, nec aliis videri volebat;</q>
and that he candidly confeſſed, that
<q>ante acceptas quaſdem a Gronovio Literas, Se de Senectute ſua nunquam cogitaviſſe.</q>
And therefore I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpect that Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> was ſenſible of the Inſufficiency of his former Exertions againſt an American Epiſcopate, and found it neceſſary to make another Effort to ſupport the Cauſe he had undertaken to maintain. And if he had a farther View of retrieving his own literary Character, he is not to be blamed; for, in the Opinion of many ſenſible People, <hi>that,</hi> as well as his Cauſe, had conſiderably ſuffered, by the Appearance and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a certain noxious Pamphlet, known by the Title of—THE APPEAL DEFENDED.</p>
            <p>BUT I will not ſpend Time in trying to account for what, after all, may be <hi>unaccountable</hi>; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can the Doctor expect me to take the Trouble of ſettling his Affairs with his Readers. It is more
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012007_0010_0F8940DFEE94B2A8"/>
properly my Buſineſs, at this Time, to aſſign the Reaſons why I requeſt again to be heard
<q>before the Tribunal of the Public,</q>
after having offered my Plea in Behalf of the American Epiſcopalians, and made my DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>AND here I might plead the natural Right every Man has to defend himſelf as often as he is attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that it is the proper Buſineſs of a Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to reply to every Thing objected by his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: But I ſhall not avail myſelf of theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, becauſe I muſt confeſs that I have not been governed by them myſelf. In the Doctor's laſt Piece, now coming under Examination, the Attack never appeared to me to be ſo formidable as to make a regular Defence neceſſary; nor the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an American Epiſcopate to be of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as to deſerve a formal Reply. I could very freely, without Anxiety or Reluctance, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Matter in Diſpute to the Judgment of the impartial, without offering another Sentence on the Subject.</p>
            <p>BUT the Misfortune is, that, while many undertake to be Judges, in this Caſe, without any Deſire or Inclination to examine what is ſaid <hi>on the other Side,</hi> there are but few Perſons, in thoſe Colonies wherein Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s Pamphlets have chiefly abounded, (and for which I have an Affection as well as he) who have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reading what has been offered in Favour of the Epiſcopate propoſed. With Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe Colonies therefore, which are the chief Objects of the Doctor's Concern, he and his Adherents, one would think, might have been very quiet and contented with ſo conſiderable an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012007_0011_0F8940E0AD2484C0"/>
But no: They were alarmed, it ſeems, for what he calls, p. 141, <hi>the great Cauſe</hi> of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; and it was feared that even the Report, or oral Tradition, of what had been urged in Behalf of American Biſhops, might render the People of New-England favourable to the Plan for introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the Colonies. It was therefore thought proper, by Way of Prevention or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and perhaps at the ſame Time as a <hi>Cordial</hi> for the Doctor after ſo great a Fatigue as he had lately undergone in <hi>anſwering</hi> the <hi>Appeal</hi>; that the <hi>Thanks</hi> of his <hi>aſſociated</hi> Brethren ſhould be formally voted him for the Exploit; and that this Vote ſhould be circulated through the Country in the <hi>public Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>: By which Contrivance much greater Force was given to his Pamphlet than it originally poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For the Body of the People in New-England, who had heard ſo little in Behalf of the Biſhops propoſed, and ſo much againſt them; upon ſeeing this Decree of a public Triumph or <hi>Ovation</hi> made in Favour of the Doctor; had it hardly in their Power to conceive otherwiſe, than that the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> had been fairly vanquiſhed, and that the epiſcopal Clergy and their Friends, under the Cover of plauſible Pretences, had formed a Plot to deprive them of their religious Liberties, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh over them an eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of a tyrannical Nature, and to raiſe high Contributions upon them, for the Support of—it as had been originally objected.</p>
            <p>IN Order therefore to undeceive them, and any others who have been impoſed upon by theſe or the like Arts; and to ſhew that, notwithſtanding the Pretence, none of theſe Objections have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably ſupported, and indeed that no Objection of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012007_0012_0F8940E16D63F6F0"/>
any Conſequence can be reaſonably made againſt an Epiſcopate on the Plan that has been offered; the Author has been urged by many of his Friends, to make this <hi>farther Defence</hi> of it; which they think to be neceſſary under ſuch Circumſtances. As his own Opinion differed not greatly from theirs, he ſoon conſented to ſubmit to the Taſk<note n="*" place="bottom">What is <hi>now</hi> preſented to the Reader, would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much ſooner, had not the Author waited to ſee what Productions worthy of Notice, the Publication of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> and <hi>Appeal defended</hi> in LONDON, might occaſion in that Quarter.</note>; and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it he will endeavour to ſhew, among other Things, that there is a fairer and better Way of judging of the Matters in Diſpute, than either from the public <hi>Vote of Thanks</hi> before-mentioned, or from the Doctor's confidently ſaying, in his Title Page, that in his <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> the Author's <hi>Miſtakes are rectified, his falſe arguing refuted, and the Objections againſt the planned Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate ſhewn to remain in full Force, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that he has offered to render them invalid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctor's Pamphlet is entitled, A <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Appeal defended</hi>; but the Reader muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence, that it is, in any Senſe, a Reply to the <hi>whole</hi> of it. The larger Part, containing many Things that are very material in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, is paſſed over without the leaſt Notice. I ſhall not follow the Doctor's Example in this; intending, ſince I have undertaken a Review of his Performance, not to paſs by any Thing that can be thought to be either pertinent or plauſible.</p>
            <p>IN taking my Leave of him, I propoſed, in Caſe the Diſpute about an American Epiſcopate
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012007_0013_0F8940E22CA50420"/>
ſhould be farther continued,
<q>that the Debate ſhould be reduced within a narrower Compaſs; that nothing which does not immediately relate to the Merits of the Cauſe, ſhould be offered on either Side<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 266.</note>.</q>
But he will not allow that I had any Right to propoſe ſuch a Limitation; ſince in the <hi>Appeal</hi> and the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> I had not ſtrictly adhered to the Point of an American Epiſcopate myſelf. But I know of nothing in the <hi>Appeal</hi> that does not immediately relate to this Point, except the two firſt Sections, wherein a 'Sketch' of the general Arguments in Favour of Epiſcopacy was given, and the Nature of the epiſcopal Office was explained. Theſe were <hi>introductory</hi> to the Buſineſs in Hand, and were thought to have a Tendency to put the Plea for the Epiſcopate requeſted in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Light, by ſhewing that the late Application of our <hi>Convention</hi> for American Biſhops proceeded from their real <hi>Principles</hi>; which was certainly the Caſe. But ſeeing the ill Uſe made of theſe intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory Sections by my Adverſaries, in my <hi>Defence,</hi> I paſſed over all that had been ſaid on the general Subject of Epiſcopacy, ſo far as relates to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Scripture and the primitive Church; being deſirous of reducing the Controverſy to one Point; namely, the Reaſonableneſs and Propriety of an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopate.</p>
            <p>DR. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> in his firſt Pamphlet, had not only enlarged on the introductory Sections, but had rambled beyond the Bounds of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> in a long Epiſode about the Sentiments of our firſt Reformers, (to ſay nothing of other Inſtances) in Order invidiouſly to repreſent the epiſcopal Clergy in the Colonies as having departed from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012007_0014_0F8940E3D70566F0"/>
Principles of the Church of England: And I found it neceſſary to ſpend no inconſiderable Part of my Reply in ſetting this Matter in its proper Light.—After what had thus paſſed between us, I think I had a Right to
<q>propoſe a new Plan of Operations,</q>
in Caſe Hoſtilities ſhould continue; which I did—not intending, as he miſrepreſents the Matter, <hi>to put it out of the Power of others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon the greateſt Part of what I had been pleaſed to offer,</hi>—but only deſiring that a due Regard to the Patience of our Readers, upon which we had treſpaſſed, might, for the future, be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maintained. The Doctor is of Opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that if <hi>I had taken the whole</hi> of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Miſconduct <hi>upon myſelf, no one would have thought it an</hi> ASPERSION. I am of the ſame Opinion too; becauſe no one before <hi>him</hi> ever <hi>did</hi> think of calling That an <hi>Aſperſion,</hi> which a Man <hi>takes upon himſelf.</hi> It is poſſible he intended to ſay a <hi>Self-Aſperſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAD farther propoſed, ſhould the Controverſy be continued,
<q>that no Invective or Abuſe,—no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſavors of Bigotry or Barbarity, ſhould be ſuffered to mingle in the Debate; but that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, ſober Reaſoning ſhould decide it.</q>
The Doctor thinks I could <hi>have made the Propoſal with a better Grace, if I had more fully exemplified it</hi> myſelf. Indeed he immediately confeſſes, p. 6, (I requeſt the Reader to take particular Notice of the Paſſage, becauſe it is the <hi>only</hi> one in which he ſeems to be in a tolerably good Humour, while he ſpeaks of me) that my <hi>Air in writing ſometimes carries the Appearance of Mildneſs and Moderation; nor is it generally miſbecoming the Gentleman, or the Chriſtian.</hi> I will give him all due Credit for this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012007_0015_0F8940E46D7A6520"/>
Conceſſion; and I think it concerns me to make the moſt of it.</p>
            <p>BUT in the next Words he cries out concerning me: <hi>Will any pretend that his Manner is not too often very like their's who are actuated by a Spirit of Bigotry?</hi> Perhaps in ſome Inſtances this may have been the Caſe, although I am not conſcious of it myſelf, and am unable to point out in what particular Paſſages. I know the extreme Difficulty of carrying on a Controverſy with peeviſh and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Adverſaries, without ſometimes dropping Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that may appear, to an indifferent Perſon, to <hi>ſavor of Bigotry,</hi> or a blind Confidence. But I can truly declare, that I have endeavoured to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Kind of Failings.—He goes on: <hi>Has he no where treated his Opponents with Invective and Abuſe?</hi> With ſome little <hi>Invective</hi> on certain Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, I confeſs; but not with <hi>Abuſe,</hi> as the Word implies unkind or ſevere Treatment that is undeſerved. <hi>Are there no Inſtances in which he has had Recourſe to evaſive Art, rather than ſolid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?</hi> Not a ſingle one, I affirm, to the beſt of my Knowledge. Again: <hi>Has he never ſubſtituted popular</hi> EXCLAMATION <hi>in the Room of good Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> —The Doctor moſt probably meant here po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Declamation; as in p. 85, he complains of my having made <hi>a declamatory Application to the Paſſions.</hi> Popular <hi>Declamation</hi> is too often the Fault of controverſial Writers; but as to <hi>popular Exclamation,</hi> it is
<q>novum Crimen, et ante hunc Diem inauditum.</q>
How far the <hi>Appeal defended</hi> was a Compoſition of a <hi>declamatary</hi> Nature, is freely ſubmitted to the Judgment of the Impartial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012007_0016_0F8940E52D5C4630"/>BUT farther: <hi>Do we never find him diſingenuouſly endeavouring to make others think he has anſwered</hi> POWERFULLY, <hi>when he himſelf knew he had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Purpoſe? Nay, has he never ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his own Character as only to laugh loud when ſo preſſed as to be unable to make a juſt or ſober Reply?</hi> As the Doctor has not attempted to point out par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances of this Conduct, I can only ſay, in general, that in anſwering <hi>him</hi> I never thought myſelf <hi>ſo preſſed as to be unable to make a juſt or ſober Reply</hi>; and conſequently that I was under no Temptation to put off upon the Reader what was <hi>nothing to the Purpoſe,</hi> for a <hi>powerful</hi> Anſwer. Even <hi>laughing loudly</hi> on ſome Occaſions is no Crime nor Diſhonour; and in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> I am not conſcious of having laughed at all, but in ſuch Caſes as would diſpoſe every attentive Reader to laugh with me. In a Word, I meant nothing in any Part of it, but to treat both the Doctor and the Public fairly; and if I failed in any Inſtances, it was contrary to my Deſire and Intention, and it is more than hitherto I have been able to diſcover. What the Sentiments of my Friends are, upon this Head, I ſhall leave for them to expreſs as they think proper. I know not that they have made any Complaints, either as to the Matter or Manner of my former <hi>Defence</hi>; and I truſt they are not diſpoſed to complain of any Thing, like the Doctor's Friends, on Account of its being <hi>candid.</hi> For he tells us, that ſome of his Friends have complained of his <hi>Manner</hi> in anſwering the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, as over-mild and</hi> CANDID. p. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT enlarging farther on what is meerly perſonal, between the Doctor and me, I ſhall now proceed to conſider ſuch Paſſages of what he calls
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012007_0017_0F8940E5EDB68F78"/>
his <hi>Reply,</hi> as are moſt worthy of Notice. And the firſt that occurs is in p. 11. In an introductory Obſervation I had requeſted of every Reader to take Notice, that Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> as well as my other Opponents, had given up the great Point in Diſpute. To ſupport this Obſervation, I quoted ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which were ſuppoſed to be a full Proof of it. The Doctor now denies <hi>that they contain that in them which</hi> LOOKS LIKE <hi>his giving up the main Point in Debate.</hi> p. 12. As this is a Matter of great Importance in this Controverſy, and what he calls p. 13, <hi>the moſt eſſential Part of the Diſpute,</hi> I beg Leave to review it with particular Care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that it deſerves the Reader's Attention, as much as any Thing contained in the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>THE particular Paſſages alledged in Proof of the Doctor's having given up the great Point in Diſpute, by conſenting to the Epiſcopate in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the following. <hi>We deſire no other Liberty, than to be left unmoleſted in the Exerciſe of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principles, in ſo far as we are good Members of Society. And we are perfectly willing Epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould enjoy this Liberty to the full. If they think Biſhops, in their appropriated Senſe, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, we object not a Word againſt their having as many of them as they pleaſe, if they will be content to have them with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority altogether derived from Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Anſwer to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 180.</note>. Again: <hi>It is not ſimply the Exerciſe of any of their religious Principles that would give the leaſt Uneaſineſs, nor yet the Exerciſe of them under as many</hi> PURELY SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITUAL <hi>Biſhops as they would wiſh to have; but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012007_0018_0F8940E6AE5DF308"/>
their having Biſhops under a</hi> STATE ESTABLISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT <note n="§" place="bottom">Anſwer to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 189.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor allows the Quotations to have been fairly made; and the Queſtion here is, whether in theſe Paſſages, he does, or does not, conſent to our having the Epiſcopate propoſed in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> In order fairly to determine this Point, Recourſe muſt be firſt had to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that it may be ſeen what Sort of an Epiſcopate it propoſes, and whether it be the ſame that the Doctor conſents to. Now this is clearly and fully deſcribed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words.
<q>It has been long ſettled by our Friends and Superiors at home, and the Clergy of this Country have often ſignified their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof, and Acquieſcence therein— that the Biſhop to be ſent to America, ſhall have no Authority, but <hi>purely of a ſpiritual and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church, and not from the State</hi>—that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity nor Diſſenters of any Denomination—that the Biſhops ſhall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil or religious, of Churchmen or Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters —that, in particular, they ſhall have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with the Probate of Wills, Letters of Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip and Adminiſtration, or Marriage-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, nor be Judges of any Caſes relating thereto—but, that they ſhall ONLY <hi>exerciſe the original Duties of their Office</hi> as before ſtated, <hi>i. e. ordain and govern the Clergy, and adminiſter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> to thoſe who ſhall deſire it. This, without any Reſervation or Equivocation, is the exact Plan of an American Epiſcopate which has
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012007_0019_0F8940E76E862030"/>
been ſettled at home; and it is the <hi>only one,</hi> on which Biſhops have been requeſted here, either in our general or more particular Addreſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Appeal,</hi> p. 79.</note>.</q>
Nor is there any Thing, in any Part of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> from which it can be infered, that a different E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate from this was intended or deſired.</p>
            <p>NOW the Doctor, in the Paſſages quoted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares for himſelf, as well as in Behalf of others, that he is willing we ſhould have as many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as we want, provided only, that we are <hi>content to have them with</hi> AUTHORITY ALTOGETHER DERIVED FROM CHRIST—that they are PURELY SPIRITUAL—and not upon the Footing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT. But theſe are ſpecifically and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the very Biſhops propoſed in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> The Biſhops requeſted are thoſe expreſsly ſaid
<q>to have no Authority, but ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church,</q>
and conſequently ALTOGETHER FROM CHRIST. Their Authority and Powers are to be intirely 'of an eccleſiaſtical Nature,' they being intended only
<q>to ordain and govern the Clergy, and to adminiſter Confirmation;</q>
and conſequently they are to be PURELY SPIRITUAL.</p>
            <p>THE Government is not expected or deſired to give them any Support or peculiar Protection; and conſequently they are not to be on the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT. From theſe <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> every Reader can, and every unbiaſſed Reader will, draw the <hi>Conſequence</hi> for himſelf, that THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> allows of the Epiſcopate propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and has given up the great Point in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:012007_0020_0F8940E82E898F18"/>HE aſſerts notwithſtanding, that the Biſhops in the above-mentioned Plan, and thoſe he ſpoke of in the above recited Paſſages, are ESSENTIALLY DIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERENT —<hi>as widely different, as this World is from another.</hi> But what Aſſurance is this! A Man that can affirm at this Rate, is fit to undertake, what a common Genius will not attempt, to prove that 'Darkneſs is Light, and Light Darkneſs.' I would willingly put the moſt favourable Conſtruction upon this Conduct; and therefore I impute it to the Perplexity he was under, which did not permit him to ſee what is ſo evident to others.</p>
            <p>AND indeed he ſeems to have puzzled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed himſelf not a little, with the Term <hi>ſpiritual Biſhops.</hi> For ſometimes he uſes it in the Senſe wherein all Mankind have ever underſtood it, as ſignifying Biſhops that have
<q>no Authority but of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical Nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State,</q>
which are the Biſhops of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> Thus he allows, p. 92, that we might have purely <hi>ſpiritual Biſhops,</hi> by applying to the Biſhop of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> or the <hi>Moravians.</hi> But why then may we not have Biſhops <hi>as</hi> ſpiritual, if we receive them from England? Ordination to the ſame Office, by any one Biſhop in Chriſtendom, conveys exactly the ſame Authority, to the ſame Degree, as Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by any other Biſhop, according to the Opinion of the Church in all Ages; and the Powers thus conveyed are not temporal, but ſpiritual. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Powers which Biſhops poſſeſs in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are not derived from their Ordination, but confered upon them by ſome Law or Act of the State. Where Biſhops receive ſuch Powers, they are in Part temporal Biſhops; but where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012007_0021_0F8940E8ECDCE0E8"/>
none, they are <hi>purely ſpiritual.</hi> Before the Time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> all Biſhops were ſuch; and ſince his Time, Biſhops, without any temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are as <hi>purely ſpiritual</hi> as they were before it, every Power which belongs to them as Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſpiritual Nature. The original and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Powers of Biſhops, are thoſe of Ordination, Government and Confirmation. Now the Doctor himſelf, p. 103, calls <hi>ordaining</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> Power <hi>ſpiritual</hi>; and for the ſame Reaſons, <hi>confirming</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be ſpiritual likewiſe. And when Biſhops poſſeſs theſe Powers, without any Mixture of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Authority, they are <hi>purely ſpiritual.</hi> But in other Places, and particularly wherever he denies that ſpiritual Biſhops are the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> he uſes the Words in a Senſe that is excluſively his own; and by <hi>purely ſpiritual</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, he evidently means Biſhops that are <hi>pure</hi> SPIRITS, without any bodily Qualities; which laſt, it ſeems, are the only Biſhops he is now willing to allow us.</p>
            <p>HE appears to have been equally embarraſſed with the word <hi>Eſtabliſhment.</hi> The Eſtabliſhment of a Religion, or of any particular Order of Men always implies, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> ſome <hi>peculiar</hi> Countenance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the State, but all that is deſired for the Biſhops of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> is a Conſent to their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, or, <hi>at moſt,</hi> the Approbation of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, and that <hi>common</hi> Protection which is freely granted to the various religious Denominations throughout the Britiſh Dominions. Nothing but wilful or natural Blindneſs can avoid ſeeing, that there is a wide Difference between ſuch a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a <hi>State-Eſtabliſhment.</hi> The Doctor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſes the Word <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> in the Senſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012007_0022_0F8940E9ACD6AEF8"/>
wherein others uſe it; and it was not ſuſpected that he departed from its common Acceptation in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Appeal.</hi> And therefore when he ſignified his Conſent to our having Biſhops that ſhould not be under a <hi>State-Eſtabliſhment,</hi> I made no Scruple to affirm, that he conſented to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> which was not to be under a <hi>State-Eſtabliſhment,</hi> and conſequently that he had given up the main Point in Debate—which had he uſed common Language in its common Acceptation, was certainly the Caſe. In order to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he now declares in his <hi>Reply,</hi> that he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied no ſuch Conſent; and to my Queſtion—
<q>Does this Plan propoſe an Eſtabliſhment of the Church?</q>
—He roundly anſwers, <hi>it undoubtedly does.</hi> p. 142. So that by <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> now, he means no more than what is propoſed in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> for an American Epiſcopate, which is exactly neither more nor leſs than what all conſiſtent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mean by the word <hi>Toleration.</hi> And ſuch are the Fervors of his anti-epiſcopal Zeal, that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing American Biſhops ſhould be eſtabliſhed in <hi>his</hi> Senſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> tolerated, or ſuffered to exiſt in any Form, excepting perhaps that of <hi>pure Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE proceeded on the favourable Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Doctor was perplexed himſelf in the Uſe of theſe Terms. If this was not the Caſe, it was ſtill worſe; for he muſt have intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex his Readers. 'Phenomena' of this Kind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do appear 'in the Regions of Controverſy.' When a Writer is dextrous in playing Tricks with Words, he can, at any Time, raiſe a Miſt, and make his Eſcape; and when we think that we have ſecured him in Cords of his own twiſting, we are ſurprized to find, that—
<q>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012007_0023_0F8940EA6C9204D8"/>Effugiet tamen haec ſceleratus Vincula Proteus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctor complains that my Repreſentation of the Matter makes him to have <hi>wrote</hi> [written] <hi>many Scores of Pages in Oppoſition to that, againſt which he had not a Word to object.</hi> p. 12—and to have <hi>acted a weak, ridiculous and inconſiſtent Part.</hi> p. 13. The Fact is truly repreſented, whatever it may imply; and I am not anſwerable for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. I am diſpoſed to think as favourably of him as poſſible, and I could wiſh for no Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of treating him otherwiſe than reſpectfully. And as to the Inconſiſtency before us, I am willing, as I have ſaid, to aſcribe it, not to any Malice <hi>prepenſe,</hi> but to the Embarraſſment he was under from the Badneſs of his Cauſe, and the urgent Neceſſity of his ſtill defending it. The ſame Kind of Inconſiſtency, proceeding from the like Embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, has appeared in all our Oppoſers; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the <hi>American Whig,</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> and another great Stickler againſt American Biſhops, in the <hi>London Chronicle,</hi> who ſigns himſelf <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus.</hi> They oppoſe that againſt which they have no Objections; they give their Conſent, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deny that they ever thought of conſenting at all.</p>
            <p>THE laſt-mentioned Writer, in Order to
<q>do Juſtice to the Americans,</q>
ſays, that
<q>they only object to <hi>Lords Biſhops</hi> being ſent over by Authority from the Legiſlature of Great Britain, with Power and Titles of worldly Pre-eminence.</q>
And the Doctor in p. 104, ſeems chiefly to fear, that the Biſhops deſcribed in our Plan, ſhould come <hi>from the King or State</hi>; for he is there very willing that we ſhould have them from the Bohemians, or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012007_0024_0F8940EC163E88C8"/>
Waldenſes, or Moravians, or even from Canada. But it can be a Matter of no Conſequence to thoſe, over whom they are to exerciſe no Juriſdiction, whether our Biſhops, under the Limitations propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are of Bohemian, Moravian, or Engliſh Extraction. Biſhops may be ſent by "the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of Great-Britain" without any temporal Power; and ſuch only have been deſired for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. As to their <hi>Titles,</hi> which may give Pain to the envious and malicious, they will imply no <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> but what ariſes from the Nature of their Office, conſidered as <hi>purely</hi> eccleſiaſtical or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and will undoubtedly not exceed what were given to Biſhops in the primitive Ages of the Church. "The Legiſlature of Great-Britain" has never been requeſted to ſend Biſhops to America; nor is the Parliament deſired to interfere any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than, if it ſhould be found that the national Eſtabliſhment will naturally give American Biſhops, when appointed, more Authority than is propoſed, to circumſcribe it according to our Plan.</p>
            <p>AS to the KING indeed, it is the Duty both of the Clergy here, and of the Biſhops at home, to apply to him for his Conſent and Warrant, before they proceed to carry ſuch a Scheme into Execution. This Duty ariſes from that <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Crown, to which the Biſhops and Clergy have ſworn Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in all ſuch Caſes, agreeably to the Laws of the Realm; and although we find
<q>the Minds of ſome <hi>ſlanderous</hi> Folks to be offended</q>
at it, it is no more, to uſe the Words of the ARTICLE, than
<q>that only Prerogative which we ſee to have been given always to all godly Princes by GOD himſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012007_0025_0F8940ECAE0FAFE0"/>AMONG the original Articles of the Doctor's Complaint, it was repreſented, <hi>that the Arguments in Support of the</hi> PETITIONS <hi>for an American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate had been kept ſecret; and that an authentic Knowledge of them, though applied for, was rejected.</hi> It was replied in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> 'I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſuch an Application, or Rejection.' He now rejoins, p. 14, <hi>I am now diſpoſed to think he here wrote as he thought. But, if he had taken Time for Recollection, it is probable he would have called to Mind what he might not then have had in actual Remembrance. Did he never hear of a formal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made by Dr. Stiles in a Letter to the Clerk of the New-York Convention, deſiring a Copy of their Petitions, eſpecially their Petition to the King, and of the formal Negative put upon this reaſonable Requeſt? Did he never hear of any Controverſy between the American Whig, and this Clerk of the Convention, relative to the Petition to the King, wherein he was called upon to put an End to the Diſpute, by producing the Words of the Petition, which he refuſed to do?</hi> To all this I anſwer in the Negative. I neither heard of Dr. Stiles's Application, nor of the Diſpute between the <hi>American Whig</hi> and the Secretary of our Convention, till conſiderably <hi>after</hi> the Time of the Doctor's making his Complaint; and therefore I naturally ſuppoſed that what is here mentioned could not have occaſioned it, it being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for <hi>Effects</hi> to go before their <hi>Cauſes.</hi> The Complaint was publiſhed by the Middle of March 1768, and muſt have been printed in February, and written before it was printed—Mr. Seabury's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, as Secretary of the Convention, which brought on his Diſpute with the <hi>American Whig,</hi> did not make its Appearance in New-York before March 28—And Dr. Stiles's Application for Copies of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012007_0026_0F8940ED6D6B9428"/>
the Petitions, was not made till ſeveral Weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. So that the Reader ſees it was not owing to my Want of <hi>Recollection,</hi> but to my Ignorance of the Doctor's Abilities in <hi>Prognoſtication,</hi> that I made ſuch a Reply. But if this Gentleman was above making Diſtinctions between paſt and future, he ought in Juſtice to have told us ſo, upon his engaging in the Controverſy.</p>
            <p>IT was farther ſaid in Anſwer to him: 'The Complaint is altogether groundleſs; for the Plan upon which it was propoſed that Biſhops ſhould be ſent to America, and the Arguments afterwards made Uſe of in Support of the Petitions, actually were publiſhed, a conſiderable Time before the Petitions were ſent.' The Doctor replies, <hi>What is all this to the Purpoſe?</hi> p. 15. I muſt confeſs it appears to me to be greatly to the Purpoſe, to ſhew that particular Matters were publiſhed, in anſwering a Complaint that they were <hi>not</hi> publiſhed. <hi>It is true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuch Arguments, in Support of the Plan for American Biſhops as were thought fit to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly uſed, we have been</hi> (he might have ſaid <hi>had been) made acquainted with. But the Queſtion is, are theſe the</hi> ONLY ONES <hi>that enforced the Petitions that were ſent home? Will the Doctor venture to ſay,</hi> NO OTHERS <hi>were uſed?</hi> I aſſure him, that ſuch Arguments as had been publickly uſed in Support of our Plan, included the ONLY ONES that were uſed to enforce the Petitions; and therefore I need not add, that NO OTHERS were made Uſe of for that Purpoſe. All this has been publickly aſſerted over and over. If ſo, ſays the Doctor, <hi>What poſſible Harm can there be in giving Copies of them?—It is generally ſuppoſed that ſome Things are ſaid in Support of theſe Petitions, which the Clergy who ſent them
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012007_0027_0F8940EE308660E8"/>
are not willing ſhould be publickly known.</hi> No great Harm, I imagine, could have been expected from the Publication of our Petitions; and if the Clergy had been treated with Decency on the Occaſion, it is not improbable that Copies of all of them would, long ſince, have been laid before the Public. But after having been openly bullied and abuſed, upon no other Evidence againſt them than that of uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Suſpicions, and after the Petitions had been magiſterially demanded by anonymous Scriblers, they thought proper to refuſe them. In theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the Requeſt of Dr. <hi>Stiles,</hi> however <hi>reaſonable</hi> in itſelf, or however decently made, could not prudently be granted, as his Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a certain Party were known.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor proceeds: <hi>If any Credit is due to the Word of a Gentleman, of well eſtabliſhed Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who was favoured with a Sight, though not with a Copy of one of theſe Petitions, it contained that in it which has never been made public.</hi> I would not ſay any Thing to leſſen the <hi>well eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of any Gentleman; but ſuch an imperfect Teſtimony can, by no Means, be admitted in the preſent Caſe. If the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> here meant, had the Sight of a <hi>true</hi> Copy, it is poſſible that he may have miſapprehended ſome particular Paſſages, or his Memory may have deceived him. But perhaps he ſaw only the firſt Draft of a Petition, before it had undergone the Corrections of the Convention; and from this he could form no Judgment of the Petition that was afterwards actually ſent. Perhaps he ſaw a ſpurious Copy (and why may there not be fictitious Petitions, as well as <hi>fictitious Letters</hi> from Members of <hi>the Society?</hi>) written with a View, either of making Miſchief among the Diſſenters,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012007_0028_0F8940EEEE994A70"/>
or of raiſing an Odium againſt the epiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. To this muſt be added, that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> himſelf is not known, and conſequently but little Regard can be paid to his Teſtimony, at any Rate. Now, to borrow a little of the Doctor's Phraſeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from p. 168, this <hi>poor, lame, lank</hi> Evidence is all that he has to oppoſe to the poſitive and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Declarations of our Convention to the contrary, and particularly by the Pen of their very worthy Secretary; the Members of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention muſt be ſuppoſed to know what they themſelves did in the Affair, and can, whenever they pleaſe, have Recourſe to the original Papers.</p>
            <p>BUT as what could not prudently be done, at that Seaſon of epidemic Preſbyterian Vehemence againſt the Clergy and the Church of England in the Colonies, may not be altogether improper now—when the Paſſions of Men have greatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and their Prejudices have abated, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as their Eyes have been opened; in order to gratify the Curioſity of the Reader (not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>) I will lay before him <hi>true</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of our Petitions to the King, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, without any Comment or Explanation: And if our late Adverſaries ſhould continue to preſerve their preſent apparent good Temper, (here I do not forget, but muſt except, the Doctor) the other Petitions may poſſibly ſee the Light on ſome future Occaſions.</p>

New-Jerſey, now met together in one of thoſe voluntary Conventions, which the Neceſſities of the Church in theſe Parts frequently oblige us to hold, having long waited in Hopes of ſeeing the Church of England in America enjoy the Benefits of its own Inſtitutions, and of being thereby raiſed to an Equality with other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Denominations in your Majeſty's Colonies, think it our Duty, at length, to proſtrate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Supplicants before the Throne, and to implore your Majeſty's gracious Protection and Relief, which we now moſt earneſtly do, with all Submiſſion and Humility.</p>

                        <p>THE Clergy of New-York and New-Jerſey, after mature Conſideration, have thought proper to addreſs the Throne, in Behalf of the Church of England in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, which, while deſtitute of Biſhops and an orderly Diſcipline, muſt be in a ruinous
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012007_0031_0F8940F12E9581B0"/>
Condition, have taken the Liberty to encloſe their Addreſs, to your Grace, humbly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, to the innumerable kind Offices which you have been doing to the American Church and Clergy for a long Courſe of Years, You will be pleaſed to add that of preſenting it to his Majeſty, and of ſupporting the Prayer of it with thoſe Arguments and Repreſentations, which none can uſe ſo properly or to ſo great Advantage, as your Grace. It is impoſſible that this Cauſe can be better pleaded than it was by your Grace many Years ago in a public Manner, and no one has ever yet done it ſo well; and if any Relief is to be obtained, we have Reaſon to expect it from ſuch a Prince as now adorns the Throne, by the Mediation of ſuch an Advocate.</p>
                        <p>IT is needleſs to be particular with your Grace, who are ſo thoroughly acquainted with our Caſe and Condition; and it would be injurious to offer Intreaties to ſo warm and avowed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. The Requeſt, we apprehend, is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and equitable, that none can oppoſe it with any Appearance of Juſtice or Humanity; and the Plan of an American Epiſcopate, as it has been often explained by your Grace, is ſo univerſally harmleſs and unexceptionable, that no tolerable Objections can be offered againſt it.</p>
                        <p>However we are ſenſible that a powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy has been formed to oppoſe it, which will probably continue; in which Caſe the great Queſtion is, in our humble Opinion, Whether the Church here ſhall be ſacrificed to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs and malicious Obſtinacy of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or, whether its Friends ſhall run the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012007_0032_0F8940F1EE9F5938"/>
Hazard of diſobliging them? We do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſee far into Futurity, but we are ſadly apprehenſive, that if our Enemies have now Power to prevent our having Biſhops in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the Time is not far diſtant, when, having gathered Strength by Conceſſions, they will be alſo able to exterminate Epiſcopacy even in England.</p>
                        <p>AMONGST other Arts that have been uſed to diſappoint us, it has been publickly and boldly aſſerted<note n="*" place="bottom">IN many of the Engliſh and American News-Papers.</note>,
<q>
                              <hi>that the ſending us Biſhops is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſagreeable to nineteen Twentieths of all the People in America, and would occaſion a more dangerous Diſcontent and Clamour than the</hi> Stamp-Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </q>
This, we beg Leave to aſſure your Grace, is a Slander, vile and malicious in all its Parts. We do not believe <hi>any</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in theſe Colonies have ever pretended ſo much Uneaſineſs at the Proſpect of Biſhops, as has been <hi>generally</hi> expreſſed on Occaſion of the Stamp-Act. Indeed we have heard of no Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour at all, and our Ears have been open. We have made it our Buſineſs for ſome Time paſt to mention the Affair to the moſt conſiderable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters among us, as Opportunity has fairly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but we have found none that pretend to diſpute the Reaſonableneſs of it. On the other Hand, ſeveral have declared that they have no Objections to Biſhops in America, provided the Diſſenters are not to come under their Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is no Doubt but thoſe who are the Enemies of the Church would be ſorry to ſee it in a flouriſhing State, but none are ſo hardy as to tell us ſo.</p>
                        <p>

AND as to the Proportion of diſſatisfied Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are repreſented to be Nineteen in Twenty, it is too glaringly falſe to deſerve an Anſwer. If we take into the Account all the North-American Colonies, and it is not fair to do otherwiſe, we believe that of the Profeſſors of the Church of England the Number is as great, (ſome ſay ſuperior) as that of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There are alſo many Thouſands of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans in the Colonies, whoſe good Wiſhes in this Caſe we may ſafely rely on. And of the Diſſenters, a conſiderable Proportion are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who are well known to have generally a much better Opinion of the Church, than of the Preſbyterians. Nay, they now begin to dread the increaſing Power of the latter in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and declare their Reſolution to ſupport the Church; and of late there have been ſeveral Inſtances of their contributing largely to the building of Churches, on the ſame Principle.</p>
                        <p>AFTER all, ſuppoſing the Diſcontent were really conſiderable, yet the World muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that it is very unreaſonable. And we truſt that our Superiors, who believe Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy to be the Appointment of Chriſt, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think it more reaſonable, and, upon the whole, more prudent and better Policy, to obey God and to oblige the Friends of the Church, than to pleaſe a comparatively ſmall and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Party. But if we are to have no Biſhops until the Diſſenters are willing, we know what to expect: We ſhall only ſay, that the Caſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us to be unparalleled in this, as well as other Reſpects.</p>

YOUR Grace will excuſe the Warmth of this Addreſs, as it proceeds from no intereſted Views, but from a Senſe we are under of the Neceſſities of the Church. We ſhall offer no farther Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, but relying on your great Goodneſs, beg Leave to ſubſcribe ourſelves, as we are with the utmoſt Veneration and Gratitude, &amp;c.</p>

            </q>
            <p>HAVING gone through the Doctor's preliminary Articles, I ſhall now proceed to conſider the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his firſt Section, amounting to a third Part of his Pamphlet; although there is but little in it that is immediately connected with the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in Queſtion. And here, upon a Proſpect of the Work before me, I am ready to ſhrink back, and to repent that I have undertaken it. Were the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs only to debate Matters of ſome Conſequence with a candid Opponent, I ſhould enter upon it with leſs Reluctance, and could promiſe the Reader more Satisfaction. But where much Time and Labour muſt be ſpent in the unprofitable Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of comparing Pamphlet with Pamphlet, of balancing Sentence with Sentence, of ſhewing that I ſaid <hi>ſo,</hi> or ſaid <hi>not</hi> ſo—that the Doctor ſaid this, or meant that, or miſtook, or miſrepreſented the Matter, I fear it will be a Trial indeed. And yet to more than a little of this Kind of Labour am I unavoidably deſtined, in the preſent Undertaking.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> I regreted that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the Plea for American Biſhops, with a <hi>Sketch</hi> of the general Arguments in Favour of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy; and confeſſed
<q>that what was ſaid on the general Subject, however juſt in itſelf, or proper in Theory, had been better omited</q>
—for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012007_0035_0F8940F516486FF0"/>
Reaſons that need not be repeated. <hi>And yet,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>he has wrote</hi> [written] <hi>not leſs than</hi> 98 <hi>Pages—more than one third Part of the whole—in Support of that, concerning which he was convinced it had been better if he had ſaid nothing.</hi> p. 17. But in the 98 Pages, to which he refers, I ſaid but little upon what was contained in the <hi>Sketch,</hi> and carefully avoided ſaying any Thing on the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture and the primitive Church, which is the moſt eſſential Part of the general Controverſy; becauſe I was for haſtening to the Subject of an American Epiſcopate. And that I reached it no ſooner, was owing to the Doctor's needleſsly obſtructing my Paſſage with, what he pretended to be, the Sentiments of our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, the Opinions of ſome eminent Moderns, the Caſe of the Waldenſes, of the foreign Churches, the King's Supremacy, &amp;c. Theſe were the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thoſe 98 Pages, and not the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, which was <hi>that, concerning which I was convinced it had been better if I had ſaid nothing.</hi> And yet a Subject that had been better omited in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> might very properly come under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> as it was profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly written
<q>in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Objections and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations</hi> of Dr. Chauncy and others.</q>
This I take to be a ſufficient Reply to all that is ſaid in three prevaricating Pages, wherein the Doctor far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſes his Talents, and labours to prove me to have been guilty, not only of what he calls <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious Unfairneſs</hi> (he may poſſibly think his OWN <hi>Unfairneſs</hi> to have been <hi>judicious</hi>) but alſo of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the divine Right of Epiſcopacy was aſſerted. The Doctor denied this to be a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012007_0036_0F8940F5B029D968"/>
of the Church of England. It was replied, in the firſt Place, that were this really the Caſe, and
<q>if it be by Virtue only of the <hi>Jus humanum</hi> of Epiſcopacy that Biſhops are neceſſary, ſtill the Ends for which they are neceſſary cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without them, ſo long as we are ſubject to the Authority that requires them.</q>
He now rejoins: <hi>As the Authority requiring is by Suppoſition merely human, no Complaints can reaſonably be made by thoſe who could have none to make, if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and honoured no one but Jeſus Chriſt as ſupreme Head of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> p. 20. But does not the Doctor know that none admit of a <hi>ſupreme Head of the Chriſtian Church</hi> upon Earth, but Papiſts? I hope he did not mean to inſinuate, that the epiſcopal Clergy in the Colonies believe the Doctrine of the Pope's Supremacy. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of a <hi>national</hi> Church is a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Thing from the ſupreme Head of <hi>the Chriſtian</hi> Church; and, by the former, the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland means no more than the Prerogative given to our Princes, of
<q>ruling all Eſtates and Degrees commited to their Charge by God, whether they be <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> or temporal<note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Article</hi> XXXVII.</note>,</q>
in Oppoſition to the Pope's Uſurpation: And, whether this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Chriſt's <hi>abſolute Supremacy,</hi> let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe judge. An Authority to govern the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church in <hi>Subordination</hi> to Chriſt, is the moſt that the Church of England ever aſcribed to Chriſtian Princes; and the Claim of <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Authority is ſo far from denying, that it actually acknowledges and eſtabliſhes, the Supremacy of the <hi>Principal.</hi> But more will be ſaid upon this Subject in its proper Place. Suppoſing now, but not granting, that we eſteemed Biſhops to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012007_0037_0F8940F66F2CFEF0"/>
by Virtue only of a <hi>Jus Humanum</hi>; it is evident, at firſt View, that the Ends for which they are thus made neceſſary cannot be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them,
<q>ſo long as we are ſubject to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that requires them,</q>
and
<q>look upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be bound in Duty and Conſcience to obey</q>
it. And the Caſe of Epiſcopalians in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, conſcientiouſly obedient to the national Authority, muſt be hard without an Epiſcopate, in Proportion to the Neceſſity or Importance of thoſe Ends, for which Biſhops are neceſſary. To tell us that we are wrong in our Notions of the King's Supremacy, if true, would be nothing to the Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IT was farther ſaid in Reply, that, with Regard to Epiſcopacy, the Doctor miſtook the Principles of the Church of England, which always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a divine Right. And here he was referred, in particular, to the <hi>Preface</hi> to the ORDINAL. Part of this Preface was recited, wherein, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<q>the DISTINCTION of the three Orders of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons is fully aſſerted— the ANTIQUITY of this Diſtinction is deduced <hi>from the Apoſtles Times</hi>—the EVIDENCE in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it is ſaid to be contained in <hi>holy Scripture and ancient Authors</hi>—and the CLEARNESS of this Evidence is ſuch, that it muſt appear <hi>to</hi> ALL MEN <hi>diligently reading holy Scripture,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="§" place="bottom">The <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 19.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctor attempts not to ſhew that theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are ill-grounded, nor <hi>to point out the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſiveneſs of this Reaſoning,</hi> in his <hi>own Words,</hi> as he was apprehenſive it might expoſe him to be cenſured for <hi>Prejudice, Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>perverſe Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012007_0038_0F8940F72D35E210"/>
but he chooſes to anſwer <hi>in the Language of two famous epiſcopal Writers.</hi> What then do theſe two famous Writers ſay? The firſt is Biſhop Hoadly, in his <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Conformity,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the laudable View of reconciling the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts to the Church of England. In the Courſe of his Work, he repreſented the Difference that divided them from the Conformiſts to be, in Reality, much ſmaller, in many Inſtances, than had been commonly pretended. Dr. Calamy had offered, as an Objection againſt miniſterial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that the Subſcription required from the Clergy, implies
<q>an Allowance and Approbation of that Aſſertion, that Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons are three diſtinct Orders <hi>by divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi>
               </q>
Mr. Hoadly anſwered, that this Quotation from the Preface to the Ordinal was not fairly made.
<q>
                  <hi>By divine Appointment,</hi> ſays he, You add yourſelves;</q>
which was certainly true, theſe Words being not in the Preface.
<q>For, continues he, all that the Sentence, which you quote, ſays, is that <hi>that theſe Orders have been in the Church from the Apoſtles Times.</hi>
               </q>
He then proceeds in the Words cited by the Doctor, the Force of which is contained in this one Aſſertion:
<q>
                  <hi>There is ſome Difference between the two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, are three diſtinct Orders in the Church by <hi>DIVINE APPOINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, and,</hi>—From the Apoſtles Times, there have been theſe Orders in Chriſt's Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons:</q>
Which Diſtinction is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly juſt, when the Diſpute is about the Words of the Ordinal. But he does not deny that the Preface aſſerts the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of the three Orders—nor that it deduces the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Diſtinction from the Time of the Apoſtles—nor
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012007_0039_0F8940F7EE82C4D0"/>
that it ſays the EVIDENCE of it is contained in holy Scripture and ancient Authors—nor that it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Clearneſs</hi> of this Evidence to all diligent Inquirers; which is all that I affirmed, or am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſupport. Nor does it appear in his Diſpute with Dr. Calamy, that he himſelf did not fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the apoſtolical Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy. But on the contrary, in this ſame Book, which the Doctor has the Aſſurance to quote, he expreſsly declares:
<q>We think we can <hi>demonſtrate</hi> that in the primitive Times the Adminiſtration of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs was in the Hands of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who had <hi>Preſbyters</hi> ſubject to them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Second</hi> Edition, p. 4.</note>.</q>
And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
<q>Imagining our Method (of Ordination by Biſhops) to be the orderly and ſettled Method <hi>from the primitive Ages</hi>; where we ſee it neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, when there is no Neceſſity, we think in Juſtice, <hi>we cannot acknowledge thoſe who depart from it approved of God,</hi> in ſetting apart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Miniſtry<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 8.</note>.</q>
This approaches near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the moſt <hi>high-flying</hi> Expreſſions uſed in the <hi>Appeal</hi>; in which the Author went not much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this eminent Writer, whoſe Moderation has been known and celebrated throughout the Chriſtian World. In his <hi>Defence of epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> he undertakes to prove, and does prove, that it is of APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION. And he introduces Mr. Baxter himſelf, as making this very important Conceſſion:
<q>that there were fixed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in ſome Churches in the Days of one of the Apoſtles; that neither the Apoſtles, nor any of their Diſciples, nor any Chriſtian, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic in the World, ſpake, or wrote a Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Epiſcopacy, till long after it was generally ſettled in the Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012007_0040_0F8940F8ADBE4038"/>THE other <hi>famous epiſcopal Writer,</hi> in whoſe Words the Doctor chooſes to expreſs himſelf, is Mr. Ollyſſe, in his Anſwer to the ſame Dr. Calamy. After making the ſame Diſtinction with Mr. Hoadly about the Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, he ſays, as quoted by the Doctor, that the Preface "does not prove a <hi>divine Appointment.</hi>" That Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face does not undertake to <hi>prove</hi> any Thing. It was drawn up as an explicit Declaration of the Doctrine of the Church of England, relating to the three eccleſiaſtical Orders which were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and it ſays the Evidence in Favour of this Form of Church-Government is contained <hi>in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as well as <hi>in ancient Authors.</hi> This <hi>looks</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>like</hi> an Acknowledgment of a <hi>divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi> But not to inſiſt upon this. No farther Evidence is required to prove that Epiſcopacy is of <hi>divine Appointment,</hi> than that it is of <hi>apoſtolical</hi> Appointment. The Apoſtles were <hi>inſpired</hi> Men, and peculiarly conducted by the Spirit of God in the public Execution of their Office; and for the ſame Reaſons that their <hi>Writings</hi> are of divine Authority, the <hi>eccleſiaſtical Government</hi> they ſettled, as to all its eſſential Parts, muſt be of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But that Epiſcopacy was of <hi>apoſtolical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> Biſhop Hoadly thought he could <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,</hi> and Chillingworth <hi>did</hi> demonſtrate, even from the Conceſſions of its Enemies: And Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy differs <hi>as eſſentially</hi> from Preſbyterianiſm or Congregationaliſm or Independency, as Monarchy does from Ariſtocracy or Democracy.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays Mr. Ollyſſe, as the Doctor quotes him, there were
<q>other Things, in the Apoſtles Days, which yet for all that are not allowed to be of <hi>divine Appointment.</hi>
               </q>
This is not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012007_0041_0F8940F96EAEAF00"/>
expreſſed; but I take the Author's Meaning to be, that the Apoſtles injoined and practiced ſome Things, that are generally allowed not to have, at this Day, the Authority of a divine Appointment. This may be true: But if we may judge of others by St. Paul, whenever they gave Directions relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church that were occaſional or local, and not of general and perpetual Obligation to prevent Miſtakes, they were careful to ſignify it. This, we know, in particular, was the Practice of the great "Apoſtle of the Gentiles;" who found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more Churches, and iſſued out more eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Injunctions, than any other Apoſtle. And as to Authority to govern the Church, and to ordain, it muſt, in the Nature of Things, have continued in thoſe Hands wherein it was originally placed, and in the Hands of ſuch Succeſſors, from Time to Time, as it was regularly conveyed to. There is not the leaſt Intimation in Scripture that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Form of it might be changed; nor is there any Appearance that the primitive Church thought it could be changed.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor informs us (in a <hi>Note,</hi> p. 21) that, <hi>after long ſeeking,</hi> he was ſo lucky as to obtain <hi>a Sight of the</hi> OLD <hi>Ordinal. The Year in which it was printed is not mentioned,</hi> but he looks upon it to be <hi>one of the firſt printed Copies, or a Reprint from one of theſe,</hi> in the Reign of EDWARD VI. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſigned for his Belief of its Antiquity are, that <hi>it is printed in the Old Engliſh Letter,</hi> and that he finds at the Bottom of the Title-Page,
<q>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, printed by <hi>R. Barker</hi> and <hi>J. Bill,</hi> Printers to the King's moſt excellent Majeſty.</q>

               <hi>the Old Engliſh Letter,</hi> which on ſome Occaſions is uſed to this very Day, <hi>Barker</hi> and <hi>Bill</hi> were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to CHARLES I, almoſt 100 Years after the <hi>old Ordinal</hi> was <hi>firſt printed.</hi> But this is a Matter of no Conſequence, if they did but give a faithful <hi>Reprint</hi> from a true Copy. Well: Upon comparing the <hi>Preface</hi> as it there ſtands, with that which is <hi>now</hi> prefixed to our Ordination-Offices, he finds that it underwent <hi>a very material Alteration</hi> in the Time of CHARLES II. He points out the Variations; but they appear to be of little Conſequence, as nothing is expreſſed in the latter, which is not ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the former, and which was not as clearly expreſſed both in the Engliſh and Latin Articles of 1552, and of 1562.</p>
            <p>BUT he urges, that although none under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Ordinal <hi>may be looked upon as a lawful Miniſter</hi> without <hi>epiſcopal Ordination, it does not appear that this was the Caſe under the old</hi>—and that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewers</hi> afterwards <hi>did not think this an indiſputable Point; otherwiſe they would not have made an Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the principal Deſign of which was to put this Matter beyond all Doubt.</hi> I am glad to find that he allows it to be the Deſign of the Preface to the <hi>preſent</hi> Ordinal, to put this Matter beyond all Doubt: For hereby he admits that the Church of England ever ſince the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> has maintained the apoſtolical Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, contrary to his frequent Aſſertions. Nor has he been able to prove that <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> ſhe held other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But why then was ſuch an Alteration made, if the Point was already ſecured? A <hi>famous epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Writer,</hi> whoſe Words, the Doctor knows, it may ſometimes be prudent to uſe, inſtead of one's own, will help us to a proper Anſwer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.

It was becauſe of
<q>the unhappy Neceſſity ſome learned Men imagined themſelves under, to contradict and obſcure it</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoadly's <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of <hi>Conformity,</hi> p. 109.</note>. This Author goes on to obſerve, that
<q>the Deſire they had that it ſhould not appear of great Conſequence, hath helped mightily to the clearing it. Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> may very well appear at the Head of thoſe who have added great Evidence to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (viz. Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons have been in the Church from the Apoſtles Days).</q>
               <q>If he differed from other <hi>epiſcopal</hi> Men, the Difference may well be thought <hi>verbal</hi> and not <hi>real</hi>; if we conſider the Service he hath done to Epiſcopacy, in Oppoſition to the Preſbyterians. Biſhop Pearſon and others followed.

               </q>
As to what the Doctor ſays farther in this <hi>Note,</hi> that <hi>under the old Ordinal, thoſe were admitted to officiate as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Church of England, who were not epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ordained</hi>; it will be ſufficient here to refer the Reader to the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 42, where this Point is properly ſtated and explained; to which the Doctor, for a very good Reaſon, has thought proper not to ſay a Word in Reply.</p>
            <p>IN another <hi>Note,</hi> p. 24, (for I muſt pick up Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Order wherein I find them) he tells us, that <hi>the upper Houſe of Convocation, no longer</hi> [ago] <hi>than</hi> [in] 1702, <hi>appear to have been of Opinion, that Epiſcopacy, upon the Footing of</hi> DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION, <hi>was not the Doctrine of the Church of England, notwithſtanding all that is ſaid in the Preface to the Ordinal.</hi> For this he brings no other
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012007_0044_0F8940FBAEF18078"/>
Proof, than what Dr. Calamy repreſents to have paſſed in an Altercation between the two Houſes of Convocation; wherein, the lower Houſe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that <hi>they had been</hi> SCANDALOUSLY <hi>repreſented,</hi> by the upper Houſe, <hi>as Favourers of Preſbytery, in Oppoſition to Epiſcopacy,</hi> make a formal Declaration, <hi>that they acknowledged the Order of Biſhops, as ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Preſbyters,</hi> to be of DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION; and afterwards complain, that, on this Account, <hi>they were accuſed of aſcribing</hi> TOO MUCH to Epiſcopacy. But as I can obtain no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of that Affair, upon which I can depend, I muſt content myſelf with obſerving, in a general Way, that this Repreſentation is <hi>incred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible</hi> in itſelf, both from what has been already ſaid, and from its being well known that the Majority of thoſe, who muſt have been Members of the upper Houſe at that Time, fully believed the apoſtolical Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy—as appears from their Writings. Yet were the Caſe exactly as it is here repreſented, we know that Words, uſed in the Warmth of Paſſion, are no Proof of the real Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of thoſe that utter them. I hope every Expreſſion that has eſcaped the Doctor, during the Heat of the preſent Controverſy is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an Evidence of his real Opinion.</p>
            <p>AS he advances in the Diſpute, he waxes ſtouter and more vigorous in his Oppoſition to Epiſcopacy. For, in p. 26, he has the Courage to affirm, that <hi>the Book of Ordination, the Preface to which we have been conſidering, is formed upon the Suppoſition, that Preſbyters have the Power of Ordination in common with Biſhops; nor can it in any other View be made conſiſtent with itſelf.</hi> To this I will reply, in the Words of the celebrated <hi>Hooker</hi>:
<q>With us,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012007_0045_0F8940FC6CD831B0"/>
even at this Day, Preſbyters are licenſed to do as much as that Council (the 4th of Carthage) ſpeaketh of, if any be preſent. Yet will not any Man thereby conclude, that in this Church others than Biſhops are allowed to ordain. The Aſſociation of Preſbyters is no ſufficient Proof that the Power of Ordination is in them; but rather, that it <hi>never was</hi> in them we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by underſtand; for that no Man is able to ſhew either Deacon or Preſbyter ordained by Preſbyters only, and his Ordination accounted lawful in any ancient Part of the Church <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> Lib. vii. Cap. vi.</note>.</q> This may ſerve, at preſent, as a general Anſwer to the Doctor's general Aſſertion. But we ſhall ſoon come to Particulars. For he intends to <hi>dilate upon the Matter,</hi> as it is a Thing that has not been <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conſidered,</hi> by <hi>giving a large Extract from Mr. Ferdinand Shaw's</hi>
               <q>Judgment of the Church of England.</q>
He <hi>chuſes to exhibit this Extract</hi> the rather, <hi>becauſe it is taken from a Pamphlet</hi> he <hi>lately received from the other Side</hi> [of] <hi>the Atlantic, and</hi> [which] <hi>is, perhaps the</hi> ONLY ONE <hi>in America</hi>; meaning the only Copy of <hi>that</hi> Pamphlet, for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he muſt know that there are other <hi>Pamphlets</hi> in America.</p>
            <p>BUT previouſly to this <hi>Dilatation,</hi> in Anſwer to my deſiring him to try the Experiment, whether he could 'honeſtly and conſiſtently' declare his own Sentiments, concerning Epiſcopacy, in the Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, he ſays that he <hi>has</hi> tried it, <hi>and finds that he can; i. e.</hi> as we are to underſtand him, <hi>with the Allowance only of</hi> 'Explanations' <hi>more natural, and</hi> 'Interpretations' <hi>leſs ſoftening than Ninety-Nine in a Hundred</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012007_0046_0F8940FD72C94C08"/>
of thoſe that do ſubſcribe) <hi>are obliged to recur to, before they can, if they pay any Regard to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſubſcribe to the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> &amp;c. The Juſtice and Propriety, are equal to the Charity, of this Reflection. It is no Proof that he can ſubſcribe to the Words of the <hi>Preface</hi> 'honeſtly and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,' that he can do ſo with <hi>leſs</hi> Prevarication than is practiced by many others, on certain Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Nor do Ninety-Nine in a Hundred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate, in ſubſcribing to the Articles of the Church: So far from it, that none, whom he means to aſperſe, have Occaſion to prevaricate at all. The Church of England is not, nor was it ever, founded upon <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Principles, as its Enemies take Pleaſure in aſſerting:—Unleſs <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm</hi> admits, of a Poſſibility of falling from Grace, as in <hi>Art.</hi> xvi—of conditional Promiſes, as in <hi>Art.</hi> xvii—and of univerſal Redemption by Chriſt, as in <hi>Art.</hi> xxxi. It is not my Buſineſs now to undertake the Proof of this Point; but thoſe that deſire to ſee it proved, in a full and ſatiſfactory Manner, may have Recourſe to the proper Authors; particularly, to Biſhop Montague's <hi>Appello Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> —Dr. Heylin's <hi>Hiſtory of the quinquarticular Controverſy</hi>—Biſhop Bull's <hi>Apologia pro Harmonia</hi>— Dr. Waterland<hi>'s Supplement to the Caſe of Arian Subſcriptions—An Apology for the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> printed in 1732—<hi>Three Letters to the Author of the Confeſſional</hi>—and Dr. Nowel<hi>'s Anſwer to Pietas Oxonienſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I COME now to attend upon Mr. Ferdinand Shaw. He affirms that in the old Ordinal, <hi>the Form of committing to Biſhops and Preſbyters their Office and Work, made no Diſtinction at all in the Order,</hi> to which they were admitted. And again: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012007_0047_0F8940FF182F21B0"/>
ſpiritual Powers the one had given them, to the other were given the ſame. Had Biſhops the Power of Ordination committed to them, ſo had Preſbyters too, who received the ſame Commiſſion, by the ſame Solemnity, in Words of the ſame Importance, and therefore muſt be inveſted with the ſame divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Such an Aſſertion muſt be amazing, to any one that has ſeen the old Ordinal, or that has any Acquaintance with our eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. This indeed was objected by the Papiſts, in the Reign of CHARLES II, which, together with other falſe and groundleſs Aſſertions, occaſioned Biſhop Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, then a private Clergyman, to write his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Ordinations of the Church of England.</hi> The popiſh Writers, eſpecially ſuch of them as are ſingled out for Diſputants, have a Way of their own, and profeſſedly make no Conſcience of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing that has a Tendency to advance their Cauſe. But Mr. Shaw, I hope, is a Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and Proteſtants have no Right, contrary to their Profeſſion and Principles, to practice this Art. However, a brief Examination of what is here advanced, may be expected by the Reader.</p>
            <p>IF by <hi>the Form of committing to Biſhops and Preſbyters their Office and Work,</hi> this Writer means the <hi>Offices</hi> uſed at their reſpective Ordinations, he groſsly miſrepreſents them. For the Titles of the two Offices, the Offices themſelves in almoſt all their Parts, and the whole Face and Appearance of them, are widely different; and they clearly point out and diſtinguiſh a Difference of <hi>Order.</hi> In the Prayer to be uſed at the End of the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at the Ordination of Prieſts, God is ſaid to have
<q>appointed divers (<hi>i. e.</hi> more than Two) <hi>Orders</hi> of Miniſters in the Church.</q>
How many,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012007_0048_0F8940FF6DE60BB8"/>
and what, theſe <hi>divers Orders</hi> are, is declared in the general Preface. When a Perſon preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Ordination according to the Form of the ſecond Office, he knows that he can be made by it no more than a Preſbyter. He is aſked:
<q>Will you reverently <hi>obey your Ordinary,</hi> and other <hi>chief Miniſters</hi> unto whom the <hi>Government and Charge is committed over you,</hi> following with a glad Mind and Will their godly Admonitions, and <hi>ſubmitting</hi> yourſelf to their godly <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
               </q>
And he anſwers:
<q>I will do ſo, the Lord being my Helper.</q>
And although the Word <hi>Order,</hi> as it now ſtands in the new Ordinal, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be found in the correſponding Places of the old; yet it is a Matter of no Conſequence, as other Words, ſuch as <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> are uſed in an equivalent Senſe. Thus, when the Archdeacon ſays to the Biſhop,
<q>I preſent unto you theſe Perſons preſent to be admitted to the <hi>Order</hi> of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</q>
the Biſhop, immediately addreſſing the People, ſays:
<q>theſe be they whom we purpoſe, God willing, to receive this Day into the holy <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of Prieſthood;</q>
and before the Sentence is concluded, he calls it the "holy Miniſtry," and, in another Place, "the Miniſtry of the Prieſthood."</p>
            <p>IF it be the Meaning of this Writer, that thoſe particular Words in the Office, by which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is more immediately conveyed, make <hi>no Diſtinction in the Order,</hi> it is alſo a Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A Diſtinction actually is made, and as much as is neceſſary, even on the Principles of the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Epiſcopalians. The Words at the Ordination of Prieſts are;
<q>Receive the holy Ghoſt: Whoſe Sins thou doſt forgive, they are forgiven: And be thou a faithful Diſpenſer of the Word of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012007_0049_0F8941002FABE350"/>
God and his holy Sacraments; in the Name, &amp;c.</q>
The Biſhop, then delivering a Bible, ſays:
<q>Take thou Authority to preach the Word of God, and to adminiſter the holy Sacraments in this Congregation, where thou ſhalt be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi>
               </q>
But in the Ordination of a Biſhop, the Words are theſe:
<q>Take the Holy Ghoſt: And remember thou ſtir up the Grace of God which is in thee, by Impoſition of Hands; for God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power, and Love and Soberneſs.</q>
Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to him the Bible, the Archbiſhop charges him
<q>Give Heed unto Reading, &amp;c. Be to the Flock of Chriſt a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> not a Wolf: Feed them, devour them not; hold up the weak, heal the ſick, bind together the broken, bring again the outcaſts, ſeek the loſt; be ſo merciful that you be not too remiſs: So miniſter Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, that you forget not Mercy, that when the Shepherd ſhall come, you may receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marceſſible Crown of Glory, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q>
Who does not here ſee a very wide and material Difference? The Words,
<q>receive, or take, the Holy Ghoſt,</q>
are indeed the ſame in both Offices; they are general, and make no Diſtinction. But in the Ordination of Preſbyters, a Diſtinction, of their Office from that of Biſhops, immediately follows. They are declared to have, and the Declaration implies that they only have, in Virtue of that Ordination, the Power of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Penitents, and of diſpenſing the Word and Sacraments, and that in ſuch Congregations only as they ſhould be appointed to. Here is not the leaſt Appearance of epiſcopal Powers, nor of any Authority which is not at this Day given, by the Church of England, to Preſbyters. But in the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012007_0050_0F894100EDB20368"/>
Ordination of Biſhops, there is none of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; the Words are left general, as they were uſed by Chriſt in ordaining his Apoſtles; and all the ordinary Authority, which they were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to expreſs, is conveyed by them without Diminution. So that in one Caſe, there is only a limited Commiſſion given; but in the other, a Commiſſion without any Reſtriction or Limitation, and conſequently extending to <hi>all</hi> eccleſiaſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which, in Fact, is alſo intended.</p>
            <p>FOR it may be added, that were the Words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame in both Caſes, provided they were general, as in the original Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles; it would not follow, that no farther Powers were given in the Ordination of a Biſhop, than in that of a Preſbyter. For a new Ordination neceſſarily ſuppoſes an Intention to convey ſome new Powers. Biſhop Burnet juſtly argues on the Subject, in the following Manner:
<q>It is to be conſidered, that eccleſiaſtical Orders being from the Influence and Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which being one, yet hath <hi>different Operations</hi> for the <hi>different Adminiſtrations</hi>; therefore the concomitant Actions, Words and Circumſtances muſt ſhew, for <hi>which</hi> Adminiſtration the Holy Ghoſt is grayed for, ſince that general Prayer is made for all; but the Functions being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the ſame Holy Ghoſt works differently in them all. Therefore it is plain from the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Saviour, that there is no Need of expreſſing in the very Words of Ordination, <hi>what</hi> Power is thereby given, ſince our Saviour did not expreſs it, but what he ſaid both before and after, did determine the Senſe of thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Words to the apoſtolical Function. The
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012007_0051_0F894101AE1827D8"/>
whole Office of conſecrating Biſhops (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) ſhews very formally and expreſsly, what Power is given in theſe (general) Words. Now though the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would place the Form of Conſecration in ſome imperative Words; yet we ſee no Reaſon for that, but the Complex of the whole Office is that which is chiefly to be conſidered, and muſt determine the Senſe of thoſe Words. So that a Prieſt being preſented to be made a Biſhop, the King's Mandate being read for that Effect, he ſwearing canonical Obedience as Biſhop Elect, Prayers being put up for him as ſuch, together with other Circumſtances which make it plain what they are about; thoſe general Words are by theſe qualified and reſtrained to that Senſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Burnet's <hi>Vindication of the Ordination,</hi> &amp;c. p. 64.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE, in a <hi>Note,</hi> the Doctor ſteps in with his old <hi>Reprint,</hi> and endeavours to prove from it that Biſhops and Preſbyters <hi>were eſteemed one and the ſame Order,</hi> by the Compilers of that Ordinal. For it is <hi>worthy of ſpecial Remark,</hi> ſays he, that <hi>previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> (meaning <hi>previouſly) to the Ordination of Prieſts, Acts</hi> xx. <hi>from the</hi> 19<hi>th to the</hi> 24<hi>th Verſe</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid, from the 17th to the 35th incluſive) <hi>was appointed to be read for the Epiſtle; which muſt be eſteemed highly impertinent, if they were not, as</hi> EPISCOPOI <hi>to</hi> RULE (POIMANEIN) <hi>as well as feed the Church of God.</hi> That Portion of Scripture contains an Account of St. Paul's Interview with the Elders from Epheſus; at which he informs them in what Manner he had conducted himſelf in the Execution of the apoſtolical Office, gives them a ſolemn Charge to attend to the Duties of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and concludes with an affectionate Leave and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012007_0052_0F8941026DCFD050"/>
Benediction. Such an Example, and ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, might, I conceive, very properly be recommended to the careful Conſideration of every Candidate for the Orders, either of a Biſhop, or a Prieſt, or even of a Deacon. St. Paul ſometimes propoſes his own Example as a Pattern for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in common; and it may, with peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, be propoſed for the Imitation of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This is hinted, on the Suppoſition that the Elders from Epheſus were poſſeſſed of thoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are appropriated to Biſhops. But there is no Certainty that they were more than Preſbyters. Many learned Men, and Hooker and Hoadly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, are clear in the Opinion, that the Elders above-mentioned were nothing more: And this may have been the Opinion of the Compilers of the Ordinal.</p>
            <p>THE Door farther urges, that <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. or elſe <hi>John</hi> xx. 19—24, is appointed for the <hi>Goſpel; both which Paſſages of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the higheſt Commiſſion of Goſpel-Officers.</hi> But if the Commiſſion for the ſubordinate Degrees of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officers is included in this general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Apoſtles, and if they can produce no other original Commiſſion than is contained in this; then, theſe Paſſages of Scripture might, with no <hi>Inconſiſtency,</hi> be appointed to be read at the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Preſbyters. And <hi>the Reviewers of the old Ordinal,</hi> after the Reſtoration, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved them into the Office for the Ordination of Biſhops, not becauſe they believed them to be <hi>not proper</hi> to be uſed at the Ordination of Prieſts, but, from an Opinion that they were <hi>more proper</hi> at the Conſecration of Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:012007_0053_0F8941032E0A2200"/>In another <hi>Note,</hi> p. 28, the Doctor farther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to the ſame Purpoſe, from the <hi>Additions</hi> in the new Ordinal. At the Ordination of Prieſts, after the Words, "receive the Holy Ghoſt," theſe Words are added, FOR THE OFFICE AND WORK OF A PRIEST;—and, at the Conſecration of Biſhops, after the like Words, theſe Words are added, FOR THE OFFICE AND WORK OF A BISHOP. By this he ſeems to think, that, according to the old Ordinal, Biſhops were not ordained for the Office and Work of Biſhops, nor Prieſts for that of Prieſts, becauſe thoſe particular Words were not uſed on the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But with the ſame Force and Propriety he might have argued, that the Apoſtles were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned, by our bleſſed Saviour, for <hi>the Office and Work</hi> of Apoſtles, becauſe theſe Words are not found in the Commiſſion. But it was ſufficient, that the Compilers of the old Ordinal declared, in the Front of it, their Acknowledgment and Belief of three diſtinct Orders in the Church—that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a particular and diſtinct Office for the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each Order—that there could be no Diſpute to <hi>which</hi> of theſe Orders, any particular Perſon, by his Ordination, was admitted, nor what were the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Duties of his Office—and that all this was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and conſented to, by the Biſhops and Clergy, and eſtabliſhed by the King and Parliament. After all, it is not denied that the Alterations and Amendments, introduced into the new Ordinal, were a real Improvement; and particularly, as Words are therein uſed with greater Preciſion.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor has another <hi>Note</hi> in the like Strain, in p. 29; but after what has been ſaid in Anſwer to the preceding, it would be a needleſs Expence
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012007_0054_0F894103EECAD9F0"/>
of Time, Paper and Patience, to make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Reply to it.</p>
            <p>I NOW return to Mr. Shaw. His Deſign in the remainder of this Extract, extending from p. 29 to 35, is no leſs than to prove, that the Church of England at this Day allows Preſbyters to have the Power of Ordination, as inherently and eſſentially as Biſhops themſelves. The Attempt is arduous and romantic, and ſhould it appear that he has miſcarried in the Execution, ſtill it may be ſaid of him, as was ſaid of a notable Adventurer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,
<q>—magnis tamen excidit Auſis.</q>

            <p>THAT the Church of England allows to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Power of <hi>ordaining,</hi> he endeavours to prove, in the firſt Place, from the <hi>Rubric</hi> in the Office for the Ordination of Prieſts, which requires that <hi>the Biſhop with the</hi> PRIESTS <hi>preſent ſhall lay their Hands ſeverally upon the Head of every one that receiveth the Order of Prieſthood.</hi> This <hi>Rubric,</hi> as well as every other Rule or Injunction, ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted according to the Senſe in which it is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Authority, if that Senſe can be certainly known. But could it be the Intention of the Church in this <hi>Rubric,</hi> to contradict the whole Tenor of the Ordinal, and every Declaration and Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhe had made and given, relating to the Subject? Was there ever an epiſcopal Church, in any Age, that allowed the Power of Ordination to be in any other Hands, than of Biſhops? Was it the Opinion of thoſe who were commiſſioned to review the old Ordinal, and frame the new one, or of any Individual in that Commiſſion, that all the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012007_0055_0F894104AEA68910"/>
Preſbyters in the Kingdom, convened in one Body, could effectually ordain a ſingle Preſbyter?—Or, that any Biſhop in the Kingdom had not, as eſſential to his Office, the full Power of Ordination in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? If this was not the Opinion of thoſe Review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor of the Governors of the Church, nor of the civil Authority, at that Time; we may be certain that the <hi>Rubric</hi> means no ſuch Thing, and is an Evidence of no ſuch Thing, as it is alledged to prove. It requires indeed that the Biſhop ſhall admit the Prieſts, that are preſent, to join with him in the Impoſition of Hands; but it does not ſay, nor give the leaſt Intimation, that it is with a View of rendering the Ordination more valid and compleat, than it would have been by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop's Hands only. Every Impoſition of Hands is not with a Deſign to ordain; and there is the higheſt Evidence, that, in this Caſe, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the Deſign of the Church in general, nor of the Biſhop that officiates, nor of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves who practice this Rite. If the Preſbyter convey any ſpiritual Authority, it is without their own Knowledge and Intention, and by a barely mechanical Operation.</p>
            <p>THE Impoſition of the Hands of Preſbyters, in Conjunction with thoſe of the Biſhop, has been practiced in every Age of the Church, in a greater or leſs Degree; but it was never thought to be any Part, much leſs an <hi>eſſential</hi> Part, of Ordination, as this Writer calls it. The Practice was common and almoſt univerſal, in the fourth Century. A Canon of the 4th Council of Carthage, is thus worded:
<q>Preſbyter cum ordinatur, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> when a Preſbyter is ordained, while the Biſhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the Bleſſing, and lays his Hand upon his
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012007_0056_0F8941057309B450"/>
Head, all the Preſbyters that are preſent ſhall lay their Hands, by the Biſhop's Hand, upon his Head alſo.</q>
At that Time flouriſhed St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who was thoroughly acquainted with the Cuſtoms of the Church, and knew that the Impoſition of the Hands of Preſbyters, at the Ordination of a Fellow-Preſbyter, was the daily Practice. But did he believe that the Power of Ordination, or any Part of that Power, was exerciſed by Preſbyters? So far from it, that in his famous Epiſtle to <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius,</hi> wherein he endeavours to exalt their Order as high as poſſible, he confeſſes, that, from the Acts or Offices which they perform in common with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>Ordination</hi> muſt be <hi>excepted.</hi> If therefore the Impoſition of the Hands of Preſbyters in St. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's Time, was no Proof of their having Power to ordain, it can be no Proof now<note n="†" place="bottom">See the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,</hi> Lib. viii. Cap. 28, where it is ſaid of a Preſbyter:
<q>Benedictionem recipit ab Epiſcopo, et a Compreſbytero; eamque pariter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſbytero dat; <hi>Manus imponit,</hi> NON ORDINAT.</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>THIS Writer inſiſts upon it, that the Impoſition of the Hands of Preſbyters, in this Caſe, muſt be for the Purpoſe of Ordination; becauſe it cannot be pretended that it <hi>does only ſignify their witneſſing to, or approbating, the Thing done.</hi> But why not <hi>witneſſing?</hi> This, he ſays, <hi>might as well be done by the Laity who are preſent, or the Deacons</hi> All that are preſent are undoubtedly Witneſſes of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, but in ſome Caſes <hi>choſen Witneſſes</hi> may be thought proper, as is appointed in the Office of Baptiſm for <hi>Adults,</hi> although the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are Witneſſes at the ſame Time. Or, why not <hi>approbating?</hi> Is there any Impropriety in calling upon the Clergy that are preſent, to ſignify their Conſent to, and <hi>Approbation</hi> of, the Ordination of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012007_0057_0F894106349B25D8"/>
a particular Perſon to that ſacred Office, with which they have been inveſted themſelves? And may not the Impoſition of Hands, in the Manner required, be the eſtabliſhed Sign of it? It is true, the Church has not ſaid that this is the Intention; nor certainly has it ſaid that Ordination is the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And where no explicit Declarations are made by the Church of its Views and intentions, every Perſon is left to judge of them by the Evidence he can collect.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Argument that Preſbyters in the Church of England have <hi>ordaining Powers,</hi> is founded by this Writer on the Uſe of the Word OUR, in the Act of Ordination, where the Biſhop ſays:
<q>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the Office and Work of a Prieſt in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Impoſition of OUR, Hands.</q>
To this a very brief Anſwer is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. There are Inſtances of the like Uſe of the ſame Word in our public Offices, which if they will not prove what it poſitively <hi>does</hi> mean, will however enable us to determine what it <hi>does not</hi> mean. At the Baptiſm of Infants, the officiating Clergyman prays:
<q>Grant that whoſoever is here dedicated to thee by OUR Office and Miniſtry, &amp;c:</q>
—And at the Baptiſm of Adults:
<q>Grant that they being dedicated to thee by OUR Office and Miniſtry, &amp;c.</q>
Now in theſe Places, the Word OUR certainly does not mean, that thoſe who are preſent aſſiſt in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, or that this Ordinance is not adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prieſt only; And therefore we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, that at the Ordination of a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it does not mean, that the Ordination is not performed by the Biſhop only. What the Word
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012007_0058_0F894107DCFC41F0"/>
actually does mean, is not my Buſineſs here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now done with Mr. Shaw; having ſhewn the Weakneſs of his Arguments, and having anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered or obviated all that he or the Doctor ſays in Support of them. Indeed I might have taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that both of them ſeem to proceed on the Suppoſition, that whatever is ordered by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is injoined as <hi>equally</hi> neceſſary or important. According to this Mode of thinking, the Church of England makes wearing a Surplice as neceſſary as the public Service; and the Circumſtance of kneeling at the Communion to be as eſſential, as the great Duty of receiving that holy Sacrament. And then, to be ſure, the Impoſition of the Hands of Preſbyters at the Ordination of a Prieſt, muſt be as eſſential to the Validity of the Performance, as the Impoſition of the Biſhop's Hands, ſince both are ordered in the ſame <hi>Rubric.</hi> But ſuch an abſurd Way of Reaſoning deſerves not a formal Refutation; and I am under ſome Apprehenſion that I may be thought, by the ſenſible Reader, to have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too particular in replying to Things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I ſhall therefore not ſtop a Moment to make any Reflections upon ſuch a groſs Miſrepreſentation of the Ordinal, and of the Church of England; but proceed immediately to other Matters.</p>
            <p>IN his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the Doctor urged, that if the Preface to the Ordinal were explained by what appears to have been the Sentiments of thoſe that compiled it, it would not prove that the Church of England was epiſcopal, at that Time, in the Senſe of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> It was replied, that the Senſe of any Church muſt be taken from
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012007_0059_0F8941086CFF35F8"/>
her public Offices and Declarations, and not from the known or ſuppoſed Sentiments of Individuals. It was farther obſerved, that as to the Compilers of the Engliſh Ordinal, it did not appear that their private Sentiments were different from what they publickly expreſſed; but, on the other Hand, that there was ſufficient Evidence to convince the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, that the principal Perſons employed in that Service believed the divine, or apoſtolical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Epiſcopacy. In Order to ſhew this, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a particular Examination of the Subject, and took proper Notice of all that Dr. Chauncy had alledged, in Support of the contrary. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Evidence contained in the INSTITUTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, and ERUDITION, <hi>of a Chriſtian Man,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and publiſhed under the Direction of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop CRANMER, in the Reign of HENRY VIII, as far as I could collect it from <hi>Collier</hi>'s Abſtract, and from other Accounts.</p>
            <p>ON this Examination, the INSTITUTION ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared favourable to the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy; and a Paſſage was produced, wherein, among other Things, it is ſaid, that
<q>Biſhops are authoriſed by our Saviour to <hi>continue the Succeſſion,</hi> and <hi>perpetuate the</hi> HIERARCHY.</q>
The Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had quoted Dr. Calamy's Quotation, from the INSTITUTION and ERUDITION of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence:
<q>Prieſts and Biſhops <hi>by Gods Law</hi> are one and the ſame; and the Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Excommunication belongs <hi>equally</hi> to them both.</q>
Theſe two Sentences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory; and the true Way of ſettling the Point, whether they are fairly extracted or not, would be to have Recourſe to the Books themſelves, which is not in my Power. But, from Collier's Account,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012007_0060_0F8941092D382C00"/>
I ſuſpect there is ſome Miſtake made, either by Dr. Calamy or Dr. Chauncy, and that if their Quotation is made fairly, it is from the ERUDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION only, and not from the INSTITUTION. If the Doctor will prove that I am miſtaken, and that the Sentence quoted is contained in the INSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTION, I will allow that it greatly weakens the Evidence I produced from it on the other Side, as, on that Suppoſition, he argues juſtly, in p. 37. But ſince I have as high an Opinion of Collier's Honeſty, as he has of Calamy's, he muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me to give up the Teſtimony of my Author, becauſe it is contradicted by his. But if it ſhould be found on the other Hand, that the Doctor's Quotation, from Calamy, is not fairly made from the INSTITUTION; and mine, from Collier, or the Subſtance of it, is: Then my Argument is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, and all that he ſays in Reply to it falls of Courſe.</p>
            <p>AS to the ERUDITION, I allowed that it had, in Collier's Abſtract, ſuch a doubtful Appearance, that nothing could be juſtly concluded from it, but that the Principles of the Reformers were, at this Time, with Regard to ſome Points, in an unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, fluctuating State. It contained Paſſages, if not directly contradictory, yet which I knew not how to reconcile, to one another. In one Place it ſays:
<q>the Scripture ſpeaks expreſsly of no more than the two Orders of Prieſts and Deacons.</q>
And yet, in other Places, according to Collier,
<q>that the two Orders (of Biſhops and Prieſts) were diſtinct and ſubordinate, <hi>is plain from this</hi> ERUDITION.</q>
But then, as was obſerved farther, this Book was drawn up only by a Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King, and did not expreſs the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012007_0061_0F894109ED1F9ED8"/>
Senſe of the Church as the INSTITUTION did, which was formally conſented to by both Houſes of Convocation. The Doctor ſays, p. 39, there is no Difficulty in reconciling the Paſſages I had quoted. For <hi>if, as theſe Reformers ſay,</hi>
               <q>the Scripture makes mention of only the two orders of Prieſts and Deacons,</q>
               <hi>Biſhops cannot in their Opinion be a diſtinct Order from Prieſts; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> what is aſcribed to the Biſhop, is aſcribed to <hi>an Officer of the ſame Rank with Prieſts.</hi> On this Suppoſition, the Concluſion indeed is juſt. But if, as Collier aſſerts, who knew more of the Matter than either of us, it
<q>is plain from this ERUDITION, that the two Orders are diſtinct and ſubordinate;</q>
I fancy it will puzzle a Man, even of the Doctor's Dexterity, to reconcile all the Parts of that Book, or ſo much as the Paſſages quoted.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, the Sentiments of the Biſhops and Clergy at <hi>this Period,</hi> were not conſidered as of any great Conſequence in this Diſpute. The INSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION was publiſhed in 1537, and the ERUDITION in 1540, for temporary Uſe, while the Nation was but juſt emerging from Popery, and before it had Time to purge itſelf from the old Leaven <note n="(§)" place="bottom">See the Extracts from Bramhall and Burnet, in the <hi>Appeal Defended,</hi> p. 25.</note>. To perform ſo great a Work properly, required much Time and Caution. Of this, Cranmer and his Aſſociates were duly ſenſible; and, for the Honour of the Engliſh Reformation, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with much greater Coolneſs and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Reformers in any other Country had done. And the Method they purſued was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider diſtinctly one Doctrine after another, with the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012007_0062_0F89410AAD330F68"/>
cloſeſt Attention, until the whole Syſtem ſhould be examined, and placed on the ſure Baſis of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Authority, as was obſerved in my <hi>Defence.</hi> As a Proof of this, the ſeveral <hi>Queſtions</hi> given out to the moſt eminent Divines for their Examination and Deciſion, were pointed out.
<q>For it was at <hi>this Time,</hi> and not Ten Years afterwards, in the Reign of EDWARD VI, as Dr. Chauncy, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blind Guide the IRENICUM, aſſerts, that theſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> were given out for Diſcuſſion, as is plain from Biſhop Burnet<note n="‡" place="bottom">The <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 24.</note>,</q> with whom Strype a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees<note n="†" place="bottom">Memorials of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> p. 78.</note>. To this he replies, p. 40, <hi>If this is plain from Biſhop Burnet, he is the blind Guide to the Doctor, and not the</hi> Irenicum <hi>to me. For it is obſervable, theſe Queſtions with the Reſolutions of them are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Biſhop Burnet</hi>
               <q>ex. M. S. S. D. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</q>
               <hi>as his own Words are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a Matter of great Importance in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, to ſettle the Time <hi>when</hi> theſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> were given out and anſwered. Biſhop Burnet ſays it was in 1540; the Author of the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> that it was long afterwards in the Reign of EDWARD VI. One of them muſt be wrong, and the Queſtion is, which of them is the <hi>blind Guide.</hi> It ought not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that either of them intended to deceive his Readers; but one of them muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf. <hi>Which</hi> then, was moſt likely to have made the Miſtake?</p>
            <p>AND here it deſerves Notice, that Stillingfleet wrote his <hi>Irenicum</hi> with evident Haſte and Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and under the Influence of a Zeal bordering upon Impetuoſity. The Doctor knows, that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012007_0063_0F89410B6E4F06B8"/>
in theſe Circumſtances are liable even to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <hi>Facts</hi>; and <hi>Dates</hi> are more eaſily miſtaken by them, eſpecially when they appear not to affect the chief Object in View. Thus the Author of the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> when he became cooler, and took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect of his Performance, candidly confeſſed, that it contained many Paſſages that ſhewed his Youth, and want of Attention.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation</hi> was the Work of Time, written with Compoſure and Caution. In adjuſting the materials for his Hiſtory, which chiefly conſiſted of original Manuſcripts, the Author was obliged carefully to attend to the Circumſtance of Dates. In this Way he became ſo minutely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Progreſs of the Reformation, that, from the very Nature and Words of thoſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> he muſt have been able to arrange them in their proper Place, even if the Date had been omitted. And what renders his Account the more credible is, that he aſſigns a ſpecial Reaſon for iſſuing out the <hi>Queſtions,</hi> viz. That the Committee, which was appointed to review and correct the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> might be able to do it to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Purpoſe. For he repreſents them to have been given out during the Courſe of that Work, and when the Part relating to the Doctrine of the <hi>Seven</hi> Sacraments, as they were then called, came under Conſideration.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding theſe obvious Remarks in Favour of the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> the Doctor is poſitive that Stillingfleet muſt have been right, and Burnet wrong, becauſe the latter made Uſe of the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> of the former. It is ſtrange, that a Man of Senſe can think this has any <hi>Appearance</hi> of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012007_0064_0F89410C2EF69D10"/>
If Burnet had tranſcribed <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> his Date muſt have been corrected <hi>by</hi> it; but to infer, that, becauſe he conſulted the ſame <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> that the Author of the <hi>Irenicum</hi> had conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, THEREFORE his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> muſt be corrected by the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> in the Inſtance before us, is a Specimen of new Logic, and curious it is. For my Part, I think it much more reaſonable to conclude, that the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> in this Particular, ſhould be corrected by the <hi>Hiſtory</hi>; becauſe the Hiſtorian conſulted the ſame <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> and yet altered the controverted Date as publiſhed in the <hi>Irenicum</hi>; which he would not have done without ſufficient Reaſon while the Author, who was his intimate Friend, was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and might contradict him if he could. But more direct Evidence ſhall be produced preſently.</p>
            <p>LET us at preſent attend to the Doctor. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Biſhop Burnet himſelf was of the ſame Mind,</hi> viz. That the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned paſſed in the Reign of EDWARD VI: And to prove it, he tranſcribes from him, Words which make it evident that his own Aſſertion is falſe. Let the Reader ſee with his own Eyes, and wonder!
<q>I find, ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>another</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>like this,</hi> in the Reformation that was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried on in the ſucceeding Reign of EDWARD VI; of many Biſhops and Divines giving in their Opinions under their Hands, upon <hi>ſome Heads</hi> then examined and changed<note n="‖" place="bottom">The <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> Vol. I. p. 289.</note>.</q>
The Author is here evidently ſpeaking of the very <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> under Conſideration, a Copy of which he inſerts in his <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>firſt Volume</hi> of his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and part of which had been publiſhed in the <hi>Irenicum.</hi> He ſays that they were
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012007_0065_0F89410CEE562EC0"/>
given out at the Time when the ERUDITION was preparing. He ſpeaks of ſuch a careful Method of proceeding, as an Evidence of the great Prudence uſed in the Engliſh Reformation. He takes notice indeed, that there was <hi>another</hi> Inſtance of the <hi>like</hi> Care in the next Reign. But the Papers that paſſed, in <hi>like</hi> Manner, in the next Reign, are ſo far from being the ſame with thoſe under Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that here is not the leaſt Intimation that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the ſame Subjects; it being only ſaid, that the Biſhops and Divines at that Time, gave in their Opinions upon <hi>ſome</hi> Heads, then examined and changed. It would have been very natural for him to have ſaid, <hi>the ſame Heads,</hi> unleſs they were different.</p>
            <p>WHEN he comes to the Time, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, in the Reign of King EDWARD, he ſays:
<q>This Winter (1548) there was a Committee of ſelected Biſhops and Divines appointed for exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all the Offices of the Church, and for reforming them.—The Thing they firſt examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>; which being the chief Symbol of Chriſtian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was thought to deſerve their chief Care. And <hi>here</hi> they managed their Enquiries <hi>in the ſame Manner</hi> that was uſed in the former Reign; in which when any Thing was conſidered in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Change, it was put into ſeveral <hi>Queries,</hi> to which every one in Commiſſion was to give his <hi>Anſwer in writing.</hi> It is no Wonder if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, that followed in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, have deprived us of moſt of theſe Papers; yet there is <hi>one Set</hi> of them preſerved, relating (N. B.) to ſome <hi>Queſtions about the Prieſts ſingle communicating</hi>

                     <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> Vol. II. p. 61.</note>.</q>
What was naturally to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012007_0066_0F89410DAEE4F970"/>
from the former Paſſage, is fully expreſſed in this. The Hiſtorian ſays plainly, that the <hi>Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> given out in the Reign of King EDWARD, and to which he had refered in his former Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, related to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as it was thought at that Time "to deſerve the chief Care". HERE, ſays he, <hi>i. e.</hi> in examining the Doctrine of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> they proceeded
<q>
                  <hi>in the ſame Manner</hi> that was uſed in the former Reign.</q>
He does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that the <hi>Queries</hi> now given out related to any other Subject, than that of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>; ſo far from it, that the Words, and the whole Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Paſſage, neceſſarily imply that they did not. He moreover ſays, that moſt of the Papers that paſſed on that Occaſion, are <hi>loſt</hi>; however, that <hi>one Set</hi> of them has been preſerved, a Copy of which he publiſhes in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume.</hi> The Queſtions, in this only Set of Papers remaining, he tells us, related to
<q>the Prieſts ſingle communicating;</q>
and upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, there is not one of them that appears to have any more Reference to the Doctrine of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, than to that of the <hi>Copernican Syſtem.</hi> It is now as clear as the Meridian Sun in an uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sky, that <hi>Biſhop Burnet himſelf was</hi> NOT <hi>of the ſame Mind</hi> with my Opponent, but affirmed and proved the contrary—that, with Regard to the <hi>Date</hi> in Queſtion, the <hi>Irenicum</hi> was the
<q>blind Guide</q>
—and that the Doctor is blinder ſtill, who out-faces a much brighter Evidence than was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by the Author of the <hi>Irenicum.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">It is a more difficult Taſk than moſt Readers imagine, to deal with an Adverſary that can miſrepreſent Matters, at this Rate. To ſpeak <hi>plainly</hi> of ſuch Conduct, has the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Abuſe</hi> and <hi>Scurrility,</hi> which diſgrace any Writer; and yet, on ſome Occaſions, not to ſpeak plainly, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Cauſe of Truth, and Injuſtice to the Public. The Author of this <hi>farther Defence</hi> is thus unluckily ſituated. He is ſenſible of the Duty he owes to Truth, and to the Public; at the ſame Time, he wiſhes not to be wanting in that Charity, which
<q>hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</q>
It pains him to entertain a hard Thought, or to ſpeak a harſh Word, of any Man; and yet he ſometimes finds both to be unavoidable, when thinking and ſpeaking of a Man, who is in high Eſtimation with many People, and whoſe Character he greatly reſpected, at the Commencement of this Controverſy. In this critical Situation, as he knows the great Danger of acting improperly, he will be upon his Guard; and he hopes to meet with that Candor, which is not extreme to mark what, in ſuch Circumſtances, may be done amiſs.</note>

               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:012007_0067_0F89410E6CD90C70"/>HAVING ſettled the Date of the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> aforeſaid, and fixed it to 1540, I muſt again remind the Reader, that it was
<q>about Ten Years before the Offices for Ordination were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</q>
and before Cranmer appears to have ſettled his eccleſiaſtical Principles. It is therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, as Biſhop Burnet obſerves,
<q>in Cranmer's Paper, ſome ſingular Opinions of his about eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Offices will be found.</q>
But it deſerves ſpecial Notice, that as this Hiſtorian goes on to inform us,
<q>afterwards he <hi>changed</hi> his Opinion. For he ſubſcribed the Book that was ſoon after ſet out [<hi>the</hi> ERUDITION] which is, (the very thing that Collier affirmed of it) <hi>directly contrary</hi> to thoſe Opinions ſet down in theſe Papers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Hiſt. Ref.</hi> Vol. I, p. 289.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS a farther Proof that Cranmer altered his Opinion <hi>ſoon afterwards,</hi> it was alledged, on the Authority of Doctor <hi>Durel,</hi> that he ſubſcribed to the <hi>Two Opinions</hi> of Dr. Leighton, in theſe very Papers, that were favourable to Epiſcopacy. That Author ſays, that upon examining the original
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012007_0068_0F89410F2C668420"/>
               <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> he found <hi>Th. Cantuarienſis</hi> ſubſcribed to both; which is omitted, either negligently or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably, in Biſhop Burnet's Copy. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor objects to the Evidence of Durel, <hi>which,</hi> ſays he, p. 42, <hi>is no Evidence at all, if Mr. Boyſe may be believed, who ſpeaks of him as</hi>
               <q>an Author too notorious for his many Falſehoods and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in this Kind to be depended on.</q>
But ſome have given the ſame Character of Mr. Boyſe himſelf. Be that as it may, Dr. Durel's Character is not to be taken from Mr. Boyſe, nor from any other Writer againſt Epiſcopacy. He had ſaid and done too much in Favour of it, to expect fair Treatment from ſuch as oppoſe it. He had ſhewn that this Form of Government was held in high Veneration by all the reformed Churches abroad; that the Church of England was greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and honoured by them for eſtabliſhing it; and that the Engliſh Diſſenters were utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them for diſobeying and rejecting it. For this he was treated, in his Life Time, with the groſſeſt Scurrility by Hickman, and plentifully abuſed by Dr. du Moulin; but it ought not to be forgotten that the latter of theſe Writers had the Grace to repent of this Conduct, and retract it, in his "LAST WORDS." Some People ſince have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied his Abuſe, but not his Repentance. Durel was well known in almoſt all the reformed Churches in Europe. In ſome of them he received Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and might have received it in others; and the many Letters ſtill extant, written to him by the moſt eminent foreign Proteſtants of his Time, demonſtrate that his Reputation was great, and his Character reſpectable. Having thus ſhewn the Credibility of this Witneſs, it is not doubted but the candid will admit, upon his <hi>poſitive</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012007_0069_0F894110D3403CE8"/>
that the <hi>two Opinions</hi> of Dr. Leighton were actually conſented to by Cranmer, and ſigned <hi>Th. Cantuarienſis</hi>; notwithſtanding the <hi>negative</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Biſhop Burnet.</p>
            <p>FROM that Time, viz. 1540,
<q>I find in this great Reformer no Fluctuation of Principles; but many Proofs appear of his ſettled and ſteady Belief, that Biſhops are ſuperior to Preſbyters, by apoſtolical Inſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 30.</note>.</q>
Here Reference was particularly made to the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> he publiſhed in 1548, in which, Biſhop Burnet who had ſeen it ſays,
<q>he fully owns the <hi>divine</hi> Inſtitution of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</q>
To this the Doctor replies. p. 46; <hi>Could a Sight of this</hi> Catechiſm <hi>be obtained, it is</hi> PROBABLE <hi>it might be in our Power to refute what it here ſaid from Biſhop Burnet.</hi> We ſee, that, however firmly the Doctor relies upon the Biſhop's <hi>negative</hi> Evidence, when in his Favour, he will allow but little Weight to his <hi>poſitive</hi> Evidence, when it makes againſt him; and that he offers his own bare groundleſs <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> as ſufficient to confute it.</p>
            <p>I AM not able to obtain a Sight of that <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> any more than the Doctor. It is extremely ſcarce at this Day; however, ſome Copies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and there is one, in particular, in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Library at Lambeth. A Gentleman of eminent Integrity, and whoſe literary Fame is well known both at home and abroad, writes, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dated Feb. 16, 1770, that he had read this Copy more than once, and had made Extracts from it, among which he finds the following.
<q>Firſt, it is neceſſary to our Salvation to have
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012007_0070_0F8941116CF8A260"/>
Preachers and Miniſters of God's Word to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the true Faith and Knowledge of God. Secondly, that Preachers muſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this Honour to themſelves, but muſt be ordained and appointed to this Office. For as it is impoſſible to be ſaved without Faith, and we cannot believe without being taught of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo Teachers, except they be ſent, cannot fruitfully teach. For the Seed of God's Word doth never bring forth Fruit unleſs the Lord of the Harveſt do give Increaſe, and by his Holy Spirit work with the Sower: but God doth not work with the Preacher whom he hath not ſent.— To know who are ſent, you are to underſtand that when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt began to preach, he called and choſe his 12 Apoſtles; and afterwards beſides theſe Twelve, he ſent forth Three Score and Ten Diſciples and gave them Authority to preach the Goſpel. And a little before his Death and Paſſion he made his Prayer to his heavenly Father for them, and for all thoſe who ſhould believe through their preaching. John xvii.— And after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, the Apoſtles gave Authority to other holy Men to miniſter God's Word. Where they found Men fit to preach God's Word they laid their Hands upon them and gave them the Holy Ghoſt as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves received the ſame Holy Ghoſt of Chriſt to execute this Office. And they that were ſo ordained were indeed, and alſo were called the Miniſters of God as the Apoſtles themſelves were. And thus the Miniſtration of God's Word (which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did firſt inſtitute) was derived from the Apoſtles Time to our Days. And this was the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Orders and Unction of the Apoſtles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012007_0071_0F8941122D21A278"/>
they at the Beginning made Biſhops and Prieſts, and this ſhall continue in the Church to the World's End.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Paſſage, which is undoubtedly a faithful Tranſcript, is ſufficient to prove Biſhop Burnet's Aſſertion. For it maintains a Difference of Orders by <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> between the <hi>Seventy,</hi> who could only miniſter the Word, and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who could alſo appoint others; and it aſſerts that the Power, whereby Biſhops and Prieſts were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally appointed, ſhall continue to the End of the World. I ſhall make no farther Remarks upon it; the curious Reader can examine the Paſſage at his Leiſure.</p>
            <p>IT was mentioned as a farther Proof that when Cranmer had once ſettled his eccleſiaſtical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he ſteadily adhered to them; that in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>of the Authority of the Keys,</hi> publiſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his <hi>Catechiſm,</hi>
               <q>his Notions of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy and Church-Government are ſo high, that even the <hi>high-flying</hi> Dr. Hicks reprinted it at large, in his Preface to,
<q>the divine Right of Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</q>
               </q>
The Doctor replies: <hi>This Sermon is, I conclude, the very one repaired to by</hi> Mr. Drury <hi>in Order to prove that</hi> Cranmer <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his Opinion about Biſhops and Prieſts; to whom</hi> Mr. Boyſe <hi>replies,</hi>
               <q>the Paſſage he has cited in this Sermon no Way aſſerts Prieſts and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be at the Biginning two diſtinct Orders.</q>
So then; the Sermon, it ſeems, does not prove the Point for which it is alledged, becauſe a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Paſſage in the Sermon does not prove it; and that Paſſage does not prove it, becauſe Mr. Boyſe ſays it does not. But any one, who is acquainted
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012007_0072_0F894112EE2D0B80"/>
with Dr. Hicks's Character and Writings, muſt know that he was as good a Judge, in this Caſe, as Mr. Boyſe; and his Inducement to publiſh the Sermon, if it made not for his Purpoſe, ſurely was not equal to Mr. Boyſe's Temptation, after it was publiſhed, to ſay that it was not for his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when it really was.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor after denying that the Reformed Church of England was originally epiſcopal, had ſaid, in the Words of Mr. J. Owen, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Epiſcopacy, as now contended for, was
<q>FIRST promoted in the Church of England by Archbiſhop Laud.</q>
It was anſwered:
<q>There may indeed be ſome ſecret Meaning in the Word <hi>promoted,</hi> which I do not comprehend; but until it be unfolded, I muſt take the Liberty to believe, that the national Eſtabliſhment of this Doctrine, again and again, and making it a fundamental Principle of the Reformation, was doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>promote</hi> it<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 32.</note>.</q>
In his <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 48, he thus explains himſelf: <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> Laud, <hi>without all Doubt, was the firſt—in Oppoſition to any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Eſtabliſhment, or its being at all a Principle, much leſs a fundamental one of the Reformation, that openly aſſerted and pleaded for the Doctrine.</hi> This <hi>Reſponſe</hi> is more <hi>oracular</hi> and <hi>myſterious</hi> than the former. If the Reader can underſtand ſuch Language, I am free to confeſs, that he has more Sagacity than falls to my Lot. Laud never aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pleaded for this Doctrine in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to any national Eſtabliſhment, but in <hi>Conformity</hi> with our own, as he proved at his Trial <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the Hiſtory of his Troubles and Tryal, by Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, p. 37<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. I ſaid not
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012007_0073_0F894113AD960758"/>
that he pleaded for the apoſtolical Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, as a fundamental Principle of the Church of England, which I know not that he ever did, in ſo many Words; but what I ſaid was, that its having been eſtabliſhed as ſuch, proves that it had been <hi>promoted</hi> before his Time. But I will not enlarge. As I underſtand not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Sentence, I may miſtake its Meaning, or give it a Meaning where it has none.</p>
            <p>IT was farther anſwered, that
<q>if the Meaning of the Word <hi>promoted,</hi> be, that none before Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Laud contended for the Superiority of Biſhops over Preſbyters, by divine Appointment, in their <hi>Writings,</hi> I muſt ſtill deny it; as I am able to produce abundant Evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q>
This, I believe, was Part, if not the whole, of the Doctor's original Meaning; and I proved his Miſtake, by producing many Authors before Laud, that contended for this Doctrine in their Writings. He now half confeſſes his Miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſaying that for this Aſſertion he depended upon the Authority of Mr. J. Owen. I adviſe him to be more careful for the future, upon what Authors he puts his Dependence; for ſome of them, if truſted too freely, will bring one into Trouble. The Doctor comforts himſelf however, that, in the preſent Caſe, his Miſtake is but trifling. <hi>Of what great Importance is it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>whether he</hi> (Laud) <hi>was the firſt, ſecond, third or fourth that contended for this Doctrine?</hi> In his former Pamphlet he urged it as a Point of great Importance. This brought on the Diſpute, whether the Fact was as he aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. In this Diſpute, ſuch as it is, the only Queſtion was, whether Laud in Reality was the firſt that maintained the Doctrine, or not. If he
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012007_0074_0F8941146E513550"/>
was the ſecond only, he could not be the firſt, in the Senſe of the Queſtion. So plain a Caſe has but little need of Illuſtration: However, let us ſuppoſe the Doctor had aſſerted that Lord Anſon was the firſt that had ſailed round the Globe, and had inſiſted upon it as a Matter of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and that another had taken him up upon this Point, and ſhewn, from the beſt Authorities, that Drake, Cavendiſh and many others had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed the Globe long before him:—Would it have been deemed a juſt Reply if he had ſaid, it is a Matter of no Importance, whether Anſon was the firſt, ſecond, third or fourth? Although this might be ſaid perhaps truly, yet it could not be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, with Reference to a Debate where it was the only Point in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>THE Perſons introduced as prior to Laud in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the divine Right of Epiſcopacy, were <hi>Whitgift</hi> (under the Patronage of Archbiſhop Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Biſhop Cooper,) Bancroft, Hutton, Bilſon, Hooker and Saravia. This Liſt might have been eaſily enlarged, but it was thought ſufficient; and it was clearly proved, that they all contended for the divine Right of Epiſcopacy. Dr. Chauncy ſays in Reply: <hi>They were, it is true, Epiſcopalians on the Foot of divine Right, in a</hi> QUALIFIED, MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIGATED <hi>Senſe; but not in the Senſe in which</hi> Laud <hi>and the Doctor plead for this Right.</hi> p. 49. This Gentleman has the beſt Knack I have ever met with, of ſhifting for himſelf, and repairing his Loſſes. After having been obliged to give up the Point in Diſpute here, and to allow that the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Perſons were <hi>Epiſcopalians on the Foot of a divine Right,</hi> contrary to what he had ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſiſted upon as a Matter of Importance; he
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012007_0075_0F8941152E388118"/>
gets a Reinforcement from <hi>Stephen Lob,</hi> or ſome other Author of an anonymous Pamphlet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with his Diſtinctions, and explains away his Conceſſion—by ſaying that the divine Right for which thoſe Epiſcopalians contended, was not a divine Right properly, but a divine Right in a <hi>qualified, mitigated</hi> Senſe. How many <hi>Sorts</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right there are in his Opinion, and what <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Mitigation he intended, he ought to have told us; for it is in vain to diſpute with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding his Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>HE attempts not to ſhew that the Principles of Hutton, Bilſon and Saravia were miſrepreſented; but what was ſaid to prove that Whitgift, Bancroft and Hooker believed and maintained the divine Right of Epiſcopacy, he confronts with Evidence brought in by Stephen Lob, tending to prove, in his Opinion, that they were Epiſcopalians, not of the firſt Rate like Laud, but in a <hi>qualified, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> Senſe. The firſt of theſe Writers is quoted, p. 50, as diſtinguiſhing between Things that are <hi>ſo neceſſary that without them we cannot be ſaved,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>ſo neceſſary that without them we cannot</hi> SO WELL <hi>and</hi> CONVENIENTLY <hi>be ſaved</hi>; and then ſaying that it is only by this ſecond Kind of Neceſſity, that Government, or any particular Form of it, is neceſſary for the Church. But this, which is given as the Opinion of Whitgift, by no Means implies, that he thought Epiſcopacy not to be of apoſtolical Inſtitution—much leſs, that he thought Men might depart from it without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Neceſſity—and leaſt of all, that they were at Liberty to ſet up a Form of eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to it. Nor does it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Declaration he made to Beza in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012007_0076_0F894115EE851E60"/>
Words:
<q>We make no Doubt but that the epiſcopal Degree, is an Inſtitution apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and divine, and ſo always hath been held by a continual Courſe of Times from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to this very Age of ours.</q>
I know of no Epiſcopalians that eſteem any Form of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government to be ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that without it <hi>we cannot be ſaved.</hi> Even Laud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was an Epiſcopalian of the <hi>firſt</hi> Rate, was not of this Opinion. He treated the foreign Proteſtant Churches, that were without epiſcopal Government as Members of the ſame Body with the Church of England, and maintained with them a friendly Correſpondence.
<q>See his Letter in 1639, to the Swiſs Divines in the <hi>Praeſtantium Virorum Epiſtolae,</hi> Ep. 552, where they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him <hi>Confratres mei chariſſimi:</hi> And of their Letter to him he ſaith, <hi>it was agreeable to him on a double Account, as it was theirs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to Chriſtian Peace. Such Men ought they to be who are Members of the ſame Body, and who believe and profeſs the Communion of Saints.</hi> And in 1629, he writes to Voſſius with great Mildneſs and Concern for the whole reformed Church, and for Peace among Divines, in Ep. 471. And he ſaith to him in 1633, <hi>It is a mere Invention that the Engliſh Biſhops deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Juriſdiction over the foreign proteſtant Churches: A Thing which they never ſo much as dreamed of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>WHAT has been obſerved hitherto, is on the Suppoſition that Whitgift ſpoke in the Senſe in which the Doctor underſtands him. But upon a
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012007_0077_0F894116B1538870"/>
cloſer Examination I believe it will be found, that he had no particular Reference to Epiſcopacy, in the Paſſages quoted. When he uſed thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he was combating a known Maxim of many of the Puritans, viz. That every Thing relating to the Government or Diſcipline of the Church, or to public Worſhip, that is not clearly expreſſed in Scripture, is unlawful. This was one of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, on which their famous <hi>Admonition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> was erected, rotten as it was <note n="¶" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 362.</note>. Neal, their Hiſtorian and Advocate, tells us, that
<q>
                  <hi>Mr. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright maintained that</hi> the holy Scriptures were not only a Standard of Doctrine, but of Diſcipline and Government; and that the Church of Chriſt in all Ages was to be regulated by them. <hi>He was therefore for conſulting his</hi> Bible only, <hi>and for reducing all Things as near as poſſible to the apoſtolic Standard</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> Vol I. p. 231, <hi>Dub. Edit.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
In confuting this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it was applied by the Puritans, Whitgift might have ſaid:
<q>There is no certain Kind of Government or Diſcipline, preſcribed to the Church; but that the ſame may be altered as the Profit of the Churches requires.—I do deny, that the Scriptures do ſet down any one certain Kind of Government in the Church to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, for all Times, Perſons and Places without Alteration:</q>
I ſay, he might have uſed theſe and the like Expreſſions, ſpeaking in the Senſe of the Puritans, and yet have believed the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy in as high a Senſe as Laud himſelf did.</p>
            <p>TO prove that Bancroft was not epiſcopal, on the Footing of a divine Right, except in a <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012007_0078_0F8941176D2BDF90"/>
mitigated</hi> Senſe, and that he <hi>allowed Ordination by Preſbyters to be valid,</hi> the Doctor, in p. 51, mentions the Caſe of the three Scots Preſbyters who were conſecrated Biſhops with his Conſent, without any previous Ordinations by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of epiſcopal Hands. This Caſe he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his former Pamphlet with the like View; and it was ſaid, in Anſwer, that thoſe Perſons were immediately conſecrated Biſhops on this Principle,
<q>that the epiſcopal Character, as it included thoſe of a Preſbyter and a Deacon, might be conveyed by a ſingle Conſecration, as in the Caſe of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe and Nectarius.</q>
He now replies, <hi>as this is reſted on no other Proof than the Doctor's own Affirmation, it ought to be conſidered as nothing.</hi> Experience has taught me not to be ſurpriſed, in this Controverſy, at the moſt unexpected and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Aſſertions; and therefore I can, with the utmoſt Calmneſs, aſſure the Reader, that what is here ſaid to be <hi>reſted on no other Proof than my own Affirmation,</hi> was reſted <hi>altogether</hi> on other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and that Collier's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> Vol. II. p. 701, and Grey's <hi>Anſwer to Peirce,</hi> p. 143, were particularly quoted for this Account, as any one may ſee, upon turning to the <hi>Appeal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> p. 46, 47. If Spotſwood gives a different Account of this Affair, it only follows that it is a diſputed Caſe; and it is a much fairer Method to judge of Bancroft's Principles by what he clearly ſays in his Writings, than from the doubtful Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a diſputed Fact. Every Man muſt be ſuppoſed beſt to know his own Principles; and his own Declaration muſt be the beſt Proof of what Doctrines he believes. Let the Reader then attend to Bancroft himſelf explaining his own Principles, relating to this Head, and placing them as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

quoted to prove the contrary, they were in Anſwer to the above mentioned <hi>Maxim</hi> of the Puritans, as is evident from the whole <hi>third Book:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what has been ſaid in the Caſe of Whitgift, is equally applicable to Hooker. In other Places, where he has no immediate Reference to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, he clearly and ſtrongly expreſſes his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the divine Inſtitution and Obligation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Government.
<q>A Biſhop, ſays he, is a Miniſter <hi>of God,</hi> unto whom with <hi>permanent Continuance,</hi> there is given not only Power of adminiſtering the Word and Sacraments, which Power other Preſbyters have; but alſo a <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Power to <hi>ordain</hi> eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and a Power of <hi>Chiefty in Government</hi> over Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well as Laymen, a Power to be by Way of Juriſdiction, <hi>a Paſtor even to Paſtors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

<q>That ſo (<hi>i. e.</hi> as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God)</q>

And he concludes the Section with theſe memorable Words:
<q>Wherefore let us not fear to be herein <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> that if any Thing in the Church's Government, ſurely the <hi>firſt Inſtitution</hi> of Biſhops was <hi>from Heaven,</hi> was even <hi>of God</hi>; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt was the Author of it.</hi>

            <p>THE Doctor had alſo argued that <hi>Reordination was not practiſed</hi> in the Church of England <hi>before
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012007_0081_0F89411A6E147688"/>
the Time of</hi> Archbiſhop Laud. This occaſioned the Caſe to be fully conſidered and fairly ſtated, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Appeal defended.</hi> p. 42. Among other Things I ſaid, that it was an eſtabliſhed Law from the very Beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, that none ſhould be admitted as lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Church of England without epiſcopal Ordination; uſing the very Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, and meaning the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> which eſtabliſhed the Book of Common-Prayer and all that it contained. The Doctor replies, p. 55, <hi>this is ſaid in direct Contradiction</hi> to the Act of 13 <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; from which he gives an imperfect and unfair Extract, that it may furniſh him with a Pretence of ſaying ſomething in Oppoſition to me. That one Act of that Reign was contradictory to another, without a Deſign of repealing it, ought not to be ſuppoſed without good Evidence; and it is not denied, that the Eſtabliſhment I refered to was made. But it might much more plauſibly have been objected, after the Example of Biſhop Bonner, that the Act of Uniformity, although it in general eſtabliſhed the Book of Common-Prayer, yet took no particular Notice of the Ordinal, which many of our Acts of Parliament diſtinguiſh as a different Book. However, could it be proved that the Preface to, or other Parts of, the Ordinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no legal Force from the Act of Uniformity; yet it had the Support of <hi>Art.</hi> xxxvi. in 1562; and there was an Act in the 8th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly injoined,
<q>that ſuch Order and Form for the Conſecration of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and for the making of Prieſts, Deacons and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as was ſet forth in the Time of the late King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and authoriſed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the ſaid

            <p>THAT the Reader may judge, whether what is here ordered was repealed, or contradicted, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travened by the Doctor's Act of 13 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I will give an Extract of ſo much of that Act as relates to the Subject before us, ſupplying the material Omiſſions in his Quotation of the ſame Paſſage, which, that they may be diſtinguiſhed, are printed in <hi>Italics.</hi>
               <q>Be it enacted—that every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under the Degree of a Biſhop, which doth or ſhall pretend to be a Prieſt, or Miniſter of God's holy Word and Sacraments, by Reaſon of any other Form of Inſtitution, Conſecration or ordering, than the Form ſet forth by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Time of the late King—or now uſed in the Reign of our moſt gracious ſovereign Lady, <hi>before the Feaſt of the Nativity of Chriſt next following,</hi> ſhall in the Preſence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop —declare his Aſſent, and ſubſcribe to all the Articles of Religion—and ſhall bring from ſuch Biſhop—in writing, under his Seal authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic a Teſtimonial of ſuch Aſſent and Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion —upon Pain that every ſuch Perſon <hi>which ſhall not before the ſaid Feaſt do as is appointed,</hi> ſhall be (ipſo Facto) deprived<note n="‡" place="bottom">See <hi>Codex,</hi> p. 396, and Sparrows Collection, p. 118.</note>.</q>
The Doctor ſays that this Act, meaning this particular Clauſe of it, <hi>continued in Force till</hi> Charles II; whereas it is evident, beyond Contradiction, from the Words he endeavoured to conceal, that it was to
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012007_0083_0F89411BEE53AE20"/>
have no Force, and could have none, after
<q>the Feaſt of the Nativity of Chriſt next following</q>
the Time of its paſſing. He alſo ſays <hi>it is a full Proof that it was not her</hi> (Queen <hi>Elizabeth's) Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Ordination was, by divine Appointment, appropriated to Biſhops in Diſtinction from Preſbyters, ſo that Ordination by Preſbyters only was invalid</hi>: Whereas there is no Appearance of its having any Relation to the Validity, or Invalidity, of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Preſbyters. The Deſign of it was chiefly to provide for ſuch Clergymen, as had received epiſcopal Ordination according to the popiſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; with a farther View to ſuch as might have received, what was eſteemed a valid, Ordination abroad. But what was eſteemed a valid Ordination, is neither ſaid nor implied. The Act does not provide that <hi>all,</hi> who had received any Kind of Ordination, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the eſtabliſhed Ordinal, ſhould be made capable of holding Preferment; but that none, ordained otherwiſe, without qualifying themſelves in the Manner preſcribed, ſhould be admitted as ſuch.
<q>Whether thoſe ordained by foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, where Neceſſity, not Choice, made it impoſſible to have epiſcopal Ordination, were (qualified to hold Benefices) this Act doth not ſay. And ſuppoſing the firſt Paragraph be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to indulge ſuch till the Chriſtmas fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, upon ſubſcribing, and after that Period to refuſe them: On this ſuppoſition, the Rejection being perpetual, and the Indulgence only for a ſhort Term, the Act is rather againſt the foreign proteſtant Ordination, as not valid in this Church†:</q>
And conſequently, however Whittingham might have availed himſelf of the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012007_0084_0F89411CAD1F0298"/>
Indulgence, Travers, who was too late, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Benefit from the Act.</p>
            <p>THE Subject of the King's Supremacy was the next in Courſe; but as the Doctor chooſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in another Place, I ſhall not object, as I am not diſpoſed to contend with him for Trifles. He gives here, p. 57, an Extract from Burn's <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Law,</hi> under the Title <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which, without being firſt garbled according to his uſual Manner, he knew could not anſwer his Purpoſe; of which I ſhall take no farther Notice.</p>
            <p>
               <q>SHOULD it now be aſked, what is all this to the Buſineſs of an American Epiſcopate? My Anſwer is, I know not, but perhaps Dr. Chauncy does.</q>
This Obſervation was made in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> after I had rambled from the main Point 50 or 60 Pages in Purſuit of my Opponent, who ought, if any one, to have been able to aſſign ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, as he alone was the Cauſe of the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It was my Buſineſs, as Matters were circumſtanced, to attend upon him through all his Aberrations; and Duty required me, as well as I could, to defend the Church of England againſt all his Attacks, which I had very undeſignedly occaſioned. The ſame Obſervation I have too much Reaſon to repeat, at this Time. I have been long preſſing forward, but have not yet been able to come to the main Point in Diſpute. This I again lay to his Charge; as by the Introduction of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Shaw,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Lob,</hi> and his <hi>old Reprint,</hi> and his <hi>new Diſtinctions,</hi> he has brought not only upon me, but alſo upon the Reader, much need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:012007_0085_0F89411D6E214BB0"/>WHAT was intended as Proof of the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Officers in the Church, the Reader may ſee in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 59. The Doctor allows what was ſaid on the Subject to be even <hi>ſelf-evident,</hi> p. 58; but then he contends that it is no Proof of the Point, becauſe it was raiſed upon a bad Foundation. For I had <hi>taken for granted, that Authority, if conveyed</hi> MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATELY, <hi>muſt be conveyed by</hi> PERSONAL SUCCESSION, which ought, it ſeems, firſt to have been proved. He ſays farther; <hi>I can aſſure him—it is the Opinion of the non-epiſcopalian Coloniſts, that the Power of perpetuating the Miniſtration of the Word and Goſpel Ordinances, is ſo lodged with the Chriſtian Churches, that, whenever the Caſe requires it, they can begin a Succeſſion</hi> de novo, <hi>which Succeſſion will be as truly veſted with Authority from Chriſt, as if it had been uninterruptedly handed down from the Apoſtles:</hi> And he pretends that Hooker was of the ſame Opinion. I ſhall not ſpend Time in inquiring whether the Senſe of the <hi>non-epiſcopalian Coloniſts</hi> is truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in theſe Words, or not. I could eaſily prove, that ſeveral of their moſt ſenſible Writers have thought otherwiſe; but it is enough for the preſent Purpoſe, that what is here expreſſed is the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Opinion, on which Account only an Examination of it in this Place is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>HE readily allows that
<q>none have Authority in the Chriſtian Church, but thoſe who derive it from Chriſt, either mediately, or immediately.</q>
An <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Conveyance of eccleſiaſtical Authority from Chriſt, we have at preſent no Concern with. We are only to inquire, in what Manner that Power, which Chriſt formerly beſtowed for the Edification of his Church, can <hi>now</hi> be obtained, for thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:012007_0086_0F89411E2D928100"/>
Purpoſes for which it was then granted. Now, I think it will not be diſputed, that <hi>wherever</hi> that Power was lodged, from <hi>thence</hi> it muſt be received, if it be received at all. The moſt material Queſtion then is, to whom was this Power originally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Chriſt? It will be ſaid by ſome, that it was given to the Church. In one Senſe this is true; as whatever is given to any Members of a Society, for the general Benefit of that Society, may be ſaid to be given to the Society. But if we examine the original Grant of eccleſiaſtical Power, it will appear, that it was not made to the Church diffuſively, but to certain Perſons, under whoſe Care and Government the Church was immediately placed. Thoſe Perſons, who undoubtedly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what Authority they received, proceeded forthwith to exerciſe it, in Diſcharge of the great Truſt repoſed in them. Now the whole Conduct of the Apoſtles neceſſarily ſuppoſes and implies, that the Government of the Church here on earth was left <hi>intirely</hi> in their Hands. The Acknowledgement and Submiſſion of all Chriſtians alſo prove the ſame Point. As, on the one Hand, the Apoſtles made Laws for the Government of the Church; ſo we find, on the other, that thoſe Laws were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obeyed. All diſputed Matters were referred to their Deciſion, from which there was no Appeal. In ſhort, they exerciſed, in the Name of Chriſt, an uncontroulable Authority in the Church; and, as Occaſions required, they appointed particular Perſons to act as ſubordinate Miniſters.</p>
            <p>LET the Caſe be carefully and cloſely examined, and, I think, there can be no Difficulty in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, whether, in the firſt Inſtance, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt was lodged in the Hands of the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012007_0087_0F89411EEDE6CF08"/>
Apoſtles only and excluſively, ſo that none could act as Officers or Miniſters without their Conſent and Appointment: Or, whether it was lodged in the Church diffuſively, in ſuch a Manner, that the Members of it, met together in a popular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, might reject or diſplace an Apoſtle, and put another in his Stead, by Virtue of the Commiſſion given by Chriſt. If the whole Power at <hi>this</hi> Time is allowed to have been in the Hands of the Apoſtles, it will go very far towards deciding the Matter in Diſpute. For <hi>when</hi> was this original Conſtitution altered, and <hi>who</hi> had a Right to alter it? Who could reduce that, which Chriſt had formed into a regular Society, with proper Officers to govern it, from an organiſed Body into a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Maſs? To ſay that the Apoſtles could make this Alteration, is to aſcribe to them a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power, without any Shadow of Evidence that they ever had it—a Power, which implies that they were better Judges of what was a proper Conſtitution for ſuch a Society as the Chriſtian Church, than the divine Founder himſelf. But ſuppoſing them to have had ſuch a Power, <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>on what Occaſion,</hi> did they exert it? Where is the Proof, where are the Records, of this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Event? But, on the other Hand, if the very Nature of Things, and every Monument remaining teſtify againſt it, as they certainly do; we may be aſſured, that the Conſtitution of the Church was the ſame when the Apoſtles left it, as when they were at firſt intruſted with the Care of it. And if it was not changed by them, and they had no Power to change it, any more than Aaron could change the primitive Conſtitution of the Jewiſh Church; whether others, ſince their Time, can have had ſuch a Power, may ſafely be left for
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012007_0088_0F89411FAE21B528"/>
common Senſe to decide. To this may be added, that if the original Conſtitution of the Church has been altered, it is ſo far another Society, and not the ſame that was founded by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>WHERE a Society is conſtituted under a particular Form of Government, and deſigned for Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it is eſſential to it, that the Officers have a Power of perpetuating themſelves, by appointing Succeſſors, if they are not particularly appointed by the Founder of the Society. This was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Caſe of the Chriſtian Church, if we may judge from the Practice of the Apoſtles. Where they were preſent, none received eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, but immediately from them. In diſtant Places, none received, or could receive, ſuch Authority, but from thoſe Perſons whom they had duly authorized to impart it. Upon this Maxim Timothy was ſent to Epheſus by St. Paul, and Titus was left in Crete, to ordain Elders in every City.</p>
            <p>THE Chriſtian Church was thus originally conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted under Officers of divine Appointment, as evidently as the Jewiſh Church was; and Chriſtians, in the Time of the Apoſtles, had no more Right to ſet up an Authority different from theirs, or in Oppoſition to it, than the Iſraelites had, in the Rebellion of Korah, to gainſay Moſes and Aaron in theſe very <hi>popular</hi> Words:
<q>Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing <hi>all the Congregation are holy,</hi> every one of them, and <hi>the Lord is among them</hi>; wherefore then lift you up yourſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?<note n="*" place="bottom">

Let it now be obſerved, that what were the Rights of Chriſtians
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012007_0089_0F8941206CAE6E48"/>
in the Apoſtles Days, the very ſame, neither more nor leſs, are the Rights of Chriſtians at this Day. If therefore the Church at Epheſus, for Inſtance, could not ordain Elders, without, or in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, the Authority given to Timothy; neither can the Church now, in any Country, ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, without, or in Oppoſition to, the Authority of thoſe, who are in the ſame Station that Timothy was<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>non-epiſcopalian Coloniſts,</hi> it ſeems, claim, in Neglect or rather in Defiance of the Authority above-mentioned, a Power to ordain, and to begin a Succeſſion <hi>de novo.</hi> This Claim, I ſuppoſe, is founded in the Privileges given <hi>in common</hi> to all Chriſtians, and not in the Privileges given to ſome Chriſtians in Preference to others. But the common Privileges of Chriſtians are equal in all, in male and female, bond and free; for the Goſpel knows nothing of theſe Diſtinctions. Now whatever power is exerciſed by a Body of Perſons who are equal in Authority, muſt be exerciſed by the Direction of the Majority, to which the minor Part muſt ſubmit. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing then an Aſſembly of Chriſtians to be called together for the Buſineſs of beginning a Succeſſion <hi>de novo</hi>: As no Chriſtians can be excluded, the Voices and Rights of all being equal, it may happen that the Women amount to a Majority, and agree in an Opinion different from that of the Men. I would aſk the Doctor, whether the Act of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, thus circumſtanced, can produce the Ordination intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If he ſays <hi>no,</hi> he muſt renounce his Principle, and that of the <hi>non-epiſcopalian Coloniſts.</hi> But indeed I have long obſerved, that this Doctrine of eccleſiaſtical Authority lodged in the People, is only uſed for Convenience on particular Occaſions, and that it is ſeldom or never made the Rule of Practice. Accordingly, in Church-Meetings for the Purpoſe of Diſcipline, &amp;c. among the <hi>non-epiſcopalian Coloniſts,</hi> the Women are not conſulted; they appear not by Proxy; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are generally as good Chriſtians as the Men, and have an equal Right to direct in theſe Matters; but the Men <hi>uſurp</hi> all that Right to themſelves, in which, by their own Principles, they have but an equal Share.</note>.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid it appears, that in the Apoſtles Time, and conſequently at this Day, the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012007_0090_0F8941218E97E2B8"/>
Authority to govern and order the Church, which was lodged in the Hands of particular Perſons, and not in the Body diffuſive, could be derived in the firſt Inſtance, in no other Way than by <hi>perſonal</hi> Communication; and in after Inſtances, could, and can be derived from the Apoſties in no other Way than by <hi>perſonal Succeſſion,</hi> in a Line that has never been interrupted. By <hi>perſonal Succeſſion</hi> is here meant a Succeſſion of particular Perſons in the Government of the Church, to whom the Power of Ordination has been regularly conveyed, by thoſe that have regularly received it, in this Manner, from the Apoſtles themſelves; and by its being <hi>uninterrupted</hi> is meant, that throughout the Succeſſion, eccleſiaſtical Authority has been handed down by thoſe who were duly authoriſed to convey it.</p>
            <p>THE Point which was <hi>taken for granted</hi> before, is now, I truſt, ſufficiently proved. If the Reader is of the ſame Opinion, let him take Notice, that Doctor Chauncy allows, p. 58, that it is <hi>the only Thing that needed Proof,</hi> and that, upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the Neceſſity of an <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> is <hi>ſelf-evident.</hi> I have therefore no Need to enlarge farther on the Subject. I can freely truſt what has been now ſaid, in Conjunction with what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly offered, to the Judgment of every Reader that is not groſsly partial.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor has a Number of other Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relating to the Subject of an uninterrupted Succeſſion, and many other Objections againſt what was ſaid in Favour of it, but they appear to me to be but of little Conſequence. His Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Hooker, is introduced in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012007_0091_0F8941232ECDEB18"/>
as to pervert his Meaning: His Quotation from M. Claude, is unworthy of his Character: And his Quotation from Dodwell, is contrary to the known Principles of that Author. With the like Liberties, a Man may undertake to prove any Thing from any Writer.—As to what may be done in Caſes of Neceſſity, it will be Time enough to conſider it, when the Neceſſity happens. We know that Neceſſity never could be pleaded by the Diſſenters at home, and their <hi>non-epiſcopalian</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Colonies are <hi>anti-epiſcopal</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Author of a <hi>critical Commentary</hi> on A. Bp. SECKER'<hi>s Letter to Mr.</hi> WALPOLE, ſpeaking of the Diſſenters at home, at whoſe Head he affects to figure, ſays:
<q>It was their Concern for, and their Deſire to preſerve to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans of their own ANTI-EPISCOPAL <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> the full Exerciſe,</q>
&amp;c. p. 82.</note>. At the ſame Time they care as little, the Doctor tells us, p. 62, about an <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as of Biſhops. For they not only believe and are confident, but <hi>they</hi> KNOW <hi>they have Power from Chriſt to conſtitute Officers for all the Purpoſes of the Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> whenever there ſhall be Occaſion for it.—As to our Saviour's Promiſe to his Apoſtles to be with them to the End of the World, it implies that he intended that they, and their Succeſſors in the ſame Office, ſhould continue to the End of the World. This Promiſe therefore is a ſufficient Security, that the Succeſſion in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not been, and ſhall not be, interrupted. Beſides,
<q>it is incumbent on the Objectors to prove,</q>
that the Interruption has happened; for until this be proved, the Preſumption will be that it never has. Indeed it appears from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things morally impoſſible that it ever ſhould have happened. For it has been the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church in all Ages, that no Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012007_0092_0F8941236CF074A0"/>
was effectual, but what was performed by Biſhops. This has been a perpetual Guard to the Succeſſion contended for, becauſe no Ordination would be accepted of, but ſuch as was thought to be valid.—Theſe <hi>Hints</hi> are offered as a ſufficient Anſwer to all that is ſaid in the Doctor'<hi>s Reply,</hi> from p. 59 to p. 65.</p>
            <p>IN his former Pamphlet he had endeavoured, in the Words of the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> to prove the Church of England to be inconſiſtent and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, in maintaining the Validity of Orders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived through the Church of Rome, while ſhe is called in the <hi>Homilies,</hi> "an old withered Harlot," &amp;c. To this I thought it ſufficient to oppoſe that Part of Mr. White's Reply to that <hi>Gentleman,</hi> where he ſays:
<q>If I muſt derive my ſpiritual Pedigree from a Harlot, I had rather it ſhould be <hi>an old withered one,</hi> of an antient and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Line, than a <hi>young Strumpet</hi> of no Name and Family, and who came into the World but yeſterday.</q>
This, I confeſs, is rather ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crouſly ſaid; however, a more ſerious Anſwer was ſcarcely deſerved. The Doctor replies, that in both Caſes we muſt be <hi>born of Fornication. Is it poſſible,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Whore, a foul, filthy Whore, ſhould, being an Adultreſs, bring forth any other than a baſe-born, ſpurious Race?</hi> A <hi>real</hi> Whore, while ſhe continues ſuch, cannot; but perhaps a <hi>metaphorical</hi> Whore may. The Church of Rome is called a <hi>Harlot</hi> in the Homilies, in Conformity to the Language of Scripture. The Jews were ſaid to "play the <hi>Harlot,</hi>" and to
<q>go a <hi>whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> after their own Inventions,</q>
when they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their Religion with a Mixture of idolatrous Rites and Practices. In the New Teſtament we
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012007_0093_0F8941242CDF1F20"/>
read of
<q>the great <hi>Whore</hi> which did corrupt the Earth with her <hi>Fornication</hi>;</q>
by which
<q>great Whore</q>
is intended, in the Opinion of moſt Commentators, either Rome Heathen, or Rome Chriſtian. In ſpeaking therefore of the Church of Rome, and her ſuperſtitious and idolatrous Corruption of Chriſtianity, at a Time when the Nation was ſtill ſmarting under the Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her galling Yoke, it was very natural for the Compoſers of the Homilies, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to call her a <hi>Harlot</hi>; in the Senſe wherein the Jewiſh Church was ſo called by the Prophets. But they never intended to ſignify that her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations were invalid; for they knew, that, at the Time of her Whoredoms, the Sacrifices and other Miniſtrations in the Jewiſh Church, when duly performed, were effectual to thoſe Ends for which they were appointed. They were far from adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Opinion of the ancient <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in theſe Matters; and what they believed of Churches and Biſhops, of corrupt Principles and Practices, we may judge from what they believed of <hi>Prieſts</hi> in ſuch a Caſe. Thoſe that compoſed the Homilies, were ſoon after employed in framing what are called King <hi>Edward</hi>'s ARTICLES; in one of which they ſay:
<q>Although in the viſible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and ſometime the evil have chief Authority in the Miniſtration of the Word and Sacraments: Yet for as much as they do not the ſame in their own Name, but do miniſter by <hi>Chriſt's Commiſſion and Authority,</hi> we may uſe their Miniſtry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither is the Effect of God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances taken away by their Wickedneſs, nor the Grace of God's Gifts diminiſhed from ſuch, as
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012007_0094_0F894124F27A9798"/>
by Faith rightly receive the Sacraments miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, <hi>which be effectual, becauſe of Chriſt's Inſtitution and Promiſe, although they be miniſtered by evil Men.</hi>
               </q>
It need not be added, that this is equally applicable to Ordination by a popiſh Biſhop.</p>
            <p>WERE it worth the Reader's Attention, I could ſhew that the Doctor is much miſtaken in his Opinion of the Sentiments of Archbiſhop Uſher and Biſhop Burnet concerning Epiſcopacy, and that he judges from partial and imperfect Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Enough, I believe, was ſaid of Uſher, for the impartial Reader's Satisfaction in the <hi>Appeal defended</hi>; but as the Doctor ſeems to require far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satisfaction, I muſt refer him to a Book written in Anſwer to Dr. Bernard's, intitled, <hi>Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondet Petrus,</hi> by Dr. Heylin. As to Burnet, it is ſufficient that he affirms in his Expoſition,
<q>that Chriſt appointed a Succeſſion of Paſtors, in different Ranks, to be continued in the Church for the Work of the Goſpel, and the Care of Souls; and that as the Apoſtles ſettled the Churches, <hi>they appointed different</hi> ORDERS, <hi>of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">On <hi>Art.</hi> xxv.</note>:</q>
And, in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> in a Paſſage that has been held out to public View<note n="‡" place="bottom">In the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 25.</note>—that to <hi>deny</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts "to be two DISTINCT ORDERS," is not only heretical and popiſh, but ſome of the worſt Part, "THE VERY DREGS OF POPERY." But, that after the Time of writing his <hi>Vindication of the Church of Scotland,</hi> which I have not ſeen, he was truly <hi>epiſcopal</hi> in his Principles, in the full Heighth and Depth of the Expreſſion, I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012007_0095_0F894125AE486B50"/>
not only to particular Paſſages, but to the whole Tenor of his ſubſequent Writings.</p>
            <p>IT is an eaſy Thing, by the Help of ſingle Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, with here and there Scraps of Sentences, artfully arranged and properly managed, to prove almoſt any Authors to be, what we chooſe they ſhould be. In ſuch a Way, I could eaſily prove Dr. Chauncy himſelf to be an Epiſcopalian, from the Pamphlet before me. I could collect Sentences, wherein he acknowledges the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops to be <hi>ſelf evident.</hi> I could ſhew that he is an Advocate for the Sentiments of Whitgift, Bancroft, Hooker, Uſher, Burnet, and a great Majority, <hi>nineteen in twenty of the Members of the Church of England,</hi> relating to the Subject, which are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly epiſcopal—that he is ſo convinced of the Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity of an <hi>American Epiſcopate,</hi> that he is not only willing that it ſhould be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but blames the Clergy of the Church of England in the Colonies for not having exerted themſelves more in Order to procure Biſhops, and thinks they ſhould have applied for them to the Moravians, or even to the Papiſts in Canada, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be without them. But ſuch an Amuſement I will not purſue, as it would interfere too much with Buſineſs, and be too great a Treſpaſs upon the Reader's Indulgence. For theſe two Reaſons I ſhall take no farther Notice of what he ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Uſher and Burnet, but ſeek for more uſeful Employment in his next <hi>Section.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE my Opponent begins thus: <hi>The Doctor has ſeen fit, for Reaſons</hi> BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF, <hi>to paſs over almoſt every Thing this</hi> (ſecond) <hi>Section
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012007_0096_0F8941266E9D49E0"/>
relates to, that was material,</hi> p. 57. But the Reaſons for my doing this are as well known to the Reader, as to my ſelf. The Paſſage, in which he was informed of theſe Reaſons, muſt have been immediately under the Doctor's Eye when he made the Remark, as it ſtands in the Front of the Section, to which he was preparing to reply. What was there ſaid, is in theſe Words:
<q>The Objections that have been made to the ſecond Section of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> wherein the Powers peculiar to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Office are ſhewn, as they relate chiefly to the Evidence of Scripture, explained by the Practice of the primitive Church, ſo far ſhall be paſſed over, they coming not within the Intention of the preſent Defence.</q>
Why this was not within the Intention of my Defence, was carefully explained in p. 77, and the Reaſons there aſſigned have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be abundantly ſatisfactory to the Public. What can we now think of the Fairneſs and Candor of ſuch a Remark?</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing of the Nature of the epiſcopal Office, it was thought proper to diſtinguiſh, between thoſe Things that belong to it originally and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and ſuch external Appendages as had been added in after Times, and which have no neceſſary Connection with the Office itſelf. The Doctor, in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> attempted not to invalidate the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, but impertinently remarked, that it is <hi>highly</hi> UNREASONABLE <hi>to add ſuch Appendages.</hi> In my <hi>Defence</hi> it was replied:
<q>Whether the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Appendages be reaſonable or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, is nothing to me; and, which is more, it is nothing to the Caſe of ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for America. I had ſaid nothing, nor was it my Buſineſs to ſay any Thing of its being
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012007_0097_0F8941272D5894E0"/>
                  <hi>reaſonable</hi> that theſe Appendages ſhould be added; nor was it his Buſineſs as an Anſwerer to me, to ſay any Thing of its being <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> Much leſs was it his Buſineſs to object Appendages of this Kind to an Epiſcopate, which it certainly is, and ever was intended, ſhall exiſt without them *.</q>
He now rejoins: <hi>Why then, in the Name of Wonder, did he ſay any Thing about theſe Appendages? If it was nothing to him, that is, to the Cauſe he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and nothing to the Caſe of an American Epiſcopate, it is certainly to no Purpoſe to ſay a Word about them,</hi> p. 72. Fair and candid again! without any Mixture of Sophiſtry! But however, the <hi>Subject</hi> of ſuch Appendages, and the <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> of making them, are different Things. In the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the Appendages were diſtinguiſhed from the Office itſelf, becauſe it was neceſſary in Order rightly to conceive of the epiſcopal Office, as propoſed to be exerciſed in America; and in my <hi>Defence</hi> I did not ſay that the <hi>Subject,</hi> or the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,</hi> was nothing to me, but that the <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> or <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of adding ſuch Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages to the epiſcopal Office, was neither my Buſineſs, nor his, to conſider. How then, <hi>in the Name of Wonder,</hi> could Dr. Chauncy ſhew ſo little Regard to his own literary Character!</p>
            <p>IN explaining the Nature of the epiſcopal Office it was obſerved, that the Office is exactly the ſame in a large Dioceſs as in a ſmall one, and that this Circumſtance affected not the Validity of any Act performed by the Biſhop. The Doctor anſwered, that if the Validity of the Biſhop's Acts is not affected by the Largeneſs of his Dioceſs, his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ſerve it undoubtedly is. It was ſaid in Reply
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012007_0098_0F894127EE599DA8"/>
to him, the Anſwer amounts to this,
<q>that although what I ſaid is allowed to be true, yet ſomething that I did not ſay is certainly falſe. The Thing which I did not ſay is, that the Biſhop is <hi>as able</hi> to ſerve the great Ends of his Office in a large Dioceſs as in a ſmall one.</q>
Let us now hear the Doctor's Rejoinder. <hi>It is true, he did not ſay this; but it is as true, that it was with Propriety, and</hi> IRRESISTIBLE FORCE <hi>that I ſaid it,</hi> p. 72. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Opinion my Opponent may have of the IRRESISTIBILITY of his own <hi>Force,</hi> in this Inſtance it was certainly miſapplied. Nor could there be any <hi>Propriety</hi> in an <hi>Anſwerer</hi>'s thus ſhifting the Queſtion, from the Validity of an Act, to the Capacity of the Agent.</p>
            <p>IT was farther ſaid in Reply to him, that he was alſo wrong in his Opinion relating to the Biſhop's <hi>Capacity</hi> of taking due Care of a large Dioceſs, as he judged
<q>of the epiſcopal Charge upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Principles, confounding the Office of a Biſhop with that of a Pariſh Miniſter.</q>
He ſtill inſiſts upon it, that it is <hi>highly improper, and an intolerable Grievance, that Biſhops ſhould be at the Head of large Dioceſſes; becauſe it deſtroys their Capacity to ſerve the Ends, deſigned by Chriſt in the Inſtitution of their Office.</hi> This confirms the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation I made upon his wrong Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. He believes the Deſign of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Biſhops was, that they ſhould take the ſpiritual Charge of ſingle Congregations, and perform the parochial Duties. Accordingly he looks upon himſelf to be a proper Biſhop, agreeably to the Inſtitution of Chriſt. In this Senſe, it is confeſſed, Biſhops ought to be confined to narrow Diſtricts, as their Incapacity to ſerve large ones, ſuch as
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012007_0099_0F893F85709B9A80"/>
common Dioceſſes, cannot be diſputed. But the Biſhops in Queſtion are an ORDER of Men very different from that of <hi>Biſhop Chauncy,</hi> and the Ends of their Office are as different as their Order. Parochial Duties they may occaſionally perform; but the proper Buſineſs of their Office is, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Superintendency and Government of the Clergy, and Confirmation. Now if a Dioceſs is not ſo large but that a Biſhop can duly perform all theſe Offices, it cannot be juſtly objected that he has not a <hi>Capacity</hi> to ſerve it. In an epiſcopal Church the Number of Pariſh Miniſters is as great as it would be, if the epiſcopal Order had no Exiſtence; and the Addition of Biſhops to ſuper-intend the parochial Clergy and oblige them to perform their Duty, is ſo far from being <hi>an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Grievance,</hi> that ſuch an Inſtitution, in its Nature and Deſign, is an invaluable Advantage. Here the Doctor quotes and miſapplies our bleſſed Saviour's Declaration,
<q>my Kingdom is not of this World;</q>
which has no more Relation to the Subject under Conſideration, than theſe Words of Moſes,
<q>In the Beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL not ſpend much Time in controverting what he ſays about <hi>Aerius</hi> and <hi>Colluthus.</hi> Theſe I had repreſented to have been
<q>the firſt Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Ordination by Preſbyters;</q>
but herein I may have been miſtaken, as I find the learned Dr. Lee points out an Inſtance of the like Nature, among the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> in the latter End of the ſecond Century, of one <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> a Greek Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who formed, ſays he,
<q>the firſt Preſbyterian Church we read of;</q>
for which he was duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanded
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012007_0100_0F893F86302A9CB8"/>
by St. Irenaeus <note n="§" place="bottom">Hiſtory of <hi>Montaniſm.</hi> p. 137.</note>. That Aerius was condemned as an Heretic,
<q>
                  <hi>chiefly</hi> for his Opinion of the Parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters,</q>
is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Account given by all the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, and the Opinion of all the moſt conſiderable Writers, that have mentioned the Caſe. That Jerom, Auſtin, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Sedulius, Primaſius, Chryſoſtom and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact <hi>were of the ſame Opinion with Aerius,</hi> with Regard to the Parity of Biſhops and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the Doctor pretends was the Belief of <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Jewel, Bridges, Whitacre, and Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet, whom he calls <hi>epiſcopal Writers of the firſt Figure,</hi> but ſome of whom were notorious Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; is, as he ſays in another Caſe, <hi>in direct Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to as known a Truth as is contained in Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO what was ſaid concerning Colluthus, from the Biſhops of Egypt, Thebais, Lybia and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapolis, and the Clergy of Mareotis, he oppoſes the evaſive Diſtinctions of Blondel, given in the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> as a ſufficient and <hi>full Anſwer.</hi> Blondel, it ſeems, thought fit to ſay, <hi>the pronouncing ſuch an Ordination</hi> (as that of Iſchyras by Colluthus) <hi>null doth not evidence, that they looked on Ordination as belonging, of divine Right, only to Biſhops.</hi> For it might, ſays he, have been condemned as <hi>contrary to the Canons,</hi> as not performed <hi>in the proper Dioceſs,</hi> as being <hi>without a Title,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops above-mentioned, in their <hi>ſynodical Epiſtle,</hi> ſay expreſsly, in the Extract I had given, that the Ordination was null, <hi>becauſe</hi> it was performed by a Preſbyter.
<q>How came Iſchyras, ſay they, to be a Preſbyter, and by whom was he ordained?
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012007_0101_0F893F86EE72E268"/>
Was it by Colluthus? For that remains to be ſaid. But Colluthus died a Preſbyter, SO THAT ALL <hi>the Impoſitions of his Hands were</hi> INVALID <hi>and</hi> NULL:</q>
—and the Clergy of Mareotis, in their <hi>joint Letter,</hi> from which alſo I had given an Extract, ſay:
<q>Iſchyras who calls himſelf a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, is not a Preſbyter, ſince he was ordained by Colluthus, who <hi>aſſumed an imaginary Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> and was afterwards commanded by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, and other Biſhops ſynodically aſſembled, to return to the Order of Preſbyters, whereto he was ordained. And CONSEQUENTLY all thoſe, whom Colluthus ordained, returned to their former Stations, and Iſchyras himſelf became a Layman.</q>
Let the Reader now judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothwithſtanding the Doctor's <hi>full Anſwer</hi> and Proof to the contrary, the Condemnation of that Ordination was not founded on an Opinion of its eſſential Nullity and Invalidity, becauſe it was performed by a Preſbyter, or one who aſſumed only an <hi>imaginary</hi> Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking of Ordination as one of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Branches of the epiſcopal Office, I took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice there is not an Inſtance of Ordination by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to be found in the Church for ſeveral Ages after Chriſt; and that Aerius and Colluthus, in the latter End of the <hi>fourth</hi> Century, were the firſt that endeavoured to introduce that Kind of Ordination. The Doctor, in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>one Inſtance, within the long Period of</hi> 150 <hi>Years from Chriſt, of an Ordination by any Biſhop.</hi> It would have been a more compleat Anſwer to have ſaid, that there was not an Inſtance of epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to be found within the ſame Period that I
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012007_0102_0F893F8894E5BF28"/>
had mentioned, than to ſay there was no ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance within the <hi>long Period of</hi> 150 <hi>Years</hi>; which <hi>long</hi> Period was <hi>ſhorter</hi> by more than Half. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not inſiſting upon this moſt material Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between my Period and his, I replied, that he had made the ſame Demand ſome Years before, in his <hi>Dudleian Lecture,</hi> to which a direct and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Anſwer had been given by Mr. Leaming<note n="†" place="bottom">In his <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal Government.</hi>
               </note>, whereof he had not taken the leaſt Notice. This appeared to me to be a 'Curioſity,' and indeed ſuch as I had never met with
<q>in the Regions of Controverſy.</q>
I then gave Mr. Leaming's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, which I eſteemed to be a full Anſwer to the Demand. If the Doctor himſelf thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſtill there was ſomething <hi>curious</hi> in his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Notice of the Anſwer that had been <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted</hi> to this Challenge, when he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it.</p>
            <p>HE now ſays, p. 78, by Way of Excuſe: <hi>I did not eſteem it worthy of the leaſt Notice,</hi> OR (meaning, that he did not imagine) <hi>that any one elſe would, that had any conſiderable Degree of intellectual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</hi> Yet in the next Words he tells us, that Mr. Welles thought it worthy of Notice, for that <hi>he nullified this produced Inſtance, and all that was ſaid upon it.</hi> This, by the Way, looks like treating Mr. Welles very ungenerouſly, after the many kind Offices and Compliments he had received from him; as the Words fairly imply an Opinion that Mr. Welles had no <hi>conſiderable Degree of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Diſcernment,</hi> at leaſt in that particular Caſe. Again: He tells us he did not chooſe to take Notice of Mr. Leaming's Anſwer, becauſe, as he informed the Public, in his Letter prefixed to Mr.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012007_0103_0F893F892F13BA30"/>
Welles's Piece, that <hi>was he inclined to engage in the epiſcopal Controverſy, he ſhould chooſe for his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, one that is better able to manage the Diſpute, than he appears to be.</hi> But the Dealers in public Controverſy have not always the Liberty of chooſing their Opponents. And as to Mr. Leaming, he is well known to be abundantly able to manage the Diſpute about Epiſcopacy, againſt any that may oppoſe him. This ſame <hi>prefixed Letter</hi> contains illiberal Reflections, upon a Gentleman of a very amiable and reſpectable Character. And here, as we are on the Subject of
<q>Curioſities in the Regions of Controverſy,</q>
it may not be amiſs to point out a very remarkable one, to be found in that ſhort Letter to Mr. Welles. Says the Doctor: I <hi>have</hi> NO OTHER KNOWLEDGE <hi>of this Gentleman</hi> (Mr. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) <hi>than what may be collected from this ſmall Work of his</hi> (his <hi>Defence,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet within the Diſtance of a ſingle Page he alſo ſays: <hi>by</hi> THE ACCOUNT I HAVE <hi>of</hi> Mr. Leaming, <hi>he is not equal to the Performance that comes out in his Name.</hi> But to return from this Digreſſion in Purſuit of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor contends that Mr. Leaming's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was improper, becauſe <hi>the Example of epiſcopal Ordination wanted, and deſired, was to be ſelected, not from the Scripture, but from one or another of the Fathers of the Two firſt Centuries.</hi> But this does not appear from the Challenge, in which there is not a Word ſaid of thoſe <hi>Fathers.</hi> The <hi>Dudleian Lecturer</hi> had been ſaying, that he could find nothing in Favour of Epiſcopacy in the Scriptures, nor in the Fathers before Clemens of Alexandria, except a Sentence in Irenaeus, which he endeavoured to explain away. Upon this, he called upon <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parians
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012007_0104_0F893F89EEF08A60"/>
to favour him with only one Example of epiſcopal Ordination, in their Senſe of it, within the Time above-deſcribed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dud. Lect.</hi> p. 70.</note>. The Demand therefore, by all the Rules of fair Conſtruction, muſt have been, to produce the Example from thoſe Writings wherein he was unable to find it himſelf; which were the Scriptures and primitive Fathers of the Church. If then Mr. Leaming was able to point out an Example in Scripture, he complied with the Demand, as directly as if he had produced it from any of thoſe Fathers.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor argues that the Example given is not to be admitted by him, becauſe ſuch an Example would, on our Side, be rejected. For if, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Declaration in the <hi>Appeal</hi> that no Inſtances of Preſbyterian Ordination are to be found in the Church for ſeveral Ages, he had replied, in Words like thoſe of Mr. Leaming; that he could produce many, but for brevity Sake he would mention but one Inſtance, viz. The Ordination of Timothy, by "the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery," <hi>producing only thoſe Arguments that had been uſed a Hundred Times over, in Support of it</hi>; he imagines he ſhould be <hi>laughed at</hi> by <hi>the Doctor, and that convened Body which firſt put him upon writing.</hi> But a Man is ſeldom laughed at for producing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithſtanding they may have been uſed frequently, provided they are produced and applied properly. Good Arguments will wear a long while, and not be the worſe for it. But when a Man uſes Arguments that have been <hi>refuted</hi> a Hundred Times over, in Oppoſition to plain Facts, and the ſettled Belief of the Church for 1500 Years; I will not anſwer for myſelf, nor am I authoriſed to
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012007_0105_0F893F8AAF6996A8"/>
anſwer for our Convention, that he will not be laughed at. If it could be made to appear, by any Kind of Arguments, that the Conſecration of Timothy was an Example of preſbyterian Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I believe we ſhould conſider it as a very ſerious Matter, and allow that it would anſwer the Purpoſe of our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>BUT whether the aboveſaid Anſwer was proper or not, of which the Reader muſt judge for himſelf; the Doctor goes on to challenge <hi>me,</hi> with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of greater Intrepidity than ever, and more in the Style of a <hi>Champion,</hi> to produce <hi>one ſingle Inſtance of epiſcopal Ordination, in the appropriated Senſe, from ſome or other of the Fathers within</hi> 150 <hi>Years from Chriſt,</hi> p. 80: And he allows me to call in the Aſſiſtance of <hi>any of the epiſcopal Clergy on the American Continent</hi>; and promiſes <hi>to admit as genuine any Inſtance</hi> that may be brought from Ignatius's Epiſtles, although <hi>certainly ſpurious or interpolated.</hi> But he has no Right to expect that I will take Notice of this Defiance, daring and provoking as it is, until he makes ſome Anſwer to a Challenge I gave him <note n="‖" place="bottom">In the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 259.</note>, to ſupport a certain Charge he brought againſt the epiſcopal Clergy—or elſe to retract it. However, with him I will not inſiſt upon the Strictneſs of <hi>eſtabliſhed Forms,</hi> and therefore I now give him the following Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF he himſelf will point out any Inſtance in thoſe Fathers, wherein a particular Ordination is mentioned, I do, by <hi>theſe Preſents,</hi> engage to prove, without the Aſſiſtance of any Clergyman on the Continent, that ſuch Ordination was properly and ſtrictly epiſcopal.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:012007_0106_0F893F8B726A99D8"/>2. IF no ſuch Inſtances are to be found, the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy may be ſupported without them. The Doctor, I ſuppoſe, will not give up the Cauſe of Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no Inſtances of it, within 150 Years after Chriſt. The Fathers, within the Period preſcribed, of whoſe Writings any Part is now extant, are but few, and there is not one of them whoſe Works are intire. The Works of Papias, Biſhop of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erapolis, are loſt; the ſame Fate has attended the Writings of Hegeſippus—a few Fragments of both, preſerved by Euſebius, excepted. The literary Productions of Melito, Biſhop of Sardis, which were numerous, and chiefly relating to eccleſiaſtical Subjects; of Dionyſius, Biſhop of Corinth; of Quadratus, Ariſtides, and Agrippa ſurnamed Caſtor, beſides many others that might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, have all periſhed. Were they now extant, eſpecially the Works of Hegeſippus, the particular Intelligence wanted, might reaſonably be expected. For Euſebius and Jerom, who ſaw the Works of the laſt-mentioned Writer, inform us, that he compoſed a compleat Body of eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, in <hi>Five</hi> Books, wherein he related all the principal Occurrences that happened in the Church, after our Saviour's Paſſion to the Time of his Writing.</p>
            <p>AS to thoſe Works, belonging to the Doctor's. Period, which are extant, they might all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a Pocket-Volume. Some ſhort Epiſtles to particular Perſons or Churches, exhorting to Perſeverance and Patience—one catholic Epiſtle, partly written with the like View, but chiefly giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an allegorical Explanation of the ceremonial Law—one practical Diſcourſe—a Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, proving that Jeſus is the true
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012007_0107_0F893F8C2F36DE48"/>
Meſſiah—a few Apologies for the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in Anſwer to the Calumnies of its Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries— two or three Diſcourſes againſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, expoſing their Errors and Idolatries—with a Fragment or two concerning the Reſurrection—are all the Works of St. Barnabas, St. Hermas, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Romanus, St. Ignatius, St. Polycarp, Juſtin Martyr, Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenagoras, which have ſurvived the Wreck of Time; a great Part of their Writings having been irrecoverably loſt. Now as nothing that remains is of an hiſtorical Nature, we could hardly expect that they would give us hiſtorical Accounts. Yet,</p>
            <p n="3">3. FROM theſe very Writings, and others of the ſecond Century, we are abundantly able to prove, that there were three Orders of Officers in the Church at this Time, viz. Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons; and that the Church was under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Biſhops, as an Order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, the other Two:—from whence it follows, that Ordinations were performed by Biſhops.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be expected, in a Work of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that I ſhould collect all the Paſſages in thoſe Writings, which relate to the Subject; however, a few of them by Way of Specimen, I beg Leave to preſent to the Reader. Clemens Romanus, who was a Fellow-Labourer with St. Paul, and one of thoſe
<q>whoſe Names were written in "the Book of Life <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> iv.3.</note>,</q>
in his celebrated <hi>Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Miniſtry, which he illuſtrates by the Jewiſh Prieſthood, ſays:
<q>the <hi>chief Prieſt</hi> has his proper Services; and to
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012007_0108_0F893F8CEE7059F8"/>
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> their proper Place is appointed; and to the <hi>Levites</hi> belong their proper Miniſtries<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> xl.</note>.</q>
Here are evidently three Orders in the Chriſtian Church pointed out, correſponding with the like Diſtinctions in the Jewiſh Church; and to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Order belongs the Superintendency and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole.</p>
            <p>IGNATIUS, in his Epiſtle <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Chauncy very graciouſly allows us, <hi>pro hac Vice,</hi> what we have long claimed and poſſeſſed as a Right, the Uſe of Ignatius's Epiſtles, which he is pleaſed to ſay are <hi>certainly ſpurious or interpolated</hi>; but which others ſay, who are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably better Judges than he, are undoubtedly <hi>genuine</hi>— meaning thoſe which are publiſhed as ſuch by Uſher and Voſſius. The following <hi>Hints</hi> are worthy of the Reader's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The Epiſtles of Ignatius were mentioned by Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſoon after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of Ignatius; and he informs them, that he had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſent to them theſe very Epiſtles. They are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Irenaeus, Origen, Euſebius, Athanaſius, Jerom, Gelaſius and Theodoret, to ſay nothing of others: and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the very Words of the Copies now extant. No anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writings, thoſe of the Holy Scriptures excepted, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener quoted, or better atteſted to be genuine, than the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles in Queſtion; and the Arguments uſed againſt them, would equally prove every other antient Writing ſpurious. It deſerves Notice, that none but thoſe, whoſe new-fangled Tenets are contradicted by the Epiſtles of Ignatius, ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to diſprove their Authenticity; and we all know, that for the ſame Reaſon, even the Holy Scriptures have ſometimes met with the like Treatment.</note> to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> ſays:
<q>Foraſmuch as in the Perſons before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (viz. Damas their Biſhop, Baſſus and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius, their Preſbyters, and Sotio their Deacon) I have ſeen all of you in Faith and Charity, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you that you ſtudy to do all Things with divine Concord; your <hi>Biſhop</hi> preſiding in the Place of God; your <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> in the Place of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012007_0109_0F893F8E94A52FD0"/>
the Council of the Apoſtles, and your <hi>Deacons,</hi> being intruſted with the Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt<note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> vi.</note>.</q>
He alſo exhorts the <hi>Trallians,</hi> to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Biſhop; to be ſubject to their Preſbyters; and to reverence their Deacons; and ſays,
<q>he that does any Thing without the Biſhop, and Preſbyters, and Deacons, is not pure in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> vii.</note>.</q>
To the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> he ſays:
<q>I cried whilſt I was among you: I ſpake with a loud Voice; attend to the Biſhop, and to the Preſbytery, and to the Deacons <note n="¶" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> vii.</note>.</q>
In his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Smyrnaeans,</hi> he ſalutes their
<q>very worthy Biſhop, and their venerable Preſbytery, and their Deacons,</q>
whom he calls his Fellow-Labourers <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> xii.</note>. And in an Epiſtle to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the Biſhop of the Smyrnaeans, he ſays:
<q>My Soul be Security for them that ſubmit to their Biſhop, with their Preſbyters, and Deacons.</q>
Such is the Teſtimony of this venerable Martyr, in Favour of the Superiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters; and it is no Wonder, that the Enemies of Epiſcopacy uſe every Effort to weaken its Force.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor acted very wiſely in not extending his Period any farther downwards, than 150 Years after Chriſt; for he knew that his Cauſe would <hi>too</hi> evidently ſuffer by an Examination of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that immediately followed; whoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Favour of Epiſcopacy no Arts could evade, and the Authenticity of whoſe Writings he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſpute. I ſhall notwithſtanding venture, with his Leave, or even without it, to ſtep over the Line which he has marked out for me, for a few Moments, to point out ſome Paſſages in thoſe Authors, that are directly to my Purpoſe; but
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012007_0110_0F893F8F2F3069F0"/>
ſtill confining myſelf within the Limits of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Century.</p>
            <p>HEGESIPPUS, in a genuine Fragment of his Works preſerved by Euſebius, ſays:
<q>when I came to Rome, I compoſed a Succeſſion (<hi>i. e.</hi> a Hiſtory of the Succeſſion) of the Biſhops of that City to the Time of Anicetus (about the Year 153 <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Fabricii <hi>Bibliog. antiq.</hi> Cap. vii.</note>) whoſe Deacon Eleutherus was at that Time. After the Death of Anicetus, Soter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and Eleutherus ſucceeded Soter, &amp;c <note n="†" place="bottom">Euſebii <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> Lib. iv. Cap. 22.</note>.</q>
The regular Succeſſion of Biſhops, in the Time of Hegesippus, we ſee, was ſpoken of, not as Novelty, but as a Thing commonly known; and in compoſing his eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the moſt eminent <hi>Sees,</hi> and wrote his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Biſhops upon the Spot, where he had the Advantage, not only of common Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but of conſulting the Records of the Church.</p>
            <p>THE Three Orders of Biſhops, Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, are frequently mentioned by other Writers of the ſecond Century. Clemens of Alexandria, who was inſtructed by thoſe who had ſeen the Apoſtles <note n="§" place="bottom">Stromata, Lib. l. p. 201, edit. per <hi>Heinſium.</hi>
               </note>, ſays:
<q>There are many other Precepts concerning the elect (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtians) which are written in the Scriptures; ſome relating to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſome to Biſhops, and others again to Deacons—of which I ſhall take another Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak<note n="‡" place="bottom">Paedagogus, Lib. iii. p. 194.</note>.</q>
Again ſays he:
<q>In the Church, the Orders of Biſhops, Prieſts and
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012007_0111_0F893F8FEF4A1058"/>
Deacons, are, I ſuppoſe, Imitations of the angelic Glory; and of that Oeconomy which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay thoſe expect, who, following the Steps of the Apoſtles, have lived righteouſly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpel<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Strom.</hi> Lib. vi, p. 481. The famous Origen, who was the Diſciple of Clemens, and his Succeſſor in the catechetical School of Alexandria, makes the ſame Diſtinctions. Although he lived in the ſecond Century, yet as he wrote not until the Beginning of the third, I will only take Notice of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſage; which the candid Reader will excuſe as it is given in a Note.
<q>More, ſays he, is required from one in my Station (of a Preſbyter) than from a Deacon; and more from a Deacon, than from a Layman. But more ſtill is required from him, who has, in eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Sovereignty over all of us</q>
—meaning the Biſhop. Apud Bev. Cod. Can. Lib. ii, Cap. xi. Sect. 3.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF we go on to Irenaeus, we ſhall find him boldly declaring:
<q>We can reckon up thoſe whom the Apoſtles ordained Biſhops in the ſeveral Churches, and their Succeſſors down to own our Times. And if the Apoſtles had known any hidden Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries —they would have committed them to theſe Men, to whom they committed the Churches themſelves. For they were very deſirous that thoſe ſhould be perfect and unblameable in all Things, whom they left as their Succeſſors, and to whom they committed their own Authority <note n="‖" place="bottom">Adverſus Haereſes, Lib. iii, Cap. 3, Edit per Grabe.</note>.</q>
He then, as an Example, enumerates the Succeſſion of Biſhops at Rome in the following Order: Linus, (mentioned by St. Paul in his Epiſtle to Timothy) Anacletus, Clemens, Euariſtus, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Sixtus, Teleſphorus, Hyginus, Pius, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus, Soter, and in the 12th Place Eleutherius, who was the Biſhop at that Time. And in another Place, he ſpeaks of a regular Succeſſion of Biſhops
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012007_0112_0F893F90AF826638"/>
from the Apoſtles, as an eſſential Mark of the true Church <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. iv. Cap. 43. See the learned Dr. Grabe's Notes, in p. 343.</note>.</p>
            <p>THESE Paſſages, to which many other of the like Tendency, from Writers of the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, might have been eaſily added <note n="§" place="bottom">Moſt of theſe have been collected by Biſhop Pearſon, in his <hi>Vindicia.</hi>
               </note>, prove directly and immediately, as well as unanſwerably, that throughout the ſecond Century, Biſhops were diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters, and had the chief Government of the Church; and, by <hi>neceſſary Conſequence,</hi> that ORDINATION was their peculiar Office. For there never was in Fact, ſo far as we can diſcover by the Light of Hiſtory, nor indeed in the Nature of Things can there be, an epiſcopal Church, wherein any other than epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination was, or can be, allowed of. In every Society, the Appointment and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the various Degrees of Officers, muſt proceed from thoſe that govern it. This is ſo evident, that there never was, I believe, an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the Preſbyterian Parity, but would readily grant, that whenſoever and whereſoever the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church was epiſcopal, the Ordinations were alſo epiſcopal. Therefore the above-recited Paſſages, although they do not inform us of any <hi>ſingle</hi> Ordinations that were performed by Biſhops, yet do more; they give ſufficient Evidence, that <hi>all</hi> Ordinations were thus performed.</p>
            <p>WE come now to the Caſe of the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> It was ſaid in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that until the Beginning of the Reformation, no Inſtances worthy of Notice occur,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012007_0113_0F893F916EB1DF68"/>
to favour Ordination by Preſbyters. The Doctor alledged the Example of the Waldenſes to the contrary. I replied, that it appeared from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius, that the Waldenſes pretended always to be epiſcopal, and that the Bohemians applied to them <hi>as ſuch,</hi> for Ordination; which they would not have done, had there been Reaſon ſo much as to <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> that they had not the Authority that was wanted. And, beſides the Account given from a very reſpectable Writer in Anſwer to Mr. Owen, I quoted Dr. Moſheim and Dr. Allix, the latter of whom probably underſtood the Waldenſian Hiſtory better than any Writer of his Time, to prove that they were epiſcopal.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now, in p. 81, endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his former Aſſertion, by the Aſſiſtance of Two more Authors. The firſt is Paul Perrin, whoſe Book I have not ſeen; nor does he ſay, or intimate, that he has ſeen it himſelf. But if he has ſeen it, why may he not miſtake that Author even where he ſpeaks plainly, as he does Biſhop Burnet? Let the Reader alſo judge how far his Teſtimony ſhould be admitted in ſuch a Caſe, after he has repreſented that, in the Church of England, Preſbyters have as much Authority to ordain, as Biſhops. But Allix and Moſheim <hi>had</hi> ſeen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin's Book, and they both believed notwithſtanding, that the Waldenſes were epiſcopal: From whence I infer, that Paul Perrin proves not the <hi>contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS other Author is <hi>that famous Epiſcopalian,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Leader of the Puritans) Dr. Reignolds,</hi> [Reynolds] <hi>who more than equaled in Learning</hi> (becauſe he was a Puritan) <hi>either Moſheim or Dr. Allix</hi>; and he <hi>peremptorily affirms in his
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012007_0114_0F893F922EA34138"/>
Letter to Sir F. Knolls</hi> (Knollys) <hi>that the Waldenſes were of the ſame Opinion with Aerius</hi> (the Heretic) <hi>as to the Identity of the Order of Biſhops and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> This is pompous indeed, and calculated to lead the Reader to believe, that this Letter contains ſuch a clear and particular Account of the Matter, as would convince the moſt ſtubborn. But the very Letter, unleſs I am greatly miſtaken, as much as the Doctor has ſeen of it, is in Neal's <hi>Hiſtory of the Puritans</hi>; and to gratify the Reader's Curioſity, I will preſent him with as much of it as has any Relation to the Subject.
<q>All that have laboured in reforming the Church for 1500 Years, ſays the Letter-Writer, have taught, that all Paſtors, be they intitled Biſhops or Prieſts, have equal Authority and Power by God's Word; as firſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> next Marſilius Pativinus, &amp;c †.</q>
The Reader here ſees the whole of the Evidence afforded by Reynolds; and feeble as it is, the Doctor is forced to place upon it a great Part of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He produces nothing but a Reference to this Extract, and his Account of Paul Perrin's Hiſtory, to oppoſe to the great Names of Allix and Moſheim.</p>
            <p>HERE I might ſafely reſt the Matter; but as it is now in my Way, I will farther confirm what I think already well eſtabliſhed, by one or two ancient Authorities, out of the many I have at Hand. In an ancient <hi>Abridgement of the Opinions of the Waldenſes,</hi> recorded by <hi>Wolfius,</hi> at the Year 1160, it is ſaid:
<q>They abſolutely deny the Pope's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over all Churches, and more eſpecially his Power over all Policies, that is, his Power of both Swords; neither do they hold, that any
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012007_0115_0F893F92EE61B010"/>
other Orders ought to be retained in the Church, but thoſe of Prieſts, Deacons and Biſhops <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the ancient Churches of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by Dr. Allix, p. 139.</note>.</q>
And Mr. Limborch produces out of the Book of the <hi>Sentences of the Inquiſition</hi> of Tholouſe, paſſed in that Court, from the Year 1307 to 1323, the following Charge, which, among many others, was brought by the Inquiſitors againſt the Waldenſes, viz. That they held
<q>that in the Church there are <hi>but three</hi> Orders, namely, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Inquiſition, Vol. 1, Book 1, Chap. 8, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by S. Chandler. Let the learned Reader alſo conſult Uſher's elaborate Work, <hi>de Chriſtianarum Eccleſiarum Succeſſione et Statu,</hi> Cap. vi, et viii, where he will find the ſame Point moſt abundantly and unanſwerably proved.</note>.</q>
When the Doctor ſhall have invalidated theſe antient Authorities, by ſhewing, either that they are <hi>certainly interpolated or ſpurious,</hi> or that they are no Evidence of what they are alledged to prove, others ſhall be at his Service.</p>
            <p>ON the Subject of <hi>Confirmation</hi> he ſays but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. He had objected againſt the Practice in the Words of the <hi>Diſſenting Gentleman,</hi> and I had anſwered him in the Words of Mr. White. He now requeſts the Reader, and I heartily join in the Requeſt, that he would compare the <hi>Objections</hi> and the <hi>Anſwer</hi>; and if the latter will not be found adequate to the former, I can only ſay that I am greatly miſtaken. He concludes with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that Mr. Towgood was a Man of much greater Abilities than Mr. White, and Mr. Peirce than Dr. Grey. One Reaſon for this Opinion is obvious; Mr. Towgood was a <hi>Diſſenting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and—ſo was Mr. Peirce <note n="‖" place="bottom">Perhaps this may be diſputed. Dr. Troughear ſays;
<q>it is well known, that Mr. <hi>Peirce</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who <hi>pretended</hi> to be a Preſbyterian, or independent Teacher or Miniſter there, was not only a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> but an Heretic too, and had his Followers as ſuch.</q>
                  <hi>See his</hi> LEGACY, &amp;c. p. 9. He ſays alſo:
<q>After he (Mr. Peirce) had been a Preacher in a Conventicle for many Years he declared himſelf an <hi>Arian,</hi> and was diſcovered to have been all the Time a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in Diſguiſe.</q>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 33.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:012007_0116_0F893F94940D8F68"/>HIS next Section contains all that he ſays in Reply to five Sections of the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Support of as many Sections of the <hi>Appeal</hi>; wherein it was ſhewn, that without an Epiſcopate the Church of England in the Colonies muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be without Ordination, Confirmation and a regular Government—that ſo conſiderable a Part of a national Church, ſuffering ſo long under the Want of its own Inſtitutions, was an unparalleled Caſe—and that Application for an Epiſcopate at that Time was apprehended to be peculiarly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, for many Reaſons that were there aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and particularly on Account of the American Heathens, whoſe Caſe was largely explained. Theſe Subjects all directly tended to the Point in Hand, and were neceſſary Parts of ſuch a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as the <hi>Appeal</hi>; and as ſo little is now ſaid relating to them by my perſevering Antagoniſt, what was advanced in thoſe Sections may now be conſidered as generally eſtabliſhed. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being thus ſecure, I ſhall attend to the few ſtragling Exceptions ſtill remaining, that have any Appearance of Force or Plauſibility.</p>
            <p>IN this Number can hardly be included what is ſaid in p. 86, in Oppoſition to an Obſervation made in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that none but Biſhops have a Right to govern the Church. This Propoſition was affirmed of the Church in its ſimple, original State, conſidered barely as a ſpiritual Society; and the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012007_0117_0F893F952F054EC8"/>
Government ſpoken of was evidently ſuch as is <hi>purely ſpiritual.</hi> The Doctor objected that the Church of England has no Authority of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Nature, becauſe She acknowledges all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Juriſdiction to flow from the Crown. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a direct Reply to the Objection in <hi>that</hi> Place, it was thought proper to refer the Reader back, to where the Subject had been formally conſidered <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 49.</note>, and where it was clearly proved that the Supremacy of the Crown was never thought to include ſpiritual Power, in the Senſe of the Objection. And I ſtill think
<q>it would have been paying but an ill Compliment to the Reader's Underſtanding,</q>
to repeat to him what had been ſaid but 50 Pages before: And I beg Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to refer to it, as a ſufficient Refutation of all the Doctor ſaid on the Subject in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> p. 56, and of all he now ſays in his <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 86, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all that he can ſay.</p>
            <p>NOR do I think it worth while to follow him through his Diſquiſition about the <hi>Head</hi> of a Thing, and the <hi>Middle</hi> of it: Not that I mean to retract what I ſaid about his miſtaking one for the other, but becauſe it can be of no Conſequence to our Readers I had advanced, in what, if he pleaſes, he may call the <hi>Head</hi> of my third Section, this general Propoſition, that without Biſhops the Church of England in America muſt be without Government. This Propoſition, I obſerved, was not meant abſolutely and ſtrictly, but in a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Senſe. The Doctor objected to this in his <hi>Anſwer</hi>; to which it was ſaid in Reply, that it is
<q>agreeable to ſtrict Method, firſt to lay down a general Propoſition, and then to mark out the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012007_0118_0F893F95EE9F5938"/>
Exceptions and Limitations with which it is to be underſtood.</q>
He now rejoins, p. 89, that it is neither conſiſtent with <hi>Method, or</hi> (nor) <hi>good Senſe to limit a Propoſition that is not capable of Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I know of no <hi>general</hi> Propoſition that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Limitation. Indeed <hi>univerſal</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, in Strictneſs, do not admit of Limitation; but yet, as they are ſometimes uſed by the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Writers and Speakers, they muſt be taken in a qualified Senſe. The Pſalmiſt ſays: They are
<q>
                  <hi>all</hi> gone out of the Way, they are <hi>altogether</hi> become abominable; there is <hi>none</hi> that doeth good, no <hi>not one.</hi>
               </q>
And yet this Propoſition, predicated of "the Children of Men," although it be an univerſal Affirmative, guarded both by poſitive and negative Terms, was never true in any other than a limited Senſe. But as to <hi>general</hi> Propoſitions, as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>univerſal</hi> ones, a Capacity of Limitation is eſſential to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for a Propoſition that admits of no Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is not <hi>general,</hi> but <hi>univerſal.</hi> However, the Limitation of which a <hi>general</hi> Propoſition is always capable, is not always required. For,</p>
            <p>
               <q>AS to Ordination, the general Propoſition, that without Biſhops the Church of England in America muſt be without Ordination, is true without any Exception,</q>
or Limitation. In Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this the Doctor ſaid, that notwithſtanding our Want of Biſhops, we might have the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we wanted in America, attended with ſome <hi>Inconvenience and Charge.</hi> This, conſidered as an Anſwer to the Complaint, I thought amounted to ſaying, that we might have Ordination in America, by having it in England. Dr. Chauncy ſays in Reply, <hi>the Doctor is here illogically inſenſible that
<pb n="112"
                      facs="unknown:012007_0119_0F893F96AF73CBF0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is ſneering at himſelf.</hi> p. 90. That I am here ſneering at myſelf, I am truly inſenſible; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Inſenſibility be, according to this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſtinction, of the logical or <hi>illogical</hi> Kind, muſt be left to the Deciſion of the <hi>learned</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Complaint was, that Ordination cannot be had at all in America, and that a Voyage to England for that Purpoſe is attended with great Inconvenience, Danger and Expence. What could put it into the Doctor's Head to diſpute this, and to oppoſe it with a Number of Diſtinctions, which after all amounted to no more than ſaying, that we might have Ordinations in America by having them in England, I am unable to conceive.</p>
            <p>BUT we are now ſhewn that there is no Reaſon for either Part of the Complaint; and we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected how we may have Ordination in America, without having it in, or from, England. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this mighty Outcry, there are at leaſt two Biſhops now reſiding in Britiſh America, one in the North, the other in the South Part of it, from either of which it is reaſonable to think, the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Office might be conveyed, with inconteſtible Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, to an epiſcopal Preſbyter; which would, at once, put an End to all farther Complaint of the Expence and Hazard in going to England to have Ordination in America.</hi> p. 91. We do not diſpute the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Orders given by any true Biſhop, whether he be Moravian or Papiſt; and I had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Ordination from ſuch an one, than from all the Preſbyters, or Preſbyteries, in the Chriſtian World. But we have other Objections againſt applying either to the Moravians or Papiſts, ſome of which, as the Doctor appears to be ſerious, I will mention.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:012007_0120_0F893F9770ADE230"/>1. WE are neither Moravians nor Papiſts our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore we cannot conſiſtently think of making this Application to them, until we have no Proſpect of Relief from the Biſhops of that Church to which we belong.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUCH an Application, before we know that our Petition for Biſhops will be abſolutely and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejected, much more while there is a fair Proſpect of its Succeſs, might be conſtrued as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful, both by our civil and eccleſiaſtical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, whom Providence has placed over us, and to whom we, the Clergy in particular, have ſworn to behave dutifully and obediently.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT would be ſchiſmatical. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeparate and withdraw ourſelves from that ſound Part of the Catholic Church, which juſtly claims us as its Members, and is intitled to our Obedience. And we look upon Schiſm in the Church of Chriſt to be as criminal as it was in the Jewiſh Church, although it be not immediately puniſhed by the like viſible Interpoſitions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We look upon Schiſm in the Church to have much of the ſame Nature with Rebellion in the State; and the Guilt of both is ſo flagrant in our Opinion, that we conſtantly pray in our Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany, to be preſerved from it—
<q>from all falſe Doctrince, Hereſy and <hi>Schiſm,</hi>
               </q>
as well as
<q>from all Sedition, privy Conſpiracy and <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
               </q>
Were the Britiſh Colonies independent of their Parent-Kingdom, the Epiſcopalians in this Country would be a Society independent of the national Church; and in that Caſe they might ſeek for an Epiſcopate from any Part of the Globe, from which they could expect moſt eaſily to obtain
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:012007_0121_0F893F9831A9D630"/>
it. But ſuch an Independency they do not affect— they wiſh not to ſee; they deſire no more than the common Rights of Britiſh <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Privileges of their Fellow-Chriſtians; or, in other Words, ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> as the Government allows to the Diſſenters from its own religious Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE have alſo a great Regard for the ancient Canons of the Church, which required that <hi>Three</hi> Biſhops ſhould impoſe Hands at the Ordination of a Biſhop. Although this may not be abſolutely neceſſary, yet it has been always <hi>canonical</hi>; and we have ſuch a Veneration for the Church in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages, that we would rather ſubmit to the Trouble of going to any Part of Europe for an Epiſcopate, than depart from the Example She has ſet us:—eſpecially in the Conſecration of our <hi>firſt</hi> Biſhops, from whence, in that Caſe, all our future ones would probably proceed. Now the Biſhops in the Britiſh Colonies are but <hi>Two</hi>; and they are ſo remote from each other, and their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as well as Intereſts, are in many Reſpects ſo oppoſite, that it would be extreme difficult to perſuade them to come together, and to join in ſuch a Conſecration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE Biſhop of Canada and the Moravian Biſhop in Pennſylvania, are both Britiſh Subjects, and both tolerated by a peculiar Indulgence; and they would probably conceive it to be very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in them, without the Conſent of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to convey the epiſcopal Character to the Church of England in the Colonies, the Tendency of which would be to render it independent of the national Church. And before the Government
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012007_0122_0F893F98F00C1C20"/>
would conſent to this, it would undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our having an Epiſcopate in ſuch a Manner as is requeſted.</p>
            <p>THUS our not having applied to the Moravians or Papiſts for a Biſhop hitherto, has been a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both of Prudence and Conſcience; and the following Reflections are very unjuſt, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable. <hi>It may reaſonably, and will be ſtrongly ſuſpected,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>Something more than that which is purely ſpiritual is hankered after, if the poor Church of England in the Colonies, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue in a lamentably periſhing Condition for Want of a Biſhop, when She may have one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Hazard of Life, and at a ſmall Expence of Pocket, by only repairing to an American Biſhop. Surely the Cry of Diſtreſs and Miſery, for Want of a purely ſpiritual Biſhop, will be diſregarded, as it ought to be, until it be made evident, that due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication has been made to one or other of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Biſhops, and that they have refuſed to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate a Biſhop for the Colonies, or to ordain Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for holy Orders. If the epiſcopal Clergy had been as zealous in their Application to the Biſhops in America, as they have been elſewhere, they might without all Doubt, have had one from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves veſted with the epiſcopal Powers of Ordination and Government long before now.</hi> p. 92.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now takes a Leap over more than 20 Pages of my <hi>Defence,</hi> and lights down upon that Part of it, where <hi>the Society</hi>'s offering to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Expences of going to England for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was conſidered. He complains bitterly, p. 93, of what he calls the <hi>ſcurrilous</hi> Treatment he received <hi>in one of the New-York periodical Papers,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:012007_0123_0F893F9A96A593B0"/>
on Account of his Anſwer to what I had ſaid of the Expenſiveneſs of ſuch a Voyage to our Candidates. As I was not the Writer of that Paper, I will leave it to the Author to defend it, if he thinks proper, or to give the Doctor Satisfaction. But he complains bitterly of me too, for having <hi>remarked upon it in a Manner much below the Gentleman, not to ſay the Chriſtian Divine.</hi> How the Matter was, will appear preſently. He hopes <hi>the Reader will bear with him,</hi> while he explains the Affair; and I hope the Reader will alſo bear with me, while I conſider that Explanation.</p>
            <p>WHAT relates to this Subject in the Doctor's former Pamphlet, is in p. 81, in the following Words. <hi>Another Reaſon</hi> (of Complaint) <hi>is,</hi>
               <q>the Expence of the Voyage, which cannot be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at leſs, upon an Average, than One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds Sterling to each Perſon.</q>
               <hi>And this is aggravated by the Conſideration, that</hi>
               <q>the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence muſt generally fall upon ſuch, as, having already expended the greateſt Part of their Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in their Education, will find it extremely hard to raiſe a ſufficient Sum for the Purpoſe.</q>
               <hi>I candidly ſuppoſe the Dr. had never ſeen, or, if he had, did not remember at the Time of writing, the Account of the Society, publiſhed in</hi> 1706, <hi>in which they ſay</hi> p. 74,
<q>all young Students in thoſe Parts (<hi>meaning the Colonies</hi>) who deſire epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are invited into England; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be defrayed by the Society.</q>
               <hi>According to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, there is no Hardſhip as to the Article of</hi> "Expence," <hi>that can be complained of, unleſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, but by the Society themſelves; and they cannot have juſt Reaſon for Complaint, as the Money they
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012007_0124_0F893F9B2F1515D8"/>
expend in this Way is as properly beſtowed, as in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Miſſionaries themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE the Reader proceeds farther, I beg of him to review this Paſſage, and to mark its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Deſign and Tendency. Is it not manifeſtly worded in ſuch a Manner, as to excite the Idea, that the Voyage to England is not expenſive to the Candidates? I know of ſeveral, that upon reading the Paſſage, underſtood that the Doctor abſolutely affirmed this; and I know of but one Perſon, who at firſt perceived that he did not affirm it. It had been aſſerted, that
<q>the Expence upon an Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was no leſs than £. 100 Sterling to each Perſon;</q>
does not the Anſwer lead one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is not a Farthing? Nay does it not
<q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be <hi>artfully</hi> calculated to lead the Reader alſo to believe ſomething farther; namely, that concerning a plain Matter of Fact, with Regard to which it is impoſſible that any Miſſionary can be miſtaken, I publiſhed to the World an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute wilful Falſehood?</q>
—and that I was ſo
<q>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably ſtupid,</q>
as to publiſh
<q>a Falſehood which was known to be ſuch, not only by every Miſſionary on the Continent, but by every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Society both here and at home, and by every Biſhop in the Kingdom <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 124.</note>?</q>
This is what I aſſerted; and the Aſſertion is true, that <hi>to me</hi> it had that Appearance. It was not affirmed that the Doctor <hi>intended,</hi> but only that I <hi>feared</hi> it was his Intention, to lead his Readers thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of me. The Suſpicion, if there had been no Foundation for it, would, I confeſs, have been injurious to his Character, as ſuch Conduct is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with common Honeſty; but as the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012007_0125_0F893F9BEF0E5360"/>
Words, in my Opinion, naturally ſuggeſted it, and I had no other Way of judging of his Deſign, than from the natural Tendency and the known Effect of the Paſſage, he has no Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; as I formed my Judgment according to the Evidence which he himſelf afforded.</p>
            <p>MY Repreſentation of the Expenſiveneſs of the Voyage to Candidates I knew to be true; he could not know it to be falſe, or unfair; why then did he diſpute it? And by diſputing it, why would he <hi>appear</hi> to contradict me? By alledging againſt me the Society's Invitation to Candidates in 1706, he <hi>appeared</hi> to ſay, while he ſeemed careful to avoid expreſsly ſaying, what was yet ſtrongly inſinuated by the whole Structure of the Paragraph, that the Expence fell upon the Society, and not upon the Candidates. He knew that if what was thus art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſinuated was received as true, what I aſſerted muſt have been received as falſe; and that I muſt have been thought a Liar, in a Caſe wherein I could not poſſibly have been miſtaken, and conſequently a <hi>wilful</hi> Liar. In this View of the Caſe, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that I had not ſeen, or had forgotten, the Society's Invitation, was no more than ſuppoſing, that I did not recollect that ſuch Evidence was in the Hands of the Public, as was a Proof of the Falſeneſs of my Aſſertion. A very <hi>candid</hi> and charitable Suppoſition truly!</p>
            <p>HE conceits that I was inconſiſtent with myſelf, in pretending to ſuſpect him in this Manner, while I allowed that he <hi>candidly</hi> ſuppoſed I had not ſeen the Society's Invitation. But to ſpeak plainly, and without a Figure, I did not imagine that there was <hi>Candor</hi> in any Part of the Affair. The Word
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012007_0126_0F893F9CB0B2ACC0"/>
               <hi>candidly</hi> was his own; I uſed it as ſuch with the Mark of Quotation, and returned it to him in an <hi>ironical</hi> Senſe. In Order to heighten the Irony, I introduced it with <hi>very,</hi> a Word of my own, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he VERY <hi>candidly</hi> made the Suppoſition; which <hi>ironical</hi> Uſe of the Word I would not have made, I aſſure him, had I imagined it could have poſſibly been miſtaken.</p>
            <p>IN explaining himſelf upon the Subject he now declares, in theſe Words: <hi>in direct Contradiction to this</hi> ACKNOWLEDGED CANDOR, <hi>he</hi> (Dr. Chandler) <hi>would lead the Reader to think, that it was my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to repreſent him as an abominably ſtupid Liar. It was in Truth my real Deſign, explicitly as well as candidly ſignified, to guard him againſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any ſuch Thought.</hi> p. 97. Some People have a ſtrange Way of puting their <hi>Deſigns</hi> in Execution. What the Doctor ſays was his Deſign, I <hi>candidly</hi> believe to be true, in the Senſe wherein he means it. But whether I, or a common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, can come at that determinate Senſe, there is Room to doubt. A Man may be a <hi>Liar,</hi> and yet not a <hi>ſtupid</hi> one; he may be <hi>ſtupid,</hi> and yet not <hi>abominably</hi> ſtupid: And whether he means, that he endeavoured to guard againſt the Reader's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of me as a <hi>Liar,</hi> or as a <hi>ſtupid Liar,</hi> or only as an <hi>abominably ſtupid</hi> one, he has not ſaid with ſufficient Preciſion. And why ſhould he have endeavored to <hi>guard</hi> againſt this, if he was not conſcious of having ſaid what would otherwiſe tend to lead into the Miſtake?</p>
            <p>THAT I made not a fair Repreſentation of the Matter, he ſtill inſinuates, without poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>though I neither ſaid, nor
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012007_0127_0F893F9D71355DC8"/>
intended to ſay it before, I ſay it now in plain Words, that he did not declare the Truth</hi>—IF—(if what? Why <hi>if) he intended to make his Readers believe, agreeably to the evident Import of his Words,</hi>
               <q>that the Expence of the Voyage to England for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was, to each Perſon,</q>
               <hi>out of his own Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket without Exception,</hi>
               <q>One Hundred Pounds Sterling.</q>
I never meant to ſay this; nor do my Words import, that <hi>without Exception,</hi> every Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate expended in his Voyage to England £. 100 Sterling, <hi>out of his own Pocket.</hi> I knew very well, that every Candidate's Pocket does not contain £. 100 Sterling, and that what it does not contain cannot be expended out of it. But this I ſaid, that the Expence of the Voyage, on an Average, is £. 100 Sterling to each Candidate; it being to ſome more, and perhaps to ſome a little leſs. This Expence has never been defrayed by the Society; the Candidates have generally born it themſelves: But in thoſe Inſtances wherein they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Donations for that Purpoſe have been made by their Friends, or Money has been advanced by the Congregations in which they were to officiate; and in this Caſe it is moſt commonly deducted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, if they live to return, either wholly or partly from the ſtipulated Salary, ſo that thus far it finally falls upon the Candidates themſelves.</p>
            <p>BUT it ſeems that, in New-England, <hi>it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for Candidates to be much aſſiſted in their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> This <hi>much Aſſiſtance,</hi> except in the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ſeldom amounts to more than the Sea-Stores for the Paſſage to England, if I have been rightly informed. But ſuppoſing it to be otherwiſe, £. 100 Sterling is the Expence attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Voyage of each Candidate; and whether
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012007_0128_0F893F9E30A3F338"/>
it falls upon himſelf, or his Friends, or his future Congregation, it does not weaken the Complaint. What an intolerable Burthen would the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts in New-England eſteem it, if every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of theirs was loaded with the Expence of £. 100 Sterling, to be paid, either by the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, or his Friends, or the Congregation? Were this the Caſe, if I know my own Heart, I ſhould be aſhamed of <hi>appearing</hi> to oppoſe, but would heartily join in promoting any proper Plan for their Relief.</p>
            <p>AS to the Defence of the Doctor's Conduct, in the Inſtance under Conſideration, attempted by the Author of
<q>a <hi>fictitious</hi> Letter from a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Society,</q>
(the Letter is called <hi>fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> becauſe the only Member of the Society, with the initial Letters of whoſe Name it was ſigned, diſavowed it with abhorrence) I am not ſenſible that I ſaid any Thing relating to it, that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Character of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Divine.</hi> What I ſaid was, that without 'an abler and fairer Advocate' than the Author of that Letter,
<q>the Doctor's Reputation muſt ſuffer,</q>
by the Charge of Falſehood, which a Writer in one of our periodical Papers had brought againſt him, on Account of the Paſſage that is ſtill before us. The Falſehood charged upon him was, his publiſhing
<q>that all the Candidates for holy Orders in the Church of England, have the Expences of the Voyage home paid by the Society <note n="*" place="bottom">A WHIP for the <hi>American Whig,</hi> Numb. XIV.</note>.</q>
The Doctor did not directly ſay this; but the above-mentioned Writer thought, as moſt People did, that he attempted to <hi>prove</hi> it, and that attempting publickly to prove a Falſehood,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012007_0129_0F893F84AFE231A8"/>
was equal to <hi>publiſhing</hi> a Falſehood, and might juſtly be called ſo. It had been alledged by the Doctor as a Medium of Proof that the Voyage to England was not expenſive, as was repreſented in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that the Society publiſhed ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to Candidates in 1706, as he mentioned. The Fact was not denied; but ſuch an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was the Object of the Cenſure. The Vindication therefore that took no Notice of this wrong Application, fell ſhort of the Accuſation; on which Account it was imperfect and feeble, and inſufficient to ſecure the Reputation that was at Stake.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor affects to think that the Society's Invitation in 1706 is ſtill binding to them, unleſs it has been formally recalled. But as it was not expreſſed in Words that extended it forward, it expired of Courſe. It appears upon the Face of the Invitation, that it was only an occaſional Act. All is expreſſed in the preſent Time, without a ſingle Word to intimate an Intention of its being a ſtanding and perpetual Rule. I believe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Vote or Law of a Body Corporate, that is deſigned for Continuance, has ſome Words that clearly expreſs that Deſign; and where no ſuch Words are uſed, that it is always underſtood to be only occaſional, or to ſerve for the preſent Time. But, ſays the Doctor, the Society Five or Six Years afterwards ordered the ſame <hi>Account,</hi> &amp;c. contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Invitation, to be reprinted with a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation; ſo that the Invitation, by their Order, was <hi>printed and reprinted:</hi> From whence he would have his Readers to infer, at leaſt, that the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was in Force Five or Six Years after it was firſt made. But the Book might have been order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012007_0130_0F893F9EEEFAB3F0"/>
to be reprinted, without any particular View to this Paſſage; and the Paſſage might have been deſignedly preſented again to the Public, to ſhew a Step that had been formerly taken, in Order to ſupply the Church in America with the Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wanted. It appears that none accepted of the Invitation when it was firſt made, and that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was repeated, any farther than every new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hiſtory that records it, made by the Society's Order, may be called a Repetition of it.</p>
            <p>WHEN the firſt Candidates went home from hence, which was not until many Years afterwards, they received no Benefit from the Invitation in Queſtion. The Society knew that, both in its Nature and Deſign, it was then antiquated; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they choſe not to fulfil it's Promiſe, they would have taken Care to recall it. About Eight Years after the Time now ſpoken of, Dr. Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who had reſided a conſiderable while in this Country, in his Sermon before the Society, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Miſſionaries as had been born and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in America, ſays:
<q>I verily think it might increaſe the Number of ſuch uſeful Men, if Proviſion were made to defray their Charges in coming hither, to receive holy Orders; paſſing and repaſſing the Ocean, and tarrying the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Time in <hi>London,</hi> requiring an Expence that many are not able to bear.</q>
This implies that he knew nothing of any Proviſion then in being, by Virtue of any Order, or Vote, or Invitation of the Society, for defraying the Expences attending the Voyage of Candidates: And as the Sermon was ordered to be printed, without a Correction of this Paſſage, or any explanatory Note, we may be certain that the Society, as a Body, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012007_0131_0F893F9FAE567CE0"/>
of it neither. But I will not enlarge farther in ſo plain a Caſe. I will only return to Dr. Chauncy ſome of his own Language, relating to this Head, it being not ſo much my Property, as his. <hi>The Doctor, perhaps, may in Time make high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Attainments in Learning of this Kind, than he is at preſent poſſeſſed of.—For it is no infrequent Thing with him to affirm that, both publickly and boldly which he never would have done, had it not been for want of more Knowledge.</hi> p. 102.</p>
            <p>IT has always been thought very hard, that the Church of England in the Colonies ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and, as it were, ſtigmatized by a Want of thoſe religious Privileges, which are granted to all other Denominations of Chriſtians. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whom I will <hi>warrant</hi>—as the moſt compleat and univerſal Opponent that ever dealt in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, denies this Fact too. He affirms, <hi>that it is the exact Truth,</hi> that the Epiſcopalians
<q>have the ſame <hi>Liberty</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>with all other Perſuaſions.</hi> The ſame Liberty to do and enjoy <hi>ſome</hi> Things, they undoubtedly have: But have they the Liberty of enjoying their own peculiar Form of eccleſiaſtical Government, in the ſame Manner that other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations have? Can their Candidates be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without great Loſs of Time, Hazard and Expence, as thoſe of the Preſbyterians and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſts may? <hi>If they cannot,</hi> ſays the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>it is not owing to any Want of Liberty, but to their not uſing that Liberty which is equally granted to all Denominations without Diſtinction.</hi> p. 103. What we have not a Liberty to enjoy conſiſtently with our Principles, we have no Liberty to enjoy at all. But, ſays this <hi>profeſſed Defender</hi> of LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, it is then <hi>from your Principles only that you
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012007_0132_0F893FA154D93050"/>
are hampered with Difficulties.</hi> This, as I told him before, is the Language of Tyranny and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but notwithſtanding he repeats it. But what can he mean, by being <hi>hampered by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?</hi> If we are allowed to enjoy and practice what our Principles require, we are not <hi>hampered</hi> by them: But, if we are not allowed this, we have not an equal Liberty with thoſe, who are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enjoy and practice all that their Principles do require. If no public Worſhip were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Colonies, but according to the Liturgy of the Church of England, the Diſſenters might be told, according to the Doctor's Mode of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that they had the ſame Liberty with the Members of the Church; meaning that they had Liberty to do, contrary to their Inclination, what the Members of the Church <hi>choſe</hi> to do. But would ſuch Liberty as this content them? Would telling them that it was <hi>only from their Principles that they were hampered with Difficulties,</hi> ſilence their Complaints? I trow not. The great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is that we are hampered by Difficulties, from, or on Account of, our religious Principles. We wiſh to have ſuch Embarraſſments removed, and to be upon the ſame Footing with thoſe that are not thus embarraſſed.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor, who is ſo lucky as never to want for Diſtinctions, ſays, that we are <hi>under no more Reſtraint, than the other Denominations, by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing</hi> ACT OF THE STATE. p. 104. But what is this to the Purpoſe of proving, that we have the ſame religious Liberty with Chriſtians of other Denominations? If we are not under Reſtraint from any Act of the Legiſlature, yet if we are under peculiar Diſadvantages on ſome other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012007_0133_0F893FA1EF345DA8"/>
which render us incapable of enjoying what our Fellow-Chriſtians of all other Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enjoy, why ſhould not a Remedy be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thoſe peculiar Diſadvantages? Nay, ſhould it appear that our Principles and Connections are ſuch, that a proper Remedy could not be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without an <hi>interpoſing Act of the State</hi> in our Favour, we humbly conceive that this would be an Object not unworthy of the Attention of the Legiſlature, and that we ſhould have a Right to petition for ſuch an <hi>Act:</hi> And as barely religious Liberty, and not any Authority over others, is the End in View, no true Friends to religious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Toleration ought to oppoſe us. Religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty conſiſts in a Freedom to perform all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and public Duties which Men's Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, without Moleſtation or Reſtraint. And the Enjoyment of this Liberty may be interrupted or prevented by other Ways, as well as by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Government. The Effect may be the ſame, whatever Cauſe, or Concurrence of Cauſes, may have produced it. The Epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Colonies know and perpetually feel, that they have not the ſame Liberty, which they ſee others around them poſſeſs and exerciſe. They do not enjoy ſome of the moſt neceſſary Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Religion, and of this they complain. But they never have complained, that they had no Dominion over any of the religious Sects in the Colonies:—They have never complained of not being diſtinguiſhed by any ſuperior Advantages:— They only requeſt, and they only wiſh, to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to an Equality. They think themſelves inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to ſo much, by the common Rights of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, which they are not conſcious that they have forfeited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:012007_0134_0F893FA2B2301D30"/>THE Doctor goes on to ſpeak of me, in the following high and figurative Language. <hi>He can perceive no Difference between Difficulties, ſuffered upon Principle, in Conſequence of the Non-beſtowment of diſtinguiſhing Favour, and Difficulties that are ſuffered for not complying with the arbitrary, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Precepts of Men, in Violation of the Rights of Conſcience: Yea, he would make us believe, that Difficulties ſuffered, upon Principle, through Want of a Grant of Favour, may, with as much Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, be complained of as any of the Tortures the Saints of the moſt High have been harraſſed with, for their Adherence to their God, from the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors that ever exiſted.</hi> p. 104. All this is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Animadverſion I made upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Aſſertion of his, in his former Pamphlet, <hi>that there is no other Hardſhip or Difficulty in the Caſe</hi> (of the Epiſcopalians in America) <hi>than what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſes from profeſſed Principles.</hi> This, I told him, looked, as if in his Opinion,
<q>Men were not to be pitied, when their Sufferings reſult from their Principles. The moſt dreadful Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions are no more than Sufferings inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men for, and conſequently, in ſome Senſe, reſulting from their <hi>profeſſed Principles.</hi> But (as I proceeded) does the Doctor mean that we ſhould be left to ſuffer, becauſe it is on Account of our Principles? Or that Men, of whoſe Principles HE does not approve, ought to be perſecuted <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 136.</note>?</q>
Such was the Provocation given him! Upon ſo ſlight Baſis is this maſſy Column of Miſrepreſentation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected! There ought, no Doubt, to be a <hi>Difference</hi> made <hi>between Difficulties,</hi> although <hi>ſuffered upon Principle, in Conſequence of Non-beſtowment of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> abſurdly here called <hi>diſtinguiſhing,</hi> when the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012007_0135_0F893FA37033C090"/>
Deſign of it is to put an End to Diſtinctions, <hi>and Difficulties that are ſuffered from arbitrary and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Precepts.</hi> But Difficulties are ſtill Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: and when Men, who are under no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that can interfere with the full Enjoyment of all their religious Privileges, endeavour to obſtruct the Removal of Difficulties in the Way of others, becauſe they do not approve of their Principles; they ſo far are actuated by the Spirit of Inquiſitors, and ſo far diſcover that very Diſpoſition, which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the ſevereſt <hi>Tortures, the Saints of the moſt High have been</hi> ever <hi>harraſſed with.</hi> It concerns ſome People to examine their own Hearts, whether they have not, in Reality, too much of this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and accurſed Spirit.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now takes another Leap that is prodigious indeed, from p. 136 to p. 196 of my <hi>Defence,</hi> containing the whole fourth, fifth, ſixth, and the far greater Part of the ſeventh Sections. As he profeſſes himſelf in his Title-Page to be a <hi>Rectifier</hi> of my <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and a <hi>Refuter</hi> of my <hi>falſe arguing,</hi> it will naturally be concluded, that he could find no Miſtakes, in thoſe 60 Pages, that he was able to rectify, nor any falſe arguing that he was able to refute; or, at leaſt, none that was of material Conſequence. He therefore paſſes on to the Caſe of a <hi>Negative</hi> put upon the Requeſt of the <hi>Non-Epiſcopalians</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> for a Royal Charter, to enable them to conduct and manage a Fund of £. 2000 Sterling raiſed by Subſcription, for the Support of <hi>Miſſionaries among the Indian Natives.</hi> The Defeat of this Application he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated to have been occaſioned by <hi>epiſcopal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> What he meant by this Expreſſion, I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from a Paſſage in his REMARKS on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012007_0136_0F893FA433004640"/>
of <hi>Landaff</hi>'s Sermon, wherein he ſays: <hi>It is hoped the Accounts we have had are not true, that the Negative upon this Act</hi> (of the Boſton Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) <hi>was principally owing to the Influence of ſome of the moſt important Members of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel.</hi> I replied in the Words of an able Writer, in his VINDICATION of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi>'s Sermon, wherein the utter Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of ſuch a Suſpicion was pointed out, and an Extract of a Letter from one of the <hi>moſt important</hi> Members of the Society was given, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the Scheme ſent home was rejected on Account of its internal Defects, and that
<q>
                  <hi>the Society,</hi> MADE NO OPPOSITION TO IT.</q>
I alſo produced a Declaration from Mr. Apthorp, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Member of the Society, who affirmed, after due Inquiry and upon proper Authority that the Rejection was
<q>meerly on political and commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reaſons, which aroſe from <hi>the Manner of drawing it up,</hi> and were repreſented by the Board of Trade to the Privy-Council, who <hi>unanimouſly</hi> diſapproved it, when there was <hi>not one Biſhop preſent</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Apthorp<hi>'s Review</hi> of Dr. Mayhew's Remarks, p. 39.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE only Evidence of the Interpoſition of <hi>epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Influence</hi> to defeat the above-mentioned Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, was the Teſtimony of an unknown Letter-Writer; and even he affirms only that <hi>there is Reaſon to think,</hi> that the Caſe was as he repreſented it to be. Such a Teſtimony, in Proof of a Fact that was important in its Conſequences, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Perſon could think worthy of Notice, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after direct Evidence was produced to the contrary; wherefore I treated it with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012007_0137_0F893FA4EE6F44A0"/>
it deſerved. The Doctor now does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh the Reputation of his unknown Witneſs, nor to introduce any new ones; but he attempts to weaken the Influence of mine. The Archbiſhop, he conceits, prevaricated; Mr. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp was a Quibler; and neither of them anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to the Point. However, he ſeems to allow, that <hi>the Society in their Character as ſuch</hi> "made no Oppoſition" to the <hi>incorporating Act</hi> under Conſideration. Nay, he confeſſes, <hi>it may, in like Manner, be true, that,</hi> although <hi>Epiſcopalians might uſe their Influence againſt the paſſing this Act,</hi> yet <hi>they might not do it as</hi> SUCH. But if Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, in their Oppoſition, acted not <hi>as ſuch,</hi> or in Conſequence of their epiſcopal Principles, the Oppoſition they made, cannot, with any Propriety, be called an Exertion of <hi>epiſcopal Influence</hi>; that not being epiſcopal, which has no Relation to, or Connection with, the Doctrine or Cauſe of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding the Want of Evidence to ſupport it, and notwithſtanding his own Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it, the Doctor appears to be reſolved not to give up his Suſpicion, that the Plan of the <hi>Boſtonians</hi> received an <hi>epiſcopal</hi> Overthrow. The Society, he is ſure, could wiſh it no good; but were jealous of the Succeſs that would probably attend it, if ſuffered to proceed. <hi>I am heartily ſorry,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am obliged to ſay that this</hi>
               <q>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eminently pious Men,</q>
               <hi>have given the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſo little Reaſon to think, that they have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Savages much at Heart. Had this been the real Truth, it is impoſſible but they ſhould have done much more than they have ever yet done to promote their Converſion. They have made it abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012007_0138_0F893FA6970EF828"/>
that they had at Heart the</hi> PROPAGATION OF EPISCOPACY <hi>much more than the Converſion of Savages; and if we may be permitted to judge from their Conduct, we ſhall naturally, and almoſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, be obliged to think, they would be in Readineſs to oppoſe any Plan for the Converſion of Savages, that did not propoſe to convert them by epiſcopiſing them.</hi> p. 105.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider the Particulars of this <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> Repreſentation. The Society appear not to the Doctor to have the Converſion of Savages at Heart, becauſe they have done no more in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to effect it. He judges of their Inclination from their Attempts, and of their Attempts from their Succeſs; and he allows not their Succeſs to have been ſo conſiderable as it really has been. And yet they have always declared their earneſt Deſire of chriſtianiſing the American Heathens; and their Declarations have been made under ſuch Circumſtances, from Time to Time, as gave no Room juſtly to ſuſpect their Sincerity. Their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts alſo to convert them were early, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated; and they have conſtantly, from their firſt Incorporation to this Day, ſought for Opportunities, and have never neglected one that has offered with any Proſpect of Succeſs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Goſpel among the native Heathens of America.</p>
            <p>THEY were no ſooner formed, than they inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, obtained, and ſent a Miſſionary to South-Carolina, to ſee what religious Impreſſions might be made upon the Indians in that Quarter. This was in 1702, the very next Year after their Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. In 1704, having tried without Succeſs
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012007_0139_0F893FA72F140080"/>
to perſuade both an Engliſh and a Dutch Clergyman in this Country, that were conveniently ſituated for the Purpoſe, to engage in ſuch a Service, they provided and ſent over a Miſſionary from England, of an excellent Character, to the <hi>Mohawks</hi>; with Information that another Miniſter might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the <hi>Oneidas,</hi> and one for every Tribe in Alliance with them,
<q>as ſoon as proper and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Perſons could be found.</q>
This Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, meeting with a very unfavourable Reception, thought proper, after a Year's fruitleſs Trial, to give over the Attempt. Notwithſtanding, another was ſent over and introduced to them in 1709, but to little Purpoſe; yet, in the Year following, the <hi>Requeſt</hi> of the Four Sachems, then in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, being thought favourable to the Society's Intentions, it was agreed forthwith to ſend over Two Miſſionaries, with an Allowance of a Salary of £. 150 Sterling to each, beſides an Interpreter and School-Maſter to attend him. One actually was ſent; another probably could not be found to accompany him: But after a Courſe of unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Efforts to anſwer the great Ends of his Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finding himſelf to be in Danger of his Life, this Miſſionary alſo was obliged to leave them. I might continue the like Account to the preſent Time; but as the Society's Conduct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Indians has been clearly and juſtly repreſented, by a Writer of eminent Abilities and Candor, in his <hi>Anſwer to Dr. Mahew's Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> nothing farther need be ſaid in Vindication of it.</p>
            <p>AND here it deſerves ſpecial Notice, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel among the American Savages was not the primary and principal Deſign of the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012007_0140_0F893FA7EF073AF8"/>
Society, if we may judge, either from the Words of their Charter, or the Views of thoſe worthy Perſons who petitioned for it, or the Opinion of its leading Members from that Time to this. The Society was erected in Order
<q>to promote the Glory of God, by the Inſtruction of OUR PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE in the Chriſtian Religion.</q>
It was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the King's LOVING SUBJECTS in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Plantations, who are repeatedly ſpoken of in the Preamble to the Charter, as the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object of the intended Charity; and the Indians are not ſo much as once mentioned on the Occaſion. The religious State of the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in moſt of the Colonies, at that Time, was lamentably bad. Many of them had no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunies at all for public Worſhip, and were as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Chriſtian Sacraments as the Heathens themſelves. Accounts were ſent home, by Perſons of the beſt Character amongſt them, that for Want of public Inſtruction People were daily falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even from the very Profeſſion of Chriſtianity into Heatheniſm, or a State of Nature. Now the Deſign of the Society was to ſtop the Progreſs of this Apoſtacy; and to recover the lapſed, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>orthodox</hi> Clergymen to reſide and officiate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And let Envy itſelf ſay, whether there could be a more worthy and charitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than this!</p>
            <p>THE Prevention of a Chriſtian's Apoſtacy to Heatheniſm, is of as much Conſequence in itſelf, at any Time, as the Converſion of a Heathen to Chriſtianity. The Recovery of an Apoſtate is as great an Acquiſition, as the gaining of an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Heathen. The Converſion of a civilized Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or Infidel, and ſuch were many of the King's
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012007_0141_0F893FA8B1712290"/>
Subjects, was as good a Work as the Converſion of a Savage one. It was therefore highly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Society's Charity ſhould begin at home, among our own People—with a View, at the ſame Time, of extending it farther, as their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Opportunities ſhould permit.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSING the Society had been at Liberty to expend as much of their Fund in propagating the Goſpel among the Indians, as in ſupporting and propagating it among our own People, which was by no Means the Caſe; yet it would have been right and judicious Conduct, in the Exerciſe of ſuch a diſcretionary Power, to expend the far greater Part of their Money in providing for the King's Subjects. For many of the latter were not only willing to accept of Miſſionaries, but ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired them, and earneſtly requeſted to have them: Whereas the very Reverſe of this good Temper appeared in the Indians. There was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reaſon to expect, that the ſame Sum expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Colonies would be far more uſeful, and produce a much better Effect, than if expended among the neighbouring Tribes of Indians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as St. Paul obſerves, Men cannot hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Preacher; but if they have Preachers, and will not hear them, it is impoſſible that they ſhould <hi>believe</hi> in Conſequence of their preaching, or be proſelyted to that Faith which comes by hearing. This ſeems to have been the general Temper and Diſpoſition of the Indians, with Regard to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
            <p>DR. Wheelock, who has thought much upon the Subject of propagating the Goſpel among the Indians, ſays:
<q>There is no ſuch Thing as ſending
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012007_0142_0F893FA9708D5DF8"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miſſionaries, or ſettling or maintaining Engliſh Schools to any good Purpoſe, in moſt Places among them, as their Temper, State and Condition <hi>have</hi> been<note n="‡" place="bottom">See <hi>a plain and faithful</hi> NARRATIVE, &amp;c. p. 19.</note>.</q>
Again:
<q>As to moſt Places, there is no ſuch Thing at preſent as introducing either <hi>Engliſh</hi> School-Maſters or Miſſionaries to continue with them; ſuch are their Prejudices in general, and ſuch the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and ungovernable Temper of ſome, that none but an <hi>Indian</hi> would dare to venture his Life among them<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 21.</note>.</q>
Such is the Character and Diſpoſition of the Indians in general, and ſuch it has been ever ſince the Incorporation of the Society, according to Dr. Wheelock.</p>
            <p>THAT the Society have made it <hi>abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they had at Heart the Propagation of Epiſcopacy, much more than the Converſion of Savages,</hi> is a vile Reflection on that venerable Body. Dr. Mayhew, taught by another, and inſtigated by his own <hi>anti-epiſcopal</hi> Zeal, was guilty of this Abuſe ſome Years ago, for which he received public Correction. Dr. Chauncy has the Hardineſs to repeat it, notwithſtanding a Vindication of the Society, that has been deemed fully ſatisfactory by the candid and impartial; for which I beg Leave to refer to the before-mentioned <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Dr. Mayhew's <hi>Obſervations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Society had the Propagation of Epiſcopacy at Heart, in the Senſe wherein it is objected, they would undoubtedly have inſtructed their Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to make this a conſiderable Part of their Buſineſs. It can never be ſuppoſed that they would
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012007_0143_0F893FAA34959BE0"/>
ſend Perſons abroad, at a great Expence, with a View to any particular Service, without informing them that ſuch Service was expected from them. But nothing of this Kind has ever been given in Charge in their <hi>public</hi> Inſtructions: On the other Hand, their Miſſionaries are directed to
<q>keep always in View the great Deſign of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, viz. To promote the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Men, by propagating the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour;</q>
and it is required of them,
<q>that the chief Subject of their Sermons be the great fundamental Principles of Chriſtianity, and the Duties of a ſober, righteous and godly Life, as reſulting from thoſe Principles <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>a Collection of Papers,</hi> &amp;c. p. 20 and 23.</note>.</q>
And as to <hi>private</hi> Directions, although from the very Nature of them I cannot be ſo poſitive about theſe, as their public ones; yet I moſt firmly believe, from every Thing that I can recollect or learn upon Inquiry, that no Miſſionary was ever inſtructed, either verbally before he came abroad, or by any Letter or Letters afterwards, to endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Epiſcopacy, or any of the diſtinguiſhing Principles of the Church of England. And if any Miſſionaries have made the Attempt, or have behaved in ſuch a Manner as to give juſt Umbrage to any of their Neighbours, it has been their own free and voluntary Act, and what the Society have never required at their Hands.</p>
            <p>THE Miſſionaries wiſh, that all the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, throughout the Britiſh Dominions, would become Epiſcopalians and Members of the Church of England: But, as they are not employed to moleſt any Proteſtants in the Enjoyment of their own Principles, ſo I believe they ſeldom do—far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012007_0144_0F893FAAEEC59648"/>
than their own neceſſary Defence may require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Within the Compaſs of my Knowledge, I am verily perſuaded, that for every Inſtance of an Attack made upon the Diſſenters by any Miſſionary or Member of the Church, <hi>Twenty</hi> at leaſt are made by Diſſenters upon Churchmen. I know more of their Conduct of this Kind than perhaps they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and I have often been ſurpriſed to diſcover, to what low and pitiful Arts ſome, who think themſelves Men of Conſequence, can deſcend, in Order to prevail with the moſt inſignificant Perſon, and ſometimes even with a ſtupid Negro, to leave the Church and go to their Meeting.</p>
            <p>THE Aſſertion, that we are <hi>naturally and almoſt</hi> neceſſarily obliged to think, from the Society's <hi>Conduct,</hi> that they would OPPOSE <hi>any Plan for the Converſion of the Savages, that did not propoſe to convert them by epiſcopiſing them,</hi> I ſhould not have expected from a Gentleman of the Doctor's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as it is worthy of a <hi>Savage</hi> only. Unleſs the Society look upon Preſbyterianiſm, for Inſtance, to be no better than Indian Heatheniſm, they would chooſe rather that the Indians ſhould become Preſbyterians, than remain in their preſent State. They undoubtedly wiſh, in the firſt Place, that every Indian may be converted, and that every ſuch Converſion may be compleat; <hi>i. e.</hi> that every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted Indian may become not only almoſt,
<q>but altogether ſuch,</q>
both in Faith and Practice, as the Rules and Precepts contained in Scripture are thought to require. If they cannot be perſuaded to become <hi>altogether</hi> ſuch, they wiſh, in the next Place, that they may become <hi>almoſt,</hi> and as nearly ſuch as poſſible. The Society wiſh to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in converting all the Indian Tribes: But, as
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012007_0145_0F893FAC9472F470"/>
they know that they are unable to carry this into Execution, they envy none the Honour of being Sharers in this good Work, that are able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to promote it in any Degree. If they had rather the Indians ſhould become Members of that Church which they prefer, than ſtop ſhort of it, they are not cenſurable for this; for, at the ſame Time, they had rather they ſhould become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, of any Denomination, than Papiſts—and they had rather they ſhould become Papiſts, than continue to be Heathens. I could produce, from their Hiſtory and annual Abſtracts, many Proofs of this Diſpoſition; and I defy their bittereſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even Dr. Chauncy himſelf, to bring any Proof of the contrary.</p>
            <p>THE Indian Miſſion at Stockbridge, under the Direction of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> (of the Society in Scotland) reſiding in Boſton, is indebted to Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Society for conſiderable Donations. It is more indebted to the Members of the Church of England; who have given more to promote that ſingle Miſſion, than I believe the Diſſenters have ever given to <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> from its firſt Exiſtence to this Day. If Miſſionaries from New-England ſhould receive Checks from Government in any Part of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, this cannot, with any Juſtice or Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, be charged to the Account of the Society. If Government ſhould hereafter diſcover, or have Reaſon to ſuſpect, that any of thoſe Miſſionaries endeavour, together with the Propagation of their Religion, to eſtabliſh a <hi>political</hi> Intereſt of their own Party, different from the general Intereſt of the Nation; or, that they incumber the <hi>Sale of Lands</hi> to the Britiſh Crown, by ſtipulating with the Indians
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012007_0146_0F893FAD2F6BA218"/>
for certain Conditions in Favour of their own Schemes; they will have no Right to expect the Countenance of Government in ſuch Proceedings. The Doctor knows that Things of this Kind <hi>may</hi> hereafter happen, for this good Reaſon, that they lately have happened; he will therefore do well to be cautious in blaming the Society in ſuch Caſes <note n="§" place="bottom">The Author has ſeen, and could publiſh, ſome curious Copies of Letters, of a late Date, to and from one of the Indian Miſſionaries from New-England; but as he hopes the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> will be careful that thoſe whom they employ to proſelyte the Indians, behave in an unexceptionable Manner for the future, theſe Letters for the preſent ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT was thought ſtrange that he ſhould inſinuate that the before-mentioned <hi>incorporating Act</hi> was defeated by <hi>epiſcopal Influence,</hi> without taking No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Mr. Apthorp's Declaration to the contrary, which he could not have been
<q>ſuch a Stranger in Iſrael</q>
as not to have ſeen. The Matter is now clearly accounted for, in p. 108. <hi>It is at once ſolved,</hi> replies the Doctor, <hi>by only ſaying, it was none of my Buſineſs to take Notice of this Evidence, until</hi> it had been <hi>produced.</hi> The Reader here ſees in what Manner he has rendered himſelf ſo very exceptionable, both in his Reaſonings and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. He neglected all Evidence on one Side the Queſtion, how fully ſoever he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, unleſs I had <hi>produced</hi> it; and he thought it was not his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> to ballance and compare counter Evidences, but to rake together every Thing that had an unfavourable Aſpect <hi>only</hi>; in Order to vilify and abuſe the Church of England, and <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> with a farther View of obſtructing the Progreſs of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012007_0147_0F893FADF1BCAA80"/>
our Plan. After this honeſt and artleſs Confeſſion, his Readers will know how to make proper Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances, for what he advances in a controverſial Way.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>eighth</hi> Section of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> a full and fair Account was given, of the only Plan on which it was requeſted than an American Epiſcopate might be granted, with Expoſtulations on the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of ſuch an Appointment. In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this Section the Doctor ſeemed really to exert himſelf; and he called in, to aid his own Efforts, what he ſays was POWERFULLY <hi>offered by the late excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dr. Mayhew.</hi> In my Reply, particular Notice was taken of every Thing produced, either from his own Store or the late Dr. Mayhew's Magazine, that <hi>appeared</hi> to have Force; and enough was ſaid to ſhew, if I am not greatly miſtaken, that every Objection exhibited was either groundleſs or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. The Doctor in his <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> which he miſcalls his <hi>Reply,</hi> ſeems to ſay a great deal in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his former Objections. It is here, if any where, that he aims his Blows directly at the Vitals of the Epiſcopate requeſted, and does his utmoſt; for which Reaſon I ſhall take a particular Review of what, in this Place, he has done and ſaid.</p>
            <p>BEFORE he proceeds to an immediate Attack, he has ſome Obſervations of a miſcellaneous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeveral of which I ſhall paſs by as utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. He begins with endeavoring to raiſe, in the Minds of Readers, but an indifferent Idea of what I had ſaid upon the <hi>main Point.</hi> He tells them that he was greatly diſappointed, that I fell ſhort of his Expectation, and that what I ſaid on the Subject was <hi>leſs convincing</hi> than what I had <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012007_0148_0F893FAEB05F7410"/>
in any Part of my Performance.</hi> p. 109. This, I think, diſcovers his Heroiſm, rather than his Policy; for according to the apparent Weakneſs of his Antagoniſt, the Honor of a Victory will be proportionably abated.</p>
            <p>HERE he again takes Notice of our Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's Addreſs to the Univerſity of Cambridge, on the Subject of American Biſhops; and he ſeems to to think, that, becauſe ſome of his Friends have publiſhed a <hi>ſpurious</hi> Copy of that Addreſs, therefore he is intitled to a <hi>true</hi> one. He is determined not to be ſatisfied until he ſees a Copy that is genuine, and will continue to ſuſpect that the obnoxious Expreſſions contained in the falſe Copy were alſo in the true one, notwithſtanding our Declarations to the contrary. This is treating us rather unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly, as the Teſtimony of a Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have ſeen and are acquainted with any particular Writing, is always allowed to have more Weight, than the Teſtimony of a ſingle Perſon, perhaps an unknown one, that has never ſeen it— where the Diſpute is about the Contents of that Writing. If therefore he determines not to ſubmit to the Evidence of our Teſtimony, I adviſe him, for the preſent, to ſuſpend his Judgment of the Matter, until he ſhall obtain a Sight of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and to wait with Patience; as Time may poſſibly bring forward, what it is not in his Power to haſten.</p>
            <p>AMONG a Number of paradoxical Things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Appeal,</hi> it was ſaid: <hi>Some of the moſt reſpectable Epiſcopalians, in theſe Parts, for Sobriety, good Senſe,</hi> and <hi>a ſteady Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Intereſt of the Church of England, have
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012007_0149_0F893FAF6F37F788"/>
declared it to be their Opinion, that Biſhops would be of no Service here, and they did not deſire they ſhould be ſent.</hi> What was meant by the indefinite Word <hi>ſome,</hi> whether Two or Two Hundred, I was unable to determine. The Doctor ſays I might have known the Meaning of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> its <hi>preciſe</hi> Meaning, if I had attended to the following Sentence. Let us ſee then how the Matter is cleared up in the explanatory ſentence. <hi>And it is to me, as well as to</hi> MANY <hi>I have converſed with on this Head,</hi> EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPALIANS <hi>among others, very queſtionable,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Word <hi>many</hi> is impoſed upon the Reader, as an Explanation of the Word <hi>ſome</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Sentence: Whereas <hi>many Epiſcopalians</hi> are not here mentioned, but only <hi>many</hi> People, <hi>ſome</hi> of whom were <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi>; ſo that the Word <hi>ſome</hi> is ſtill left as indeterminate as ever. I then queſtioned whether there was an Epiſcopalian on the Continent, juſtly ſo called, that was averſe to American Biſhops on the Plan of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> I knew of none, had heard of none, could conceive of none. Such a Character is ſo abſurd, that I did not imagine it had an actual Exiſtence. An Epiſcopalian is one that, at leaſt, approves of the Government of the Church by Biſhops; but he that only approves of the Government of the Church by Biſhops reſiding at the Diſtance of 3000 Miles, can hardly be ſaid to approve of it at all, or to be an Epiſcopalian in any Senſe. An Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian is one that alſo approves of Ordination by Biſhops; but he that only approves of epiſcopal Ordination under the Circumſtances of a long, dangerous and expenſive Voyage to obtain it, may be thought by the Doctor to be <hi>reſpectable for his good Senſe,</hi> and may be eſteemed by him for SUCH an <hi>Attachment to the Intereſt of the Church of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012007_0150_0F893FB02E6BA2F0"/>
England in the Colonies</hi>; but <hi>as an Epiſcopalian</hi> he will appear to all its real Friends to be truly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. It was therefore natural to interpret the Word <hi>ſome</hi> in as ſcanty a Senſe as it would any Way bear; and it was paying great Regard to his Teſtimony, in ſo incredible a Caſe, to believe his Aſſertion in that Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT what is all this to the Point:</hi> ſays he. <hi>It is a Fact, not a ſpeculative Truth, we are now upon,</hi> p. 112. This is calling the Credibility of a Fact a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Matter; but it is ſpeculative in no other Senſe than that, wherein the Perſons he mentions are <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi>—a Senſe, which will never be admitted by thoſe, who content themſelves with Words in their common Acceptation.</p>
            <p>BUT, <hi>where is the Difficulty of ſuppoſing, that moſt Epiſcopalians on the Continent may have a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notion of the Plan for an American Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, from that the epiſcopal Clergy have of it, who were its</hi> ONLY FORMERS, <hi>and the</hi> ONLY PETITIONERS <hi>that it might be carried into Execution?</hi> If by the epiſcopal Clergy he means thoſe of America, it is not true that they were the <hi>only Formers</hi> of the Plan in Queſtion. They do not pretend to have <hi>formed</hi> it at all; but they have adopted it when formed by others, not excluſively of the Laity. Nor were they the only <hi>Petitioners</hi> in Favour of it; for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the moſt conſiderable Lay-Gentlemen in the Colonies have recommended and petitioned for it, although not jointly with the Clergy of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Many others were alſo conſulted, who ſignified their Approbation of it, before our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were framed. All of them could not be conſulted in a private Way, and therefore it was
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012007_0151_0F893FB1D5A2C5C8"/>
thought proper to publiſh it to the World, before it could be put in Execution; that all might have an Opportunity to conſider it, and to offer their Objections if they had any.</p>
            <p>THERE were many Members of the Church that were, upon the whole, averſe to an Epiſcopate in this Country; imagining it would either expoſe them to conſiderable Expence for its Support, or put them to ſome other Inconveniencies. But when they came to ſee, that every Thing of this Kind had been carefully guarded againſt, and that from its Deſign and Tendency it would be mild and beneficial in its Operation, which appeared as ſoon as it was explained to them; their Averſion immediately ceaſed, and from that Time they have generally viewed it in the ſame Light with that wherein it is ſeen by the Clergy.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH what has been ſaid of the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <hi>in theſe Parts</hi> is univerſally true, without an Exception, to the beſt of my Knowledge, the Doctor however has this to comfort him, that the Epiſcopalians in and about Boſton, are of a different Opinion. For, ſays he, <hi>that the Miſſion of Biſhops into the Colonies would do more Hurt than good, I</hi> KNOW, <hi>is, in Fact, the Opinion of</hi> MANY <hi>Lay-Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, and, I believe, of the greater Part of them in the New-England Colonies.</hi> What is here ſaid of the Epiſcopalians in New-England, muſt not be underſtood to extend to Connecticut, which contains more in Number than the three other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and where they are unanimous in wiſhing for an Epiſcopate. As to the Epiſcopalians in Maſſachuſetts, New-Hampſhire and Rhode-Iſland, they are not yet univerſally acquainted with the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012007_0152_0F893FB26ED9E968"/>
Plan. It is therefore not improbable that the Doctor may <hi>know,</hi> either perſonally or by Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, of <hi>many, i. e.</hi> of <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Ten,</hi> for the Word does not neceſſarily mean more, that ſtill think unfavourably of an American Epiſcopate. But it is remarkable that he does not yet ſay, that <hi>any</hi> are averſe to an Epiſcopate <hi>on the Plan of the Appeal,</hi> who are acquainted with it otherwiſe than by Miſinformation. I fancy it would be difficult to find <hi>many</hi> ſuch, or even <hi>ſome.</hi> I have inquired of Perſons that are not Strangers in Boſton, and I have never heard of but <hi>one</hi> ſuch <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi>; and he is generally looked upon by Churchmen, and frequently by others, to be a Diſgrace to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. While he calls himſelf a Churchman, he aſſociates and connects himſelf with the bittereſt Enemies of the Church, is governed by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and ſuffers himſelf to be uſed as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Hands to injure its Reputation and deſtroy his own.</p>
            <p>AND here it may deſerve Notice, that there are many People in New-England, beſides Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, that have no Averſion to an American Epiſcopate. This may be juſtly ſaid of the Quakers in general, unleſs they differ widely from their Brethren in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, where they are more numerous and more reſpectable than in any other Parts of his Majeſty's Dominions, compared with the other Inhabitants. And a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Favour of the Baptiſts in New-England, who is ſuppoſed to expreſs the general Sentiments of that Denomination of Chriſtians, ſays, with a Tartneſs that ſeems to have been excited by an Opinion of their Oppreſſion: "The Fraternity," (meaning the Preſbyterian or congregational Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters)
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012007_0153_0F893FB3305DDDD0"/>
               <q>laſt Year have ſent Letters to Baptiſt Miniſters in New-England, requeſting their Aid againſt the Church of England. But truly it is the Intereſt of the Baptiſts that the Church of England ſhould multiply in Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, ſo far as to form a Ballance of eccleſiaſtical Power there, as in other Colonies. And as for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they are welcome there; their coming thither is an Object <hi>worthy of</hi> PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITIONS; we cannot be worſe off; we may be better: <hi>they</hi> are Gentlemen at leaſt, and have ſome Generoſity for vanquiſhed Enemies. But the New-England People (of a certain Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) are ſupercilious in Power, and mean in Conqueſt. I will venture to ſay, that all the Biſhops in Old England have not done the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts there ſo much Deſpite for 80 Years paſt, as the Preſbyterians have done <hi>this Year</hi> to the Baptiſts of New-England <note n="*" place="bottom">Goddard<hi>'s Pennſylvania Chronicle,</hi> Nov. 26th, 1770.</note>.</q>
And that the latter are not inconſiderable in Number appears from what this Writer tells us, who aſſerts that
<q>there are 37 Congregations of them in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts</q>
only; to ſay nothing of Rhode-Iſland, where they are more numerous and much more powerful than in any of the other Colonies.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor objected againſt our Plan, that it had been <hi>illegally</hi> ſettled. This Objection, if juſt, more nearly concerns the Friends of the Plan, than its Enemies: And while he objects the <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality</hi> of the Plan, he ſays much to perſuade us to put it <hi>far more illegally</hi> into Execution. But why was it illegally ſettled? Becauſe, ſays he, it was projected and formed, <hi>to the intire Neglect of his Majeſty, without whoſe</hi> LICENCE, <hi>not even the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012007_0154_0F893FB3F0769208"/>
have any Right to ſettle ſuch a Plan, or ſo much as</hi> ATTEMPT <hi>to form it.</hi> p. 113. In Reply to this he was told, that under whatever Reſtraints a Convocation might be laid, the Plan was not the Work of a Convocation. But he argues, that if the Convocation, without a ſpecial Licence, cannot attempt ſuch a Thing, much leſs can it be attempted by Clergymen out of Convocation— Clergymen of leſs Diſtinction perhaps, and fewer in Number. But this Argument is by no Means concluſive. The Parliament of Great Britain, for Inſtance, when met together upon public Buſineſs, are tied up to the Strictneſs of Rules and Forms; but when the Members meet together occaſionally or deſignedly, in their private Character, they are free from thoſe Reſtraints to which they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in their parliamentary Capacity. The like may be ſaid of the Convocation; the Members of which, at a private Meeting, may lawfully do many Things, and in ſuch a Way, as are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to be done at all, or in that Way, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>
            <p>NOR has his Majeſty been <hi>intirely neglected</hi> in this Affair. Indeed the Prince upon the Throne was never neglected, when the Scheme for an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Epiſcopate was made the Object of Attention. The Caſe of the Epiſcopalians in the Colonies was duly conſidered by the Society, and the Plan for an Epiſcopate, peculiarly fitted to their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was brought nearly to its preſent Form, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>—when an Order was iſſued by the Crown, for a Bill to be drawn and preſented to the Parliament for the Confirmation of it <note n="§" place="bottom">See the <hi>Appeal.</hi> p. 52.</note>. An American Epiſcopate was propoſed
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012007_0155_0F893FB4B02EAFB0"/>
long before this Time: The Subject then was brought before the King's Privy Council, ſo that we have no Reaſon to think his Majeſty was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, at that Time. The ſame venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who furniſhed the Extract from Cranmer<hi>'s Catechiſm,</hi> in another Letter of Feb. 28th, 1770, to a different Perſon, ſays:—
<q>that <hi>he</hi> had met with an original Letter, that fell into his Hands by Executorſhip, from Dr. <hi>Alexander Murray,</hi> in which he found that the Council had come to a Reſolution to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy in Virginia; that he himſelf (Dr. Murray) who had attended <hi>Charles</hi> II. abroad, ſhould be the firſt Biſhop; that the Plan of Eſtabliſhment was referred to the Biſhop of London and Sir Orlando Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and this was, ſo far as <hi>he</hi> could recollect, Oct. 16, 1673. And <hi>he</hi> ſuppoſes the Matter then died, by the <hi>Cabal</hi>'s throwing out Sir Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando in the November following, before the Biſhop and he made their Report <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The late Archbiſhop diſcovered, from ſome Papers of Biſhop Gibſon, that there was ſuch a Deſign in the Time of <hi>Charles,</hi> II. and
<q>that Letters Patent for that Purpoſe are ſtill extant.</q>

He adds, that he had returned the Original to the Duke of Bedford, with ſeveral other Papers belonging to the Duke's Family, but had taken a Copy of it. To ſay nothing farther of the intermediate Reigns, the Plan was properly laid before his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and he heartily approved of it; and of this Royal Approbation ſome Members of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had received authentic Evidence, before their Petitions were voted. As therefore our Friends have no juſt Reaſon to blame us for proceeding <hi>illegally, to the intire Neglect of his Majeſty,</hi> our
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012007_0156_0F893FB56EEEFBF0"/>
Enemies have certainly no Right to reproach us with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHY then was not the Plan introduced with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice of ſo important a Point of Deference to the Royal Supremacy?</hi> p. 118. Becauſe it was not needful. The Deſign was to inform the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true Plan that was propoſed for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Epiſcopate, and to convince the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced of the Reaſonableneſs of it; and it would not have promoted either Part of the Deſign, to have told the Reader what the King thought of it. But afterwards, in replying to the Doctor's Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this Information became proper, and he doubtleſs received from it no ſmall Conſolation. However, he is not altogether ſatisfied, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires farther: <hi>Why is there not now exhibited in Form ſome authentic Proof of the King's</hi> LICENCE <hi>to contrive and publiſh the Plan we</hi> HAVE HAD HELD <hi>out to View?</hi> p. 116. The King could give no Licence to <hi>contrive</hi> a Plan that was contrived long before he exiſted; but authentic Proof of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of it, and that he does not look upon the Steps that have been taken as any Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Royal Supremacy, we are able to give. We pretend not to have proceeded in all the Forms of a Convocation, which would have been a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Affectation, nor to have received a <hi>Licence</hi> under the great Seal. Such a Licence was not neceſſary; it was ſufficient for our Convention, that his Majeſty had conſidered and was favorable to the Epiſcopate in View, and that our Evidence of his favorable Diſpoſition was ſuch as could not be queſtioned. Our Evidence of this important Fact we have not laid before the Public, becauſe this would be taking a Liberty that has not been
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012007_0157_0F893FB67108E310"/>
granted; and we are reſolved to do nothing but what is <hi>ſtrictly</hi> warrantable.</p>
            <p>IF nothing elſe could be ſaid to juſtify the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe who propoſed the Plan, yet
<q>the Charter granted to the Society for the Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, has the Nature and Efficacy of a Royal Commiſſion,</q>
and warranted them to concert any Plans that might be thought neceſſary, in Order more fully to anſwer the Ends of their Incorporation. They <hi>ſoon</hi> were convinced that an American Epiſcopate would be highly uſeful to this Purpoſe. They mention the Matter as early as the <hi>Abſtract</hi> annexed to the anniverſary Sermon preached in 1703, by Biſhop Burnet. From their entering ſo ſoon upon the Subject, it may fairly be concluded, that, in <hi>their</hi> Opinion, the Charter gave them the Authority in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>INDEED the Doctor allows, that the Society had a Right to form <hi>a general Plan for ſending Biſhops to America,</hi> and that this may be <hi>perfectly conſiſtent with due Honor to the Royal Supremacy</hi>; but not to plan ſuch an Epiſcopate as that of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> For, it ſeems, the Biſhops therein propoſed, are <hi>to carry on the Buſineſs of eccleſiaſtical Government and Diſcipline in a Manner quite different from that which is injoined by the Authority of the King and Parliament.</hi> p. 117. The King and Parliament have preſcribed in what Manner eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be adminiſtred in England; but the Statute is not quoted, wherein they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined any Form of it for the Colonies. Indeed he alledges the 73d <hi>Canon,</hi> which is pointed againſt thoſe that <hi>impeach</hi> or <hi>deprave</hi>
               <q>the Government or Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Church of England;</q>
               <pb n="151" facs="unknown:012007_0158_0F893FB814863DF0"/>
but nothing which has not this Tendency is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Canon. The Canon could have no Reference to the Colonies, becauſe they were not ſettled at the Time of framing it; and therefore it is not violated, by propoſing an Epiſcopate for the Colonies, that is peculiarly adapted to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays the Doctor: <hi>Why do Colony-Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians glory in being Members of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, if there is no Church of England here? And if there is, it is as reaſonable to ſuppoſe the Canon was intended to guard its eſtabliſhed Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt Impeachment and Depravation here, as at home.</hi> p. 118. We glory in being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of England, becauſe we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it to be the pureſt and beſt Church upon Earth. We are Members of that Church, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our diſtant Situation, becauſe we not only receive her Articles and embrace her Liturgy, but more eſpecially becauſe we ſubmit to her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and all our eccleſiaſtical Offices are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Power derived from her Biſhops. The Church of England therefore extends itſelf into the Colonies, and <hi>partly</hi> exiſts here; although at preſent in ſuch an imperfect State, for Want of an Epiſcopate, as to be a proper Object of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Interpoſition of all its Friends.</p>
            <p>BUT if the Church of England exiſts here, it is argued, that the Canon muſt have been intended to guard its <hi>eſtabliſhed Form of Government</hi> here, as well as at home. But how could the Canon be intended to guard its <hi>eſtabliſhed Form,</hi> where no Form is eſtabliſhed? The Canon was evidently deſigned to extend, and it can extend, no farther
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012007_0159_0F893FB86F8F79E0"/>
than to where the Church was, or is eſtabliſhed. It may be eſtabliſhed here by the ſame Authority that has eſtabliſhed it at home, and yet under a different <hi>Form,</hi> in many Reſpects, without <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching</hi> or <hi>depraving</hi> any Part of the Eſtabliſhment which it has in England. For in framing Laws for the external Regulation of a Church, as well as of any other Society, Reference ought always to be had to the Circumſtances of the Country, and the Opinions or Prejudices that generally prevail in the Minds of People. On this Account, the Government of the Church may require one mode of Adminiſtration in England, and another here; and ſuch a Difference will be no <hi>Impeachment</hi> on either Side. For while it is allowed, that a certain Mode of Adminiſtration is the fiteſt for that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in which it obtains; it is no Reflection to ſay, that it is not fit for a different Country, with a View to which it was never framed. The preſent eccleſiaſtical Government in England, although perhaps in ſome Points capable of Improvement, yet, upon the whole, may be better adapted to that Kingdom, than any other Form that can be deviſed. At the ſame Time, the Epiſcopate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for America, may be fiter for America, than ſuch an Epiſcopate as is eſtabliſhed in England. In theſe Caſes, the American Epiſcopate will imply no Reflection upon the Engliſh Epiſcopate, nor the Engliſh upon the American; as each may be beſt fited, in ſuch different Countries, to anſwer the great Ends of the general Appointment.</p>
            <p>THE Church of England claims to herſelf a Right, and ſhe allows the ſame to all Churches, to regulate or alter the <hi>Externals</hi> of Religion, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may require. Previouſly to the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012007_0160_0F893FB92F6F8630"/>
of eccleſiaſtical Matters ſoon after the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> this Point was fully canvaſſed; and at a public Diſputation between the proteſtant and popiſh Divines, the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for and ſupported this Propoſition—
<q>that every particular Church hath Authority to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, change and abrogate Ceremonies and Rites of the Church (meaning every Thing belonging to its Worſhip or Diſcipline that is not eſſential) ſo that it be to Edification<note n="*" place="bottom">Strype's <hi>Annals,</hi> p. 92, and <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 40.</note>.</q>
Accordingly the Doctrine of this Propoſition was ſoon after brought into <hi>Art.</hi> xxxiv.
<q>It is not neceſſary, ſays the Article, that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all Places one or utterly like, for at all Times they have been diverſe, and may be changed <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Diverſity of Country and Men's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ſo that nothing be ordained contrary to God's Word.—Every particular or national Church hath Authority to ordain, change and aboliſh Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained only by Men's Authority; ſo that all Things be done to edifying.</q>
The ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is uſed in the Preface to the Book of Common Prayer eſtabliſhed by 14 CHARLES II, and in many other Places. According therefore to the Doctrine of the Church of England,
<q>the Diverſity of Country and Men's Manners</q>
may be a ſufficient Reaſon, for ſettling an Epiſcopate in America under differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Regulations, and a different external Form, from what may be eſteemed preferable in England.</p>
            <p>WERE the Circumſtances of this Country the ſame with thoſe of England, an Epiſcopate of the ſame Kind with that in England would have been the Object of our Plan; for we believe, as the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012007_0161_0F893FB9EF91E310"/>
Legiſlature at home believe, that ſuch an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate is beſt fited for ſuch a Country. Were the Circumſtances of England the ſame with thoſe of the Colonies, ſuch an Epiſcopate as would be beſt for the Colonies, would alſo be beſt for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country. In that Caſe, I confeſs, it would be <hi>an idle Thing to ſay,</hi>
               <q>that Circumſtances in America require that the Externals of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate ſhould be under a Regulation peculiar to this Country.</q>
But he that cannot ſee that the Circumſtances of the Two Countries are widely different, muſt be blind with a Witneſs; and he that can argue for the Propriety of any Mode or external Form under certain Circumſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is proper under different Circumſtances, is <hi>idle</hi> indeed. Strange! that the Doctor, who can frequently make Diſtinctions where there is no Difference, ſhould not be able to diſtinguiſh ſo glaring a Difference!</p>
            <p>BUT we are told, that <hi>no Circumſtances, unleſs thoſe of a meer worldly Nature, which have nothing to do with a purely ſpiritual Kingdom, can make it fit, ſuitable or reaſonable, that the Mode of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate ſhould be different</hi> (here) <hi>from what it is at home,</hi> p. 120. It may be ſaid, in the like Strain, that no Circumſtances, but thoſe of a mere wordly Nature, which have nothing to do with a purely ſpiritual Kingdom, can make it reaſonable or fit, that the Mode of ſupporting the Clergy here, ſhould be different from what it is at home, namely, by Tithes. This Propoſition is in the ſame Style with the Doctor's, and is as unexceptionable as his. The ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt is indeed not <hi>of</hi> this World; yet it exiſts <hi>in</hi> the World, and as the Subjects of it are not <hi>pure Spirits,</hi> like the Biſhops
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012007_0162_0F893FBAB1C78BA8"/>
the Doctor allows us, it may be greatly affected by the Things of this World. But I will not enlarge on ſo plain a Subject. If the Epiſcopate now propoſed, would be better received, and probably have a better Effect in America, than the Engliſh Epiſcopate; it is, of the two, the fiter for this Country. It is of no Conſequence in this Debate, whether the Fitneſs ariſes from Conſiderations that are <hi>purely ſpiritual,</hi> or not. Fitneſs is Fitneſs; Reaſonableneſs is Reaſonableneſs; and whatever is fit and reaſonable to be done, ought always to be done. It is therefore ſubmitted to the Reader's Judgment, whether the Plan for an American Epiſcopate which has been offered to the Public, has any Tendency to <hi>impeach</hi> or <hi>deprave</hi> the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Government of the Church of England— any more, than a particular Mode of maintaining the Clergy in one Country, is an Impeachment of a different Mode of maintaining them in another Country.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, what is this to the Doctor, or his Adherents? Are he and they, on a ſudden, become ſo friendly, as to deſire that the Advocates for the Epiſcopate in Queſtion may not incur the Penalty of a Canon? He, good Man, ſeems to be under great Concern for us on this Account. We are obliged to him for his <hi>Friendſhip</hi>; but he may ſpare himſelf all his Uneaſineſs, as we are ſafe without it.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Fulminations</hi> hitherto have reſembled that diſtant Cannonading, which often precedes and introduces a cloſe Engagement, where Noiſe and Smoak are the moſt that is expected. But now he proceeds to immediate Action. His Five capital
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012007_0163_0F893FBC590A4F10"/>
Objections, like ſo many ſtanding Batteries formerly erected, he again brings to <hi>bear</hi> upon the Plan that has been advanced—but, with what Force and Execution, will ſhortly appear from a diſtinct View of each.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION 1. <hi>The Government and Diſcipline of the Church of England, under the propoſed American Epiſcopate, is injurious both to the Church, and the Biſhops that are to preſide over it,</hi> p. 121. He thought it injurious to the Church, becauſe it was to have no immediate Effect upon the Laity. To this it was anſwered:
<q>If the Laity are not to be affected by the Biſhop's Authority, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not to be injured by it; that, which does not operate at all, producing no Effect, either injurious or beneficial<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 206.</note>.</q>
He now aſks: <hi>Is this a fit Anſwer for public View?</hi> It was offered as ſuch, and I ſee no Reaſon to be aſhamed of it. <hi>No one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I believe, before the Doctor ever ſaid, it was not injurious to deprive the Laity of a ſpiritual Privilege they are ſuppoſed to be intitled to, and by a Grant from Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For my Part, I believe Dr. Chauncy is the firſt, that ever talked of <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Men of what they never had in Poſſeſſion. If the not beſtowing a Favour may be called a <hi>Deprivation,</hi> it may be ſaid of him, that he has been deprived of the Biſhoprick of London.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſpiritual Privilege,</hi> of which he ſuppoſes the American Laity to be <hi>deprived</hi> by our Plan, is that of being immediately under the Government of Biſhops; but if they are not deſirous of being under ſuch Government, they certainly cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, nor ought it to be mentioned, in the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012007_0164_0F893FBCEECDEB18"/>
Light of a <hi>Privilege.</hi> The Doctor often ſpeaks of eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, as only the Rule for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, or the Puniſhment itſelf, of eccleſiaſtical Delinquents; according to which Uſe of the Word, the Privilege for which he contends, in Behalf of the American Laity, is <hi>the Privilege of being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> for their Offences. So that his <hi>Privilege</hi> is of as new and extraordinary a Nature, as his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation.</hi> For tell a Criminal of his <hi>Privilege</hi> of receiving public Correction, and he will take it as an Inſult. If the Doctor had contended for eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Puniſhment, which he means by the Word <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as a <hi>Benefit</hi> to the Church in general, or ſometimes even to the Delinquents themſelves, and not as a <hi>Privilege</hi> to the Sufferers, he might have been free from Abſurdity.</p>
            <p>THIS Matter of Diſcipline ſeems to have been ſtrangely miſunderſtood, or miſrepreſented, by my Opponent. It is not propoſed that the American Laity of the Church of England, after the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Epiſcopate, ſhall be under no eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Diſcipline at all; for they are not ſo at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It is the Duty of the Clergy now, and it will be conſidered as their Duty under the propoſed Epiſcopate, to make Uſe of public and private Admonition, and to repel from the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Caſes may require; and it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that a more ſevere Diſcipline than this, would, in the preſent Age, and in this Country, tend to Edification. The Enemies of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland reproached the Eſtabliſhment of it by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with the Neglect of Diſcipline; but its celebrated <hi>Apologiſt</hi> maintained in Anſwer to them, that She was guilty of no criminal Neglect in this Reſpect.
<q>
                  <hi>Nos—quantum his Moribus et Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:012007_0165_0F893FBDAF365978"/>
&amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> as far as the preſent Times, and the preſent State of Manners, in this Age of general Corruption, will <hi>admit of,</hi> we do care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adminiſter eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline<note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. Jewel'<hi>s Apology.</hi> p. 66.</note>.</q>
This he thought a ſufficient Juſtification of the Church of England; not imagining that She was obliged to make Uſe of a ſeverer Diſcipline than the Times would admit of. The ſame Plea is offered for the Epiſcopate propoſed for the Colonies. As much Diſcipline over the Laity as the State of this Country will admit of, is in the Hands of the Clergy; and therefore more will not be introduced by the Biſhops of our Plan. Conſequently, <hi>in this Reſpect,</hi> they will not be <hi>immediately</hi> beneficial to the Laity. However, as they will probably cauſe ſome of the Clergy to be more attentive to their Duty in general than they would otherwiſe be, and to that of Diſcipline, as well as others; in this Way they will be really beneficial to the Laity, by the Inſtrumentality of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>UNDER this Objection the Doctor urged, that our Plan would be <hi>injurious to the Biſhops</hi> propoſed, by reſtraining their Power. It was anſwered, that if ſuch a Reſtriction was not injurious to the Church, it could be no Injury to the Biſhops. I could not conceive of the Authority of Biſhops, under the Notion of ſo much <hi>private Property</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; in Conſequence of which every Limitation of their Authority would be ſo much <hi>Damage</hi> ſuſtained by the Biſhops. This was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as an abſurdity attending the Doctor's Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He now refers to it, not as a ſuppoſed Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of his, but as a Principle of mine; and makes a Flouriſh in the following abuſive Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:012007_0166_0F893FBE6F105318"/>
               <hi>It is amazing, one of the Doctor's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſhould not be able to ſee, that Biſhops were</hi> (are) <hi>capable of ſuſtaining Damage in other Ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of being touched in their private Property.</hi> p. 123.</p>
            <p>TO what was ſaid on this Subject in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> which ſtands in full Force notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctor's Attempt to weaken it, I will now add, as worthy of his Attention, the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. The epiſcopal Order has Authority, given by Chriſt, to govern the Church. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority extends to all the Members of the Church, the Laity as well as Clergy; but its <hi>immediate</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Operation was chiefly intended to take Place upon the Clergy. The Diſcipline of the Church, ſo far as the Laity are its immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, has always been exerciſed by the parochial Clergy, except in ſome extrordinary Caſes, and not by the Biſhops in their own Perſons. It appears therefore, that no great Innovation will be the Conſequence of our Plan; it being intended only to provide, that no new Diſcipline over the Laity ſhall be introduced into America, nor the common Diſcipline exerciſed by different Perſons, under the propoſed Epiſcopate. And where it is ſaid that the Biſhop's
<q>Authority ſhall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity;</q>
the Meaning is, that it ſhall operate only upon the Clergy as its immediate Objects, and that others can have no Reaſon to dread its Effects. Not that the epiſcopal Authority over the Laity ſhall be intirely ſuſpended; for when the parochial Clergy exerciſe an Authority, given them by the Biſhops, and under their Superintendency, it is an Exerciſe of the Biſhop's Authority. What a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012007_0167_0F893FBF2FD71200"/>
does properly and effectually by Means of his ſubordinate Officers, is his own Act; and there is no juſt Room to complain, that the Biſhops of the <hi>Appeal</hi> are injured, by being diveſted of all Authority over the Laity. The Authority given by Chriſt to Biſhops ought always to be exerciſed in ſuch a Manner, as may beſt anſwer its original Intention, of which they are the proper Judges. If the Governors of the Church had not ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary Power in Matters of this Nature, in many Caſes the Exerciſe of their Authority would tend more to Deſtruction than to Edification, and thus defeat its own End.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION II. <hi>The Biſhops in this Plan are ſo widely different from the Biſhops of the Church of England at home, that it is not reaſonable they ſhould be deſired or ſent,</hi> p. 124. In Anſwer to this it was ſaid,
<q>the Biſhops in this Plan are <hi>eſſentially</hi> the ſame with the Biſhops at home, how widely ſoever they may differ in ſome Circumſtances.</q>
So far as they differ from the Biſhops in England, they are <hi>more</hi> adapted to the State of the Colonies, and are proportionably <hi>more</hi> to be <hi>deſired</hi> than ſuch Biſhops; the Difference being propoſed for this very End, that they may be rendered more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in this Country. And I obſerved to this Objector, in Words that have not eſcaped his Notice, that
<q>let them be ever ſo different, if ſuch Biſhops as are propoſed are fiter for the Colonies, than ſuch Biſhops as are in England, and the Doctor will hardly ſay they are not; then it may be reaſonable that they ſhould be both deſired and ſent<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended.</hi> p. 207.</note>.</q>
But behold here, another Curioſity in the Regions of Controverſy! The Doctor replies in
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012007_0168_0F893FBFEE261640"/>
theſe remarkable Words: <hi>The plain Anſwer is, they are not fiter for the Colonies, than</hi>—(than what? I dare ſay every Reader expects the next Words to be, <hi>ſuch Biſhops as are in England.</hi> But no ſuch Matter; for thus it is in my Copy, than) <hi>for the Mother Country.</hi> See here, in a proteſtant Divine, an Inſtance of Jeſuitical Sophiſtry, that is worthy of a FILIUCIUS or an ESCOBAR! The Biſhops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were ſaid to be fiter for this Country, than ſuch Biſhops as are in England would be; but they were not ſaid to be fiter for the Colonies than they are for England, although this be undoubtedly the Caſe. The Propoſition that I advanced, this accompliſhed Diſputant was unable to deny; but in the Place of it he denied a Propoſition that I had not advanced, that he might <hi>appear</hi> to contradict me.</p>
            <p>UNDER this Branch of the Objection, the Doctor inſiſted, that it was unreaſonable for <hi>a comparative Handful of epiſcopal Profeſſors</hi> in the Colonies to expect, <hi>that the Powers and Appendages of Biſhops ſhould be ſo mightily abridged</hi> in Favour of them; when <hi>the Diſſenters in England,</hi> and others who deſired it, could not obtain this Gratification at home. To this I gave no particular Anſwer, as the ſame Point had been already conſidered, and what had been ſaid was, in my Opinion, a full Anſwer to it. <hi>But</hi> WHERE (this was conſidered) ſays the Doctor, <hi>he has not told us; nor can I find that he has any where given ſuch an Anſwer, or even attempted it,</hi> p. 125. As I frequently find Reaſon to ſuſpect, that he has never read, with proper Attention, the Pieces he undertakes to refute, I ſhall not queſtion the Truth of what is here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, namely, that he knows not <hi>where</hi> I had
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012007_0169_0F893FC190DD0FF8"/>
obviated the Remark under Conſideration. And as I am willing to give him any friendly Aſſiſtance he may think himſelf intitled to aſk, I will inform him, that I had Reference in particular to p. 113, preceeding; for the Pertinency and Force of which, I appeal to every Reader, one only excepted.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor alſo complains, that I took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he ſaid, concerning the Inconſiſtency of our Plan with the Doctrine of <hi>Uniformity,</hi> which is, <hi>made ſo important a Matter in the Church of England.</hi> I aſſure him, that whatever in his <hi>Anſwer</hi> I paſſed by without Notice, was omitted, either from an Opinion that it had been already obviated, or that it did not deſerve particular Notice. It was on the latter of theſe Accounts, that I made no Remarks upon the Paſſage referred to. And here I will only obſerve by the Bye, that Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is not more ſtrenuouſly required by the Church of England, than by every other national Church. An Uniformity of Worſhip and Doctrine, and even of Diſcipline in all its <hi>eſſential</hi> Parts, with what is eſtabliſhed in England, will be maintained in the Church of England in the Colonies, under the propoſed Epiſcopate. And as to the Difference in the <hi>Appendages</hi> of our Biſhops, it will be no greater than has lately been proved, from the 34th Article—that, in the Opinion of the Church of England,
<q>Diverſity of Countries and Men's Manners</q>
will juſtify.</p>
            <p>IT was farther objected, <hi>that if Biſhops ſhould be ſent to the Colonies, with theſe reſtrained Powers</hi> (as mentioned in the Plan) <hi>undeſirable Conſequences might be naturally feared, both here and at home.</hi> The Conſequence to be dreaded here, was ſaid to

be, <hi>that the Biſhops would throw off this Reſtraint as ſoon as might be,</hi> &amp;c. In Anſwer to this it was obſerved, that Men's endeavouring to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Reſtraint, is no juſt Reaſon why they ſhould not be reſtrained, on proper Occaſions. It was alſo obſerved, that no Uneaſineſs under ſuch a Reſtraint was juſtly to be apprehended in our American Biſhops; for as they will know what to expect before they accept of the Office, there can be no Diſappointment. I then proceeded in the following Words, which I beg Leave to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; becauſe I think them a ſufficient Anſwer not only to all that was objected under this Head, but to all the Doctor now ſays in Support of his Objection.
<q>Why ſhould they (the American Biſhops) be uneaſy, becauſe the Biſhops at home are inveſted with civil Authority? The Biſhops at home may be as properly uneaſy and reſtleſs, becauſe they are not, like ſome of their Order on the Continent of Europe, ſovereign Princes. Perhaps the Uneaſineſs of American Biſhops may be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the Reflection, that deſtitute as they are of civil Power, they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the ſame Church with their Brethren in England. But they will not be able to avoid the farther Reflection, that they are Biſhops of the ſame Church in <hi>different</hi> Countries, and under <hi>different</hi> Circumſtances; which eſſentially alters the Caſe. And no better Reaſon can be given, why they ſhould not be contented with leſs Power than belongs to the Biſhops in England, than why the other Biſhops in England ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with leſs Power than belongs to the Biſhop of Durham. This ſame Kind of Reaſoning would operate as ſtrongly againſt epiſcopal <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen</hi> in America, as againſt Biſhops. The
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012007_0171_0F893FC2F095F918"/>
Clergy of the Church of England at home, are, in a great Meaſure, ſupported by Tithes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it might have been ſaid, at the firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Colonies, if Clergymen of the Church of England are once admitted in this Country, under whatever Reſtrictions or Limitations, they will not be eaſy, until they ſhall have ſecured to themſelves the Tithes of our Eſtates<note n="¶" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended.</hi> p. 208, 209.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN Reply to this Illuſtration, the Doctor ſays: <hi>The Fact here ſuppoſed is, I believe, ſtrictly true, that the Clergy of the Church of England will never be eaſy until they may have ſecured to themſelves from our Eſtates here, what will be, in ſubſtantial Signification, the ſame Thing with the Tithes in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> p. 129. I believe that the Clergy, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Denomination, as well as Men, of whatever Station in Life, will not, and cannot, be eaſy, without a <hi>competent</hi> Maintenance. And I agree with the Doctor, that a competent Maintenance in one Way, is, <hi>in ſubſtantial Signification,</hi> much the ſame Thing with a competent Maintenance in any other Way. But ſomething ſeems to be here inſinuated, to the peculiar Diſadvantage of the epiſcopal Clergy in the Colonies, as if they were apt to be more reſtleſs, uneaſy and rapacious, than other Men; or, at leaſt, than the Clergy of other Denominations. But ſuch an Inſinuation is not more illiberal than unjuſt <note n="†" place="bottom">To ſhew that one Eccleſiaſtic is not always innocent of the Crimes of which he accuſes others, and to give a little Relaxation to the Reader, who may be fatigued with travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through ſo many dry Pages of Controverſy, I beg Leave to introduce the following Ancedote. Bilibaldus Pirckhei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus, the great Friend of Eraſmus, in a Company where much was ſaid in Commendation of him, took Notice that a certain <hi>Mendicant Monk,</hi> diſcovered, by his Countenance and Geſtures, that he was greatly diſſatisfied with the Encomiums that paſſed.
<q>And being hard puſhed to declare what he had to cenſure in Eraſmus, he ſaid, that this Man, whom they affected to extol ſo much, was a notorious <hi>Eater of Fowls</hi>; and that he knew it to be true, not from the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of others, but of his own Eyes. Did Eraſmus buy them, or ſteal them? Said Pirckheimer. He bought them, ſaid the Monk.—But is it then a Sin to eat Fowls? Moſt certainly, anſwered the Monk: It is the Sin of Gluttony; and it becomes the more heinous, when it is committed and frequently repeated by Church-Men. Perhaps, ſaid Pirckheimer, he eats them upon Faſt-Days. No, ſaid the Monk; but we Eccleſiaſticks ought to abſtain upon all Days from ſuch Delicacies. Ah, my good Father, ſaid Pirckheimer, it is not by eating dry Bread, that you have got that huge Paunch of yours; and if all the Fowls, which have gone into it, could lift up their Voice at once, and cackle in Concert, they would make Noiſe enough to drown the Drums and Trumpets of an Army <note n="a" place="bottom">Jortin'<hi>s Life of Eraſmus.</hi> p. 216.</note>.</q>
This, it is hoped, will be as acceptable to the Reader, as the <hi>Story</hi> of my good Friend, the Doctor, about <hi>a Cock and a Bull and Three</hi> RAM-CHICKENS <hi>with which the Children are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diverted.</hi> See his <hi>Appeal anſwered,</hi> p. 25, in a Note.</note>; as I verily believe,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012007_0172_0F893FC3B050E580"/>
from all that I know of ſuch Matters, that it is intirely groundleſs. Why then ſhould they be the Objects of any peculiar Jealouſy? And why did the Doctor, on my happening to mention them, ſeize upon the Occaſion to give this Evidence of his <hi>brotherly</hi> Affection towards them?</p>
            <p>IT was pretended that Two <hi>undeſireable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> would ariſe at home, from granting to the Colonies the Epiſcopate requeſted. One is, that <hi>vaſt Numbers</hi> of People there, meaning the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters and diſaffected Members of the Church, would <hi>think themſelves hardly treated,</hi> when they found ſuch an Epiſcopate granted to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012007_0173_0F893FC46EAF9960"/>
as has been refuſed to them. I think them very <hi>hardly treated</hi> by ſuch an Objection as this; wherein they are repreſented as a Set of peeviſh and unreaſonable People, diſpoſed to behave weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abſurdly and perverſely, and in a Manner groſsly unworthy of Men and of Chriſtians. They are here ſuppoſed, in the firſt Place, to prefer ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for the Colonies, to the Epiſcopate in England—then, to have applied for ſuch an Epiſcopate themſelves, which has been refuſed them—and laſtly, becauſe they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in England, to be unwilling that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans ſhould have it. The Doctor may be better acquainted with the Genius and Diſpoſition of thoſe People than I am; but I can hardly believe ſuch an unfavorable Repreſentation of them to be juſt, at leaſt, without many Exceptions.</p>
            <p>IN making this Objection, I thought my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent had forgotten his proper Buſineſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which was to anſwer the <hi>Appeal,</hi> upon the Principles of the Diſſenters in this Country. Now if we may judge of them from their Writers, they would willingly inflame, rather than allay, the Diſcontent at home with the preſent eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment; and therefore they cannot conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently object, that the Execution of our Plan would increaſe that Diſcontent, or, in other Words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Effect which they wiſh to ſee. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſays, that I had <hi>injudicouſly miſplaced this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark —that had I made it under the former Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would have appeared more plauſible.</hi> p. 130. The Remark <hi>here</hi> was proper and pertinent; and by introducing it in this Place, I meant not to confine it to this particular Objection. And I expreſsly ſaid, that the Doctor miſtook his proper Buſineſs,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:012007_0174_0F893FC52E23DBF0"/>
not only where it was then pointed out, but IN MANY OTHER PLACES <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal defended.</hi> p. 209.</note>. The <hi>former Objection</hi> was ſo glaring an Inſtance of this Miſmanagement, that it was needleſs to mention it.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING, the Doctor thinks he had a Right to make Objections upon any Principles, <hi>as Objections of all Kinds were called for.</hi> But who called for <hi>all Kinds</hi> of Objections, in the Latitude wherein he has produced them? <hi>i. e.</hi> For good, bad and indifferent; pertinent and impertinent; conſiſtent and inconſiſtent; reaſonable and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable? I will undertake to anſwer for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that he did not. But if, in Fact, he had made ſo abſurd a Propoſal, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould have had more Diſcretion than to have accepted of it. But to clear himſelf partly from the Charge of Inconſiſtency, he informs us, that he and thoſe who are commonly called <hi>Diſſenters, are in real Earneſt that the epiſcopal Laity may not be impoſed on by their planning Clergy</hi>—and that the Deſign of the Objection was <hi>to ſerve them.</hi> It appears to me that the Account would have been far more juſt and candid, had he ſaid, that he and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents were <hi>in real Earneſt,</hi> to excite, in the Minds of the <hi>epiſcopal Laity,</hi> a Jealouſy, that their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy have combined to impoſe upon and deceive them. For, I believe, it is not ſo much Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Laity, as Enmity to the Clergy, that has cauſed them to be ſo mightily <hi>in Earneſt. Their planning Clergy!</hi> How often muſt this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector be told, that the Epiſcopate in Queſtion was never <hi>planned</hi> by the American Clergy? It was ſhewn in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> that it was planned by others; and that the Plan is no otherwiſe ours, than as we
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012007_0175_0F893FC6D3CF3290"/>
we have adopted it, and are deſirous of promoting it. But what is worſt of all, he ſays it was <hi>a Scheme they had contrived</hi> FOR THEIR OWN SAKES. They muſt have been wretched <hi>Contrivers,</hi> if in forming <hi>a Scheme for their own Sakes,</hi> they could project no other Advantage to themſelves, than that of being more ſtrictly governed, and the Doctor's PRIVILEGE <hi>of being puniſhed</hi> when they do amiſs. That the Clergy have been influenced by mercenary Motives, in their Application for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, is as groundleſs and unjuſt a Reproach as Malice can invent. If ever a <hi>diſintereſted</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Reſolution was formed by any Body of Men; this of our Clergy, to ſolicit and promote an Epiſcopate, calculated to bring themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reſtraint, without the leaſt Proſpect of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantage, and with a View only to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion, is fairly intitled to this glorious Character. The whole Plan is laid before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; let the Public judge of it, and ſay—whether the Eaſe, or the Wealth, or Authority of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, can be the Object in View. Jealouſy, Envy, and a gloomy Tribe of malevolent Paſſions, are always ready to entertain unfavorable Suſpicions; but the Suſpicion, in this Caſe, has not the leaſt Appearance of Evidence to ſupport it. The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy therefore, conſcious of the Rectitude of their Aims, will be neither detered nor diſconcerted by any Abuſes they may receive from the Enemies of the Church; but they will ſteadily purſue, and perſevere in purſuing, what they judge to be their Duty with Regard to an Epiſcopate, through evil Report and good Report.</p>
            <p>IN dealing with one Branch of this general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I expreſſed what I took to be the Senſe of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012007_0176_0F893FC76F069AD0"/>
it in my own Words; in which I did not other Harm, than to expreſs it in ſtronger Terms than were uſed by the Doctor. In ſpeaking of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters at home, he ſaid they would <hi>think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hardly treated</hi>; this I expreſſed by their being <hi>clamorous,</hi> ſubſtituting <hi>noiſy Words</hi> for <hi>hard Thoughts,</hi> which was no great Diſadvantage to his Argument. However, he ſays, and in Strictneſs of Speech it is true, that <hi>it was not mentioned as an Objection that Diſſenters at home would</hi>
               <q>grow more <hi>clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> in Conſequence of the Settlement of the propoſed Epiſcopate.</q>
But he is alſo of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there was no <hi>juſt Foundation</hi> for my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Word <hi>clamorous</hi>; and that there is a <hi>wide Difference</hi> between the Diſſenters being <hi>clama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> and their <hi>thinking themſelves hardly treated.</hi> The two Things, it is confeſſed, are different in themſelves, and in ſome Caſes ſhould be carefully diſtinguiſhed; but it appears from the Hiſtory of the Engliſh Diſſenters, that <hi>with them</hi> there is ſuch a cloſe Connection between their thinking themſelves hardly treated, and their being <hi>clamorous,</hi> that miſtaking the former for the latter is very excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I ſpeak not of Individuals; there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly many among them of amiable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Characters; who are mild, gentle and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and who would ſuffer much, before they would make any public Diſturbance, or act any Way diſreſpectfully towards Government. But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, this has not been the <hi>general</hi> Character of the Party.</p>
            <p>WHAT was abſurdly put into the Mouth of the Diſſenters, I allowed that ſome others might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently ſay; and for their Satisfaction, I thought it ſufficient to refer them to what had been offered
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012007_0177_0F893FC8305CFF28"/>
               <q>to this Purpoſe—viz. That ſuch an Epiſcopate might be erected here with eaſe; but it cannot be effected in England, without ſubverting an Eſtabliſhment, and making a very viſible Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the national Conſtitution—a Work never to be undertaken but in the greateſt Extremity, and even then, not without a trembling Hand.</q>
The Doctor tells us, all this is a Miſtake. <hi>The propoſed Epiſcopate could not be erected here with that Eaſe that is inſinuated.</hi> But certainly it can be erected here with Eaſe, in a comparative Senſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> with leſs Difficulty than would attend the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of an Epiſcopate in any other Form. It will meet with no Oppoſition from the Friends and Members of the Church; and as to Oppoſition from thoſe who have no Concern with it, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and pragmatical, and not to be regarded.</p>
            <p>AND as 'to ſubverting an Eſtabliſhment,' and making
<q>a viſible Alteration in the national Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</q>
the Doctor ſees no Difficulty in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter —it is one of the eaſieſt Things in Nature. Some People may think the Subverſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Eſtabliſhment to be a <hi>good</hi> Work, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a <hi>pleaſant</hi> Work; but I believe this Writer is ſingular in thinking it an <hi>eaſy</hi> Work. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that he has not ſeen enough with his own Eyes, to convince him of the Groſſneſs of this Miſtake. Has he never known of Attempts to introduce Innovations in <hi>ſmall</hi> Matters, where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was thought to be concerned, that have been attended with violent Conteſts, and have ended in incurable Schiſms? Has he never heard of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that have been torn in Pieces, by the Endeavors of ſome, to ſubſtitute a new and better Verſion of the Pſalms, for Inſtance, in the Place
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:012007_0178_0F893F83F2DDB698"/>
of an old one? And does he think that a general religious Eſtabliſhment, to which the greater Part of the Nation is firmly attached, will be given up with more Eaſe, than a ſingle Congregation can be perſuaded to part with, or exchange, a Matter of but trifling Conſequence? It ſeems to be almoſt impoſſible that he can be ſerious, when he talks at this Rate. He concludes this labored Paragraph with telling the Public, that he thinks it high Time that the national Conſtitution ſhould be new-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled: And if he could find a ſufficient Party to ſupport him, I doubt not but he would undertake the Work <hi>himſelf,</hi> without ſo much as
<q>a trembling Hand,</q>
and that immediately, without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Heſitation or Delay; for, ſays he, <hi>the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the better.</hi> p. 132, 133.</p>
            <p>THE other ill Conſequence to be dreaded at home, I will lay before the Reader in the Doctor's Words, as he thinks I did not fairly repreſent it, when I undertook to expreſs it in Words of my own. <hi>It can ſcarce be ſuppoſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it ſhould eſcape the Thought of our Engliſh Biſhops, that the Settlement of ſuch an Epiſcopate in America, as is propoſed, may prepare the Way for ſuch a Change in the Power of Biſhops at home, as they would not be very fond of.</hi> To the Objection thus expreſſed, it is a ſufficient Anſwer to ſay—that the Biſhops at home univerſally approve of the Plan <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The late Archbiſhop of Canterbury was of Opinion that
<q>there ſcarce ever was a Biſhop of the Church of England, from the Revolution to this Day, that hath not deſired the Eſtabliſhment of Biſhops in our Colonies,</q>
upon much the ſame Plan with that under Conſideration.</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Let.</hi> to <hi>Walpole.</hi> p. 9.</bibl>
               </note>—that they have conſidered it in every Light, and viewed it in all its probable Conſequences—and, that they
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:012007_0179_0F893FC8EF6A65B0"/>
are, in Fact, under no Apprehenſions on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But, on the other Hand, they would have juſt Cauſe to be uneaſy, ſhould the propoſed Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate not be granted; as there would be Reaſon to ſuſpect, that ſuch a Refuſal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Hatred</hi> to the epiſcopal Order itſelf—a Hatred, which in Time might overthrow them and the Church of England together, as it once did.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION III. <hi>The Church of England knows no ſuch Biſhops as are ſpecified in the Plan, nor can they, in Conſiſtency with its Conſtitution, be ſent to the Colonies.</hi> p. 134. To this I gave no particular Anſwer before, as I conceived that what had been offered on the Subject of the King's Supremacy, from which the Inconſiſtency was infered, was a full Refutation of the Objection, and of all that was ſaid to ſupport it. But the Doctor will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, without a particular Anſwer. Let it then be obſerved, that what the Church of England allows of and has provided for, it not inconſiſtent with her <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and what She has experienced, She may be properly ſaid to know:—But, <hi>ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as are ſpecified in this Plan,</hi> She allows of, has provided for, and experienced:—Therefore, ſuch Biſhops are conſiſtent with her Conſtitution, and She is no Stranger to them. The <hi>minor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is thus proved. The Biſhops of our Plan are, and were originally called, <hi>Suffragan</hi> Biſhops: —Suffragan Biſhops are conſiſtent with the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of England:—Therefore, the Biſhops of our Plan are conſiſtent with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The Act of 26 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, Cap. 14, to which the Biſhops conſented, makes Proviſion for Suffragans in the Church of England. Such
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012007_0180_0F893FC9B368C828"/>
Biſhops were frequently appointed, during the whole Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See Strype'<hi>s Memorials</hi> of Cranmer, and Wharton'<hi>s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> on D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </note>. They are mentioned in the <hi>Canons</hi> that were framed in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church, and were continued ſome Years afterwards: For in 1606, it appears that Dr. Stern, then Suffragan Biſhop of Colcheſter, was ſuſpended, for ſome Irregularity of Conduct. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſtoration, the Biſhops, in Anſwer to ſome Propoſals made by the Preſbyterian Divines, ſay, in Words which are recommended to the Doctor's particular Notice, on more Accounts than one:
<q>We cannot grant the Extent of any Dioceſs is ſo great, but that a Biſhop may well perform his Duty, which is <hi>not a perſonal Inſpection</hi> of every Man's Soul, but the paſtoral Charge, or taking Care that the Miniſters, or other eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Officers within their Dioceſs, do their Duties; and if ſome Dioceſſes ſhould be too large, <hi>the Law allows of Suffragans</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Neal<hi>'s Hiſt. of the Puritans.</hi> Vol. IV. p. 23<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>.</q>
The Law equally allows of Suffragans at this Day <note n="§" place="bottom">See Gibſon<hi>'s Codex.</hi> p. 157.</note>. It is evident therefore, that the Biſhops of our Plan are conſiſtent with the Conſtitution of the Church of England; and it is farther evident, that the Doctor, in talking of theſe Matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays his Ignorance,
<q>underſtanding neither what he ſays, nor whereof he affirms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE chooſes <hi>here</hi> to introduce the Subject of the King's Supremacy, although the Conſideration of it more properly belonged to another Place. He brings it in here, becauſe it will ſwell this Part of his
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012007_0181_0F893FCA6E199320"/>
Performance, wherein he profeſſes more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to attack the Epiſcopate in Queſtion. For by ſuch a <hi>Manoeuvre</hi> the unwary Reader may be led to think, from the Number of Pages in this Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Doctor has ſaid much in direct Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the propoſed Epiſcopate; while, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, he has ſaid but very little that is pertinent to the Subject.</p>
            <p>HE had objected, that, according to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of England, all eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is derived from the Crown; that as to Authority purely eccleſiaſtical, there is no ſuch Thing in the Church of England; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Biſhops of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as having ſuch an Authority as
<q>is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther derived from the Church, and not from the State,</q>
cannot be Biſhops of, nor be ſent by, the Church of England to America. This occaſioned me to conſider the Subject largely, and to make a particular Examination whether his Aſſertion were true. And to prove that he was miſtaken, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Variety of moſt authentic Evidence; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the Explanation of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, to the Convocation of the Province of York, the Words of the Letters Patent granted by <hi>Edward</hi> VI, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s INJUNCTIONS, and the 37th <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> —with a brief hiſtorical Account of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Operation, of theſe ſeveral Declarations and Writings. And it was made abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Supremacy claimed by our Princes, given them by the Conſtitution, and maintained by the Church of England, allows to our Biſhops a purely ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical Authority, which is derived, not from the Crown, but from Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:012007_0182_0F893FCC1749A3B0"/>THE Doctor ſays but very little to invalidate the Force of this Evidence. He ſays that <hi>all</hi> I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to prove <hi>is</hi> ONLY <hi>this, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's Supremacy, it is from Chriſt, not the King, that the Authority of the Biſhops, as ſuch, in the Church of England, is conveyed to them.</hi> p. 137. This is <hi>all</hi> that I had Occaſion to prove; and the Proof that I made, is ſufficient to overthrow one of the main Pillars that ſupported his Oppoſition to the Epiſcopate requeſted. Notwithſtanding, he affects to think very differently of the Matter. <hi>It is, to me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>beyond all Doubt, that his</hi> (the Author's) <hi>Labor on this Head is altogether vain.</hi> This is eaſily ſaid in any Caſe; but his Manner of ſaying it in this Place, is juſtly ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Here is a capital Point diſputed between us; I had taken more than common Pains to place it in a proper Light, and to convince the Doctor of his Miſtake; and his Reply is, that he thinks my <hi>Labor is vain.</hi> So far as <hi>his</hi> Conviction was the Object, I may probably have labored without Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; however, I have this Satisfaction, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is not convinced, he is in a Manner ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced. For he only repeats, and inſiſts upon, the Words of the Statute, where all Manner of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is ſaid to flow from the Crown, &amp;c. and refers to Dr. Burn'<hi>s Eccleſiaſtical Law,</hi> for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of Parliament relating to the Subject. p. 138. What was meant by that, and ſuch like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, was explained in the <hi>Appeal defended</hi>; and it was ſhewn that this Language was conſiſtent with the Doctrine and Belief of <hi>purely ſpiritual</hi> Power in the Church, in its ſtricteſt Senſe. It were eaſy to ſupport, by innumerable Authorities, what I advanced upon the Subject; but againſt Dr. Chauncy it needs no Support. I fear not but it
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:012007_0183_0F893FCCB5D70520"/>
will ſtand forever, by its own Strength, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Attempts he may make againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SHOULD it be ſuppoſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>not granted, that the Authority of Biſhops does not flow from the Crown, but from the Church, which is the utmoſt the Doctor has endeavoured to prove, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that he has anſwered, or ſo much as attempted to anſwer</hi> 'all that is ſaid in Support' <hi>of the Objection in Debate.</hi> But ſhould it be <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, not granted,</hi> that this is not an Anſwer to <hi>all</hi> that was ſaid in Support of the Objection, yet enough for the Purpoſe had been ſaid in other Places; and the Reader was refered to what had been ſaid relating to the Subject in general, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being limited to any particular Paſſage.</p>
            <p>WHAT was ſaid to ſupport the Objection, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwered, ſays the Doctor, until it is ſhewn, <hi>how that Authority is altogether from the Church, and not from the State, which can be exerciſed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Affair of Worſhip, Ordination, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Diſcipline, but by and under the Guidance, Controul, and ſovereignly preſcribed Order, not of the Church, but of the State.</hi> p. 139. But this was <hi>ſhewn</hi> too, and illuſtrated, in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 55; and in ſuch a Manner, as, I doubt not, will be allowed by the impartial to be ſatisfactory and convincing. The Origin of any Power is one Thing, and the Regulation or Obſtruction of the Exerciſe of that Power is another. The Doctor himſelf claims an eccleſiaſtical Authority, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally derived from Chriſt; but the Exerciſe of it is, in ſome Reſpects, regulated by the Laws of his Country. And had it a more particular Direction from the Government than it now has, it would
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012007_0184_0F893FCD71F5FA60"/>
ſtill be the ſame, as to its Nature and Origin, as it now is. So plain a Caſe has but little Need of Illuſtration; however, with this View, I conſidered one particular Branch of eccleſiaſtical Authority, the Power to baptize. This Power is generally eſteemed to be purely eccleſiaſtical, and not derived by a Commiſſion from the State; and yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it cannot be exerciſed by a Clergyman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Approbation and Conſent of other Perſons. But ſuch Approbation alters not the Nature of the Power, nor is it the Source from whence it is derived; any more than my Conſent and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Operation of a Surgeon, is the Cauſe of the Skill with which he performs it. In like Manner, the epiſcopal Authority may be altogether from the Church, and not from the State; and yet it may be guided and controlled by the State; without loſing its Nature or eſſential Character. If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King or the State is neceſſary, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Biſhop's coming over to America, ſo is the Conſent of the Maſter of the Ship in which he comes over; and the former does not change the Nature of his Office or of his Authority, and more than the latter. I ſhall now paſs on to</p>
            <p>OBJECTION IV. <hi>We are in Principle againſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Eſtabliſhments in Religion; and as we do not deſire any ſuch Eſtabliſhment in Support of our own religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sentiments or Practice, we cannot reaſonably be blamed, if we are not diſpoſed to encourage one in Favor of the epiſcopal Coloniſts.</hi> p. 140. It requires almoſt the Patience of a JOB, to deal with ſuch an Objector. He argues againſt the Epiſcopate of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> which aſks only for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not encourage an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi>; and he may as well object againſt Things that
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012007_0185_0F893FCE321DB258"/>
are ſtrait, becauſe he approves not of Things that are crooked.</p>
            <p>AS to his <hi>deſiring</hi> no Eſtabliſhment in Favour of his own religious Sentiments, I am perſuaded that he ſays it in a <hi>qualified Senſe</hi>; eſpecially as he undertakes to expreſs the general Opinion of the Congregationaliſts in New-England. For that they had generally become, <hi>in Principle, againſt all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhments in Religion,</hi> in the common Extent of the Expreſſion, was a Piece of Intelligence for which I was beholden to the Doctor. For, as I told him, I was in Poſſeſſion of certain hiſtorical Accounts and Anecdotes (ſince which Time I have collected more, and of a freſher Date) from which one would naturally infer the contrary. However, ſuppoſing the Repreſentation to be juſt, it may be proper ſo obſerve here, that ſo far as the Doctor and his Friends are againſt Eſtabliſhments, they are <hi>Deſerters</hi> from the Principles of their Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the firſt Settlers of New-England; who were not only, <hi>in Principle,</hi> for an Eſtabliſhment of their own Mode of Religion, but for an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment without a Toleration. This Doctrine they received from the Puritans, who aimed at nothing leſs than ſuch an Eſtabliſhment in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, as was ſhewn from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Maddox. The Doctor denies this; and ſays that the Puritans are <hi>herein injuriouſly miſrepreſented</hi> by Maddox. But if ſo, they are miſrepreſented by all our Hiſtorians, and even by their own Writings; and I could eaſily prove, from Neal's Hiſtory of them, as much as is here aſſerted.</p>
            <p>UPON this the Doctor is all on Fire, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation flaſhes out in the following Language.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012007_0186_0F893FCEF05D1E68"/>
               <hi>He</hi> (meaning the hapleſs Author) <hi>muſt not take it amiſs, if I tell him, that we are not ſurprized at his endeavoring to uncover the Nakedneſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, as he is a</hi> DESERTER <hi>from that</hi> GREAT CAUSE <hi>which brought them over to this then deſolate Land: Nor is it beyond what we expected, to find him, and many of the Society's Miſſionaries, who are either Proſelytes themſelves, or the Sons of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, fired with extraordinary Zeal in propagating High-Church Principles. This has all along been the Way, on this Side</hi> [of] <hi>the Atlantic, in which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to the Church, eſpecially clerical ones, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give Proof of the Sincerity of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> p. 141. Are all then, that mention the Bigotry and Intolerance of the firſt Settlers of New-England, to be charged with endeavoring to <hi>uncover</hi> their <hi>Nakedneſs?</hi> This will bear hard upon ſome of the moſt reſpectable Characters among their Deſcendants. For my Part, I wiſh that their Nakedneſs could be concealed, from a Regard both to their Honor, and that of their Poſterity; but, in Truth, neither the Doctor, nor his Friends, will be able to find a Cloak large enough to cover it, in ſuch a Manner, that
<q>the Shame of their Nakedneſs</q>
(in this Part) "do not appear."</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>deſerting the great Cauſe that brought them over</hi> to America; if the whole of their religious Syſtem be here meant, Dr. Chauncy himſelf (if 'certain hiſtorical Accounts and Anecdotes' may be credited) muſt be reckoned among the <hi>Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in ſeveral Reſpects. In one Reſpect at leaſt, the Words of this Objection make it evident, that he is a <hi>Deſerter</hi> from them. I do not indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look upon ſuch Conduct to be criminal; but he charges it upon me as a Crime: And therefore
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012007_0187_0F893FCFAED39C20"/>
while he exemplifies it himſelf, he is condemned from his own Mouth—a much feverer Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than what proceeds from an Enemy. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Way of thinking, the Doctor and I are under no greater Obligations to maintain all the religious Principles of our puritanical Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, than the Puritans themſelves were, to adhere to all the Principles of their Popiſh Anceſtors. I do not mean to inſinuate any Compariſon between the Puritans and Papiſts; nor to be wanting in any due Reſpect to the firſt Settlers of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. For it gives me Pleaſure to ſay, that I think they were, in general, Men of more Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, more Religion, and more Learning, than the original Settlers of new Colonies commonly are. But an undiſtinguiſhing Fondneſs for all their Sentiments, and, in particular, a Juſtification of their intolerant Spirit, are no Parts of that Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which is due to them, from the Friends of religious Liberty, although their Deſcendants.</p>
            <p>WHAT is here ſaid of the Society's Miſſionari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are either <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> or the <hi>Sons of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi> from Congregationaliſm, is too general a Charge to admit of a particular Reply. It ſeems to have been dictated by a Spirit of Reſentment, occaſioned by their Succeſs in propagating the true Principles of the Church of England, invidiouſly and illiberally ſtyled <hi>High-Church</hi>; in which, it has by no Means been yet made to appear, that they have generally uſed unjuſtifiable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. Their Zeal for the peculiar Doctrines of the Church, may ſometimes have been exceſſive; but when this could juſtly be ſaid, it may have been occaſioned by the unreaſonable Oppoſition they met with, in the Diſcharge of their proper Duty.
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:012007_0188_0F893FD06E384298"/>
However, <hi>we are not ſurpriſed—nor is it beyond what we expected, to find,</hi> that the Miſſionaries, who have been <hi>proſelyted,</hi> or are the <hi>Sons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,</hi> to the Church of England, are ſeverely cenſured, by ſo <hi>ſtrict an Adherer to,</hi> as well as ſo zealous a Defender of, the <hi>great Cauſe</hi> of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, as Dr. Chauncy.</p>
            <p>AS
<q>the Preſbyterians in Scotland, and the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts in Geneva, Holland and other Places, have always been Friends to religious Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</q>
I thought a full and particular Evidence was neceſſary in Order to convince us, that the Preſbyterians or Calviniſts in New-England have adopted a different Principle. For the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible a Fact is, the ſtronger Evidence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in Order to prove it. Dr. Prieſtley is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all Denominations of Proteſtants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one, are fond of Eſtabliſhments in their own Favor—and of ſomething more, viz. Of depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all other Sects. "This I own," ſays he (namely Confidence in their Moderation)
<q>is more than I could promiſe myſelf from any other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſtians whatever</q>
(viz. Than the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) "the <hi>Preſbyterians by no Means excepted</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay <hi>on the</hi> firſt Principles of Government. <hi>p. 187.</hi>
               </note>." Accordingly he ſays, in another Treatiſe:
<q>If I were to pray for the general Prevalence of any one Sect of Chriſtians, it ſhould be that of the Quakers; becauſe, different as my Opinions are from theirs, I have ſo much Confidence in their Moderation, that I believe they would let me live, write and publiſh what I pleaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted among them.</q>
(I ſuppoſe the Church of England does not ſuffer Dr. Prieſtley <hi>to live, write and publiſh what he pleaſes,</hi> without Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012007_0189_0F893FD217F7C9B8"/>
               <q>And this I own, is more than I could promiſe myſelf from any other Body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whatever; <hi>the Preſbyterians perhaps</hi> (N. B.) LEAST OF ALL <hi>excepted</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Eſſay</hi> on a Courſe of <hi>liberal Education.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
The Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſts in New-England therefore, in the Opinion of this Writer, muſt, with Regard to Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the Exerciſe of Power, differ from all other Denominations of Proteſtants, the Quakers excepted, and from the Preſbyterians <hi>perhaps moſt of all,</hi> if the Doctor's Account may be credited: And how compleatly they have adopted the mild and tolerant Principles of the Quakers, the Quakers and Baptiſts in New-England know by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Public has been lately told. It is a Pity that Dr. Prieſtley had not heard of this great Revolution in the religious Syſtem of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; for then he would not, on ſo fair an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, have neglected to render it all due Honor.</p>
            <p>DR. Chauncy ſtill affects to be terrified with an Apprehenſion, that the propoſed Epiſcopate will eſtabliſh the Church of England in the Colonies. I had aſked,
<q>Does this Plan propoſe the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Church?</q>
He anſwers: <hi>It undoubtedly does.</hi> I alſo aſked:
<q>Will the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it imply, or amount to, any ſuch Thing?</q>
His Anſwer is ready: <hi>Yes; or it can never be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Execution (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Execution</hi> can never be carried into Execution.) To ſhew that no ſuch Thing was intended or implied in the Plan, I held it up once more to public View; aſking, of the whole, and of all its material Parts, whether there was any Appearance of an Eſtabliſhment. An Anſwer is not wanting: <hi>Surely,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Doctor could not but know, before he aſked theſe Queſtions,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:012007_0190_0F893FD2BAA09F08"/>
that it was only aſking, whether we thought there was any Weight, or Force, in the produced Objection.</hi> p. 142. I ſtill inſiſt upon the Propriety of the Queſtions. To decide whether the Plan mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or implied an Eſtabliſhment or not, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to refer to the Plan itſelf; that the Reader might ſee with his own Eyes, whether there was any ſuch Thing:—In the ſame Manner, that, if a Perſon ſhould affirm to me that the Sun was not riſen, when I knew that it was viſiblely above the Horizon, I ſhould point to the Body of the Sun, and aſk if he did not ſee it.</p>
            <p>MY logical Opponent proceeds, expreſſing his Surprize: <hi>How unaccountable is it, that he could imagine, that he had ſaid any Thing to the Purpoſe, by</hi> BARELY <hi>puting theſe Queſtions! They are really nothing more than ſo many ſtrongly expreſſed Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; and will he call this arguing?</hi> The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>proper</hi> Queſtions, may be ſaying ſomething to the Purpoſe, eſpecially when they have the Force of <hi>ſtrongly expreſſed Affirmations.</hi> Every Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Propoſition; and Propoſitions that are pertinent to the Buſineſs in hand, and duly metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized and arranged, may juſtly be called <hi>arguing.</hi> The Queſtions appear to me to have been perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and I conceive that I acted with no Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the Caſe. At leaſt, the Doctor has made none appear, nor has he attempted to invalidate what was offered directly to the Point, any farther than in the Words I have quoted. But were he able to prove, that an Eſtabliſhment would be the Conſequence of executing our Plan, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do in any Senſe; yet, unleſs it were ſuch an Eſtabliſhment as would tend to abridge the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or interfere with the Rights, of ſome of his
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:012007_0191_0F893FD36EC32548"/>
Majeſty's Subjects in the Colonies, it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to make it an Objection. It is poſſible, at leaſt in Theory, that there may be an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Religion, without any ill Conſequences to the Profeſſors of other Religions. Mr. Neal ſays:
<q>The King may create Dignitaries, and give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Encouragement to thoſe of the public Religion, without invading the Liberties of his diſſenting Subjects. If religious Eſtabliſhments were ſtript of their <hi>judicial Proceſſes,</hi> and <hi>civil Juriſdiction,</hi> no Harm could be feared from them <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the <hi>Puritans.</hi> Vol. IV. <hi>Pref.</hi> x.</note>.</q>
Now the Biſhops propoſed, whether eſtabliſhed or uneſtabliſhed, are to carry on no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Proceſſes, but againſt the epiſcopal Clergy, and are not to have the leaſt Shadow of civil Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and therefore, according to Mr. Neal, and according to common Senſe, no Harm can juſtly be feared from them, by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of any Denomination.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor had affirmed that there is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>that Chriſt has intruſted the State with a Right to make religious Eſtabliſhments</hi>; and argued, that if England had ſuch a Right, ſo had China, Turkey, &amp;c. the Conſequence of which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, would, upon the whole, be more injurious than beneficial; and <hi>therefore,</hi> that States had no ſuch Right. To ſhew the Weakneſs of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I applied it to the Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and made it evident, that all he ſaid againſt Eſtabliſhments, might as properly be urged againſt Men's Right to think and judge for themſelves. To this he replies: <hi>Surely the Doctor does not believe, that the Right of States to make religious Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is as clearly and indubitably a Grant from
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:012007_0192_0F893FD433203608"/>
God, as the Right of private Judgment.</hi> p. 144. But indeed I do believe, that God has given to States the Right in Queſtion, <hi>as clearly and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably,</hi> as he has given to Men the Right of private Judgment. But be this as it may; the Doctor's Argument will conclude as ſtrongly againſt the Right of private Judgment, as againſt the Right of States to make Eſtabliſhments. For if the ill Conſequences ariſing from the Abuſe of a Thing, invalidate the Right to make a proper Uſe of it, then ſuch ill Conſequences may deſtroy all Rights whatever. Eſtabliſhments, without a Toleration of Diſſenters, are intirely out of the Queſtion: I never contended for ſuch Eſtabliſhments, nor do I think that States have a Right to make them. But that they are authoriſed to make Eſtabliſhments, that do not violate the private Rights of Conſcience, is as clear to me, as any Propoſition relating to civil Society. For it means no more than this, that the Magiſtrate has a Right to give ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Countenance and Encouragement, to what he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems to be the true Religion; or, in other Words, that a Chriſtian Magiſtrate has a Right to ſhew more Favour to the Chriſtian Religion, than to Mahometiſm or Heatheniſm. And I will venture to add, that he has a Right to ſhew <hi>as much</hi> Favour to his Religion, as is neceſſary to ſupport it, and is conſiſtent with a full and free Toleration.</p>
            <p>AND if only ſuch a Right had been claimed, and exerciſed properly, in China, Turkey, or in any, or all the Kingdoms of the Earth; there would have been but little Reaſon to complain of any ill Conſequences. It is better that almoſt any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be ſupported, than that there ſhould be no Religion in a Nation; and ſuch a Support
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012007_0193_0F893FD4EF18F9F0"/>
as is contended for, would ſtill leave to thoſe of righter Judgment than the Magiſtrate, the Liberty of acting according to it. The Doctor ſpeaks of CHRIST's not having <hi>intruſted the State</hi> with a Right to make Eſtabliſhments; not adverting to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of ſuch Language. It was never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that this Right was given by Chriſt. The Authority he exerciſed was altogether of a ſpiritual Nature. He never interfered with the Rights of States, either to abridge or enlarge them; and the Rights of Kingdoms and States, before the Goſpel, were exactly the ſame that they now are, under the Goſpel. He gave not the Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he found Men already in Poſſeſſion of it. He only directed them in the Uſe of it; and their being liable to err in the Exerciſe of it, is no Argument againſt the Exiſtence of the Right. In like Manner, the Fallibility of the State, and its being liable, in Conſequence of Miſtakes, to make wrong Eſtabliſhments, proves not that it has no juſt Authority to make right ones.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION V. <hi>The Church of England in the Colonies, in its comparative low State, inſtead of an Epiſcopate upon this or any other Plan, needs rather the charitable Aſſiſtance of its Friends to ſupport its preſent Miniſters, and others that are ſtill wanted,</hi> p. 145. To this it was anſwered, that the Church of England, in ſeveral of the Colonies, is not in that <hi>comparative low State</hi> here ſpoken of; but is able to maintain its Clergy, and actually does main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, as liberally, as they are maintained in any Part of the Britiſh Dominions. This may properly be ſaid of a conſiderable Majority of the Epiſcopal Clergy in the Colonies; and therefore,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:012007_0194_0F893FD5AF2146F0"/>
with Regard to them, the Objection is not only weak, but utterly impertinent.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor replies, that he had no Reference to the ſouthern Colonies, <hi>for this very good Reaſon, becauſe it did not appear, that the Church of England in any of theſe Colonies had complained for Want of Biſhops, or were diſpoſed to petition for them,</hi> p. 146. But the Petitions from hence, were in Behalf of the Church in thoſe Colonies, as well as in theſe; and although we were not authoriſed by the ſouthern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies to petition in their Names, nor did we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch a Commiſſion, yet we had a Right to mention them, on the Occaſion, as equally ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Want of an Epiſcopate. The <hi>Appeal</hi> was made, 'in Behalf of the Church of England,' not only in the northern Colonies, but 'in America;' and this Objector had no Right to conſider the propoſed Epiſcopate in a partial View, when the Deſign of it, and the Want of it, were known to be general, extending to all the Colonies within the Britiſh American Dominions.</p>
            <p>IF the Clergy in ſome of the Colonies had not yet petitioned for an Epiſcopate, yet as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe Colonies equally required it, it was proper to include them in the Repreſentation, that was intended to ſhew the general Want of an Epiſcopate. I hope Men may ſometimes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as needing Aſſiſtance, eſpecially of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Kind, before they formally requeſt it. But ſince the Doctor looks upon the actual petitioning of the Clergy in <hi>all</hi> the Colonies, as of ſo much Conſequence to the Cauſe of a general Epiſcopate; I can now give him the Pleaſure of hearing, that the Clergy in Maryland have, ſome Time ſince,

generally united in petitioning the King, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c. in Favour of the Epiſcopate propoſed; and that their Petitions have expreſſed as much Earneſtneſs in the Cauſe, as thoſe of our northern Conventions. And in a ſhort Time, I doubt not but I ſhall be able to give him the farther Pleaſure of hearing, that the Clergy of the few remaining Colonies have petitioned to the ſame Purpoſe. I truſt he will take due Notice of this, and ſhape his future Objections accordingly.</p>
            <p>I obſerved to him alſo, in Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that
<q>ſuppoſing the Church throughout the Colonies needed the charitable Aſſiſtance of its Friends to ſupport its Miniſters, yet this would be no Proof that it does not need alſo an Epiſcopate.</q>
His Reply is, that notwithſtanding, <hi>it would fully prove, that the epiſcopal Clergy, in the Colonies, are boundleſs in their Deſires of Charity.</hi> And he ſeems to be well ſatisfied, that, although his Argument fails of proving what it was alledged for, yet it will luckily prove ſomething elſe. I would not rob him of any well-grounded Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but I muſt take the Liberty to obſerve, that what has been ſaid by him does not yet prove, that the Deſires of the Clergy are more boundleſs than the Neceſſities of the Church.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor had urged that the Money, by which an Epiſcopate muſt be ſupported, might be much more uſefully expended in ſupporting Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries in <hi>Carolina</hi> (I ſuppoſe he meant North-Carolina) where <hi>the religious State of Things, by all Accounts, is deplorably ſad.</hi> In Anſwer to this, I thought proper to obſerve as follows:
<q>When other Ends are to be anſwered (alluding to an
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:012007_0196_0F893FD72F397A40"/>
Expreſſion of his own) the Writers againſt the Church can tell us, that the Society have no Power to apply their Funds to other Uſes, than were intended by the Donors.—But <hi>now an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate is in View,</hi> it is thought reaſonable and juſt that the Society ſhould alienate a Fund, more ſtrictly appropriated to a particular Uſe than any other in their Power (for this may be truly ſaid of the Fund for the Support of American Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) and expend it upon Miſſionaries to be ſent to Carolina, and other Places, provided always, that ſuch Places be at a due Diſtance from New-England<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 215.</note>.</q>
The Doctor calls this a <hi>ſtrange Remark</hi>; and he affirms, that <hi>not a Word was ſaid of the Fund appropriated for the Support of American Biſhops, or of the Society's expending one Farthing of this Fund to</hi> [for] <hi>other Uſes than were intended by the Donors,</hi> p. 147. But how can that Money, which is deſigned for the Support of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, be expended in maintaining Miſſionaries, without taking it from the appropriated epiſcopal Fund, in which alone is depoſited all that is known to have been thus intended? This would be, to apply to one Uſe, what was particularly given for another. The epiſcopal Fund conſiſts of Legacies, and the Monies ariſing from them by Intereſt, given for the ſole Purpoſe of maintaining American Biſhops; and the Truſtees of theſe Legacies, I humbly conceive, have no Right to apply them to any other Uſe, than that for which they were intended, and to which they were limited, by the ſeveral Teſtators.</p>
            <p>BUT the Doctor, who can beſt explain his own Meaning, now pleads, that he was apprehenſive
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012007_0197_0F893FD7EF796970"/>
the Society might take from the common Fund, to make up any Deficiency in the epiſcopal Fund; and by that Means, the Support of an Epiſcopate would leſſen the Number of Miſſionaries, which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knows, he always wiſhes ſhould be encreaſed. If <hi>this, and this only, is what he had in View,</hi> I miſtook his Meaning; and the Anſwer I gave was founded on a Miſtake. But upon reviewing the Paſſage in his former Pamphlet, I find that the Miſtake was not my Fault but his; as I am ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make any other Inference from his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as they there ſtand.</p>
            <p>AND here he thinks proper to aſk my <hi>Opinion,</hi> whether the Society might not conſiſtently <hi>with Fidelity to their Truſt,</hi> make Uſe of ſuch a Liberty, and apply Part of their common Fund to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of an Epiſcopate. It is not my Province to preſcribe to that wiſe and venerable Body; but if I may expreſs my Opinion, it is clearly this—that, as they are known to have a Fund that is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Purpoſe of an American Epiſcopate, whatever is not particularly given to that Fund, is not intended for that Uſe, and the Society have <hi>no Right</hi> to employ it in that Service. I can alſo declare, that I have ſufficient Reaſon to believe, that no Members of the Society have ever intended or propoſed, that Money ſhould be taken from their common Fund for the Support of an Epiſcopate in the Colonies.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor ſays, that if I had <hi>looked within,</hi> he can <hi>ſcarce think</hi> that my <hi>Conſcience would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> me to <hi>inſinuate,</hi> that he <hi>ſpake of Miſſions in Carolina, becauſe at</hi>
               <q>a due Diſtance from New-England.</q>
p. 148. I confeſs it was not by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012007_0198_0F893FD8AECA39C8"/>
               <hi>within,</hi> but <hi>without,</hi> that I was led to ſuſpect, that he was fonder of Miſſionaries at the Diſtance of Carolina, than in his own Neighbourhood. If he will declare to the contrary, I will acknowledge that I have been miſtaken. It has often ſtruck me, in reading the various Productions of the anti-epiſcopal Writers in New-England, from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Hampſhire Miniſters</hi> to the Biſhop of London in 1734, with Dr. Coleman's Letter that accompanied it, down to Dr. Chauncy's laſt Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication <note n="*" place="bottom">By Doctor Chauncy<hi>'s laſt</hi> Publication is here meant, his <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> and not his REVENGE SERMON, preached May 30th, 1770; which ſpared the Miſſionaries, as it had a more important Object in View. The apparent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it was farther to <hi>inflame</hi> the Minds, of an inflamed Populace AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.</note>, that they were all very uneaſy at the Neighbourhood of the Miſſionaries, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious at contriving Employment for them at a Diſtance. They ſpeak of the epiſcopal Clergy as their Enemies; and it is natural for every Man to chooſe that his Enemies ſhould be
<q>at a due Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</q>
rather than within Reach of his Perſon. I think therefore, upon the whole, that it was no unnatural Concluſion, that thoſe Writers (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Dr. Chauncy) were deſirous that the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries ſhould be employed as far from New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland as poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is the real Truth of Fact,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>to whatever Cauſe it may be owing, that they</hi> (the Society) <hi>have employed few Miſſionaries, next to none, in</hi> [North] <hi>Carolina, where they were moſt needed, and multiplied them where there was little, if any Need at all of them; and in ſome Places they have ſupported, and are ſtill ſupporting them, where the Churches to whom</hi> [which] <hi>they miniſter, are
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012007_0199_0F894128AD4A7F68"/>
abundantly able, without any Aſſiſtance from them, to ſupport the Goſpel.</hi> p 149. As to North-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, it is confeſſed that there never have been ſo many Clergymen there as were needed; but it does not appear that this was owing to any Inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or Neglect of the Society. The Society's Fund is not an inexhauſtible Treaſure, enabling them to ſupply the Wants of all People in the Colonies. As they have never been able to gratify all the Petitioners for their Favour, it has been their Study to give the Preference where it was due. Thoſe Congregations which diſcover the greateſt Willingneſs to exert themſelves towards the Support of their Miniſters, the greateſt Deſire to obtain the Society's Favour, and the beſt Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to improve by it, provided they appear at the ſame Time to be unable to raiſe a ſufficient Support themſelves, muſt naturally be thought by the Society to be the propereſt Objects of their Charity. A Fund that is inſufficient to anſwer all Neceſſities for which it is wanted, muſt be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly huſbanded, that it may go as far as poſſible. Now it is evident that the Society may do all that is needful to ſupport Two Miſſions, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be equal Contributors with them, at the ſame Expence that would be neceſſary for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of one Miſſion, where the People are unable, or unwilling, to contribute; to ſay nothing of the greater Proſpect of Succeſs, in a Miſſion of one Sort than of the other. This accounts for the Multiplication of Miſſions in the Northern Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, beyond the Proportion that has obtained in North-Carolina; where the People made no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and uſed no Importunities, that could ſtand in Competition with thoſe that went home from theſe Colonies. To this may be added, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:012007_0200_0F8941296EBBD630"/>
Perſons could ſeldom be found, that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter upon Miſſions in North-Carolina. The Climate and the Circumſtances of that Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are generally eſteemed by <hi>Strangers</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable; and for Want of an Opportunity for an academical Education, but few of the <hi>Natives</hi> have offered themſelves as Candidates for holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Yet notwithſtanding theſe Diſadvantages, the Society have, for more than 30 Years paſt, found out Methods of ſending ſome Miſſionaries thither; and it appears by the laſt <hi>Abſtract,</hi> that they have now no leſs than <hi>Twelve</hi> Miſſionaries employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Colony. And while Strangers may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they have done ſo little, thoſe that are acquainted with their Hiſtory and Circumſtances, wonder that they have been able to do ſo much, as in Reality they have done, in North-Carolina.</p>
            <p>BUT the Miſrepreſentation goes ſtill farther. It makes the Society to have <hi>multiplied</hi> Miſſionaries, <hi>where there was little if any Need at all of them</hi>; while they have neglected thoſe Places where they were moſt needed. The Doctor undoubtedly thinks that there can be but <hi>little, if any Need at all</hi> of Miſſionaries, in thoſe Places where there are Preachers of the preſbyterian or congregational Claſs: But it is happy for the Members of the Church of England in theſe Colonies, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety govern themſelves by their own Opinion, and not by his. However, in one Senſe at leaſt, what he ſays but two Pages afterwards, is a full Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Society's Conduct, with Regard to New-England. For he aſſerts that the Miſſions there, <hi>are, by far the greater Part of them, in ſo weak and low a State, that there would be no Hope of their continued Exiſtence, if that Charity was
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:012007_0201_0F89412A2CB1A298"/>
withdrawn, which, at firſt, gave Being to them, and has all along ſupported them in Being.</hi> p. 131. The Society, it is hoped, will make a proper Uſe of this Information, which correſponds with the Accounts from the Miſſionaries: And it is not doubted but their Affection for the Churches to which they have <hi>given Being,</hi> and which are known ſtill to depend upon them for the neceſſary Support of it, will ſtrongly plead in Favour of them, and prevent their being deſerted, in this dependent, feeble State. In Time theſe Churches may become able to ſupport themſelves; and when this ſhall be the Caſe, they will ceaſe to be proper Objects of the Society's Charity. Whenever the epiſcopal Congregations in New-England ſhall appear to have arrived to that State, we may judge what the Society will do, from what they have done, in a like Caſe.</p>
            <p>IN South-Carolina, the Society were early in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing Miſſions. About 30 Years ago they had ten Miſſions in this Colony, ſupported at the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Expence of £. 450 Sterling. But as the Church there has become able
<q>to ſtand upon its own Legs, and without foreign Help to ſupport it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note n="§" place="bottom">See the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Landaff</hi>'s SERMON.</note>;</q>
the Bounty of the Society has been withdrawn, and at preſent they have but one Miſſionary in the whole Colony, and he is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed altogether among the poor <hi>Palatines.</hi> Let the Reader conſider this Caſe which is directly in point, and attend to what has been ſaid of the Society's Conduct relating to the adjoining Colony of North-Carolina, together with what will be ſoon ſaid of Nova-Scotia; and he will be able to form a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Judgment—whether they are diſpoſed, or
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:012007_0202_0F89412AECD26550"/>
not, to multiply Miſſions where there is but <hi>little Need</hi> of them, and to neglect thoſe Places which have <hi>moſt Need</hi> of them, as Dr. Chauncy very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently charges them.</p>
            <p>HE cenſures them for ſupporting Miniſters in Places, where the Congregations are able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, without any Aſſiſtance. But according to his own Account, there can be but very few ſuch Places in New-England. And it has never been fairly proved that the Society have done this, in a ſingle Inſtance. I know that ſeveral ſuch Inſtances have been pointed out by the Enemies of the Church; but the Congregations themſelves, which ought to be the beſt Judges of their own Abilities, declare the Caſe to have been otherwiſe, and the Friends of the Church believe their Declarations to be true. Whether it be ſo or not, the Society muſt judge according to the Evidence they receive; and it can hardly be expected, that the Teſtimony of their Enemies, in ſuch a Caſe, will weigh more with them, than the Teſtimony of their Friends, agreeing with the Declarations of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more immediately concerned.</p>
            <p>HE alſo accuſes the Society of having <hi>ſtrangely neglected Canada</hi>; and for Proof of it, refers to a Paſſage which clearly proves, that they have made that Colony the Object of their Attention. What he refers to, is an Abſtract of a Letter from Mr. Deliſle, Chaplain to the Garriſon at Montreal, dated Sept. 30, 1767. If the Society had been under no Concern for the religious State of Canada, they never would have publiſhed to the World the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of ſuch a Letter. It is probable that the Letter was ſent to them, in Conſequence of their
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:012007_0203_0F89412CEE5D1848"/>
Inquiry; as it contains partly a <hi>Notitia parochialis,</hi> ſuch as the Society require from their Miſſionaries. I know that they had the Subject under Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, before the Time that the Letter was dated. Although the Doctor ſpeaks of me, as a Perſon not having that <hi>Chriſtian Concern for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, which might have been expected from a Miſſionary</hi>; yet ſo early as in 1766, I joined with my worthy Brethren in CONVENTION, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the religious State of Canada to the Society, and in recommending it to their Attention. This was no great while after the Ceſſion of that Colony, by Treaty, to the Britiſh Crown.</p>
            <p>AT that Time, although ſomething was proper to be done in Favour of the proteſtant Religion in Canada; yet the Circumſtances of the Country did not require, nor would they with any Propriety admit of, ſo much to be done, as many People are apt to imagine. There were then but few Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Colony, that were Natives of it; and but few Engliſh People, except the Military; and thoſe few ſeated chiefly in Quebec and Montreal, where divine Service was regularly performed by the Chaplains of the Garriſons. If therefore Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries at that time had been ſent to other Places, it muſt have been in Order to proſelyte the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who were Papiſts, and Strangers to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Language. But the Papiſts would have been alarmed at ſuch an Attempt, when it was peculiarly neceſſary to quiet and compoſe their Spirits; and they would have conſtrued it to be a Violation of the Treaty of Surrender, which provided that they might continue to enjoy their Religion, without Moleſtation. It would therefore have been a very hopeful Project in the Society, to <hi>multiply</hi> Miſſions
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:012007_0204_0F89412D2CAD31E0"/>
in ſuch a Country, at ſuch a Time, and under ſuch Circumſtances. Eſpecially if it be conſidered, that in Order to ſend Miſſionaries to Canada, as the Society's whole Fund was already engaged, and no new Reſources appeared, they muſt have broken through their former Engagements, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved their Miſſionaries from other Places, where they were thought to be uſefully employed; or have diſcharged ſome of them, that they might be able to ſupport others in Canada—where there could be but little Proſpect of their Uſefulneſs, and where there was much Danger of their increaſing that Diſcontent, which required all the Skill of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to keep within Bounds.</p>
            <p>BESIDES: Had the Society been ever ſo able, and the Proſpect of Succeſs much greater than it was; it would not have been proper for them to croud Miſſionaries into Canada, as ſoon as its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Britiſh Crown was confirmed. It would have been <hi>decent</hi> at leaſt, to wait ſome Time, to ſee whether the Government, upon ſettling the <hi>Police</hi> of that new Colony, would not make ſome ſuitable Proviſion for the Encouragement and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the proteſtant Religion in that Diſtrict, ſo far as it ſhould appear to be expedient and proper. Until the final Reſolutions of Government were taken, and it was known that no Proviſion of this Kind was to be expected from thence, there are many Perſons that would have charged the Society with intermeddling in Matters out of their Province, and not treating their Superiors with proper Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, had they aſſumed the Management of the religious Affairs of Canada into their own Hands. On ſimilar Occaſions, where there have been new Acquiſitions of Territory, the Society was actually
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:012007_0205_0F89412DECC15620"/>
told, that it was irregular and improper for them to act, until the Deſigns of Government were known. I ſay not this at random, but upon the beſt Authority.</p>
            <p>SINCE the Society have thought the proper Time was come, for them to interpoſe in Behalf of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, they have not been inactive. Government has been ſollicited to ſend proteſtant Clergymen into that Country; in Conſequence of which, <hi>three</hi> are actually appointed, one for Quebec, one for Montreal, and a third (I think) for Trois-Riveirs— which are the only Places at preſent, in which much Advantage can be expected from Proteſtant Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen. The Society have alſo ſollicited for School-Maſters; and have already ſent conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Packets of Books, at their own Expence, into different Parts of the Province. As Opportunity and Ability will admit of, more will be done; and indeed every Thing that is practicable in Favour of the proteſtant Religion may be expected, from the Vigilance and Activity of that charitable and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body.</p>
            <p>WE may fairly judge of their Diſpoſition towards Canada, from the Care they have taken of Nova-Scotia. Not many Years ago, the religious State of that Colony was nearly the ſame, with what the religious State of Canada now is. And it appears from the <hi>Abſtracts,</hi> that the Society, although their Progreſs at firſt fell ſhort of their own Wiſhes, as well as of ſome People's Expectations, have in their Employment in Nova-Scotia no leſs than thirteen Miſſionaries and School-Maſters, at the yearly Expence of £. 495 Sterling, to ſay nothing of the large Sums annually expended in Books,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:012007_0206_0F89412EB2AB7B38"/>
&amp;c. By this Time I hope the Doctor begins to be aſhamed of the unrighteous Abuſe, with which he has treated a Society, that deſerves to be honoured, applauded and admired by the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>DR. Chauncy often ſpeaks of the Church of England in the Northern Colonies as inconſiderable, not worthy of Notice, and in a State little better than Non-exiſtence. And yet if we were to judge from the mighty Efforts that have been made to ſtop its Progreſs, and the Alarms it has occaſioned to the Bigots, we ſhould imagine that it had, not only the Rage, but the <hi>Strength,</hi> of a Lion, and threatened the ſpeedy Deſtruction of every other Religion in the Country. In his former Pamphlet he ſaid, that <hi>it has grown but little in Compariſon with the other Denominations</hi> in New-England. This I diſputed, and this he thinks proper ſtill to maintain. But among <hi>the other Denominations,</hi> that have thus increaſed in New-England, eſpecially in the Maſſachuſetts, he muſt not reckon his own, the <hi>Congregationaliſt.</hi> For Time was, when they not only claimed, but actually kept Poſſeſſion of that whole Dominion, to themſelves; and as other Denominations ſince have obtained Footing, the <hi>Congregationaliſts</hi> muſt have <hi>proportionably</hi> loſt Ground.</p>
            <p>AND here again I am obliged to <hi>uncover the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of my Anceſtors,</hi> for which the Doctor is anſwerable. In Order to maintain their excluſive Right to the Country, the Congregationaliſts tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as Criminals, ſuch as were found to retain an Affection for the Church; and the Quakers, that had the Luck to eſcape hanging, were baniſhed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012007_0207_0F89412F6CE702A8"/>
by them, on Pain of Death. I need ſay nothing of the latter, as their Hiſtory is well known: But I beg Leave to lay before the Reader, a Paſſage relating to the former, extracted from a valuable Book <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>New-England's Memorial,</hi> by <hi>Mr. Morton</hi>; who ſtyles himſelf "Secretary to the Court for the Juriſdiction of <hi>New-"Plimouth.</hi>"</note> which is now ſcarce, in which there appears to be no Partiality in Favor of the Church.
<q>Some of the Paſſengers, ſays he, that came over at the ſame Time (1629), obſerving that the Miniſters did not at all uſe the Book of Common Prayer, and that they did adminiſter Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper without the Ceremonies, and that they profeſſed alſo to uſe Diſcipline in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt ſcandalous Perſons, &amp;c. they began to raiſe ſome Trouble: Of theſe Mr. Samuel Brown and his Brother were the Chief, the one being a Lawyer, the other a Merchant, both of them amongſt the Number of the firſt Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, Men of Eſtates, and Men of Parts and Port in the Place. Theſe two Brothers gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Company together in a Place diſtinct from the public Aſſembly, and there ſundry Times the Book of Common-Prayer was read unto ſuch as reſorted thither. The Governor Mr. Endicot taking Notice of the Diſturbance that began to grow amongſt the People by this Means, he convented the two Brothers before him. They accuſed the Miniſters as departing from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of England, that they were Separatiſts, &amp;c. but for themſelves, they would hold to the Orders of the Church of England. —The Governor and Council—finding theſe two Brothers to be of high Spirits, and their Speeches
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012007_0208_0F8941302D14BDB0"/>
and Practices tending to Mutiny and Faction, the Governor told them that <hi>New-England was no Place for ſuch as they</hi>; and <hi>therefore,</hi> he ſent them both back to England at the Return of the Ships the ſame Year <note n="†" place="bottom">See the above-mentioned Book. p. 104.</note>.</q>
We ſee the Crime of theſe Men, and we ſee their Puniſhment. Their <hi>Speeches,</hi> becauſe they were in Favor of the Church of England, and their <hi>Practices,</hi> becauſe they made Uſe of the Liturgy, were interpreted as tending to <hi>Mutiny</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> It was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed, that <hi>New-England was no Place</hi> for ſuch People, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Churchmen; and then, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Right as original Patentees, nor their Abilities, nor Wealth, could ſcreen them from the Puniſhment of Tranſportation.</p>
            <p>BY theſe Methods, the Congregationaliſts kept the Country intirely to themſelves, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able while; and had not a general Toleration been introduced by the Authority of Government at home, it is impoſſible to ſay, how long it would have been, before any other Denominations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had been ſuffered to live among them. There may be ſtill ſome few of their Deſcendants, that have inherited the ſame Sentiments and the ſame Spirit; but, in general, the Times are now great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered for the better, in this Reſpect. Men of different Perſuaſions can live together in the ſame Neighbourhood, and maintain a friendly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one another, in a Country where none but Congregationaliſts were ſuffered to exiſt; and were it not for ſome hot-headed Leaders of the People, and ſome ſcribbling Incendiaries (I have no particular Reference to the Doctor) the Peace and Harmony of Society would not be diſturbed by
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:012007_0209_0F894130EE3934C8"/>
Difference of Principle. Epiſcopalians, Baptiſts, Quakers and others, have ventured to come into the Colony; many of the Congregationaliſts have adopted their Principles; and the reſt commonly entertain more favorable Sentiments of thoſe they differ from, than they received from their Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Although they have a Veneration for their Fore-Fathers, yet they are not ſo blind as to be unable to diſtinguiſh the Defects in their Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which Defects they think themſelves under no Obligations to vindicate. This candid Temper has been, as ſuch a Temper always will be, favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Church; and there are, at this Time, not leſs than 20 Churches actually built, and a ſtill larger Number of epiſcopal Congregations, in this <hi>anti-epiſcopal</hi> Province.</p>
            <p>AS to Connecticut, the Doctor allows the Church to have increaſed there, beyond the Proportion of other Denominations; but he affects to be of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that what I ſaid upon the Subject was <hi>hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,</hi> and beyond the Bounds of literal Truth. My Words were theſe:
<q>I cannot, at preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect an Example, in any Age or Country, wherein ſo great a Proportion of Proſelytes has been made to any Religion in ſo ſhort a Time, as has been made to the Church of England in the Weſtern Diviſion of that populous Colony; unleſs where the Power of Miracles, or the Arm of the Magiſtrate, was exerted to produce that Effect <note n="*" place="bottom">Appeal defended. p. 217.</note>.</q>
This was literally true at that Time; and as I could then recollect no ſuch Example, ſo none has occured to me ſince. If the Doctor knows of any, let it be pointed out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:012007_0210_0F894131AD2C3968"/>HE was pleaſed to repreſent the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in the Colonies as being in her <hi>Infancy,</hi> and ſo far from a <hi>State of Maturity, as to make it not worth while for a Biſhop to come here.</hi> And it was anſwered:
<q>Infant and feeble as She is, he has allowed that She may be 270,000 ſtrong in the Colonies, excluſively of the Iſlands, after reducing her Numbers as low as poſſible. Now can he poſſibly think, when he gives himſelf Time for Conſideration, that the Church of England in America, containing 270,000 Members, (beſides many Thouſands more in the Iſlands) in which are included moſt of the Governors and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Perſons in the Colonies, is ſo inconſiderable, that it is <hi>not worth while</hi> for a Biſhop to take Charge of it? Would he look upon an equal Number of any People upon Earth, however low in their Circumſtances, or however light when weighed in the political Balance, in ſo contemptible a Light <note n="†" place="bottom">Appeal defended. p. 218.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE replies, that when he ſpake in this Manner, he had Reference only <hi>to her Exiſtence in the Seven Colonies, extending from Pennſylvania</hi> to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. p. 152. I have again examined the Paſſage as it ſtands in his Pamphlet, and I ſee nothing that ſhews that he confined his View within this limited Compaſs. Beſides, he had no Right to anſwer a general Repreſentation of the Church in <hi>all</hi> the Colonies, by a partial Account of it as exiſting only in <hi>ſome</hi> of the Colonies. He might as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly have confined his View to the Province of Maſſachuſetts, or to the Town of Boſton only. The Plea for an Epiſcopate was made in Behalf, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> of 270,000 People in the Colonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012007_0211_0F89413271C31AF0"/>
many Thouſands in the Iſlands; and to ſhew the Invalidity of it, he urges that it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on Account of 26 or 27 Thouſands of that Number, according to the Calculations of his own Arithmetic—throwing more than nine Tenths of the whole intirely out of the Queſtion. This he may call <hi>reaſoning,</hi> but there is a more proper Name by which others will call it.</p>
            <p>HE acknowledges that <hi>the Governor, in moſt of theſe Colonies, is commonly in Name an Epiſcopalian</hi>; but he reſpectfully ſays, that they are <hi>ſometimes deſtitute of every Thing that looks like Religion.</hi> p. 153. Some Men can ſeize upon the ſlighteſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to "ſpeak evil of Dignities." I do not believe there is at this Time a Governor on the Continent, who pretends to be an Epiſcopalian, that has given any juſt Ground for this Reflection. Their Characters in general are irreproachable. Some of them are as eminent for their Virtues, as their Stations; the Examples, as well as Patrons, of whatever is amiable and excellent in private Life; the Ornaments, as well as Friends and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of Religion, But were it otherwiſe, their Rank renders them important, and gives a Weight to that religious Society, of which they profeſs themſelves Members.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor proceeds, in IAMBICS: <hi>It is quite remote from Truth to ſay, that moſt of the principal Perſons in the Colonies, are of this Perſuaſion, unleſs by principal Perſons are meant, thoſe who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to their civil Poſts from home.</hi> What was ſaid is moſt unqueſtionably true of the Colonies to the Southward of New-England, and probably true of the Colonies in general, <hi>excluſively</hi> of thoſe
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:012007_0212_0F8941332D176178"/>
Perſons that are appointed to <hi>civil Poſts</hi> under the Government. But why, in the Name of common Senſe, ſhould theſe be excluded? Does the Doctor imagine, that a civil Employment, held under the Government, <hi>degrades</hi> a Man from his former Rank and Character in Life? Such Ebullitions of an anti-monarchical Spirit ought, in Prudence, to have been ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>HE continues: <hi>In general there are</hi> 50 <hi>principal Perſons to one, in the non-epiſcopal Colonies, who are not Members of the Church of England, but of Churches of other Denominations.</hi> By the non-epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Colonies he means here, I ſuppoſe, as he explains himſelf elſewhere, New-England, New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania. In the three laſt-mentioned Colonies, the Gentlemen of Fortune and Character belonging to the Church of England, are, I believe, as numerous, as thoſe of all other Denominations, excepting the Quakers in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. And as to New-England, there are as many Perſons of Diſtinction belonging to the Church, (ſome ſay many more) in Proportion to the Number of Epiſcopalians, as of any other Profeſſion. But if we ſuppoſe the Proportion to be but equal throughout theſe Northern Colonies in general; then, in Order to make the Number of principal Perſons of other Perſuaſions 50 Times greater than of thoſe belonging to the Church, thoſe different Denominations muſt be 50 Times as numerous as the Members of the Church. Now the Doctor allows, that in theſe ſeven Colonies, there may be 27,000 Epiſcopalians: Conſequently, according to his Repreſentation, there muſt be, within the ſame Compaſs, 1,377,000 Inhabitants. But if the Number of Epiſcopalians is much
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012007_0213_0F894134D3DA8500"/>
larger, as it undoubtedly is, then the Inhabitants, from Pennſylvania to the Northward, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Canada and Nova-Scotia, can be but little leſs than 2,000,000. The notorious Falſehood of the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> argues a Defect in the Doctor's Premiſes.</p>
            <p>IN anſwering the <hi>Appeal,</hi> Dr. Chauncy had introduced a long Extract from one of Dr. Mayhew's Pamphlets, to which Mr. Apthorp had given a direct and particular Anſwer, whereof not the leaſt Notice was taken. This Conduct appeared to me to be extraordinary; and in ſpeaking of it I uſed the following Words:
<q>Was it treating his Readers generouſly, or fairly, or honeſtly, to preſent them with Dr. Mayhew's Objections, broadly hinting, although not directly affirming, that they had not been anſwered; when he muſt have known, that they had not only been anſwered, but that no Reply had been made to the Anſwer?</q>
He now ſays, that there was no Need of any Excuſe for ſuch Conduct. <hi>In Compliance with the Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given in the Appeal, my Buſineſs was, not to anſwer Objections, but to bring them that they might be anſwered by the Doctor.</hi> There is ſomething very curious in this Account of the Matter. He offered Objections that had been publickly refuted, without any Intimation that a Refutation had been attempted, becauſe it was not his Buſineſs <hi>to anſwer Objections.</hi> Would then his taking Notice that Mr. Apthorp had replied, have been <hi>an Anſwer</hi> to Dr. Mayhew's Objections? If ſo, although I never thought there would be much Difficulty in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the Work is more eaſy than I imagined. If it was not his Buſineſs to <hi>anſwer</hi> Objections; neither was it his proper Buſineſs to bring Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:012007_0214_0F8941357B205E28"/>
in that Manner, that had been anſwered. The Invitation in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> can be no Juſtification of ſuch Conduct, as it propoſed only
<q>a fair and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Debate.</q>
An Objection that has been ſhewn to be weak, is no better than a Fact that has been proved to be falſe. If the Weakneſs of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection has been only <hi>attempted</hi> to be ſhewn; it is ſtill upon the ſame Footing with a Fact that has been contradicted: And it is not 'fair and candid,' in ſuch a Caſe, to offer the Objection as ſound, without clearing it of the Imputation of being defective; any more than to aſſume the Truth of a Fact that is contradicted or denied, without clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of the Imputation of Falſehood. He thinks it was his Buſineſs to bring Objections to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by me: But the bringing ſuch Objections as he has often exhibited, looks more like an Amuſement of Idleneſs, than the proper <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of any Man, eſpecially of the Doctor's Character and Station. The Truth, I believe, is, that he hoped Mr. Apthorp's <hi>Review</hi> had eſcaped me, and that I was unable to anſwer thoſe Objections of Dr. Mayhew as effectually as Mr. Apthorp had done. Indeed he ſeems to have a ſtrong Deſire, that nothing which that Gentleman had written, in Vindication of the Church, ſhould be repeated or remembered. Such a careful and ſtudied Neglect of Mr. Apthorp, is the greateſt Honour that the Enemies of the Church can pay him.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the Doctor retired to make Room for Dr. Mayhew, he propoſed an <hi>Expedient</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe Matters between the Epiſcopalians and their Adverſaries. It was, that the King ſhould grant a Commiſſion to ſome of the Clergy here, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of a Biſhop. I told him his
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012007_0215_0F8941362CD76690"/>
Expedient wanted even Plauſibility.
<q>It can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer the Ends of Epiſcopalians, nor thoſe of the Projector and his Adherents. The Powers wanted by the American Church are <hi>purely of a ſpiritual Nature,</hi> which therefore the King cannot give: Such Authority as can be given by the King, is altogether <hi>temporal,</hi> which is the very Thing that the Diſſenters dread:—So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopalians nor Diſſenters can poſſibly acquieſce in the Expedient<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 220.</note>.</q>
In Reply to this, he only ſays, that if the Reader will examine what he ſaid relating to the Subject, he will be convinced, <hi>that under pretence of ſaying Something,</hi> I had <hi>really ſaid nothing.</hi> To ſo feeble a Reply, I ſhall not <hi>pretend</hi> to ſay any Thing. Therefore</p>
            <p>I SHALL paſs on to conſider the Reaſons aſſigned, for Dr. Mayhew's not replying to Mr. Apthorp. <hi>Neither he</hi> (Dr. Mayhew) <hi>or</hi> [nor] <hi>his Friends thought it</hi> (Mr. Apthorp's <hi>Review) worthy of ſuch Notice.</hi> This is but a poor Juſtification of any Man, from a Charge that lies againſt him. Others think, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as juſtly, that he made no Reply, becauſe he was afraid of the Conſequence. He had Senſe enough to know that it was Time to ſtop; I wiſh that ſome others may improve by his Example. Another Reaſon aſſigned for his not making a Reply is, that it was imagined that Mr. Apthorp, <hi>wrote principally with a View to recommend himſelf to a certain great Man, whoſe Favour might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to him.</hi> Were there no other Motives then, that could induce Mr. Apthorp to review a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy that he himſelf had occaſioned, and in which he had been ſo often mentioned on both Sides, than to recommend himſelf to the Favour of a certain
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012007_0216_0F894136F16BEAA0"/>
Superior? Or is there the leaſt Evidence that he was at all influenced by the Conſideration, whereby it is inſinuated that he was <hi>principally</hi> governed? How ungenerous then, how low and illiberal is it, to aſcribe to a Gentleman of his Character ſuch a mercenary Motive? If any one ſhould charge Dr. Chauncy with having written Two huge Pamphlets againſt American Biſhops, <hi>principally with a View to recommend himſelf to the Favour</hi> of ſome great Demagogue in the Town of Boſton, would he not think ſuch a Reflection unworthy of a Gentleman? And yet, I believe, the Evidence of this, both internal and external, is as clear and authentic, as can be produced againſt Mr. Apthorp. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Object this latter Gentleman might have had more immediately in View, it is nothing to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. His <hi>Review</hi> bore hard upon Dr. Mayhew's Performance; the Reputation of the latter, and of his Cauſe, was at Stake; and it concerned him to vindicate both himſelf and his Cauſe, as well as he could.</p>
            <p>BUT this he neglected to do, and Dr. Chauncy attempts it. And as I have occaſioned Mr. Apthorp to be brought into this Debate, in his Abſence; I eſteem it my Duty to repair, as well as I can, the Injuries he has ſuffered on my Account.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to Dr. Mayhew'<hi>s Obſervations</hi> had explained the Plan, on which only it had been propoſed to ſend Biſhops to America. Dr. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew allowed that the Propoſal was ſet in a more unexceptionable Point of Light, than he had ſeen it in before; but he objected to the Information, as not coming from ſufficient Authority. Yet at the ſame Time he appeared to believe, what is now
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012007_0217_0F894137ACCF0608"/>
univerſally known, that his Informer was no leſs a Perſon than the late Archbiſhop of Canterbury. To ſhew that the Plan there preſented to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, was no peculiar Scheme of the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> Mr. Apthorp declared that the ſame Plan had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by many Perſons of high Rank in the Church, and that all who appeared to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it, heartily approved of it—the Evidence of which he was ready to produce. Among others, Biſhop Butler had drawn up a Scheme for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Epiſcopate, in 1750: this was publiſhed as a Specimen, and it exactly agreed with the Plan contained in the <hi>Anſwer</hi>; and enough was ſaid, in all Reaſon, to ſilence Dr. Mayhew's affected Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. Nor does Dr. Chauncy offer any Thing, that ſhews the Impropriety of Mr. Apthorp's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>
            <p>INDEED he ſays of theſe Plans, that <hi>they are not to be looked on as Schemes ſet forth on the Foot of proper Authority.</hi> p. 157. All the Authority want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſufficient Evidence that ſuch an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate as was ſpecified, and no other, had been propoſed for the Colonies. But if by <hi>proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> he means that of the King and Parliament, what he ſays is true, but not to the Purpoſe. For the Queſtion was not, what Kind of an Epiſcopate was intended, or whether any was intended, by the King and Parliament; but what Kind of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate had been propoſed by thoſe that had taken the Subject into Conſideration, and were deſirous that Biſhops might be ſent to America. Now the Biſhops at home, and many of the principal Friends of the Church, both there and here, had agreed upon a Plan of an Epiſcopate for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, which was formed with a View of relieving
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:012007_0218_0F8941386E2FFD68"/>
the ſpiritual Neceſſities of the Church, without affecting the Liberties of others, or interfering with the civil Government; upon which Plan it always appeared probable that an Epiſcopate would be granted. That ſome Plan had been concerted, was commonly known; the Nature of the Plan, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> explained; and his Explanation Mr. Apthorp confirmed, proving it to have been fair and juſt. This is all that could be required or expected, as the Plan had not been preſented and recommended to the Government, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not be <hi>ſet forth on the Foot of</hi> the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of Government. If the only Plan that had been propoſed was unexceptionable, Men ought to have been ſatisfied; for nothing can be more abſurd than to oppoſe it, becauſe reaſonable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may be offered againſt ſome other Plan, that never has been propoſed for the Colonies.</p>
            <p>BUT the Doctor ſays: <hi>Whatever the Planners might intend or pretend, if ever an Epiſcopate is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively ſettled in America, it may be, for aught any of them all can ſay, upon a Plan very different from what they have propoſed.</hi> If the <hi>Antiepiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> had the Wiſdom to ſignify their Approbation of this, which in their own Conſciences they know can never hurt them, or the Diſcretion not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; there could be no Room to doubt, that whenever an Epiſcopate ſhould be <hi>authoritatively</hi> ſettled in the Colonies, it would be according to a Plan, that had been offered on one Side, and admited on the other, as unexceptionable. But what Alterations unreaſonable Oppoſition, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the vileſt Abuſes of the national Church, may occaſion, is more difficult to ſay: Although we ſtill hope, that Allowance may be made for
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:012007_0219_0F8941392CDE01F8"/>
Prejudices, and that no Reſentment of ſuch Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be ſhewn, when the Deſign for an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate ſhall come to be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We wiſh to give no Offence to others; we hope no juſt Offence will be ever given. We are willing to forget the Injuries we have received. We would avoid every Appearance that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Jealouſy; and we ſhould think ourſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Friendſhip and Confidence of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Denomination in the Colonies. As one Proof of this Diſpoſition, our cordial Conſent to, and our earneſt Deſire of, an Epiſcopate upon the Plan under Conſideration, are offered to the Public.</p>
            <p>OF this Mr. Apthorp ſpake, as
<q>ſuch a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and beautiful Plan of the moſt ancient and moderate Epiſcopacy,</q>
that it ought to remove the Apprehenſions and Scruples of the moſt Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious. The Doctor ſays it can be no juſt Plan of the ancient Epiſcopacy, becauſe the Biſhops are to have no Authority over the Laity. But as this Subject has been conſidered already, I have no Occaſion to repeat what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>DR. Mayhew had ridiculed, "with burleſque "Gravity," ſome Expreſſions in the Society's <hi>Abſtract</hi> of 1715, wherein Confirmation was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Mr. Apthorp remarked, that
<q>he well knows, or eaſily may, that we aſcribe no more Efficacy to the laying on Biſhop's Hands, than his Brethren do to the laying on of Preſbyter's Hands.</q>
Dr. Chauncy replies, that Mr. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp is miſtaken with Regard to this Point. For, ſays he: <hi>Do Epiſcopalians never ſpeak of an</hi> INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBLE CHARACTER <hi>as impreſſed by the Biſhop's Hand in Ordination?</hi>—implying, that the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſts
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:012007_0220_0F894139ED012DE0"/>
pretend to no ſuch Thing. I imagine the Doctor here ſpake without Attention or Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; for I am not willing to ſuppoſe, that he does not underſtand the Principles of
<q>his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</q>
They believe, or <hi>uſed</hi> to believe, that an <hi>indelible Character</hi> is, in ſome Caſes, conveyed by themſelves, as firmly as we do that ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ever given by our Biſhops. By an <hi>indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character</hi> is meant, a Character that continues through Life, and of which a Man cannot diveſt himſelf. Such, for Inſtance, is the <hi>baptiſmal</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which, in the Opinion of all that adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or receive it, can never be laid aſide. He that is once baptiſed, is always conſidered, in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as a baptiſed Perſon. Should he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the ſacred Character himſelf, ſhould he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize from Chriſtianity, or be excommunicated from the Church, yet his Baptiſm ſtill remains. For ſhould he return to his Duty, and give ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proofs of his Repentance, ſo that it would be thought proper to reſtore him to the Privileges of a Chriſtian, a new Baptiſm would not be required: The Reaſon of which is this, and can be this only, that the baptiſmal Character is conſidered as <hi>indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> This, I believe, is the Opinion of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationaliſts, as well as of others. The Caſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, in this Reſpect, is much the ſame with that of Baptiſm. According to good Information, there have been Inſtances in New-England, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters, that after a while have given up their ſacred Employment, and become perfectly ſecularized—purſuing, like other Perſons ſome of the common Occupations of Life—and afterwards have reſumed their eccleſiaſtical Functions; to which they have been admited, without Reordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a Proof that, in New-England, the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:012007_0221_0F89413AAC7823D8"/>
               <hi>ſacerdotal</hi> Character is alſo thought to be <hi>indelible.</hi> And indeed when that Character is once commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, why ſhould it be more circumſcribed, with Regard to Time, than to Place? Why ſhould it not continue with a Man as long as he lives, as well as accompany him wherever he goes?</p>
            <p>MR. Apthorp fairly concluded from Dr. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew's Performances, that he was not willing that Epiſcopalians in the Colonies ſhould have that Liberty, without which he and his Brethren would not be ſatisfied themſelves. In controverting this Point, Dr. Chauncy builds upon this rotten Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that the American Epiſcopalians have, in Reality, the ſame Liberty with other Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in all Reſpects; of which nothing farther is needful to be <hi>here</hi> ſaid.</p>
            <p>IT had been mentioned as one Advantage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from an American Epiſcopate, that the Clergy here would be under a proper Government. Dr. Mayhew treated this with his uſual Candor and Charity, inſinuating that the Epiſcopal Clergy in America peculiarly required to be "reduced to "Order." Mr. Apthorp anſwered, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was rather to be infered, from their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Deſire of ſuch an Epiſcopate. Dr. Chauncy does not deny the Juſtneſs of this Inference, nor diſpute but that the Clergy, who have petitioned for Biſhops, are <hi>unanimous, at leaſt in Appearance, in their Wiſhes to have them</hi>; but he ſtill comforts himſelf, that the Clergy in the Epiſcopal Colonies have not petitioned for, nor ſhewn themſelves to be deſirous of American Biſhops; and conſequently, that they have not given this Proof of their not being a <hi>diſorderly</hi> Set of People. How long this
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:012007_0222_0F89413B6C264AB8"/>
Conſolation is like to continue, the Reader may judge from what has been ſaid; and how much, in the Doctor's Opinion, the Reputation of the Clergy depends upon their petitioning for Biſhops, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Notice, as he undertakes to expreſs the Sentiments of his Brethren in general.</p>
            <p>THE Taſk of anſwering all the Objections and Cavils in the Pamphlet before me, is like that of teaching Children to read in their Primers; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much Time and Patience, and after all, the Profit is but inconſiderable. This Obſervation was naturally ſuggeſted by other Parts of the Doctor's Performance; but here, where a Reply to Mr. Apthorp is attempted, it forces itſelf ſo irreſiſtably upon me, that I am unable to ſuppreſs it. The Exceptions of our Author in general, appear to me to be ſo very weak and trifling, not to mention the almoſt perpetual Repetitions of what had been before ſaid, that I know not how to reconcile them with his reputed Judgment and good Senſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, amidſt theſe, there are a few Particulars that deſerve not to be intirely ſlighted.</p>
            <p>DR. Mayhew had objected againſt an American Epiſcopate, becauſe Biſhops had ſometimes proved to be ambitious and troubleſome. Mr. Apthorp anſwered, that "ſo are Preſbyters—too often;" and therefore Preſbyters might as well be excluded from the Colonies as Biſhops, on that Account. Dr. Chauncy replies: <hi>This proves nothing, unleſs he could have ſaid farther, that their Sphere of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence was equally extenſive, in Conſequence of which there was equal Danger, from their intriguing with great Men at home, or with Governors or principal Men here, of carrying into Execution ſuch Schemes as
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:012007_0223_0F89413D15890020"/>
might be greatly hurtful, both in a civil and religious Senſe,</hi> p. 163. Preſbyters muſt always be ſuppoſed to have <hi>ſome</hi> influence; and in Proportion to the Degree and Extent of it, this Objection is equally concluſive againſt them, as againſt Biſhops, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Apthorp's Argument: Nay, it will equally conclude againſt the Toleration of any Epiſcopalians at all, in Proportion to their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For the Principle is this—that wherever Men of other Perſuaſions are ſuppoſed to have an Influence, that may be uſed againſt the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts, the latter are to oppoſe their Exiſtence, at leaſt, in the ſame Country with themſelves, and to refuſe them the common Rights of Chriſtians: On which Principle alone the Oppoſition to the Biſhops of our Plan can be juſtified. The Influence of a Biſhop is undoubtedly greater than that of a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but the Influence of a Biſhop without any temporal Power, like thoſe in Queſtion, has never been eſteemed formidable in any Country. To object againſt ſuch, is like objecting againſt a Man's natural or acquired Abilities; and it may as juſtly be contended, that no Clergyman ſhould be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in America, whoſe Capacity exceeded a certain Size, or whoſe Learning exceeded ſuch a limited Standard. Suppoſing the Influence of an American Biſhop to be equal to that of Twenty Preſbyters; yet if there will be a Hundred Preſbyters in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to one Biſhop, then this Objection will have Five Times the Force againſt the Order of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as againſt the Order of Biſhops. If the Doctor would be aſhamed of the Objection in one Caſe, he ought not to urge it in the other.</p>
            <p>THE Unreaſonableneſs of the Objection farther appears, from what Mr. Apthorp juſtly obſerves,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:012007_0224_0F89413DB2FF5FC8"/>
viz. That the Temper of the Engliſh Biſhops is now, and has been for a long Time, ſuch, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no Room for Jealouſy, but intitles them to Confidence. The Doctor is not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this; eſpecially <hi>if it be true,</hi> as Dr. Mayhew had been informed, <hi>that High-Church Tory Principles are</hi> [have been] <hi>lately revived in England,</hi> p. 164. This Information may have been <hi>not</hi> true; and ſuch Principles may have been revived in England, and not countenanced by the Biſhops. The Biſhops at home may have embraced them, and yet Biſhops of other Principles may be ſent to America. Beſides, High-Church Principles (to uſe the Doctor's <hi>Cant</hi>) are not neceſſarily into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerant; and no Principles but thoſe of Intolerance are juſtly to be dreaded. That the Biſhops at home are Friends to religious Liberty, and diſpoſed, not to oppreſs, but to oblige the Diſſenters, the moſt conſiderable of the latter have candidly confeſſed. The late excellent Archbiſhop Secker was, in the Doctor's Phraſeology, a <hi>High-Flyer</hi> in his Principles; and yet he was as forward to do kind Offices to Proteſtants of other Principles, as they themſelves could reaſonably wiſh. An Inſtance of this Kind, and of the Chriſtian Temper and Generoſity of the whole Bench of Biſhops, that ought never to be forgotten, is publiſhed in his <hi>Life.</hi> In 1743
<q>his Lordſhip (then Biſhop of Oxford) received a Letter from Dr. Wiſhart, Provoſt of Edinburgh College, recommending to him his Brother and Mr. Wallace, Deputies from the eſtabliſhed Clergy of Scotland, to promote a Bill in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for providing a Maintenance for their Widows and Children, which many of them imagined the Biſhops would oppoſe. Dr. Secker paid them all the Civility, and did them all the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:012007_0225_0F89413E6CD16768"/>
Service he could. <hi>None of the Bench oppoſed their Bill</hi> either publickly or privately, and <hi>it was moved for by a Biſhop at each of its three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> in the Houſe of Lords <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Life</hi> of Archbiſhop Secker, by the Doctors, Porteus and Stinton, p. 25.</note>.</q>
The late Dr. S. Chandler, who was intimate with his Grace and ſeveral of the Biſhops, and knew them all, thought there could be no Danger from their Diſpoſition, nor from any other Quarter, that would juſtify an Oppoſition to the Epiſcopate of our Plan; and therefore, like a wiſe and honeſt Man, and a real Friend to religious Liberty, he freely ſignified his Approbation of it.</p>
            <p>DR. Mayhew objected, that ſuppoſing Biſhops ſhould be at firſt ſent in the Manner propoſed, yet there was no Certainty that they and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors would remain contented, very long, under ſuch Limitations. Mr. Apthorp replied:
<q>Who knows whether the New-Englanders will not hang Quakers—again,</q>
as, in one of their Colonies, they did formerly? This was a ſufficient Anſwer to ſo unreaſonable an Objection; eſpecially as Dr. Mayhew himſelf had adminiſtered an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the Poiſon of his own Argument, in theſe Words:
<q>It is readily owned, that our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of what may poſſibly or probably be the Conſequences of Biſhops being ſent hither, <hi>ought not to put us on infringing the religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our Fellow Subjects,</hi> and Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Mayhew's <hi>Second Defence,</hi> p. 69.</note>.</q>
But Mr. Apthorp proceeds:
<q>The Clergy of England are in general Friends to religious Freedom: The People of England, Whigs and Tories, are unfavourable to clerical
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012007_0226_0F89413F2F309CB8"/>
Power; and a far greater Danger than the Doctor's imaginary one, is, that of their laying aſide all Regard to the Chriſtian Miniſtry, in every Shape, and to Chriſtianity itſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Reader will obſerve, that the preceeding Objection does, in Effect, admit of an Epiſcopate on the preſent Plan; for it is made only on the Suppoſition that this Plan may be altered; and the poſſible or probable <hi>Alteration</hi> is its only Object. But of any material Alteration of the Plan we ſee no Probability. In this Country, we do not deſire it; at home, there appears no Diſpoſition to make it: And after a Plan of ſuch a Nature has been once put in Execution, eſpecially if Men on all Sides ſhall appear to have been ſatisfied with it, every Day will render an Alteration more difficult. The general Diſpoſition, as Mr. Apthorp obſerved, is friendly to religious Liberty: It is far more likely to increaſe than diminiſh; and therefore it is moſt probable, that no Alterations will be made, in this or any other Plan, that are unfavourable to the religious Rights of any Denomination of Chriſtians. Upon this general Diſpoſition of our Superiors, which is a Security to others, we alſo depend—for the full Enjoyment of the Inſtitutions of the Church in the Colonies; in Order to which, an Epiſcopate is abſolutely neceſſary. An Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate therefore we claim, as one of the common Rights of Chriſtians, and as Subjects of a free Government. Every Oppoſition to our Claim is an Infringement of religious Liberty; we cannot but look upon it in this Light ourſelves, and we doubt not but the Government, when the Subject ſhall be taken into Conſideration, will look upon it in the ſame Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="unknown:012007_0227_0F89413FEE1D0DC0"/>TO the foregoing Repreſentation of Mr. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp, the Doctor replies: <hi>All this being taken for granted, yet</hi> MAY <hi>not Times alter, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions change?</hi> p. 165. This is bringing the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment back, from Probability to Poſſibility. If the general Diſpoſition is more favourable to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Liberty than it ever has been, Appearances are on the ſide of religious Liberty. <hi>Times</hi> do not eaſily <hi>alter</hi> in ſuch Reſpects. A national Character is not ſoon loſt; Changes of <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> unleſs it falls into the Hands of Foreigners, ſeldom affect it. There can be no greater Security to any Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or Right, than that the Sentiments and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Public are known to favour it. To object therefore the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> that the beſt Security may fail, ſhews the Situation and Temper of our Adverſaries. Their Situation is ſuch, that, for Want of plauſible Objections, they are obliged to uſe thoſe that are monſtrous and ſhocking: And their Temper is ſuch, that they are determined, at any Rate, to oppoſe our Enjoyment of equal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges with themſelves. They clearly diſcover, that they will never conſent to our having an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate in any Form, by oppoſing one in the moſt unexceptionable Form that can be mentioned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Doctor has conſented that we may have Biſhops from the Moravians; but he may as well retract this, as his other Conceſſions. And if our Plan had been to have Moravian Biſhops, he would probably have contended as furiouſly againſt them, as againſt thoſe that have been requeſted.</p>
            <p>HE urges, in the Words of Dr. Mayhew: <hi>We are certainly more ſure againſt Oppreſſion</hi> (by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) <hi>in the Abſence of Biſhops, than we ſhould be if they were once fixed here.</hi> It appears then, as I
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:012007_0228_0F894140ACE54170"/>
have juſt obſerved, that no other Security will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy ſome People, than our having no Biſhops at all. However, as there is no Probability, hardly a Poſſibility, that ſuch an unreaſonable Oppoſition ſhould prevent it, it concerns them to conſider the following Words of Mr. Apthorp:
<q>They (Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) <hi>may</hi> ſoon be ſent, and with much greater Authority than is aſked for them now; and perhaps <hi>with ſome</hi> RESENTMENT <hi>of the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to them before.</hi>
               </q>
Should this be the Caſe, which I hope it may not be, the blind and impetuous Zeal of theſe Sticklers againſt Biſhops, may in ſome Meaſure excuſe, but it can never atone for, the Miſchief they will have occaſioned to their own Party.</p>
            <p>MR. Apthorp proceeds:
<q>Engliſh Diſſenters, who have Six and Twenty Biſhops eſtabliſhed among them, fear no Harm from them. Why then ſhould the New-England Diſſenters fear any, if one or two ſhould be eſtabliſhed, with much leſs Power, in one or two neighbouring Provinces?</q>
The Doctor replies, that if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters at home <hi>fear no Harm</hi> from the Biſhops, yet they <hi>ſuffer</hi> it. <hi>They are, and ever will be, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Circumſtances; unleſs the Eſtabliſhment of the Church of England is diſſolved, or greatly altered.</hi> p. 166. Whatever they ſuffer from the national Eſtabliſhment, is here charged to the Account of the preſent Biſhops. But did they make the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment? Is it in their Power to alter it? Or if it was, would it be right in them to give up the legal Advantages of that Church, with the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of which they are intruſted, before they find it to be agreeable to the Generality of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Indeed were thoſe Advantages founded in
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:012007_0229_0F8941416D92F248"/>
the Oppreſſion of other People, the Biſhops ought in Duty to uſe their Influence that the Oppreſſion might be removed. But the Engliſh Diſſenters feel themſelves to be not oppreſſed; and many of them are ſenſible of the peculiar Mildneſs and Moderation, not only of the Biſhops, but of the national Eſtabliſhment. No Diſſenters from the eſtabliſhed Religion in any Country on Earth, have leſs Reaſon to complain of their <hi>ſuffering Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> than thoſe in England. If the Doctor has Reference to what they contribute for the Support of the parochial Clergy, excluſively of Tithes, it amounts to but a Trifle; and what they pay in Tithes, is not, nor has it ever been, any Part of their own Property, as was ſhewn in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> If he refers to their Excluſion, from civil Offices under the Government; many of them find Ways to evade the Law, ſo that the Excluſion, in Effect, is far from being general. But were it univerſal, their <hi>Suffering</hi> would conſiſt only in not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to certain political <hi>Favors</hi>; Favors which are not granted them, on Account only of their known Diſpoſition to abuſe them, to the Injury of the national Eſtabliſhment. In the mean Time, they have every Indulgence that is requiſite to the full Enjoyment of religious Liberty. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to exerciſe their own Form of eccleſiaſtical Government—they are allowed to ordain their own Miniſters (Privileges which the Epiſcopalians in America ſtill want, and may for ever want, with the good Will of ſome People)—they are allowed to worſhip God in their own Way without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol—they are allowed to make Proſelytes, if they can, from the national Church—and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding certain Statutes and Canons, they are not reſtrained by the Government from publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:012007_0230_0F8941422CFBE650"/>
the national Eſtabliſhment, to the Mildneſs of which they are indebted for theſe Indulgences. After all this, they can have no great Reaſon to complain of their <hi>ſuffering Circumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DR. Mayhew pretended to be apprehenſive, that the Biſhops propoſed might be ſupported by a Tax upon the Colonies. Mr. Apthorp anſwered, that until a proper Maintenance could be otherwiſe provided, none would be ſent; as was evident from Biſhop Butler's Plan, with which all the others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. Here Dr. Chauncy ſeems to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; and he ſays in Reply, or rather inſtead of a Reply: <hi>It is not poſſible any one ſhould have a Conception of the Pertinency, Force, and</hi> ELEGANCE <hi>of the Doctor's Objection, as ſet forth at large in his reaſoning upon it, by reading only this curſory, ſlighty, and, I may ſay, triflng Anſwer to it.</hi> p. 167. Here is a new Quality aſcribed to Objections. I have heard of elegant Expreſſions, and elegant Compoſitions; but of <hi>elegant Objections</hi> I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before heard. It ſeems then, that as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may be <hi>pertinent</hi> and not <hi>forcible,</hi> or <hi>forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and not <hi>pertinent,</hi> ſo an Objection, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>forcible</hi> nor <hi>pertinent,</hi> may ſtill be <hi>elegant</hi>; and on that Account be worthy of Attention. Mr. Apthorp, I believe, confined himſelf to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>Pertinency</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> without thinking it worth while to attend to the ELEGANCE, of the Objections before him. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor goes on for three or four Pages more, in his Controverſy with Mr. Apthorp—<hi>nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at here and there a Sentence which he is pleaſed to pick out</hi>; but he ſays nothing of any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012007_0231_0F894142ED0B5F40"/>
nor does he introduce Dr. Mayhew as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing of Conſequence, that has not been fairly obviated in the Courſe of the preceding Pages. Although I am tired of the Drudgery I have undergone, yet I beg Leave to aſſure the Reader that my Reſolution continues, to paſs by nothing that can deſerve his Notice: But after his Kindneſs, in accompanying me thus far through a diſagreeable Road, I think it would be ungenerous to detain him with Trifles, eſpecially when he is ſo near to the End of his Journey. I ſhall <hi>therefore</hi> paſs over what has been farther offered in Reply to Mr. Apthorp; and examine what remains, relating more immediately to myſelf; which conſiſts almoſt intirely of Repetitions, and partly of double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, of what has been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>AND nothing worthy of Attention appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to p. 173. I had ſaid:
<q>Our Claim is, that we may be upon an equal Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the other religious Denominations in America. In Order to this, it is neceſſary that we be allowed the Enjoyment of our <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Conſtitution, in the ſame compleat Manner as it is enjoyed by them.</q>
The Doctor replies, that ſuch a compleat Enjoyment of it, is not agreeable to <hi>the propoſed Plan</hi>; for that it muſt be attended with <hi>ſpiritual Courts, and the Exerciſe of epiſcopal Authority in the ſame preciſe Way and Manner that has been eſtabliſhed by King and Parliament.</hi> But this is a manifeſt Perverſion of very plain Language. The Word <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> has two Meanings: In a ſtrict Senſe it means what belongs to the Church originally, as a ſpiritual Society, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the State. It alſo means, in a larger or laxer Senſe, whatever belongs to the Church; and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012007_0232_0F894143AD1C5ED0"/>
includes all thoſe external Circumſtances and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, which the Church may receive from the civil Authority. Theſe two Senſes are materially different; and when the Word is evidently uſed in one of them only, it is unfair and ſophiſtical to interpret it in the other. The Plea for the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate in Queſtion, from the very Beginning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Epiſcopalians in America as a religious Society; and what was aſked or propoſed in Favor of it, was <hi>purely</hi> of a ſpiritual or <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the firſt and ſtrict Senſe of the Word. The <hi>Appendages</hi> added by the Government to the ſame Church in England, were never conſidered as any Part of its real Subſtance, or as eſſential to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Conſtitution, even there. The Church has a Conſtitution of its own, given it by its divine Founder, which continues the ſame, both in Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and Adverſity, whether favored or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Powers of the World; and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor knows, that it was the compleat Enjoyment of this Conſtitution only that was ſpoken of. To talk therfore of ſuch <hi>ſpiritual Courts</hi> as have been erected in England, and ſuch Modes as have been eſtabliſhed by the civil Authority, as Parts of our <hi>eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution,</hi> is a poor quibbling with Words, and utterly unworthy of a fair Diſputant.</p>
            <p>ALL that was claimed as a Right, in Behalf of the Epiſcopalians in America, amounted only to a Toleration—ſuch a Toleration as ſuffers the Church to exiſt here 'in all its Parts.' The like Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made of this Expreſſion; for the whole Tenor of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and the <hi>Defence</hi> of it, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Meaning to be, all its <hi>eſſential</hi> Parts, or all its Parts conſidered barely as an eccleſiaſtical Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, unallied with the State. To countenance the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:012007_0233_0F8941446C755900"/>
Abuſe, the Doctor has added, in Capitals, IN ALL RESPECTS; as if I had inſiſted, that the Church ſhould not only be allowed to exiſt here
<q>in all its Parts,</q>
but <hi>in all Reſpects as it does in England.</hi> But as I did not uſe the Expreſſion myſelf; ſo I ſaid nothing that could juſtify the Doctor's Uſe of it, in ſuch a Manner.</p>
            <p>HE next introduces, once more, a <hi>State-Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,</hi> which has been already conſidered; and on which therefore I ſhall not enlarge in this Place. He contends that the Epiſcopate propoſed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implies ſuch an Eſtabliſhment; and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of arguing is recommended to the Attention of ſuch Readers as are fond of 'Curioſities.' <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Biſhops,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall have no Authority over the Laity;—their ſpiritual Courts muſt not be held in this Part of the World;—and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are to be confined in their Power within certain preſcribed Boundaries. How is all this to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed? Muſt there not be the Interpoſition of the State? Can it be affected in any other Way?—And what is this, in real Meaning, but an Eſtabliſhment?</hi> p. 176. I know not that the Interpoſition of the State is at all neceſſary, in Order to the compleat Execution of our whole Plan. If it be neceſſary, it is only to limit and circumſcribe the Authority of the intended Biſhops. Such an Interpoſition is properly a <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> and not an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi>; and the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Toleration</hi> may, with much greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, be called an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the various tolerated Sects, in England. I cannot conclude this Remark without obſerving, that if the Doctor will have a Language peculiar to himſelf; if he will uſe Words in ſuch a Senſe as no Mortal ever uſed them before him; he ought to publiſh a
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:012007_0234_0F89414588809ED8"/>
               <hi>Gloſſary,</hi> wherein the Singularities of his Phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy are carefully explained.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now conſidered every Thing in Dr. Chauncy's Pamphlet, that could with any Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, be brought before the Public, as worthy of Notice. I have attended to the <hi>Pertinency</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> although not to the ELEGANCE, of all his Objections againſt an American Epiſcopate, on the Plan of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> as well as againſt the Church of England, and the truly venerable Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel. I am not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that I have miſrepreſented his Sentiments or his Arguments in any Inſtance. I have paſſed over nothing, becauſe I found it difficult to be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. And if I may be allowed to expreſs my own Opinion, it is clearly this, that all he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered relating to theſe ſeveral Subjects, is either weak or impertinent; and if this has not been ſhewn, to the Satisfaction of the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I am greatly miſtaken. Indeed the Doctor ſpeaks of his own Performance with high Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and with ſtill higher Confidence, of his own Abilities. He ſays that I have not written in ſuch a Manner, <hi>as to give</hi> him <hi>an Opportunity for the</hi> TRIAL OF STRENGTH. p. 178. Such a <hi>Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> I have not met with, ſince I was a School-Boy. He may conceit himſelf to be an <hi>Hercules</hi>; but in this Pamphlet however, he appears, like the real Hercules at the Court of Omphale, to have acted unworthily of ſuch a Character.</p>
            <p>HE <hi>intended,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>to have come to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> HERE (by not concluding <hi>here,</hi> but) <hi>by preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Reader, in one View, the Sum of what has been ſaid on both Sides, that he might the more
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:012007_0235_0F89414728F55A00"/>
eaſily make a Judgment in the Caſe.</hi> But he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by what he calls <hi>a Matter of much greater Importance, the Treatment of the Preſbyterian Church at New-York, in Relation to the Charter they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for.</hi> This he thinks ſufficient to ſpread <hi>an Alarm</hi> through <hi>all the Colonies on the Continent, giving them ſolemn Notice what they may expect, ſhould Epiſcopalians ever come to have the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Influence.</hi> And he gives a partial Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Affair, contraſted with the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Boſton Aſſembly in paſſing an Act, in Conſequence of which, the Church of England in the Maſſachuſetts receives Benefit.</p>
            <p>THE Diſappointment of the Preſbyterians in New-York, with Regard to a Charter, he had mentioned in his former Pamphlet; and enough was ſaid in Anſwer, to ſhew that they have, upon the whole, no great Reaſons for Complaint. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, it was obſerved, in the <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> that
<q>it was the Belief at home, that the Church of England had been treated with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Malevolence, by ſome of thoſe very Perſons whoſe Names were annexed to the Petition. It was therefore not unnatural to ſuſpect, that any additional Power put into the Hands of ſuch Perſons, would, as Opportunity ſhould offer, be exerted againſt the Church.</q>
If nothing farther could be ſaid, yet ſo long as this was <hi>believed</hi> to be the Caſe, whether juſtly or not: it was of itſelf a ſufficient Reaſon—not for abridging the religious Liberty—but for not enlarging the Power, of the Preſbyterians in New-York. And yet Dr. Chauncy takes not the leaſt Notice of this Obſervation, nor of any Thing I ſaid relating to the Subject; but ſounds a falſe Alarm to all the Colonies, to prepare
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:012007_0236_0F8941476C583410"/>
for a Defence, againſt the oppreſſive Deſigns of the Church of England.</p>
            <p>BUT the Refuſal of Favors by the Government, to particular Perſons who had made themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Government, by a ſuppoſed ſcurrilous Abuſe of the national Eſtabliſhment, which ought always to be treated with Decency, is no Proof of the ill Temper of Epiſcopalians, nor an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Unwillingneſs of Government to grant Favors to other Perſons, although of the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Denomination, that have not diſcovered the ſame Diſpoſition:—Much leſs does it prove any Deſign, to deprive ſuch Perſons of any Privileges, of which they are in fair and legal Poſſeſſion. If the Conduct of the Preſbyterians in New-York has been miſtaken, or miſrepreſented, let it be made to appear. If they, or their Friends, can prove, or make it probable, that they have not publickly vilified and abuſed the national Church, and that they have been free from all ſecret Intrigues and Combinations againſt it; in my Opinion, they, as well as other Proteſtants, are intitled to all Favors from the Patrons of the Church, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Safety, or the Conſtitution. But on the other Hand, if they are conſcious of their own evil Intentions and Practices againſt the Church of England, and know that ſome of them have been actually diſcovered; it is ſurpriſing that they can expect, much more that they can have the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to aſk, particular Favors, to the granting of which, the Conſent of thoſe, who regard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Honor of the Church, is neceſſary. I will not enter farther into the Conduct or the Caſe of the Preſbyterians in New-York. Let them but clear themſelves of the Charges and Suſpicions
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:012007_0237_0F894148325427C0"/>
with which they are loaded; and then, if any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Favors are refuſed them, barely on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their religious Principles, the Diſſenters throughout the Colonies will have juſt Reaſon to expect the ſame Treatment, and not before.</p>
            <p>AS to the above-mentioned Act of the Boſton Aſſembly, it ſhews, according to the Doctor's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, a Generoſity that is highly commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy of Imitation. As I am unwilling to entertain any unfavorable Suſpicions in ſuch a Caſe, I ſhould not queſtion the Fairneſs of the Repreſentation; were it not that the Doctor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs ſo unmercifully in the <hi>Act,</hi> and takes occaſion from it to vilify and abuſe the Church of England. I ſhall <hi>therefore</hi> take the Liberty to obſerve, that the chief Object in View, was evidently to favor certain <hi>Paſtors and Deacons,</hi> and not the Church— and that, although the Church was benefited, yet <hi>if</hi> the Clauſes in its Favor were inſerted, as ſome ſuppoſe, in Order to ſecure to the Bill a Paſſage through all the Branches of the provincial Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a Confirmation in England, the Favor was granted on mercenary Principles, and the Merit of the <hi>Act,</hi> in Point of Generoſity to the Church, is nothing at all. Whether this, or any other private Advantage, was the prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, with the Boſton Aſſembly, for favoring the Church of England, the Doctor probably knows; and <hi>if</hi> it was, others know, that the <hi>Act</hi> deſerves not the Praiſe that he aſcribes to it.</p>
            <p>AS the Doctor was diverted from his <hi>Intention</hi> of ſuming up <hi>what had been ſaid on both Sides</hi>; in Order partly to ſupply his Omiſſion, I will conclude,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:012007_0238_0F894148ECAD4950"/>
with a ſhort Account of the Riſe, Progreſs, and preſent State of this Controverſy.</p>
            <p>IT began with the <hi>Appeal to the Public,</hi> which was made in Behalf of the Epiſcopalians in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, amounting, in the Colonies and Iſlands, as was believed, to near a Million of People. While every other Denomination of Proteſtants in the Britiſh Dominions had an unreſtrained Enjoyment of their reſpective Syſtems of eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and could perform within themſelves all thoſe religious Offices and Acts which their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples required; it was thought to be a great and very extraordinary Hardſhip, that the American Epiſcopalians, in Communion with, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of, the national eſtabliſhed Church, ſhould continue to ſuffer for Want of the like Privileges —which they could not enjoy without reſident Biſhops.</p>
            <p>THE Diſadvantages they were under, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered under the three Heads, of Ordination, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Confirmation. As to Ordination, they were unable to obtain it for their Candidates without ſending them to England, with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and Danger to their Perſons, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Loſs of Time. The Expence of ſuch a Voyage, was known to be often more, and ſeldom leſs, than £. 100 Sterling to each Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. The Danger of it was ſuch as had actually produced a double Decimation of the Candidates, Ten out of Fifty-Two, who at that Time had gone home from the northern Colonies, having pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in and by the Voyage; not to mention ſeveral others, that have been deprived of their Liberty, and dragged into miſerable Captivity,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:012007_0239_0F894149ACF85828"/>
where, for a long while, they ſuffered all that could be ſuffered, in Priſons and Dungeons. Under the next Head, it was ſhewn, that the Clergy of an epiſcopal Church cannot be properly and regularly governed, without Biſhops; and that the Influence of an Epiſcopate, at the Diſtance of England from America, can be but little better, in this Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, than none at all. It was alſo made abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evident, that the general Reputation of the Church in the Colonies, and the Proſperity and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of particular Congregations, greatly depend upon an American Epiſcopate. As to Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Practice of the Apoſtles, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which has always been appropriated to Biſhops; the Church of England eſteems the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ariſing from it to be great and important, and the Want of them muſt be proportionably affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its Members.</p>
            <p>IN Order that theſe peculiar Diſadvantages of the Church of England in the Colonies might be removed, it was requeſted that Biſhops might be allowed to reſide in America. But as in moſt of the Colonies, the Epiſcopalians were intermixed with a larger Number of People of different reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principles, the Impropriety of ſuch an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate here as was eſtabliſhed in England, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious on all Sides. It would naturally abridge ſome of the religious Liberties, of which the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Denominations in the Colonies had been long and fairly in Poſſeſſion; and this probably would be attended with Diſcontent and Clamor, and might be productive of unhappy Conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="unknown:012007_0240_0F89414A6D9FF268"/>TO guard againſt theſe Inconveniencies, a Plan for an Epiſcopate had been formed, that was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to the Circumſtances of ſuch a Country; and by the Execution of which it was imagined that the ſpiritual Neceſſities of the Church of England in the Colonies might be relieved, while no Harm could be done to other Chriſtians; and no juſt Cauſe of Offence would be given. The Biſhops propoſed were to have no temporal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and conſequently to hold no Courts for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it—they were to have no Juriſdiction at all over any of the Diſſenters, but to govern the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy only—they were to have no Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Colonies in any Form—they were not to interfere in any Matters of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to be confined to the Exerciſe of their ſpiritual Functions only. This general Plan had been honored, at home, with the Approbation of all the Patrons of an American Epiſcopate, for a long Courſe of Years; it had been cordially adopted by all the Clergy in the Colonies, and their Friends, that had attended to the Subject; and many Petitions in Favor of it had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to our Superiors in England.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Matter was thus in Agitation, and before it ſhould proceed farther, it was thought by the Clergy of the united Convention of New-York and New-Jerſey, that it would be received as a Proof of their upright and candid Intentions, if an Account ſhould be <hi>publiſhed,</hi> by their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſeting forth the Neceſſity of an American Epiſcopate, explaining the Nature of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate propoſed, and aſſuring the Public that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was deſigned againſt the Liberty or Property of any Kind of People whatever:—And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was appointed to perform this Service. He
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:012007_0241_0F89414B2D2144B8"/>
executed the Truſt repoſed in him with ſuch Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as he had; and he was certainly <hi>faithful</hi> in the Diſcharge of it. At the ſame Time he ſtudied to give no Offence to any Denomination of Chriſtians; and, as he had Occaſion to mention any of them, he treated them always reſpectfully. The Nature of his Work led him to conſider ſuch Objections againſt an American Epiſcopate, as he had heard of, or ſuppoſed might be naturally made, by Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of different Views and Intereſts; and all ſuch as occurred to him were carefully conſidered, and, as he thought, ſhewn to be groundleſs. However, as he knew that others might be of a different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if any were diſſatisfied with what had been ſaid, or had any new Objections to offer, they were invited to ſignify it, and
<q>to propoſe them in ſuch a Manner, that they might be fairly and candidly debated, before the Tribunal of the Public.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Appeal</hi> was publiſhed: And what ſhortly after enſued on the Occaſion, what inflammatory periodical Papers and Pamphlets <note n="*" place="bottom">The aboveſaid <hi>periodical Papers,</hi> with the periodical <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> to them, have been collected and reprinted by Mr. <hi>Holt,</hi> in 3 Vols. 8vo. and are to be ſold at his Printing-Office in New-York; the aboveſaid <hi>Pamphlets</hi> never will be reprinted.</note> from different Quarters, were iſſued in Anſwer to it, is well known. An Alarm was ſounded throughout the Colonies, that a general Invaſion of their religious Liberty was projected—the Minds of the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace were inflamed, by Arts that were wicked and infamous—the Church of England, the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Biſhops, and the Clergy of our Convention, were ſhamefully abuſed in the common News-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers—and a double Portion of the Abuſe naturally fell upon the Author of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> However un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:012007_0242_0F89414BEE40E1A0"/>
and undeſerved a Reception his Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion met with from ſome People, he was reſolved notwithſtanding to take it patiently, and carefully to obſerve whatever might be ſaid by his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that might deſerve Attention, and in due Time to reply to it.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the Publication of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objections againſt an Epiſcopate here, and the chief Source of Men's Diſaffection towards it, were theſe Two; that in Conſequence of ſuch an Appointment, they ſhould become ſubject to the Payment of <hi>Tithes,</hi> and to <hi>ſpiritual Courts</hi>; of which they had met with tremendous Deſcriptions.</p>
            <p>THE Caſe of Tithes, which was generally miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, was therefore carefully explained; and it was proved, that Tithes in England which are not paid to the Biſhops, but to the parochial Clergy, are claimed by Virtue of an ancient Gift, whereby they were made the Property of the Church— that in this Country, as no Tithes had been given to the Church, none could be demanded; and were it otherwiſe, that they would belong to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and be as recoverable without an Epiſcopate as with—and as to the propoſed Biſhops, that a Fund in England was raiſed for their Support, and that no Part of their Maintenance was ever intended to be drawn from the Americans. The Subject was placed in ſo clear and convincing a Light, that none of my Opponents have inſiſted upon the Objection. The Point has been given up on all Hands; and People in general are intirely eaſy on this Account, being abundantly ſatisfied, that they ſhall be ſubject to no Inconvenience for the <hi>Support</hi> of ſuch an Epiſcopate, as has been requeſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="unknown:012007_0243_0F89414CAC128050"/>AS to ſpiritual Courts, the Plan abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all Foundation or Pretence for them. For if the Biſhops are to exerciſe no Authority over any but the epiſcopal Clergy, none but the Clergy themſelves can be brought into their Courts; and neither the Laity of our own Communion, nor any People of other Communions, can be injured in this Reſpect. All that has been ſaid in Oppoſition to this Evidence, has been either trifling or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>WHEN it was found that nothing of Conſequence could be objected againſt the Plan itſelf, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that ſuch a Plan was never intended to be put in Execution, but that a different Epiſcopate was really deſigned; and Dr. Chauncy intimated, that he had diſcovered ſome Secrets that would juſtify the Charge. He was called upon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Evidence of any Kind, that the Friends of an American Epiſcopate acted deceitfully, and to lay before the Public his pretended <hi>Secrets</hi>; but in his <hi>Reply,</hi> he very ſagaciouſly takes Care to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the Matter: And, conſidering his Diſpoſition and Situation as a Diſputant, it is from thence as certain as any Demonſtration in <hi>Euclid,</hi> that he could ſay nothing to the Purpoſe. And here it may be proper to repeat, what was ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Objection, in my former <hi>Defence.</hi> p. 265.
<q>Important as it is, it has nothing more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid to depend upon than malevolent Conjecture; for whatever may be their (our Opponents) Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, every Reader knows that they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto intirely failed in the Article of <hi>Proof.</hi> On our Side, the ſtrongeſt Evidence that the Nature of ſuch a Caſe will admit of, has been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Public. We have produced, as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Society's anniverſary Sermons, their
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:012007_0244_0F89414E52484088"/>
Abſtracts, and indeed all that has been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Subject, by ſuch as could be ſuppoſed to underſtand the Caſe, for half a Century paſt; all which, without one Exception, teſtify in our Favor. We have added our ſolemn Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which muſt have a Weight proportionable to what is allowed to our Characters. The Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of our Vouchers is clear and expreſs, uniform and conſiſtent, and directly to the Point; while not one counter Evidence has appeared, on the other Side, to weaken it. To the Weight of our Declarations nothing has been oppoſed, but ungenerous Reflections and pretended Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT has alſo been contended, that in Caſe the preſent Plan ſhould at firſt be actually put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; yet the Danger is great, that, in Time, it may degenerate into an Epiſcopate that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome and oppreſſive. But nothing has been ſaid, that proves more than the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of this, and which might not as fairly be objected againſt the moſt harmleſs or uſeful Inſtitution, that was ever propoſed. If it could be made <hi>probable</hi> that ſuch an Alteration would enſue, as would be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to others; we would give up the Proſecution of our general Deſign. For we mean nothing that is unfriendly to any human Creature:—We deſire nothing more for ourſelves than that harmleſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which we wiſh all others to enjoy, and which all the other Proteſtant Subjects, and many Popiſh ones, of the Britiſh Empire, actually do enjoy. But
<q>we ſee not the leaſt Probability of this (prognoſticated Alteration) and we abſolutely deny that any ſuch Thing is intended: So far from it, that the Friends of the Church would even join with its Enemies, were that neceſſary,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:012007_0245_0F89414EECA7E280"/>
in guarding againſt it. All the Aſſurances, all the Evidences, all the Securities, which we have in our Power to give to prevent Uneaſineſs, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to offer; and all that is not beneath the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Government to give, we are willing to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icit. We want not an Epiſcopate on the Footing of a <hi>State-Eſtabliſhment</hi>; we deſire no more than a compleat Toleration, which we have not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and thereby to be raiſed to an Equality with other religious Denominations in the Colonies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Appeal defended,</hi> p. 266.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER theſe ſeveral Heads, all the Objections that have been offered directly againſt the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in Diſpute, may be fairly reduced. The Church of England, and the Society for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel, have been violently forced into this Controverſy, and <hi>violently</hi> treated; but every Thing that has been ſaid againſt either one or the other, in Caſe it could have been ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, has no more than an oblique and remote Relation to the Biſhops in Queſtion. All the Objections of this Kind, that have not been given up, have been brought before the Public in the preſent <hi>Defence,</hi> and moſtly in the Words of my Opponent, and diſtinct Anſwers have been given; ſo that what real Strength they contain, the Reader is now able to judge.</p>
            <p>AND here I beg Leave to obſerve, that, whatever may have been attempted in Oppoſition to our <hi>Plan,</hi> nothing that is plauſible has been offered, and but little has been attempted againſt our Plea for an Epiſcopate of <hi>ſome</hi> Kind. It has not been ſhewn, nor can it be ſhewn, that going to England for Ordination is not as expenſive, and has not been productive of as many Deaths, as was urged in the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:012007_0246_0F89414FB20F6E00"/>
               <hi>Appeal.</hi> It has not been ſhewn, nor can it be ſhewn, that ſuch a Burthen and ſuch Loſſes are not Grievances, which all other Denominations of Chriſtians in the Colonies, were it their own Caſe, would think intolerable. It has not been ſhewn, nor can it be ſhewn, that the Epiſcopalians in America ſhould everlaſtingly be doomed to bear Burthens, from which all others are exempted. In a Word, it has not been ſhewn, nor can it be ſhewn, that they ought not to be admitted to an equal Enjoyment of religious Privileges with other Chriſtians, although many of thoſe Privileges are inſeparable from an Epiſcopate.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, it wants not to be ſhewn, that they have never done any Thing, whereby the common Rights of Chriſtians are forfeited. Their general Principles and Conduct are ſuch, and have been ſuch, with Regard to the Public, as can juſtly occaſion no Diſtinction to their Diſadvantage. They are, at leaſt, as friendly to Liberty, both civil and religious, as any of their Oppoſers. They are 'equal to the foremoſt,' in Loyalty to the King, and Submiſſion to the Government.</p>
            <p>AND while their Pretenſions and Claims are as fair, in all Reſpects, as thoſe of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, there are ſome Circumſtances in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which, in Addition to their common Right, render it impoſſible, in their Opinion, that they ſhould be finally diſappointed. They conſider themſelves as Members of that Church, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of which peculiarly harmoniſes with the civil Government of the Nation, and which is therefore intitled to the peculiar Affection of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They conſider our gracious Sovereign as their Defender and Patron, by Duty as well as
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:012007_0247_0F8941506C65DC28"/>
by Inclination. They conſider that the Nation in general has given to the Religion they profeſs, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Proofs of Eſteem and Preference at home; and therefore cannot conſiſtently treat it worſe than all other Religions abroad. And they conſider, that there never was an Inſtance, in any Age of the World, or any Nation on Earth, in which ſuch a reaſonable and moderate Requeſt would have been refuſed, to ſuch a Body of People, in ſuch a Situation, and in ſuch a Relation to the national Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>THEY cannot therefore but flatter themſelves, that, notwithſtanding the unreaſonable and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oppoſition they have met with, an Epiſcopate will be granted them on the Plan that is propoſed, which they think much the fiteſt for this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that, ſo far as the Interpoſition of Government may be requiſite, it will not be refuſed. If any diſtinguiſhing Favours were requeſted, if any Dominion or Superiority over others were aimed at, it would intirely alter the Caſe. But, as was ſaid in the <hi>Appeal</hi>:
<q>The Church of England in America—<hi>only</hi> requeſts, that proper Remedies may be provided for her preſent Sufferings.— She wiſhes for nothing, which ſhall be thought inconſiſtent with the Rights and Safety of others. She aſks nothing but what has been granted to others, without any ill Conſequences; and ſhe relies on the common Affection and Juſtice of the Nation, to raiſe her to this Equality. And whether there be any Thing preſumptuous or unreaſonable in theſe Expectations, let Heaven and Earth judge!</q>
