            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Fundamentall.</hi> In the year 1670. In his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth &amp;c.</hi> pa. 6. he deny's the [Expreſs] knowledge and belief of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s taking upon him the form of a <hi>Man,</hi> and his <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> therein, to be abſolute <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> unto Salvation; where it hath <hi>not</hi> been revealed to them.</p>
            <p>But again in the year 1689. in his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant</hi> pa: 113. he Saith It may be very ſafety concluded that the <hi>Expreſs</hi> knowledge and faith is abſolutely and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſary, unto the <hi>finiſhing</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> of a mans Salvation.</p>
            <p>About this time he ſeem'd very bigg with his <hi>Revolution</hi> Notions whereby great ſtreſs is laid upon the [EXPRESS] knowledge and belief of the outward Coming and <hi>Suffering</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001144_0012_0FB08B6F1963D120"/>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh &amp;c. Se the 200. Queries pa. 37. the writing whereof he hath owned himſelf, in this <hi>Countrey</hi> to be concerned in; and ſe alſo his faint <hi>Defence</hi> when charged with it. <hi>Truth</hi> and Innocency pa. 3. But before the publication of that book I could never yet find that he would own that <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> Knowledge and belief to be abſolutely neceſſary, where it was <hi>Not Revealed;</hi> But thoſe <hi>Notions</hi> making that <hi>Faith</hi> and knowledge feaſible to all <hi>Nations,</hi> &amp; to all the <hi>Heathens, Infidels</hi> &amp; <hi>Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that have departed this Life, from the beginning of the World, by being born again in <hi>Chriſtian Nations,</hi> where theſe things are <hi>Preached</hi> and believed; I find he hath not onely in the ſaid 200. <hi>Queries</hi> Inſinuated his whimſicall <hi>Imaginations</hi> of the <hi>Revolution</hi> of humane Souls: But likewiſe in divers parts of his ſaid <hi>Indep.</hi> and <hi>Preſbiter,</hi> Couched the ſame; Sep. 100. 102. 103. 105. and alſo in ſome other books, by him publiſhed about that time as his (pretended) <hi>Antidot,</hi> pa. 98. 104. 105. 109. 110. a <hi>Refutation</hi> &amp;c. pa. 40. 43. 44.</p>
            <p>But again in the year 1692. When he might eaſily perceive his <hi>Revolutioniſm</hi> was not like to take with the <hi>People,</hi> he then deny'd that [Expreſs] knowledge to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſave to thoſe to whom it is revealed, <hi>Truth</hi> and Innocency pa. 10. 17.</p>
            <p>So that with G. K. in the year 1670. the EXPRESS Knowledge &amp;c. was NOT neceſſary, where not revealed. In the year 1689. the <hi>Expreſs</hi> knowledge &amp;c. was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and INDISPENSIBLY NECESSARY, and round about again, in the year 1692. &amp; ſince, the <hi>Expreſs</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp;c. was NOT unverſally <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> yet he would

have us believe he is not Chang'd in his <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, in his <hi>Truth</hi> and Innocency pa. 10. G. K. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys the <hi>Diſtinct</hi> as well as EXPRESS knowledge to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally neceſſary; but in page 106, 107. of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Antidot,</hi> he accounts that <hi>Religion,</hi> where Chrisſt, (as Com in the fleſh) is not diſtinctly preached; is but ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> had, before <hi>Peter</hi> preached Chriſt unto him: And ſuch Religion (ſaith he) is, perhaps, not unfittly by ſome call'd <hi>Deiſm:</hi> And that ſuch is the firſt part of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Creator,</hi> but not <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> From all which, as well as from his affirming, in the <hi>Year</hi> before, the <hi>Expreſs</hi> knowledge to be neceſſary, it's obſerveable; that in the years (89) and (90), when poſſibly he might have ſome hopes, the <hi>Revolution</hi> Doctrine might have taken footing, Then again both the [diſtinct and <hi>Expreſs</hi>] knowledge was neceſſary; Becauſe without the firſt mens beſt <hi>Religion</hi> was but <hi>Deiſm,</hi> and not <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Laſt, mens <hi>Salvation,</hi> was imperfect; But then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the <hi>Year</hi> (92.) when he had ſo greatly differed with our Friends, about theſe matters, and his <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Notions had taken ayre; but not like to take Root in the <hi>People,</hi> and we begun to Confront him with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer books; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> then, neither the <hi>[Diſtinct]</hi> nor the <hi>[Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs]</hi> Knowledge was univerſally neceſſary; but then comes forth the new <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> that tho' neither the <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> nor <hi>[Diſtinct]</hi> knowledge was neceſſary: Yet there is an <hi>[Implicit]</hi> knowledge that's UNIVERSALLY neceſſary; —What Strange Worke's here ?

               <hi>Some Short Obſervations</hi> upon H. M. his <hi>Remarkes</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my book of <hi>Immediate</hi> Revelation.

                  <g ref="char:endq">”</g>unto them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now compare all theſe things with his late <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of the knowledge, and faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> without, <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally]</hi> in Order to <hi>perfect</hi> Juſtification and <hi>Salvation,</hi> (Se <hi>Truth</hi> and Innocency in ſeverall places) and ſe if he be not <hi>Varied?</hi> And note, this is about one of thoſe four <hi>Fundamentall</hi> Principles, That at <hi>Turners Hall</hi> he accuſed us of denying. Se Exact Narrative p. 14.</p>
            <p>But now we Expect to be atteſted by <hi>G. K.</hi> as he did <hi>John Pennington,</hi> in his <hi>Antichriſts</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> pa. 24. for calling this diſtinction of [<hi>Expreſs</hi> and Implicit] a late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; For, ſaith he, it's an antient diſtinction, and Sufficiently <hi>Implyed</hi> in my Oldeſt books, and though he mentioned the term <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> and did not Expreſs the term [Implicit] yet it was really underſtood by him, as (ſaith G. K.) the Term <hi>[Iure Divino]</hi> implies the other term of the diſtinction when not Expreſſed viz. <hi>[Iure Humano]</hi> ſo the term <hi>[Expreſs] Implies</hi> the other term <hi>[Implicit]</hi> tho' not Expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>G. K.</hi> hath contrived a way (as he thinks) to make out the matter, and to prove, that he <hi>always</hi> held, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001144_0016_0FB08B81B0D6F5D0"/>
the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Outward,</hi> was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> neceſſary to <hi>Salvation;</hi> and that he <hi>allways</hi> underſtood, the Term [EXPRESS] to Imply the Term <hi>[Implicit]</hi> But I ſhall now evidently ſhow, that this could not be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his former books, without ſuch great <hi>Contradiction</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as, I am apt to think, ſuch a man as he, would be very unwilling to be found guilty of; For if he underſtood in his former bookes that the Term <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> implies the Term <hi>[Implicit]</hi> then in <hi>Presb.</hi> and <hi>Indep.</hi> p. 111. he Saith. <q>It's certain, at that time when the <hi>Angel</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:startq">“</g>was ſent to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he had <hi>no [Expreſs] Knowledge,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:endq">”</g>nor <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified.</q> Now if he underſtood the Term <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> Implied the Term <hi>[Implicit]</hi> then <hi>Cornelius</hi> had, at that time when the <hi>Angel</hi> was ſent to him, <hi>Some</hi> knowledge of <hi>Chriſt Crucify'd &amp;c.</hi> And yet about ſeven lines lower he ſaith, <hi>Cornelius</hi> when the <hi>Angel</hi> was ſent to him, had <hi>no Knowledge</hi> nor <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again in p. 113. ib. Saith he <q>It may be very ſafely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,<g ref="char:startq">“</g> that the <hi>[Expreſs]</hi> knowledge, &amp; faith of <hi>Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> of abſolute <hi>neceſſity,</hi> to the <hi>beginning</hi> of mans <g ref="char:endq">”</g>

That if they ſhould hear (after his arrivall in <hi>England)</hi> that he Preached amongſtt he <hi>Independants</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they ought not to call him an <hi>Apoſtat</hi> for that; but if ever he put on the <hi>Canonicall-Robe</hi> (that is Prieſts <hi>Gown)</hi> then they ſhould call G.

               </p>
               <p>To ſumm up the matter in ſhort, and ſo come to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſince a man may be an <hi>Apoſtat,</hi> tho' he doth not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatiſe from the <hi>Whole</hi> Faith, and ſince G.

Thus preſſing the matter, anſwer was made him; that the <hi>Houſe</hi> was our <hi>Own,</hi> and we ought not to be <hi>Diſturbed:</hi> Then he <hi>Pretended,</hi> he had as much to do there as we; Then we deſired to ſe his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; upon which he again call'd to the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> that they might <hi>Compell</hi> the <hi>People:</hi> The <hi>Juſtices</hi> anſwer was, The <hi>Deputy Governour</hi> was there; Then he applyed himſelf to him, who told G.

That it was our <hi>Previledge</hi> to <hi>Enjoy</hi> our <hi>Meetings Peaceably</hi> and agreeable to that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> where all had enjoyed that favour near <hi>Sixty Years.</hi> Notwithſtanding G.

K. with others went to the <hi>Governours,</hi> houſe, and there read that which he called his Power from the <hi>Biſhop</hi> I ſuppoſe of <hi>London</hi>) it prov'd onely a <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Recomendation;</hi> the Summ whereof was, that Mr. K. had been an Inſtrument to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001144_0050_0FB08BED0445FA98"/>
bring many Souls to <hi>God,</hi> and deſired he might be kindly treated in theſe parts: And yet <hi>G.</hi> K. had ſtill the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to continue his applycations to the <hi>Governour,</hi> to force the Way to the <hi>Meeting-houſe,</hi> and to order that he might have a hearing there; G. K. pretending he could <hi>Open</hi> or <hi>Lock up</hi> our doors as he Pleaſed; but the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> abſolutely <hi>Refuſed</hi> to gratify him therein; ſaying, he would do nothing by force: Then he deſired the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> Leave that the <hi>Juſtices</hi> might <hi>Aſſiſt</hi> him: which he alſo prudently <hi>Refuſed;</hi> but at laſt <hi>Granted</hi> him Leave, to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>meet in the Court-houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus G.

K. hath retracted what he formerly held, about <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> yet theſe <hi>Learned Mens</hi> skill in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is ſtill in force againſt him, unleſs he could prove, that they have retracted alſo; And further; ſince <hi>Infants-Baptiſm</hi> is no <hi>Commandment</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as any where to be found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor Practiſed till the third Age or <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it's therefore evident, that it was brought in, and continued by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>Again, he could <hi>once</hi> ſay, in pa. 88. of <hi>Way Caſt up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </hi> And ſuppoſe, that were true; does it therefore follow, that three <hi>Perſons</hi> are not three <hi>Subſtances?</hi> According to his former ſentments? And yet again, obſerve a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ibid, he ſaith, that all <hi>Created beings</hi> are improper to

expreſs this <hi>Miſtery;</hi> though I find nothing Produced by him to expreſs it: But <hi>Properties,</hi> and <hi>Created beings,</hi> as <hi>Perſons, Perſonall,</hi> dementions of <hi>Length, Bredth,</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of a body &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fundamentall-Truths</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> again he could ſay, that ſet <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp;c. were not uſed in the <hi>Church</hi> till upward of 300 Years after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which plainly ſhews them alſo, to be but <hi>Commandments</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Man.</hi> Yet now he can ſay for them; and uſe very weak Arguments to prove them to boot; ſe <hi>Quakers Stand.</hi> pa. 389. 391.</p>
               <p>Again, for G. F's being accuſed, for ſaying. <hi>He was Equall</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> and that the <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> he could once ſay, and <hi>Juſtifie</hi> G.

               </p>
               <p>Again, he could ſay, ſince he was Separated from <hi>

               <p>Again, now he hath a mind to it, he can ſay, that the whole method propoſed by the ſame <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Apology,</hi> is a mean ſham, of <hi>Deiſm</hi> or naturall <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Again in his <hi>Presbiter.</hi> and <hi>Indep.</hi> pa. 7. when ſpeaking of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> not being properly the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> he could ſay, that (according to the <hi>Greek</hi>), the term [Word] mentioned in <hi>Theſe</hi> 1.5. ſignifies <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Talke</hi> or diſcourſe: But in his Reaſons for <hi>Renouncing Quakeriſm</hi> pa. 16. he can ſay that by that very term <hi>Word,</hi> in that very place now, is, meant <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in his <hi>

               <p>But now he can ſay in pa. 11 of his <hi>Retraction</hi> book, that that very text is to be underſtood, as he was <hi>Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Crucified;</hi> and but conſequently of his <hi>Inward</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: <hi>(Note)</hi> this is the Man, that is ſo much <hi>Valued</hi> by ſome, for his skill in the <hi>Languages.

               <p>Again he could ſay in <hi>Quakers Stand.</hi> p. 507. <q>that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert<g ref="char:startq">“</g> Barclay</hi> and himſelf, held all the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that were <hi>Fundamentall;</hi> called <hi>The Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter Credenda;</hi> and yet but a few lines Lower, he could ſay, that they both ſaid and writt many things repugnant and <hi>Contradictory</hi> to the ſame; at leaſt <hi>Indirectly</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, [and in the next page,] he ſaith, that whatever their defaults were they acted not againſt their Perſwaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Again in his <hi>Quakers Stand,</hi> pa. 476. <q>he can ſay, tho' <g ref="char:startq">“</g>falſly and craftily, that <hi>Robert Barclays</hi> method of arguing againſt unlawfull <hi>Games,</hi> unprofitable <hi>Plays</hi> and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluety and vanity of <hi>Apparell</hi> &amp;c. was chiefly againſt the abuſe and exeſs of thoſe things; and therefore he would <g ref="char:endq">”</g>not contend with him about them; obſerve;</q> this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great and willfull abuſe upon <hi>Robert Barclay.</hi> to render him, as if he was not againſt the uſe of <hi>Games, Plays, Sports</hi> Superfluety and vanity in <hi>Apparel</hi> &amp;c. But
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001144_0061_0FB08C0914831558"/>
only againſt the abuſe of them, whereas, in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Particularly, in pa. 515. he tells us in plain words, that it is not Lawfull, to uſe them. It's very like, G. K. had a reach here to ſave his Creditt, in thus giving the goe-by, to <hi>Robert Barclays</hi> weighty Arguments, againſt thoſe things, leaſt he ſhould have offended the moſt Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, on the one hand, or thoſe, who are not ſo on the other hand.</p>
               <p>I would not willingly miſtake G. K. but really, I can not inmagine, what elſe ſhould occaſion him, thus ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to ſtretch the Point, by abuſing R. B. but be it as it will, we ſe he can ſay, and write very falſe and uncred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, when he has a mind to it. For thus he could once ſay, as in this book, and plead, that the <hi>Experſs Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Sufferings &amp;c.</hi> is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, except where it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>Again, he could ſay, that the <hi>Expreſs Knowledge &amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Abſolutely</hi> and <hi>Indeſpenſibly Neceſſary.</hi>

accuſation; for where did I ever take, or go about to take W.

P. had in his book called the <hi>Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Shaken,</hi> called <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Finite Impotent Creature:</hi> The place was page 20; but now I am apt to think, he ſees, that neither the place nor matter will hold water; and ſo is fain to ſlip over to page 21, where poſſibly he may fancy, he can make a noiſe with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there, a little to amuſe the Reader; for in the ſaid 21 page, when W. P. was arguing the point, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference by other ſort of arguments, than he did in page 20, there he aſſerts that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>Finite,</hi> and therefore could not as ſuch ſatisfie <hi>Infinite Juſtice,</hi> which thing the <hi>Prieſts</hi> alſo acknowledged, as I ſhewed in D.

P's Vindicating him; I have always underſtood it, to intend only particular Commands, ſuch as to <hi>Baptize,</hi> Preach the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> or as when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were ſent forth to <hi>Preach;</hi> they were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001144_0074_0FB08C314E9EB8B8"/>
Commanded to provide neither <hi>Gold</hi> nor <hi>Silver,</hi> nor <hi>Braſs</hi> in their <hi>Purſes</hi> Matt. 10.9. and as where <hi>Chriſt</hi> bid the <hi>Young-Man</hi> go his way, and ſell whatſoever he had, and give to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and he ſhould have Treaſure in <hi>Heaven</hi> Mark 10.21. Now I ſuppoſe, neither D. L. nor G. K. does underſtand this laſt <hi>Command</hi> to be binding upon them, any more than the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, nor do they believe (I ſuppoſe) that where <hi>Chriſt Commanded</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to waſh each others feet, from the Example of his Waſhing their feet, as he then ſaith, I have given you an <hi>Example,</hi> that ye ſhould do, as I have done to you, ſe John 13.14.15. And altho' this was ſo then Required of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>Practiſed</hi> afterwards in the <hi>Church;</hi> even in <hi>Tertullions</hi> time, as will be ſeen by and by; yet I ſuppoſe, few <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> of any ſort, if any at all, looks upon this binding u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, and that it was ſuch particular <hi>Commands</hi> that <hi>Edward Burough</hi> meant, and in which W.

I Challenge, (ſaith he) to find an <hi>Example</hi> for it, they were oblidged every one by their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and then explains his meaning thus; one was ſent to <hi>Baptize,</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> another was ſent not to <hi>Baptize:</hi> But to <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Goſpell &amp;c.</hi> Therefore why ſhould W.

               <p>SInce the above book was Printed, I have ſeen D. L's book, called THE REBUKER REBUKED &amp;c. which I ſuppoſe he intended as an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to my book, called DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIEL LEEDS <hi>Juſtly Rebuked &amp;c.</hi> Tho' in his <hi>Title Page,</hi> he calls his book A <hi>Brief Anſwer to</hi> CALEB PUSEY's <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s Pamphlet,</hi> Intituled, A <hi>Rebuke to</hi> DANIEL LEEDS &amp;c. Whereas, I never writ any book under that <hi>Title;</hi> but this is not the <hi>Firſt</hi> time D. L. has ſtumbled at the threſhold, and this is all the uſe I intend to make of this his blunder, and ſhall let the <hi>Reader</hi> know, that as to the ſubſtance of what's materiall in his ſaid book, it is ſufficiently ſpoke to, and Anſwered in my ſaid book; and in the foregoing <hi>Poſtſcript:</hi> In the firſt, his firſt Challenge to me, my Letter to him in Anſwer thereto, and his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack</hi> Challenge, (all mentiond in his Preface) is ſet down <hi>Verbatim; And</hi> my obſervations thereon, together with the Scriptures preduced by <hi>William Penn,</hi> and his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them, which evidently makes out, that W. P. by thoſe words, [The <hi>Finite Impotent Creature</hi>] meant it of us Sinners, that needed Forgiveneſs, but not of the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that never Sinned: To which ſaid <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> I refer the <hi>Reader,</hi> for his ſatisfaction in Generall, as alſo in particular; about what D. L. ſays in this book of Lies and Perverſions, he pretends he hath met with in my book, and of his not meeting me, according to my Letter to him, and that about the eight <hi>Miniſters</hi> atteſting to the Truth of G. K's <hi>Quotations,</hi> and of his pretending the want of timely notice to meet me; and about his chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

men of his own party, and about W. P's owning <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man to be <hi>Finite,</hi> and about my not meeting him at <hi>Burlington,</hi> according to his <hi>Almanack</hi> Challenge, and about the three ſorts of Arguments W. P. made uſe of; all which is ſufficiently ſpoke to in my aboveſaid <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript;</hi> but note, I ſaid nothing in the ſaid book of <hi>Three</hi> diſtinct <hi>Heads,</hi> as D. L. very falſly renders me, and ſays I tell a Deceitfull Story of <hi>Three</hi> diſtinct <hi>Heads;</hi> and then Vaunts upon his man of Straw, and ſays, as if W. P. wanted this <hi>Millers</hi> help, to draw this matter into heads, and Tails, ſe his pa. 7. where he quotes me pa. 19. but I affirm there is no ſuch words, as Heads and Tayls either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But in his <hi>Preface</hi> he ſays, that he came to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> the twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> to meet this <hi>Champion</hi> C. P. (viz.) according to his (D. L's) Challenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, but I alſo obſerve, in his page eight he ſays, he could never believe I would accept of his Challenge; and indeed I know not how he ſhould expect it: Becauſe it was upon ſush unreaſonable conditions; as firſt, that I muſt not chooſe <hi>Quakers;</hi> ſecondly, that I muſt have one <hi>Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> his hand, that I deſigned to meet him. Beſides I muſt give him two Months notice beforehand of it; which notice (for reaſons in p. 19. of D. L. <hi>Juſtly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked</hi>) I never gave him; therefore he had reaſon enough to conclude, I would not be there; ſo that it ſeems his boaſt of his coming to meet a <hi>Champion</hi> at <hi>Burlington,</hi> is to be underſtood, that he was firſt ſatisfied, he would not be there.</p>
               <p>As for what he ſays of <hi>Samuell Richardſon</hi>'s threatning to lay him in <hi>Goal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001144_0095_0FB08C6FB6A234C0"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That D. L. never gave the Authority or <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> any juſt occaſion to deal with him, I can't avouch for him: But this I can truly ſay, I never knew of any deſign among us ſo to deal with him.</p>
               <p>As for what he ſays in pa. 9. about <hi>Robert Youngs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſomewhat of me, about the eſtate of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Croſe,</hi> I do ſay, that according to the utmoſt and beſt recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Memory that I can make, I remember nothing that ever <hi>Rob. Young</hi> ſaid to me about it. And why did he not ſet down, when and where it was, what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and what was my Anſwer? In pa. 8. he ſays. I let's him know my deſign was to chooſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> which was contrary to the terms of his challenge; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my intentions was deceitfull, and only to Mock him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I appeal to the candid <hi>Reader,</hi> whether this be not an abominable Abuſe upon me, for he owns in his <hi>Almanack</hi> Challenge, that thoſe words [not <hi>Quakers</hi>] were left out in the printed Copy; and being ſo, which way did he think I ſhould know what was in the manuſcript; therefore what ſilly Idle ſtuff is this charge of his; and as ſilly and Idle is it in him, where in p. 9. he tells us of a Maxim, (but poſſibly of his own deviſing) to witt, who ſo Labours to prove a thing to another, himſelf diſtruſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Does he ſo; then ſurely D. L's Friend G. K. who hath ſo long Labour'd to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> muſt himſelf diſtruſt it. And where D. L. himſelf hath Labour'd ſo hard to prove the aboveſaid charge againſt <hi>W. Penn,</hi> that he himſelf diſtruſt's it. And poſſibly this might drop from him at unawares, as ſome product of his own experience, for he hath certainly given occaſion to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001144_0096_0FB08C70F2BF9B90"/>
Suggeſt ſuch a thing of him.</p>
               <p>Well again I take notice, that in his pa. 10. Since I find he can't charge it as an Errour in <hi>W. Penn,</hi> for terming <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man <hi>Finite,</hi> without bringing G. K. and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Guilty too, he ventures upon a great Falſhood, and ſays, he did never bring it againſt W. P. as falſe D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctrine, neither dared he to call it Blaſphemy, (viz.) <q>I affirm <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Impotent;</hi> whereas, in his book ſtyled NEWS <hi>of a</hi> TRUMPET: So highly Magnified by himſelf; he tells us that <hi>W. Penn;</hi> BLASPHEMOUSLY calls the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Finite Impotent Creature;</hi> ſe his page where his No: 58. is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well here is plainly ſeen D. L's evident partiality to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for it ſeems when he would father it (as he falſly renders it) upon <hi>W. Penn,</hi> ſo to affirm, then it ſeems it muſt be called by D. L. <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> but now he being ſhown wherein G. K. and the Prieſt's, own as much as he would faſten upon <hi>W. Penn,</hi> now he ſaith, he dare not call it <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> Oh! the perſidiouſneſs of the Man.</p>
               <p>Again, Laſtly in the ſame page, he aſſerts another great falſhood, where he ſays, I confeſs it, (meaning W. P's words) as charged by him D. L. which is utterly falſe, for I never confeſt any ſuch thing; for tho' I never deny'd but owned that W. P. in pa. 21. of <hi>Sandy Foundation Shaken,</hi> termed <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Man <hi>Finite,</hi> yet I always did, and do ſtill ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny D. L. his charge, (viz.) that in page 20 <hi>W: P:</hi> uſed ſuch ſlighting and Irreverend expreſſions, as to call the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Impotent Creature.</hi>
