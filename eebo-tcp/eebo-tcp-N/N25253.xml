            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TREATISE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE prevalance of the Yellow Fever, as it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denominated, in many of the ſea port towns of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, has naturally excited the attention of every claſs of citizens, and drawn forth obſervations and remarks from ſome of our moſt reſpectable philoſophic and medical characters, to whom much praiſe are due; the ſubject however does not appear to be exhauſted, it is yet ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of improvement. I ſhall endeavor to place it in a new point of view, in as conciſe a manner as I am able. The attempt may be the means of calling forth the obſervations of others better qualified to illuſtrate the ſubject. I regret that neither my abilities or ſituation enable me to do it that juſtice which it certainly deſerves.</p>
            <p>The origin of the diſeaſe has been variouſly accounted for, and with ſome degree of warmth by thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as of foreign birth, with a view to exculpate their country from the ſtigma which attaches to a city that generates ſo deſtructive a calamity. However praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy it may be to endeavour to exonerate any place from ſo ſoul an imputation, yet we ought to be extremely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of crediting a belief in its foreign origin, unleſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by inconteſtible facts, becauſe it may lull us into a fatal ſecurity, and induce us to neglect thoſe means of preſervation, which a contrary opinion puts us in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. I believe it moſt juſt, and at any rate moſt ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to conſider the yellow fever as endemial to many of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033465_0005_0FF74264199FEFC0"/>
our cities; becauſe the ſame means that would prevent its riſe here, are preciſely thoſe that retard and remove its peſtilential effects when imported, to wit, <hi>cleanlineſs</hi> and <hi>good air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great improvements that have been made within a few years in chemiſtry, form a new era in that ſcience, which will moſt extenſively influence the practiſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, particularly in the treatment of the diſeaſe in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and others of ſimilar nature, though different in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <abbr>viz,</abbr> the plague, Weſt-India, Bengal, camp, goal fever, marſh fever, bilious fever, autumnal, remitting, and moſt probably the common intermittent.</p>
            <p>As I do not excluſively addreſs myſelf to men of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I ſhall endeavour to diveſt my obſervations as much as poſſible of technical terms, that the plain citizen, whoſe health is his greateſt good, may comprehend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the nature of the diſeaſe, and of courſe will be more cheerfully inclined to contribute his mite towards preventing its origin and removing its effects.</p>
            <p>I propoſe to conſider the ſubject under three heads or queſtions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. What is the cauſe of the yellow fever?</item>
               <item>2d. What is the beſt mode of treating it?</item>
               <item>3dly. What are the ſureſt means of preventing it?</item>
            </list>
            <p>In conſidering the firſt queſtion we muſt examine the nature of the air we breath, or atmoſpheric air, and the operation breathing effectuates on the animal machine. By the aſſiduous application, and unremitted attention of ſeveral eminent philoſophers and chemiſts, among whom the names of Hales, Black, Macbride, Prieſtly, Cavendiſh, Lavoiſeir, Foureroy, Berthollet, Chaptal and De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veau will not be forgotten while ſcience is recorded. We are now able to analyſe the atmoſpheric air, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a ſimple element, is found to be a chemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033465_0006_0FF74267DCDEDA98"/>
compound, a knowledge of whoſe principles becomes the more intereſting, as nature has made them her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agents in moſt of her operations; which may be conſidered as her grand laboratory, from which the ſeeds and pabulum of animal and vegetable life are derived, and to which their ſubſequent decompoſition returns the ſame principles which before were extracted. The phyſical properties of atmoſpherical air are fluidity, inviſibility, gravity, elaſticity, compreſſibility, and negation of ſmell. though foetid and odorant ſubſtances ſometimes affect our organs, they are to be attributed to the extraneous bodies mixed and floating in the air, which is itſelf perfectly inodorous.</p>
            <p>From the moſt concluſive and ſatisfactory experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Prieſtly and Lavoiſier, it is aſcertained, that the atmoſpheric air will not, in its totality, maintain animal life, or promote combuſtion; the proportion of air that anſwers either of theſe purpoſes, compared with the atmoſpherical air, is only as 28 is to 100, which has been called by the French academicians oxigenous gas, or oxigen; the reſidue, or 72-100 of the atmoſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal air has been called azote, or nitrogene.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr. Lavoiſier's experiments make the atmoſpheric air to be compoſed of 72 parts of azote, 27 parts of oxigen, and one of carbonic acid, or fixed air.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>It has become neceſſary, that a revolution in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of chemiſtry ſhould be attended with a ſimilar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in its language; for it is impoſſible to retain a vicious nomenclature when the ſcience becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, extended, and ſimplified: the words uſed ſhould always identify the fact, that the knowledge of the one ſhould always lead to a knowledge of the other. I am ſorry here to be obliged to criticize on ſome of the words that have been adopted, becauſe they do not carry the unequivocal appropriate ideas which we have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033465_0007_0FF7426A158A5FB0"/>
a right to expect, when an innovation is introduced: the word oxigen is derived from the greek, and ſignifies <hi>the begetter of acid,</hi> or the baſis of acidity; ſo far the word perfectly correſponds with the fact, and probably it is from this principle only, that it is of ſuch infinite and indiſpenſable importance to animal life: but as it is the eſſence of life, this circumſtance gives it a priority of claim to ſtand its God-father; I ſhall therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for it the term <hi>animal vital air;</hi> this indeed does not deſignate all its qualities, nor is it neceſſary that it ſhould; but it defines, with ſufficient correctneſs, its great leading trait—the ſupporter of animal life: the words azote, or nitrogene, are more exceptionable than oxigen; azote is likewiſe derived from the Greek, and ſignifies <hi>without life,</hi> which is juſt as deſcriptive of the halter or the guillotine, as air: nitrogene is likewiſe of Grecian origin, and is meant to ſhew, that it is the baſis of nitre; that it is ſo, I readily admit, but I am not diſpoſed to believe, that this trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was of ſufficient conſequence to give a name to the <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of vegetable life; I think it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have been called <hi>vegetable vital air</hi>—a name which I ſhall take the liberty to adopt; for it is a fact as well aſcertained, as it is poſſible for a chemical fact to be, that in this air plants live and vegetate, without it they die: animal vital air is more ponderous than at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheric air, as 1000 is to 1103; vegetable vital air, on the contrary, is lighter, as 985 is to 1000; theſe two airs, in the proportion of 28 of the former to 72 of the latter, forms the atmoſpherical air, which is a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical compound, and is about 850 times lighter than water.</p>
            <p>It is an axiom in chemiſtry, that all ſubſtances in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether in a ſimple or compound ſtate, would invariably continue in that ſame ſtate, unleſs for a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which pervades all creation, and is called electric attraction, or affinity of compoſition: unions formed from this cauſe, are more or leſs perfect, in proportion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033465_0008_0FF7426DECE2E010"/>
as their ſubſtances have a greater or leſs affinity for each other.

Nitre may likewiſe be decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in another way: it is known that Barytes, or the Terra Ponderoſa, has a greater affinity for the nitric acid than what potaſh has—let them therefore be placed conveniently together, and a decompoſition of the nitric is produced, the nitrate of Barytes is formed, and the potaſh ſet at liberty.</p>

point out to us in the moſt poſitive manner, that the abſolute exiſtence of animals and vegetables depends on a mutual reciprocity of each others wants; animals abſorb animal vital air, and emit vegetable vital air; on the contrary, vegetables abſorb vegetable vital air, and emit animal vital air; the leaves are the medium through which this exchange is made by plants; the lungs and the excretory pores, on the ſurface of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are deſtined to this purpoſe in animals—or, in other words, vegetables, when in a ſtate of active exiſtence, have a greater affinity for vegetable vital air, than what animal vital air has, conſequently the vegetable vital air of that part of the atmoſpheric air which comes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with vegetables in a ſtate of verdure, quits its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the animal vital air, and attaches itſelf to the plant; on the contrary, the animal vital air of the atmoſphere has a greater affinity for the blood of animals than it has for vegetable vital air; whenever, therefore, it comes in cloſe or near contact with this ſubſtance, a new union is formed: it is, however, not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as forming an union with the blood on the ſame principles as the ſulphuric acid does with the potaſh, previouſly combined with the nitric acid, becauſe, in this caſe, a violent efferveſcence takes place, in diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nitric acid, but this union may be more aptly compared to that which takes place between quick lime and fixed air, or carbonic acid, for two reaſons—in the firſt place, the heat that is generated in the lime from this union, is perfectly ſimilar to the heat of animals, which is acquired by the abſorption and condenſation of animal vital air<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

more or leſs acrid in proportion as it is leſs or more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turated with its appropriate acid: on the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the blood of a living animal is leſs or more acrid, or fit for the purpoſes of life, as it is leſs or more neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralized with animal vital air, which is the baſis of aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; the blood itſelf can never ſhew any great degree of acridity or corroſiveneſs, becauſe it would deſtroy ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life before it arrives at this ſtate; but that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions from the blood may, and ſometimes do become very conſiderably acrid, is moſt certain—particularly the bile which is always eminently affected in all the diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in queſtion; the bile, in its healthy ſtate, is very conſiderably alkaline, although ſecreted from blood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly neutralized—at leaſt, as much as venous blood can be, for the bile is not ſecreted from artereal blood; but when the blood is not, from a deficiency of animal vital air, ſufficiently neutralized, it is in this caſe eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the bile ſecreted from ſuch blood will be in exceſs, and muſt poſſeſs a quality verging towards an acrid ſtate—which, according to the deficiency of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal vital air, and the heat of the ſeaſon, as we ſhall by and by ſee, may produce a diſeaſe of ſlight affection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—as the fever and ague, or of the moſt virulent kind, the plague itſelf.</p>
            <p>Every animal is furniſhed with lungs, or ſomething correſponding thereto, through which the blood in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion paſſes, by which means it is brought in cloſe contact with the atmoſpheric air, and from which we now know it abſorbs that part of it which we call animal vital air; after the atmoſpheric air has thus been reſpired, it loſes its property of ſupporting the lives of other animals: when an animal has died in this reſpired air, and another is ſubſtituted to the firſt, it periſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and in its firſt effort to reſpire: it ſhould ſeem, however, that animals may, by habit, become capable, to a certain point, of breathing impure air.</p>

though from the time of Hippocrates it has been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in the air reſides a principle neceſſary to life, which by him was called the <hi>pabulum vitae;</hi> this idea was connected with no hypotheſis; ſyſtems the moſt vague and void of all foundations, have at different times been held up; at one time conſidering the air as a ſtimulus in the lungs, which kept up the circulation; at another the lungs were conſidered as a bellows to cool the body, heated by a thouſand imaginary cauſes. Phyſiologiſts of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day ſeem to conſider them as the outlets of certain putrid effluviae, which would corrupt the living body in the ſame manner that it produces corruption in thoſe that are dead. The rationale is extremely againſt ſuch a theory; for is it conceiveable that the ſame <hi>viſeus</hi> can be at the ſame moment performing two functions diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to each other? that of abſorbing and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creting through the ſame veſſels, unleſs they ſuppoſe it ſimilar to elective attraction, as mentioned before, where potaſh having a greater affinity for the ſulphuric acid than for the nitric acid, diſcharges this acid with which it was previouſly combined. But there is no ſort of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in this caſe, for the matter diſcharged from the lungs inſtead of being an acid, is more of an alkaline nature, mixed with carbon; which I think is very ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, on the following principles: In examining the conſtruction of lungs, we find them furniſhed with two ſetts of veſſels, a larger and a ſmaller; through the larger the whole of the blood of the ſyſtem is conſtantly tranſmitted, for the <hi>excluſive</hi> purpoſe of attracting ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal vital air from the atmoſphere. The ſmaller ſett is appropriated to the excluſive ſupport of the lungs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to furniſh a conſiderable ſecretion, neceſſary to lubricate a part which is in ſuch conſtant motion, to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the return of the reſpired air in the atmoſphere; and to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the acrimony of any heterogeneous matter with which the atmoſphere is frequently charged. This ſecretion will ſufficiently account for the great quantity of moiſture diſcharged in expiration. The excretory pores diſtributed over the whole ſurface of the body are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033465_0012_0FF7428236753538"/>
ſufficiently competent to diſcharge this duty which has been aſſigned to the lungs by our modern phyſiologiſts.</p>
            <p>It has been long an eſtabliſhed principle among phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that all animals have a conſtant tendency to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; but it has been reſerved for our own times, to point out the cauſe that is capable of correcting this tendency. Borehave in his aphoriſms, §. 83, ſays, <q>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, fiſhes, amphibious creatures, birds, beaſts of all kinds, and even men of their own nature, conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to putrefaction, but never turn acid</q> Van Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his commentaries on this aphoriſm ſays, <q>all the known animals (except a few juiceleſs inſects, for moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure is required in putrefaction, and the parts of animals never putrefy if they are dried) putrefy, if expoſed to the heat of an air, which ſhall cauſe the liquid to riſe in the Farenheitian thermometer to any degree between the 32d and the 92d. The greater the heat is within this limit, ſo much the ſooner for the moſt part will the putrefaction begin, for beyond the 92d degree the heat rather drys up all moiſture, and ſo hinders putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the nearer the deſcending heat approaches to a like degree of coldneſs with that of ice, the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the putrefaction comes on. In fiſhes it generally comes on very ſoon, more ſlowly in other animals. Nor does it appear by any experiment, that the parts of animals have ever degenerated of themſelves into an acid; this therefore may be taken for a general rule.</q> It appears therefore, that one of the great charactariſtic differences between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, is this, that animals conſtantly tend to an alkaline or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent ſtate, and vegetables to that of acidity. We have ſeen before that the two kingdoms are conſtantly mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correcting each others morbid tendency, through the medium of the atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>From theſe premiſes it is eaſy to conceive, that when the atmoſpherical air in any particular place, is not from any cauſe ſufficiently replete with animal vital air, this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033465_0013_0FF74285D4D40418"/>
grand corrector of putreſcency, that then the animals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding within that diſtrict muſt, more or leſs, become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, according to their previous putreſcent tendency; for Boerhave obſerves in his §. 84, <q>that the antecedent cauſes of this putrefaction, are feeding upon animal food, except the milk of grazing cattle, eſpecially upon inſects, fiſhes, birds of prey, alkaleſſent vegetables; a fullneſs either of good blood, or of blood acceding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards putrefaction; the ſtrength of the veſſels, viſcera, bile, ſtagnation, or too much agitation, through the animal motion either growing languid, or being raiſed too high, great heat affecting the body frequently and long.</q> This aphoriſm in ſome meaſure explains why a deficiency of animal vital air does not equally affect all thoſe who are expoſed to it. Galen likewiſe lays it down as a rule, <q>that it is always neceſſary to remember, that no cauſe can effect without a prediſpoſition of the body, otherwiſe all who are expoſed to the rays of a ſummer ſun, would be ſeized with fevers, as well as thoſe who uſe too much exerciſe, are paſſionate or grieved. Moreover all would fall ſick during the dog days, or die of the plague.</q> M. Chaptal has taken notice of a fact which is of ſome importance, and deſerves to be related here; it is, that "frugivorous animals vitiate the air leſs than carnivorous animals," which may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in this way, that frugivorous animals having leſs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to putrefaction than carnivorous animals, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire leſs animal vital air to correct that diſpoſition; for inſtance, an animal fed altogether on vegetables, would be able to abſorb a ſufficient quantity of animal vital air to prevent putrefaction, out of an atmoſphere that contained only 20 per cent of this principle, whereas an animal fed altogether on animal food, with a leſs quantity than 25 per cent, would probably be affected with a putrid or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious fever.</p>
            <p>A diminution of animal vital air, at a ſeaſon when the thermometer is at or below 32d. may produce no bad effect; but the ſame diminution continuing, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033465_0014_0FF7428C9C750CA8"/>
the heat increaſing, a fever and ague may be occaſioned by it: a ſtill greater increaſe of heat may occaſion a dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, a further diminution of animal vital air, and an increaſe of heat, the yellow fever, or even the plague it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may be generated. The Plague, therefore, can probably never originate in a cold climate, but it may, when carried here, exert its peſtilential influence, by producing an increaſed decompoſition of animal matter, and of courſe, generating much vegetable vital air, with which the atmoſphere becomes ſurcharged, whereby the animal vital air is ſo diminiſhed, that the natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to putrefaction cannot be ſufficiently corrected; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the diſeaſe goes on rapidly, increaſing its dreadful influence, until one of the two cauſes intervenes to ſtop its progreſs—either a leſs diſpoſition to putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an increaſe of animal vital air.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now adduce a few traits to corroborate this ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: Foreſtus<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> VI. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1, <hi>P.</hi> 25.</note> relates, that a large fiſh of the whale kind, of immenſe bulk, ran aſhore on the Dutch coaſt, nor could again reach the ſea, notwithſtanding its utmoſt efforts, and at length died on the ſands; numerous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators ran thither from every part. Foreſtus himſelf was preſent. The neighbouring inhabitants, not being able to remove the dead fiſh, on account of its prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bulk, and neglecting immediately to divide the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs into ſmall pieces, the whole putrefied, and infected the country with a horrid rancid ſtench, in conſequence of which, a peſtilential fever broke out in the diſtrict of Egmont, and the adjacent parts, that carried off great numbers. This caſe goes merely to one fact, to ſhew that putrid animal ſubſtances, in a ſtate of decompoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are alone ſufficient to generate peſtilential fevers, by ſuperſaturating the atmoſphere with vegetable vital air.</p>

The next caſe I ſhall relate is much in point, and is recorded by Sir Michael Foſter<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Faſt.</hi> 17.<hi>Burn's Juſtice, Vol. II. P.</hi> 361.</note>: a Mr. Clarke was brought to his trial at the Old Bayley ſeſſions, in April, 1750—it being a caſe of great expectation, the court and all the paſſages to it were extremely crowded; the weather was hotter than is uſual at that time of the year; many people who were in court were ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a noiſome ſmell, and it appeared ſoon afterwards, upon an enquiry ordered by the court of Aldermen, that the whole priſon of Newgate, and all the paſſages leading thence into the court, were in a very filthy condition, and had long been ſo. What made theſe circumſtances be at all attended to, was, that within a week, or ten days at the moſt, after the ſeſſions, many people who were preſent at Mr. Clarke's tryal, were ſeized with a fever of the malignant kind, and few who were ſeized recovered. The ſymptoms were much alike in all the patients; and in leſs than three weeks, the diſtemper entirely ceaſed. At the time this diſaſter happened, there was no ſickneſs in the gaol more than is uſual in ſuch places; the circumſtance, that diſtinguiſheth this from moſt of the caſes of the like kind which we have heard of, ſuggeſts a very proper caution, not to preſume too far upon the health of the gaol, barely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gaol fever is not among the priſoners; for, without doubt, if the points of cleanlineſs and free air have been greatly neglected, the putrid effluvia which the priſoners bring with them in their cloaths, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, eſpecially where too many are brought into a crowded court together, may have fatal effects on peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are accuſtomed to breath better air: though the poor wretches, who in ſome meaſure are habituated to the fumes of a priſon, may not always be ſenſible of great inconveniencies from them. The perſons of chief note who were in the court at this time, and died of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033465_0016_0FF74295C2C47730"/>
fever, were Sir Samuel Pennant, lord mayor for that year, Sir Thomas Abny, one of the juſtices of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleas; Charles Clarke, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> one of the barons of the exchequer, and Sir Daniel Lambert, one of the aldermen of London: of leſs note, a gentleman of the bar, two or three ſtudents, one of the under ſheriffs, an officer of chief juſtice Lee, who attended his lordſhip in court at that time, ſeveral gentlemen of the jury on the Middleſex ſide, and about fifty other perſons, whom buſineſs or curioſity had brought thither.</p>
            <p>I have related this caſe rather lengthily, with a view to make a few obſervations on it: it ſhews that a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever may, like the laſt caſe, ariſe from putrid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive matter, and a confined air: it alſo ſhews that the priſoners, who contributed largely to generate the diſeaſe, did themſelves eſcape its deſtructive influence, by being in ſome meaſure habituated to it; for that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can, and does by degrees aſſimilate our conſtitutions to varieties of climate and atmoſpherical changes, are facts that conſtantly occur, without which the Weſt and Eaſt Indies, the coaſt of Guinea, and the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the ſouthern States, would be uninhabited by Europeans, or the inhabitants of the more northern and elevated parts of America. It is probable alſo, from low diet, the natural tendency of the priſoners to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was leſs than that of the high fed judges, law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yers, and Middleſex jurymen, who were victims to the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>This caſe likewiſe furniſhes us with another fact of ſome importance: it ſtates, that the diſeaſe commenced in April, and in about ſix weeks, that is the beginning of June, diſappeared. Now, from what has been before obſerved, in the month of June, the natural tendency to putrefaction, from the increaſe of heat, muſt have been much more powerful than it was in the month of April; of courſe, the diſeaſe, inſtead of entirely ceaſing, ought to have increaſed rapidly; why it did not, I ſhall now
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033465_0017_0FF7429A47F68F18"/>
endeavour to account. In the month of April, in nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern climates, vegetation is ſtill dormant, conſequently the atmoſpherical air muſt then be ſurcharged with vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vital air: as the ſummer advances, this vegetable vital air will be in great demand, for the nutriment of plants; of courſe, not only a diminution of it takes place, from being abſorbed by plants, but a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of animal vital air is generated by them, and thrown into the atmoſphere, from whence it will be abſorbed by animals, to whom it is a <hi>ſine qua non.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plants not only have the faculty of emptying into the atmoſphere animal vital air, by perſpiration, but they poſſeſs likewiſe the means of throwing into circulation an immenſe quantity from another ſource, to wit, from rain and dews: to underſtand this aright, it is neceſſary to premiſe, that from the beſt authenticated facts, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inſtead of being a pure element, is diſcovered to be compounded of two ſpecies of air, <abbr>viz.</abbr> animal vital air, and inflammable air, or, as it has been called, hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, in the proportion of 85 of the former, and 15 of the latter: now it is well known that plants have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er affinity for hydrogene, than animal vital air has; of conſequence, when water or dew fall on the leaves of plants, the hydrogene is abſorbed, and the water decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; therefore the animal vital air muſt be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the atmoſphere; the heat and light of the ſun greatly facilitates this operation: one ſquare inch of water contains near nine hundred ſquare inches of animal vital air.</p>
            <p>This is by no means a ſolitary caſe of a malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſing in the heat of ſummer; the hiſtory of the plague furniſhes us with a great many: I ſhall ſelect two or three. When the plague raged at Aleppo, and in the beginning of July, the hotteſt ſeaſon of the year came on, the diſeaſe remarkably diminiſhed; and towards the end of

            </p>
            <p>I have thus ſhewn that malignant diſeaſes may ariſe from a combination of two cauſes—heat and a deficiency of animal vital air. That the yellow fever which has rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged many of our cities, did originate among ourſelves, I will not undertake to ſay, but that the heat of our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the filth of the ſtreets, the putrefaction in the docks, added to the inhabitants living on ſo much animal food, are not only ſufficient to give riſe to it, but full activity, cannot be doubted; and it is, in my opinion, a matter of no importance to determine whether the diſorder was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or not, ſince we have adopted it, by making it ſo welcome.</p>
            <p>I might have quoted a variety of other facts to ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the ſame principles, particularly the jail fever at the black aſſizes at Oxford, the caſe of the unfortunate priſoners confined in the black hole at Calcutta by the Nabob Surajeddoullah, &amp;c. but it would have been nearly a repetition of the ſame effects, produced by ſimilar cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. I ſhall now proceed to conſider what is the beſt mode of treating the yellow fever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:033465_0019_0FF7424C42362980"/>
It is a great point gained always, when a phyſician can indubitably fix on the cauſe of a diſorder; his efforts to remove it will then be grounded on a rational practice. The yellow fever I have ſaid, ariſes from a combination of two cauſes, a certain degree of heat, and a deficiency of animal vital air, whereby the circulating fluids acquire a ſtrong tendency to putrefaction. Of all the ſecretions made from the blood, none ſo readily feel the influence of putridity as the bile, whoſe uſe appears to be, from its alkaleſſent nature, to render the oily parts of the food miſcible with the aqueous in the <hi>duodenum;</hi> which is the inteſtine next below the ſtomach, in which the food has been previouſly digeſted, for the bile is never diſcharged into the ſtomach in an healthy ſtate, it can get there on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vomiting, or ſome ſuch effect; the idea of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being overcharged with bile is an error.</p>
            <p>The progreſſive effects of heat above 32d of Fahren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heit's thermometer, and a deficiency of animal vital air below 27 per cent. of the atmoſphere will be as follows: the blood by having too little of the principle of acidity in it, ſecretes bile in too large a quantity, conſequently inſtead of ſimply converting the food to a bland chyle, its exceſs will occaſion a fever and ague, or a dierrhoea; when the primary cauſes above mentioned are increaſed in degree, the bile not only becomes increaſed in quantity, but its quality alſo is materially affected; it acquires a tendency to throw the food into a putrefactive fermentation, which becomes a rotten ſanies, and an excoriation of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els takes place, which conſtitutes dyſentery; or when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible perſpiration happens to be deficient, a fever will be induced, and will be known by the name of Yellow Fever, bilious fever, camp fever, goal fever, &amp;c. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the place and particular accompanying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; a further increaſe of one or both of the prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing cauſes will occaſion the plague.</p>
            <p>In the Yellow Fever therefore, the primary object of the phyſician will be as ſoon as poſſible to empty the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the bowels, and to throw into the atmoſpheric
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033465_0020_0FF680C411562FC8"/>
air an additional quantity of animal vital air, which is eaſily procured by the decompoſition of nitre. We have already ſeen, that nitre is a neutral ſalt, compoſed of potaſh and the nitric acid, and that ſulphuric acid has a greater affinity for potaſh than the nitric acid has; conſequently, by being mixed together, the nitric acid will be diſcharged. A ſimple and ready method is this—in a chafing diſh of coals, place a large gallypot nearly filled with ſand, in the ſand place a ſmaller gallypot about half full of ſulphuric acid, into which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually throw nitre in powder; an efferveſcence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately commences, which is the ſeparation of the nitric acid; the fumes as they immediately ariſe from the pot are acid and corroſive, and ſhould be avoided as not being reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable until more diluted in the air. This method was lately very ſucceſsfully uſed at Sheerneſs in England, on board the ſhip Union, in which a malignant fever had for a conſiderable time raged with ſome violence, but by the uſe of this means was entirely removed: It was ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. Carmichael Smith, for which he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made (it is ſaid) phyſician extraordinary to the King. The principles on which he recommended it were theſe, he imagined that the contagion ariſing from the malignant fever was occaſioned by certain alkaline effluvia, diſcharged from the bodies of the patients, that by throwing into the air the nitric acid, to be attracted by thoſe effluvia they were to be neutralized, and of courſe rendered inert. How far ſuch an opinion can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on philoſophical principles, I ſhall not undertake to diſcuſs, for having determined not to find fault with the opinions of others in giving my own, I ſhall not throw the gauntlet to the doctor. Nitre may be decompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heat only, which is probably the beſt method of doing it, as it reſpects a complete ſeparation of its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by which means it will be more ſuſceptible of new combinations. It muſt be put in a retort and kept in a red heat for ſome time before the gas begins to ſeparate. In hoſpitals, by means of tubes, the gas may be thrown into any ward; but in private houſes the uſe of it would
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033465_0021_0FF742A7D1061FB0"/>
become more difficult, unleſs carried there, which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done in a machine to be mentioned by and by. One pound of nitre contains about 12,000 cubic inches of animal vital air, which is about 1-5 of its weight. Animal vital air may alſo be procured in large quantities and with great facility, by pouring ſulphuric acid on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganeſe in powder, the veſſel containing the manganeſe ſhould be placed on a chaſing diſh of coals.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe in the beginning is confined to the fluids only, it is of great importance therefore, to diminiſh their quantity, and repair the loſs if poſſible with thoſe of a more acceſſent kind, obtained from vegetables only. On this principle, bleeding in conſiderable quantities is a practice well founded, and which has been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Galen, Botalli, Sydenham, Van Sweiten, and many others of great reſpectibility. There is a point however beyond which this liquid of life cannot be drawn with impunity, unleſs the loſs could be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, which can be done in one or two ways only: the firſt and moſt natural is by food, but this unfortunately is very difficult to be done, as the patient generally loaths all food, but a ſmall renovation can be expected from this ſource. From the other way great expections were once formed, though it is much to be regretted were ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned; I mean the transfuſing of good ſound blood from the veins of an healthy perſon or ſome animal into the veins of the patient who loſes a proportionate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his bad blood. That the operation has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently performed, the books tell us. When the diſeaſe like the Yellow fever is confined to the circulating juices, the theory is rational, and deſerves to be conſidered; I give it merely as a hint.</p>
            <p>I have already obſerved, that vegetable vital air is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by animals, and expelled from their bodies by means of excretory veſſels on their ſurfaces, it is in other words a decompoſition of animal matter which is diſcharged from the body not only as uſeleſs but pernicious. In a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033465_0022_0FF680C5EAF3A2D0"/>
healthy ſtate of the blood a retention of this matter will occaſion a variety of very ſerious evils; but in a diſeaſed ſtate, and particularly of the one under conſideration, it is of the utmoſt importance that every facility be given to its outlet; whatever then will contribute to promote perſpiration ſhould be freely applied, and aſſiduouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned before, that vegetable air is in a ſmall degree lighter than animal vital air; this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a pure uncombined ſtate, in which caſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable vital air would naturally tend to elevate itſelf above the animal vital air, but the affinity they have for each other, although it be not a ſtrong one, will naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to an union, which is greatly promoted by agitation. There is another circumſtance reſpecting airs or gazes which ſhould not be forgotten, which is, that their weight depends altogether on the caloric or heat and moiſture with which they are combined; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for inſtance deprived of its caloric becomes ice, give it an additional quantity of caloric and it becomes vapour or gas. Vegetable vital air therefore, diſcharged from an animal by perſpiration, being inveloped in a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humidity, will not aſcend from the body with that faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which it would otherwiſe be capable of, conſequently the body becomes encircled with an atmoſphere greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with vegetable vital air, which probably in this ſtate may be capable of being taken into the body again by means of the abſorbent veſſels; to prevent which and to give full operation to new air that may be thrown into the ſick room, the vitiated air ſhould be conſtantly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; it may be done by throwing a current of air on and near the bed, but which may be attended with the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of checking perſpiration, which ſhould be carefully avoided, for the reaſons already aſſigned. The known compreſſibility of airs, ſuggeſts the propriety of uſing the following deſcribed machine, which may be called an abſtractor</p>
            <p>

               <figure/>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>A A tubulated metallic box of any dimenſions, ſay 6 inches ſquare.</item>
               <item>B A value in the tubulure.</item>
               <item>C A gun barrel ſcrewed to the tubulure.</item>
               <item>D A piſton to be worked by.</item>
               <item>E The handle.</item>
               <item>F A flexible tube of any conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent length, inſerted into the gun barrel at C, by which means, as the piſton is worked, the air enters the flexible tube at G, and is forced into the box through the valve.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It is evident therefore, that the air may be extracted from any place wherever the point G of the flexible tube can be applied, either on the bed, under the bed, or in the bed itſelf, without in the leaſt incommoding the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. A box of 6 inches ſquare contains 216 inches; now it is a fact well known, that air may be compreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a volume of 128 times leſs than what it commonly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies; conſequently a box of the above dimentions may be made to contain 27,648 ſquare inches of air, which may be taken to the top of the houſe and diſcharged, by drawing out the piſton and forcing the valve open with an iron rod. This operation may be repeated as often as it may be thought neceſſary, by which ſimple contrivance the air of the room may be kept perfectly ſweet without endangering a check to the perſpiration. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument I had reference to, when ſpeaking of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animal vital air from any place where it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently manufactured, to the chamber or bed of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. To the retort containing the nitre to be decompoſed, or to the veſſel containing the manganeſe and ſulphuric acid, let there be affixed and well luted, a large tubula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033465_0024_0FF742B9B1831838"/>
matraſs, to the tube of which let the tube of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractor be affixed; as the gas riſes in the matraſs a few ſtrokes of the piſton will drive it into the box, which when filled may be carried to the bed of the patient and there diſcharged in the manner already directed.</p>
            <p>The atmoſphere contains, as I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a note, by Mr. Lavoiſier's eſtimates, about one per cent of carbonic acid, a gas more generally diſtributed throughout the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms than any we are acquainted with; it is diſengaged in this form by the putrefaction of animal ſubſtances, the decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of vegetables heaped together, the fermentation of wine, beer, cyder, &amp;c. by all calcareous ſubſtances, when expoſed to a ſtrong heat, &amp;c. in this acid neither animals nor vegetables can exiſt; an animal immerſed in it almoſt inſtantly dies. I do not however conſider this air as deliterious or poiſonous, as it is generally underſtood, but an animal dies in it nearly on the ſame principles that it would do if immerſed in water, that is from a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deficiency of animal vital air; conſequently a ſudden ſtop is put to the circulation. The lungs of the drowned perſon are collapſed; if inflated again in a reaſonable time with common air, he may be reanimated. The lungs of a perſon ſuffocated with carbonic acid remain inflated with this acid; of courſe it becomes more difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate him, becauſe this air muſt be firſt extracted.</p>
            <p>The weight of carbonic acid, compared with common air, according to Mr. Kirwan, is as 45 to 68 nearly; from this circumſtance, it naturally ſubſides to, and occupies the loweſt places, from whence it may be very readily removed, by the application of a quantity of quick lime, with which ſubſtance it has a great affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: 1200 pounds of quick lime will abſorb about 800 pounds of carbonic acid, to convert it into ſlacked lime; for this reaſon, then, a quantity of quick lime ſhould always be kept near or under the beds of patients in the yellow fever: its application would be attended with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033465_0025_0FF680CC063CD510"/>
another advantage—it abſorbs alſo a great quantity of, humidity, which is apt to prevail in ſuch rooms, and which ſhould never be attempted to be removed by fire, as fire, by its combuſtion, abſorbs animal vital air in great quantities: the carbonic acid has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as an antiſeptic remedy, but this fact wants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn the cauſe of yellow fever, and the beſt mode of treating it, I ſhall now proceed to the third queſtion, and point out the ſureſt means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it. After ſaying that fifth may generate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it can ſcarcely be neceſſary to ſay, that cleanliness in a great meaſure will prevent it: an invariable attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt certainly be paid to this object, as well in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and houſes, as the ſtreets and docks; for it ſhould never be out of my mind, that heat and moiſture are the two great agents that conſtantly incline all animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to decompoſition, which then form a gas of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme expanſibility, occupying the place in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of a principle that is of the laſt importance to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life. It may happen, notwithſtanding very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care, that an exceſs of vegetable vital air may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate in the atmoſphere; you will then aſk what is to be done to prevent it? plant trees in every ſtreet—trees, as has been remarked before, not only abſorb ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable vital air, but generate, in large quantities, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal vital air, and decompoſe water. The animal and vegetable kingdoms are conſtantly labouring for each other, and by this admirable reciprocity of ſervice, the atmoſphere is conſtantly changing, and an equilibrium maintained between its conſtituent principles.</p>
            <p>Hot, dry, and ſtagnating air, has been obſerved the forerunner of peſtilential diſeaſes; that they ſhould be ſo, from the foregoing theory, is inevitable, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reaſons: heat, by dilating the texture of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, increaſes their natural tendency to putrefaction: drowth diminiſhes the requiſite proportion of animal
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033465_0026_0FF742BD91DFBEA0"/>
vital air in the atmoſphere, by not furniſhing the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite quantity of water to be decompoſed by the leaves of vegetables (for water, by its decompoſition, purifies the atmoſphere, by pouring into it ſtreams of animal vital air) conſequently this air, by ſtagnation, becomes overcharged with vegetable vital air, and not being agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and removed by gentle breezes, peſtilential diſeaſes begin their deſtructive career; whenever theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in a greater or leſſer degree, ſhall therefore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in a city, diſeaſes of a more or leſs ſerious aſpect will be the conſequence; but by planting the ſtreets with trees, and procuring a ſupply of water to ſprinkle the ſtreets and trees occaſionally in the heat of the day, it is more than probable the yellow fever will never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after depopulate the city.</p>
            <p>The local ſituation of New York is equal, if not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to any commercial city in America, probably in the world; it poſſeſſes almoſt every thing but <hi>one,</hi> to render it the jealouſy of nations: when we ſee the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and numbers of her public buildings, the ſplendor of her equipages, and the extravagance of her citizens, we are aſtoniſhed that this one thing, which is eaſily procureable, ſhould be wanting—that is, a plentiful ſupply of good freſh water, particularly when it is known that this ſupply may be had for about half the price that is now paid for a ſcanty ſupply of <hi>tub water.</hi> The whole river Brunks, if it were neceſſary, may be turned through the ſtreets of New York: nothing could poſſibly tend ſo much to blend the <hi>utile dulci</hi> as this; it would, in an eminent degree, ſecure the health and wealth of the city: it would, in fact, be its protector againſt thoſe two great ſcourges of cities—fire and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>I have before remarked. that animals living on vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table food, do not deſtroy ſo much animal vital air as thoſe that live on fleſh; of courſe, they do not want ſo much; it is therefore an object of conſiderable import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033465_0027_0FF742C5CF26BD08"/>
to abſtain, during the dog days, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the uſe of fleſh meats, and particularly fiſh: abſtain alſo from the uſe of much ſpirituous liquors, they tend to heat the blood, without correcting its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid tendency; on the contrary, beer, cyder, and wines, are neceſſary: abſtain likewiſe from crowded houſes, particularly theatres, whoſe air is not only contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the number of people breathing it, but the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, by their combuſtion, tend rapidly to render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the ſupport of animal life. It would be a very good practice, and not attended with much expence, if the proprietors of houſes of this deſcription, were to cauſe a quantity of nitre to be decompoſed in them when crowded.</p>
            <p>The practice of burying in church yards and vaults in New-York, has been I fear too long ſanctioned by cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, to be affected by any feeble efforts of mine; but the accidents that have happened in many other places from a ſimilar practice, will I hope be a ſufficient apology for ſpeaking a few words on this ſubject. According to Mr. Petit, a body buried four feet under ground without a coffin, will be from three to four years before it be quite decompounded, if buried deeper, the time will be longer; if buried in a coffin, it will require ten years to produce the ſame effect. The quantity of vegetable vital air conſtantly emitting from bodies previous to the above periods is great, conſequently combining with an exceſs of vegetable vital air already in the atmoſphere, may be the means of very ſerious miſchief; the riſk however from thoſe cauſes is by no means ſo great as from the opening of vaults in cities, the moſt ſerious evils have frequently ariſen from this cauſe. Burials then ſhould be at ſome diſtance from a city; I have no objection that the inanimate bodies ſhould ſtill be conſigned to the purveyance of the prieſts, it is in many places a perquiſite of the church; common decency will point out the proper interment; if you pleaſe the burial ſervice for the dead may ſtill he ſaid over it, the living may benefit from it. It appears to me how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033465_0028_0FF742C756502C68"/>
that the mode uſed in Spain on this ceremony is better underſtood and more rational than elſewhere; the bodies are decently dreſſed, and carried on an open bier to the place of interment, into which it is placed, and with it a quantity of quick lime, which greatly facilitates the decompoſition of animal ſubſtances, whereby the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles compoſing it are the more readily enabled to form new combinations; they will quit the ſolitary abode of the dead, and will again be immediately brought into an active ſtate of exiſtence; their firſt combination will be to form vegetables, probably odorant plants and ſweet ſcented flowers will owe their ſweetneſs and beauty to the identical corpuſcles that once animated our deareſt friends and neareſt relations, from whence through the medium of the atmoſphere they will probably again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the roſy health and lively bloom of toaſted beauty. In this rotine, for hundreds of ages, they have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated our anceſtors, and for thouſands more to come will probably be performing the ſame duty for ourſelves. How infinitely more joyous is ſuch an expoſition of facts than the <hi>hic jacet</hi> inrollment in vaults and church yards, and the ſolitary, gloomy and diſguſting ſtate in which the prieſts and ancient philoſophers have ſuppoſed human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſubject to. If notwithſtanding theſe facts, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and vanity ſhould ſtill induce any to build ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres for themſelves and family, the legiſlature ſhould order, that bodies conſigned to ſuch keeping ſhould firſt be made a mummy of, in which ſtate they may occupy a ſolitary nich in the gloomy dungeon, erected by big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry and folly, from whence on the commencement of a new ſtate of things, they may in their mummied ſtate, emerge to be held up to deriſion, as contraveners of the laws of nature. The atmoſpherical air is common ſtock, and ought not to be ſuffered to be polluted by any man's avarice or folly.</p>
            <p>Would it not be infinitely better, both for the ſake of humanity and commercial benefit, that when a malignant diſeaſe rages on board a veſſel newly arrived in port, the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033465_0029_0FF742CF19D7FB68"/>
crew ſhould be ſent on ſhore to a proper ſituation, where neceſſary attendance could be given them, and the veſſel, after being ſufficiently impregnated with animal vital air, ſuffered to unload, than be obliged to perform that tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expenſive and abſurd operation called a quarantine?</p>
            <p>This naturally brings us to the conſideration of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſome importance, to wit, Is the Yellow Fever contageous? By contagion I underſtand a ſpecific diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, capable of being communicated to a ſecond perſon in one or two ways, either by actual contact and leſion of the ſkin, of which kind are hydrophobia, ſyphilis diſeaſe, leproſy, yaws and itch; or by the medium of the atmoſphere through the abſorbent veſſels, on the ſurface of the body, of which kind are the ſmall pox, meaſles, chicken pox, and hooping cough; theſe are all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that are, literally ſpeaking, contageous according to the definition of the word as above ſtated; but although I do not conſider the Yellow Fever in all ſituations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, yet in certain caſes it approximates ſo near to it, that it becomes difficult to draw the line. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a man in health viſiting a patient in the Yellow Fever, in an atmoſphere that has not more than 20 per cent of animal vital air in it, would probably under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances of heat and tendency, acquire the ſame diſeaſe; this looks ſomething like contagion, though it be in fact very diſſimilar, for let the patient be removed to a room where the atmoſphere contains 28 per cent of animal vital air, and the heat and tendency are the ſame as in the former caſe, yet he might be viſited there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſafety. An hundred inſtances of this kind might, if neceſſary, be adduced from the hiſtory of the diſeaſe in Philadelphia and New-York. That vegetable vital air might be abſorbed through the abſorbent pores, or the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body, I think extremely probable, but under what circumſtances in might be done ſo as to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to health, I can find no facts that lean to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concluſion. Can animal vital air be abſorbed in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033465_0030_0FF742D2E0AC97F0"/>
the ſame way?<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr. Prieſtly, in making ſome experiments to aſcertain to what ſource the colour of the blood is owing, relates a fact which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt concluſively determines this queſtion in the affirmative. He expoſed freſh drawn blood to vegetable vital air, to atmoſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal air, and to animal vital air; in the firſt of which it quickly became black throughout, in the ſecond, red on the ſurface but black below, in the third, the red on the ſurface was much more vivid: he then filled a bladder with blood and expoſed it to animal vital air, which acquired a red colour over its whole ſurface. If then the affinity between blood and animal vital air is ſo great as in form an union through the intervention of a bladder, the probability is ſtrongly to be preſumed, that an union may take place on the ſurface of the body.</hi>
               </note> it would become a very valuable diſcovery if it could be determined in the affirmative. It is a hint that might be improved on by thoſe who have it in their power to make the requiſite experiments. A means of determining with facility and certainly the exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the component parts of the atmoſphere is likewiſe wanting; the utility of it is very obvious.</p>
