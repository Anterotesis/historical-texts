            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REPLY TO AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Advocates of a cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the low chicanery of aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt evident untruths, of impoſing meanings on words which they do not import, and perverting the arguments of their opponents to points, the contrary of which they moſt ſolidly prove; it is difficult to determine whether they exhibit clearer evidence of weak heads, depraved hearts, or a bad cauſe. A conduct ſo deſtitute of candor and honour, may tend, for a time, to raiſe a miſt before the eyes of the weak and ignorant, and ſeduce the credulous and unwary; but cannot, for a moment, draw the ſenſible part of mankind into thoſe ſnares which <hi>your</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and deſtructive ſchemes of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have already, in idea, prepared for them. The ſight of the Americans, too long blinded by your ſophiſtical diſtinctions, and incoherent arguments, is daily growing clearer. True information reſpecting their rights and duties,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014060_0003_0F92DD27AFFEAAB8"/>
and your pernicious deſigns, are pouring in upon them. And were you not tranſported and infatuated with the wild ſcheme of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own importance upon the ſeparation of two great countries, whoſe intereſt and ſafety are inſeparable; you would perceive that the honeſt and wiſe in both, are raiſing a firm oppoſition to your meaſures; and that, like the viper in the fable, you are gnawing a file, which will wear out your own teeth before you will blunt the ſofteſt part of it.</p>
            <p>To convince you of this truth, if poſſible, and diſabuſe mankind, whom you have been deceiving by your wild and novel ideas of government, ever ſince the unhappy aera of the Stamp-act, I mean to trace you through all your artful meanders and ſophiſtical laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths; and to ſhow to the world, that your laſt doctrines are as replete with fallacy and abſurdities, as thoſe which are long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by all America. But before I enter upon a particular Reply to your Anſwer, I will take a general View of it; and there every Reader will find that its ſole aim is to ſhew that <hi>the ſeveral Colonies are not members of the Britiſh ſtate, but ſo many diſtinct, independent ſtates, veſted by their reſpective inhabitants</hi> with a <g ref="char:startq">“</g>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power, as SUPREME <hi>and as</hi> UNLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITED <hi>as the power of the legiſlature of Great Britain,</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> This Gentlemen, is throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014060_0004_0F92DD284CE61BD8"/>
off the maſk with a witneſs. The cloven foot, which has hitherto been artfully and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly concealed, by thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the management of your deſigns better than yourſelves, is here exhibited to our view in all its horrid deformity. The black ſcheme of independence, which is to rear its head out of the ruinous horrors of a civil war, is now boldly aſſerted and publiſhed; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a total ſeparation of each Colony from the Parent State, is the avowed object of your ambitious deſigns. Permit me, in the name and behalf of the virtuous and loyal part of America, to thank you cordially for <hi>blabbing this long concealed and moſt important ſecret.</hi> It will inſtruct them, in future, to be upon their guard againſt your manoeuvres, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to oppoſe, with ſucceſs, the ruin you are preparing for them.</p>
            <p>It is a diſagreeable taſk to travel through all your groundleſs aſſertions, ſophiſtical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, and ill-founded principles. They diſplay ſo great a want of candor, ſo much mean ſubtilty, and ſo little regard for truth, that it is painful to find human nature capable of deſcending to ſuch low expedients. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unpleaſing as the taſk may be, my duty to my country ſhall prevail.</p>
            <p>In the firſt paragraph of your Anſwer, you begin with a malevolent untruth—one ſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014060_0005_0F92DD2A5068FD20"/>
ſhameleſs and eaſily detected, that I ſhould not waſte paper in reſuting it, was it not on account of thoſe who are apt to ſwallow aſſertions without examination. You there tell us, I have laboured to ſhow, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that America has no rights at all, and that we are the moſt abject ſlaves on earth.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Knowing that I had done the reverſe, and ever wiſhed to put the mildeſt conſtruction on human conduct, even upon <hi>your's,</hi> however injurious, I ſought for an apology for this bold aſſeveration, through all the pages of the pamphlet; but not finding any, I turned to your Anſwer, and in the latter end I find you confeſs your <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Remarks are haſty,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> that is, as I conclude, <hi>paſſionate</hi> and <hi>raſh.</hi> This conſtruction, charity command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to put on your conduct; for to ſuppoſe that you could publiſh to the world ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt an untruth, with temper and deliberation, is to ſuppoſe that you are loſt, not only to all ſenſe of candor, but character.

repreſentation, we had loſt the enjoyment of thoſe rights, yet we had neither ſurrendered, forfeited nor loſt thoſe rights themſelves; but that on the contrary, we ought, in juſtice as well as policy, to be reſtored to the firſt and great right of Engliſh freedom, a participation of the ſupreme authority, and <hi>all the other rights of Enliſhmen,</hi> upon ſuch principles of liberty and policy as ſhall ſuit our local and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Nor did I ſtop here; but offered a variety of cogent arguments to induce the Americans to petition for, and the State to grant, them—Thus endeavouring, from the moſt diſintereſted motives, to lend my ſmall aid towards uniting two great countries by the firmeſt bands of political freedom, into one <hi>grand and illuſtrious Empire:</hi> Under which union, upon every principle of reaſon and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, all <hi>our preſent grievances</hi> muſt be relieved, and we ſhall hold the <hi>beſt of all political ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt the future.</hi> Let this union be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and all the fetters upon American manufactures, and all the burdens and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions peculiar to American trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, muſt be removed. The American merchant will enjoy the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ght to trade to every port and place, where, by treaty, the merchant in Britain may trade—and the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican manufacturer will be at liberty to ſet up every kind of manufacture. Becauſe, under this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014060_0007_0F92DD2B465980E8"/>
union, the cauſe and reaſon of all thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, prohibitions, and unjuſt diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Engliſh ſubject in Britain, and one in America, ceaſe of courſe. For, when America ſhall, by the union, be reſtored to a capacity of diſcharging, with <hi>juſtice and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality,</hi> all her duties to the ſtate, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that firſt and moſt eſſential one, of granting the <hi>neceſſary and juſt aids to the ſtate;</hi> and the ſtate ſhall have the <hi>like political</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with reſpect to America, which it hath as to its other members, that ſhe will do ſo: No reaſon can poſſibly ſubſiſt why the Americans ſhould not enjoy the ſame rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which the other ſubjects of the ſtate do enjoy. Nor can it be of the leaſt conſequence to the ſtate, whether a ſubject grows rich by his labour or commerce in the city of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or on the <hi>Ohio;</hi> provided it can obtain a juſt and reaſonable proportion of his wealth, when neceſſary for the protection and ſafety of the Empire. Upon this obvious principle of reaſon and juſtice, Calais, Wales, Cheſter, Durham, and Scotland, upon their reſpective unions with the Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were taken into its boſom, and veſted with all the rights of Engliſh ſubjects. And upon the ſame principle, they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to America. Such muſt be the happy effects of an union between Great Britain and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014060_0008_0F92DD2E64E59650"/>
her colonies—Such the fortunate change in favour of America, which would emerge immediately from a condition the moſt ſlaviſh, limited in her manufactures, reſtrained and prohibited in her commerce, and bound by laws, in the making of which ſhe does not participate, into all the <hi>rights, liberties and freedom, of the moſt free ſtate upon earth.</hi> Is it poſſible that any men whoſe minds are not fraught with dark and ſiniſter deſigns, can, upon cool reflection, prefer to a condition replete with ſuch important benefits, an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> which muſt lead us into the diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate of a conquered people, after being reduced by the calamities of a civil war!</p>
            <p>But to follow you now cloſely; you ſay, that I have laid it down as a principle that there muſt be in every ſtate a <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſupreme legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, univerſal in extent over every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;—that the Britiſh Parliament is the ſupreme legiſlature of the colonies, and that the Coloniſts are therefore ſubject to its laws.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Now this is a partial and corrupt repreſentation of the doctrine of the pamphlet:—It is but one half of the truth:—Becauſe, although I have aſſerted, that the Parliament is, ever has been, and muſt, from the nature and reaſon of civil ſociety, continue to be, the legiſlature of the Colonies while they remain members of the Britiſh State, there being no
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014060_0009_0F92DD2FA8339C58"/>
other; yet I have alſo added, and ſubſtantially proved, that in order to give the laws of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the ſame equitable and conſtitutional obligation in America, which they carry with them in Britain, ſome new proviſion, ſome conſtitutional union between the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſhould be adopted, to reſtore the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to their antient and eſſential right of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the power of making the laws: That this right was originally, and yet is, of the eſſence of the Engliſh government—That without it, the parliament is as abſolute and deſpotic over the colonies, as any monarch whatever who ſingly holds the legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; to which I have ſubjoined many ſolid reaſons to induce the colonies to aſk for, and the Britiſh ſtate to grant it. But all this part of my argument you choſe to omit; becauſe it contains a flat contradiction to your ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs charge: For it now evidently appears, when the doctrines of the pamphlet are taken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered together, that they are as different from your repreſentation of them, as Light is from Darkneſs—Truth from your aſſertions.</p>
            <p>Finding that the neceſſity of a <hi>ſupreme legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature in every ſtate</hi> was too clearly proved to be denied, you have been obliged to confeſs it: And in order to ſhew that every Colony is <hi>an independent State,</hi> and conſequently not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſupreme power of Great Britain,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014060_0010_0F92DD2FDF8CFEF0"/>
you have, without ſhame or remorſe, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a number of the moſt fallacious, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ſophiſtical poſitions. You begin with acknowledging, that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>wherever men have, <hi>from a ſtate of nature, entered into a ſtate of ſociety,</hi> there muſt be ſomewhere lodged a power to make laws obligatory on all the members of that ſociety;<g ref="char:endq">”</g> and then you aſk, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Whether we have not a legiſlature in Pennſylvania, in the hands where the community have placed it?<g ref="char:endq">”</g> This you ſay, cannot <g ref="char:startq">“</g>be denied—<hi>It's power</hi> within the bounds of the province, is <hi>as ſupreme</hi> and as unlimited as the power of the legiſlature of Great-Britain.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>—"Here," you add, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the principle of Mr. Locke applies.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> In ſupport of theſe dogmatical aſſeverations, you have not offered to the public a ſingle ſhadow of proof! Nay you have not even attempted to carp at, much leſs to deny or refute, thoſe inconteſtible facts and arguments, which demonſtrate the contrary, and are to be found in the pamphlet from page 10 to 24.—But in what an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſituation have you involved yourſelves, if I ſhould ſhow that not one of this group of aſſertions, to which you would apply your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is founded in truth or fact—that they are all inventions of your own brain, contrary to your own knowledge of the facts, and that they never exiſted elſewhere?

you will become of your <hi>Application?</hi> To evince this will be no arduous taſk: For, 1ſt, The Pennſylvanians did not <g ref="char:startq">“</g>from a ſtate of nature enter into a ſtate of ſociety;<g ref="char:endq">”</g> but ſome of them were originally members of the Britiſh State, who emigrated from one part of its territory to another, with intent to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate that territory, and to extend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and intereſts of the nation, of which they ſtill remained a part; and the others came from other eſtabliſhed ſocieties, which they relinquiſhed, in order to become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Britiſh government. 2dly, The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of Pennſylania is not <g ref="char:startq">“</g>in the hands where the community have place it:<g ref="char:endq">”</g> But where the Repreſentative of the ſupreme legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of Great Britain originally "placed it;" who had no authority to diſcharge it from its ſubordination to the Britiſh State, or to render it "<hi>ſupreme</hi>" and <hi>independent.</hi> In 1682, King Charles, as Repreſentative of the State, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nnſylvania into an inferior and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate body politic, by virtue of the power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally veſted in him to conſtitute infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Corporations. In this grant, Section 4, among other privileges, be granted to William Penn, and his heirs, and to his and their Deputies and Lieutenants, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>by and with the advice, aſſent and approbation of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

And I will next ſhow you, that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the power of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, is not ſupreme, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited as the power of the legiſlature of Great Britain,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> 
               <hi>by the words of its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> nor <hi>ſupreme</hi> in any ſenſe of the word, which I will define for your ſakes who do not appear clearly to underſtand the meaning of it.

               <hi>having none equal in power;</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> and in this ſenſe you may find that all authors on government uſe it. Now the legiſlative power of Pennſylvania is not "<hi>ſupreme,</hi>" but reſtrained and limited in a

variety of inſtances, by the expreſs words of the grant under the authority of which it has been eſtabliſhed, and by the power which gave it exiſtence. The laws which this legiſlature is impowered to make, are confined to ſuch as are <g ref="char:startq">“</g>not repugnant to, but as near may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be agreable to the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>ſtatutes.</hi> and <hi>rights of the kingdom of England;</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> and the proprietor, who is the firſt branch of this legiſlature, is made anſwerable for <g ref="char:startq">“</g>every wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defualt or neglect permitted by him, againſt the <hi>laws of trade and navigation,</hi> and ſuch other forfeitures and penalties as by <hi>acts of parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus we find that the legiſlature to which you would apply Mr. Locke's idea of <hi>ſupreme,</hi> having <hi>none equal in power,</hi> is an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, limited</hi> and <hi>reſtrained legiſlature</hi>—having no power by its conſtitution to make any laws which ſhall be repugnant to the <hi>laws, ſtatutes</hi> and <hi>rights</hi> of a ſuperior; and bound, under a <hi>forfeiture of its rights,</hi> to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>ſuch legiſlative acts</hi> as were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

of Parliament? Is not this the caſe alſo of the corporation of Briſtol, and many others in England? Look into the charter of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the city where you live, and which you ought to underſtand, and you will there find, that full power is granted to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to make <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſuch, and ſo many good and reaſonable laws, ordinances, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as ſhall ſeem neceſſary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <hi>for the government of the city:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It alſo ſeems, in your novel and refined ideas of government, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>it would be irregular and monſtrous to ſuppoſe us ſubject to two legiſlatures.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Surely your pen has here written what your underſtanding did not dictate.

            <p>Fatigued as I am by my reſearches into the numerous abſurdities upon which you have endeavoured to erect the ſupremacy and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the colonies, I ſhould ſtop here, did not one yet remain, upon which you greatly rely, ſtill more profoundly ſtupid than all the reſt. You tell us, "this <hi>ſupreme power</hi> of each colony, is ſubject to our ſovereign's negative."</p>
            <p>Could the great Mr. Locke ariſe from the grave, and hear his idea of a "<hi>ſupreme power,</hi>" thus corrupted and applied to a power ſubject to the <hi>controul of another;</hi> I much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his philoſophy and religion could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his reſentment at ſuch unintelligible jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and horrid nonſenſe. In your notions of government then, it ſeems, that a <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> a power <hi>higheſt in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> having <hi>none equal in power,</hi> may be ſubject to a power <hi>higher</hi> than the <hi>higheſt,</hi>

or to <hi>one ſuperior,</hi> which can repeal and annihilate all its acts. Again—this <hi>ſupreme power</hi> of the ſeveral colonies, is in your ſenſe of things, ſubject to the power of <hi>the King</hi>—and yet not to the <hi>legiſlative authority of Great Britain,</hi> which <hi>that King repreſents,</hi> and from which he <hi>derives</hi> all his powers; and without <hi>whoſe authority,</hi> Mr. Locke expreſsly declares, he <g ref="char:startq">“</g>is but a <hi>ſingle, private perſon, without power, without will, that has any right to obedience!</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
            </p>
            <p>Thus upon a candid examination, all your arguments adduced to ſhew that the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures of the ſeveral colonies are ſupreme,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> are either founded on falſe facts; or are inconcluſive, or abſurd; and cannot "<hi>apply</hi>" to any principle, to be found in any treatiſe on politic law or government whatever.</p>
            <p>Equally unſucceſsful you will be found in your attempt to prove, that the oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, taken by the ſubject in America, is not taken to the King as Repreſentative of the Britiſh ſtate, <hi>but as a diſtinct Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſeveral legiſlatures of the Colonies.</hi> You aſk. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Where is the abſurdity of ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an oath of allegiance, taken by a Pennſylvanian, to be taken to him, to the King as Repreſentative of the ſupreme le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power of Pennſylvania?<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Here we perceive, in order to ſeduce the Colonieſts

from their connection with the Britiſh State, his Majeſty is veſted with a new capacity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and unthought of before; and when its propriety or neceſſity is enquired into, it will be found as wild and abſurd as it is novel. You yourſelves have told us, that the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority of Pennyſylvania is placed in the Governor and Aſſembly; and you know that all the other colony legiſlatures are either veſted in a Governor and Aſſembly, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Council and Aſſembly, or Proprietor, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Council and Aſſembly, or Governor and Council alone. You alſo know that they derive <hi>all</hi> their authority from the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Britiſh ſtate; and yet you inſiſt that this <g ref="char:startq">“</g>repreſentative is the diſtinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative<g ref="char:endq">”</g> of theſe ſeveral inferior legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latures. That is, in other words, that the repreſentative of the whole ſtate, is a diſtinct and ſeparate repreſentative, of its ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate parts. Or, that he is the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of his own repreſentative, of his own delegates, or ſubſtitutes: A repreſentative being a perſon who <hi>acts in the place of another, a ſubſtitute in power.</hi> And thus to ſerve your own ends, you make his Majeſty act in the place of, and as a ſubſtitute in power to, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inferior Governor,—Council and Aſſembly in America, who derive all their powers from him. What will you at length make of his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014060_0019_0F92DD3787B1AA60"/>
Majeſty and the Parliament? You firſt took it into your <hi>learned,</hi> heads, philoſophers-like, to conceive that the ſupreme legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is indiviſible in its nature, was, like matter, diviſible <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> and under this profound miſtake, you began with ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dividing it, until by one ſlice after another, you have hacked and <hi>pared</hi> it away to leſs than an atom. And not content with thus mangling the moſt beautiful and regular political ſyſtem in the world, your barbarian pens have now attacked, with equal glee, the royal authority. Your firſt attempt was to degrade his Majeſty from the illuſtrious office and dignity of a <hi>King of the realm, and all its appending dominions,</hi> to the inferior office of <hi>King of America,</hi> a part of thoſe dominions. Since the congreſs, you have thought that rank too exalted for him; and therefore have dubbed him only King of each inferior colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And now you are graciouſly pleaſed, in the abundant overflowings of your loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, to drag him down lower ſtill, to the mean office of an <hi>inferior</hi> repreſentative, or ſubſtitute, of the repreſentatives and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of his own power. And thus from the fertility of your amazing geniuſes, you have, out of the ingredients which compoſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority of the Britiſh ſtate, formed <hi>an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But let me aſk you, in what treatiſe on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did you find this new-fangled diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction? When, and by what act, have the colony legiſlatures delegated their executive powers to his Majeſty? When did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty give up his repreſentative capacity of the Britiſh Legiſlature, and condeſcend to accept of this new, inferior delegation? Pray tell us this in your next <hi>modeſt</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>You may poſſibly here aſk, do not the oaths of allegiance, as now taken, enforce an obedience to the laws of the colonies, as well as to the laws of parliament? I anſwer, they certainly do. But yet they are not taken to the King, as a diſtinct repreſentative of each colony Legiſlature, no more than the oath of allegiance adminiſtered to a citizen of London, is taken to him as a diſtinct repreſentative of the laws of that corporation; but to him as <hi>repreſentative of the whole ſtate,</hi> from which every ſubordinate authority, and the colony legiſlatures in particular, originally derive their powers; and to which, whenever they ceaſe by forfeiture, or otherwiſe, they all revert;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014060_0021_0F92DD38C80F3798"/>
and from which alſo they muſt reflow, being grantable only by its repreſentative.</p>
            <p>But conſcious that you could not efface the ſacred obligation of the oaths of allegiance, and pervert their true meaning by this refined diſtinction, you take other ground, and aſk, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>does not every American acknowledge that he is bound by the common law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſuch ſtatutes as were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſettlement of the colonies,—and which are applicable to our ſituation? Is not the King ſupreme executor of thoſe laws? And where is the abſurdity of <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> the oaths of allegiance to relate to him as <hi>ſupreme executor of thoſe laws,</hi> which we acknowledge do bind us; and at the ſame time rejecting the abſurd and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous idea of its including an obligation to be bound by every law which the Britiſh parliament has, or may make?<g ref="char:endq">”</g>—To what do you intend to reduce the meaning of theſe oaths at laſt, by your abſurd <hi>ſuppoſitions?</hi> You firſt, by a <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> are for confining their force and obligation of obedience to the laws of the colony legiſlatures;—and then by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> to the common law, and ſuch ſtatutes as were made before the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the colonies; and I verily believe when you ſhall make your third <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> which I ſuſpect will not be until you have

               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> It is much more eaſy to aſſert than prove; and more difficult to anſwer nonſenſe than ſenſe. Convinced of theſe truths, you have often peſtered me more with your dogmatical aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and nonſenſe, in a few lines, than by all the ſenſe in your whole performance. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I do not underſtand what you mean by a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014060_0025_0F92DD3BEA6E51E8"/>
"<hi>mere</hi> corporation." And yet I ſuſpect you have annexed to it ſome emphatic idea. The dictionaries tell us it is a <hi>corporation,</hi> or a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration</hi> only. Now a corporation, or a <hi>mere</hi> corporation, if you pleaſe, is an inferior body politic, eſtabliſhed under the authority of the principal ſociety; and in the Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are eſtabliſhed by a charter from the King, or repreſentative of the Britiſh ſtate, in whom the power of incorporating inferior and ſubordinate ſocieties, or bodies politic, is veſted by the conſtitution. This power, or the practice of it, is not peculiar to the Britiſh government. We find them in almoſt all civilized ſtates, being neceſſary to render the grand ſyſtem more manageable and regular: But theſe political bodies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their exiſtence, and deriving all their powers from the principal ſtate, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate. <hi>The hiſtories</hi> of all ſtates give no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the contrary. And all authors upon politic law, agree that an independent corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration within the territories of the principal ſtate, is <hi>a monſter,</hi> a thing <hi>out of nature;</hi>—and that the <hi>ſupreme authority</hi> itſelf can have no right to eſtabliſh a thing ſo inconſiſtent with the uniformity and ſafety of the ſtate. Hence the colonies can be conſidered only as corporations, or ſubordinate bodies politic, veſted with <hi>legiſlative</hi> powers, to regulate their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014060_0026_0F92DD3CA38D70C0"/>
own internal police, under certain regulations and reſtrictions, and no more. But you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that though the King may incorporate inferior communities, with municipal rights and privileges, it does not follow that he can grant to <hi>mere</hi> corporations" <hi>full legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers!</hi> This is ſtrange jargon, and amounts to this—That though the King may do an act, yet it does not follow that he can do it. One of theſe municipal rights which is uſually granted by the Crown to inferior corporations, is authority to make all neceſſary laws for the regulations of its internal police: And I know of no bounds by which this prerogative is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, either by the principles of politic law, or thoſe of the Engliſh conſtitution; except that he cannot diſcharge the corporation or its members from their obedience to the ſupreme legiſlature. But let us gratify you by ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you contend, that the reverſe is true; and that the King by his prerogative of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating inferior communities, could not grant "the full powers of legiſlation" which he has granted to the Colonies; in what an unhappy predicament are they involved? For if he has not ſuch power, under this prerogative, you, with all your wiſdom, and knowledge of the Engliſh conſtitution, cannot derive it from any other ſource, or find it elſewhere; and it muſt be of neceſſary conſequence, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014060_0027_0F92DD3D81F4EE48"/>
of the Colonies has been granted <hi>without authority, and is therefore void.</hi> Such are the <hi>bleſſed</hi> concluſions of your arguments—ſuch the miſchievous tendency of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines! From whence learn how dangerous it is for men to dabble in ſciences they do not underſtand; or to attempt to vindicate rights they know nothing of.</p>
            <p>You find great fault with my idea of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; and after taking much pains to miſrepreſent all I have ſaid upon the ſubject, without offering a ſingle argument, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelves with drawing the concluſion that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>enough has been ſaid to ſhew it <hi>to be erroneous.</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> Had you ſaid that I had not founded American rights on the partial repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of <hi>perſonal property</hi> in England, you would have been much nearer to truth. And you might have perceived, had not your "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks" been too "haſty," that my deſign was to eſtabliſh them on a more tenable and ſolid foundation—to trace the right to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in the legiſlative authority from that principle, which in the Engliſh conſtitution was original, and remains permanent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered to this day; carefully avoiding to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, as you have done, on props and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which might be proſtrated by the moſt trivial blaſts. It was for this reaſon I did not chooſe to tread on the ground of perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014060_0028_0F92DD3E0C5881D8"/>
or that of perſonal property, which is very partial and inadequate, and <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> did not form a part of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. For let me tell you what you ſeem to be ſtrangers to, that anciently, and for many ages, none but the proprietors of lands were repreſented in parliament; that even the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes repreſented lands within their buroughs, and that neither the <hi>Ceorles</hi> nor <hi>Thanes,</hi> who were the farmers, living on rented eſtates, however wealthy, were repreſented; except ſuch <hi>Thanes</hi> who held their lands of the Crown and paid for them <g ref="char:startq">“</g>in ſervice which related to the public.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> And in confirmation of this truth, you will find that our anceſtors when they ſought for and obtained a perfect reſtoration of the ancient conſtitution, all they aſked of King John to grant them, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, by Magna Charta, was to ſummon to parliament thoſe who repreſented the <hi>landed intereſt,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> "<hi>The Abbots, the Earls, the greater Barons, and the Tenants in capite.</hi>" Every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in politics knows that ſince the Conqueſt, a number of corporations and buroughs hold rights, either by preſcription or grant, to ſend members to parliament, in ſome of which the trade, and not lands are repreſented; and alſo that this kind of repreſentation was not a part of the ancient conſtitution, but an innovation—that it is eſteemed by all good judges a rotten
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014060_0029_0F2DD3EC670DD60"/>
and dangerous part of the conſtitution; and therefore I do not believe there are more than <hi>two novices</hi> in the world who would cenſure or carp at a perſon for not fixing on it as a pillar to ſupport American liberty.</p>
            <p>It would occupy the leaves of a folio, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely to follow you through all the groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of your ideas of repreſentation—Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwered them in general, I ſhall content myſelf for the preſent with giving the Reader one other ſpecimen of your knowledge of the Engliſh conſtitution. After giving us a truly ridiculous idea of Engliſh repreſentation, drawn from the petty democracies of Greece, you tell us—<g ref="char:startq">“</g>therefore it is provided by the Engliſh conſtitution, that the people (meaning all men of property, whether landholders or others) ſhall exerciſe this power by their repreſentatives. This is the principle of repreſentation by which <hi>every man of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in England has a voice in Parliament.</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> Now I will not take upon myſelf to deny, but it may be poſſible that theſe two political magicians may, from their profound reſearches, have diſcovered ſome antient, and hitherto la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent manuſcript which has taught them, that our anceſtors formed their repreſentation upon the model of the Grecian democracies;—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not wiſh to ſuſpect that they could venture, without ſome kind of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014060_0030_0F92DD3FA851BB48"/>
to advance a fact ſo univerſally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.—However, I affirm that every author who has written on the Engliſh government, within the laſt thouſand years, informs us, that it was originally eſtabliſhed by our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Anglo-Saxons; and that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of it was, in all probability, taken from the forms of their governments in their own country, where the proprietors of the land compoſed the legiſlature. But whatever this manuſcript may have told them, certain I am it never could inform them, that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>every man of property in England has a voice in Parliament.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> In every corporation which ſends members to Parliament, the right to vote is confined to the members of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; to the excluſion of all the other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, however wealthy. In London, that great and populous city, none can vote but thoſe who are made free of the city. In Briſtol, the caſe is the ſame. In others, the members of Parliament are choſen by twelve only; and in ſome, by leſs. So that it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed, that not one thirtieth part of the inhabitants of Britain, holds <hi>by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> a right to vote. Do you not, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, know this to be fact? If you do, how far beneath the characters of men of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity and honour have you deſcended to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance untruths, ſo eaſily detected?</p>
            <p>

You next make a feeble attack on the Plan of Union propoſed in Congreſs, with a view to prevail on the members to deſert their wild and deſtructive ſchemes of independence; and to adopt, in its ſtead, ſome ſyſtem of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with Great-Britain. The amount of your objections is, that the Delegates, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the plan, who are to be <hi>freely choſen</hi> by and from <hi>among the people,</hi> are not to be truſted. And after ſuppoſing what, in the nature and reaſon of things, is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that they will be <hi>corrupted,</hi> though their election ſhould be annual; you ſay, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the truſt is too ſacred.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>—That neither wiſdom nor policy would <g ref="char:startq">“</g>dictate the leaving the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of a country to the virtues of any men, however conſpicuous,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> I much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, Gentlemen, whatever your declarations may be, was that truſt offered to either of you, as protectors of the colonies, like your great maſter, whoſe ſteps you are <hi>as yet</hi> following at humble diſtance, you would reject it <hi>in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> only; but would take care, if you could find the means, to ſecure it in ſubſtance. This moſt certainly is what you aim at. It follows from your own poſition. For if the "liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a country." are not to be left "to the virtues of any <hi>men,</hi> however conſpicuous," and yet are to be committed in truſt at all, it muſt of courſe, be to <hi>one man</hi>—a Protector.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014060_0032_0F92DD412288AAF0"/>
And who can that protector be, but one of yourſelves? But let me ſeriouſly aſk you, Where can the liberties of mankind be ſo ſafely repoſed as in the hands of their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, who are accountable to them, and who cannot deſtroy or injure <hi>their</hi> rights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtroying or injuring their <hi>own?</hi> Is not this the very predicament, in which, ſound policy has ever placed the liberties of all free people? Has human wiſdom ever invented a better, or one more ſafe? But it ſeems the "fallibility of human nature" has taught you, that there are "other props and pillars" upon which you mean "to ſupport your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties." What they are, you have not been ſo obliging as to inform us; but left us the taſk of finding them out; which is by no means a difficult one. For making the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of your whole performance the clue, we readily diſcover, that theſe "props and pillars" can be nothing elſe, but the <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>ſword,</hi> the <hi>civil wars,</hi> into which you are, by your ſyſtem of independence, unneceſſarily leading your deluded country.</p>
            <p>After having thus, in vain, attempted to ſhew that the plan is <g ref="char:startq">“</g>idle, dangerous, whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and miniſterial;<g ref="char:endq">”</g> you aſk, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>If it was indefenſible, why did not the author enter into the argument with a Gentleman from Virginia, who challenged him to it;

and who ſaid he could prove it big with deſtruction to America?<g ref="char:endq">”</g> You have unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly given a juſt and reaſonable anſwer to your own queſtion, and vindicated the author againſt the charge you intended to aſperſe him with: For you add, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>tis true, he did ſay he would defend it, if the Congreſs would appoint a day for that purpoſe; but this was when all was hurry, and the forms of buſineſs only, delayed their breaking up.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Here you have for once loſt your uſual art. It is a difficult taſk for men, however hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kneyed in deception, to continue uniform in it. Truth will now and then, in ſpight of all the pains to ſuppreſs it, pop out. For it ſeems by your own confeſſion, when this challenge was made, "<hi>all was hurry,</hi>" and the Congreſs was about to break up. And do you think that this was either a proper time to <hi>give</hi> or to <hi>accept</hi> of a challenge to diſcuſs, by fair argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the merits of a plan, in which, as was acknowledged by a Maſſachuſett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And was it not juſtifiable in the Author, and the other advocates of the plan, who were a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the men of the firſt abilities in the Congreſs, to decline it? And was it not all that reaſon or honour required of the author
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014060_0034_0F92DD4299AF2648"/>
to tender an acceptance of the propoſal the next day or any other day which ſhould be appointed? Eſpecially, when he knew it had been previouſly determined at the <hi>new tavern</hi> to expunge it, with the rules taken on it, totally from their minutes. However, that gentleman and his colleague, who in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pledged himſelf to do ſo, have now had ſufficient time to ſhow it, "big with deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to America;" and yet they have choſe not to undertake a taſke ſo arduous, I might ſay impoſſible. And now I call on you, and all your independent compeers, to prove this plan, in any reſpect, inconſiſtent with the freedom of America. You have been nibbling at it for ſome time, in your private cabals, and now in public; but you find your aſſaults have not even ruffled its ſcarf-ſkin. You have read it, and meditated upon it over and over again; and yet you know not what to do with it. It ſtands, like an impregnable bulwark, in the path to your independence; and you know not how to remove it. Here is your great objection againſt it; and for this <hi>only</hi> reaſon you fret, and fume, and rage ſo much about it.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this head, let me tell you that, altho' the author is confident no good objection can, with propriety or reaſon, be made againſt the plan by America, <hi>ſeeing ſhe denies a repreſentation in Parliament:</hi> Yet he
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014060_0035_0F92DD434BB3A6B8"/>
neither is, nor ever was, tenacious of it: That his great aim, as he declared in Congreſs, in propoſing it, was to prevail on them to take the ground of rational accommodation and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation with the parent ſtate: And therefore that he would moſt chearfully adopt any other which ſhould be thought more eligible, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tend to thoſe neceſſary and ſalutary purpoſes; ſhould the one propoſed, on examination, be rejected. In the ſame diſpoſition of mind, the Author ſtill continues, from a full conviction, ariſing from a long and mature conſideration of the ſubject, <hi>that the ruin of America can only be averted, by a candid ſtate of her grievances; and ſome rational propoſitions of a union between the two countries, upon a conſtitutional plan.</hi> And as to his inclination to be ſent over as a "Delegate" to ſolicit the cauſe of America, with which you charge him—He never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the wiſh. He will make himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy at the accompliſhment of ſo great and good a work, let it be performed by whom it may. But, Gentlemen, he never looked for ſuch a charge from <hi>you.</hi> And had not that ſame deſire exiſted in <hi>one,</hi> if not <hi>both</hi> of your breaſts, you never had made the charge. Had he, like <hi>one</hi> of <hi>you,</hi> ſignified ſuch a deſire to a Delegate in Congreſs, and thereby prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Delegate to propoſe <hi>him alone</hi> to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the petition to his Majeſty; and further
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014060_0036_0F92DD442980EC78"/>
like you, had his mind been ſo puffed up with vanity and conceit of his own abilities and importance, as officiouſly to accept of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, in Congreſs, before it was offered, or he could poſſibly foretel the determination of a Majority; and afterwards had he met with the mortification of a refuſal: I ſay, had the Author of the Plan acted this vain and forward part, your charge would have had ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. But you know he did not: And therefore I cannot avoid applying to you the old Latin adage, <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori cui culpa redarguit ipſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You, in the next place, inperiouſly aſk, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>How dare you, Sir, in the face of America, aſſert, that they, the Congreſs, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no plan of accommodation, and that every page conveys ſentiments of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?"<g ref="char:endq">”</g> I will tell you, Gentlemen—was I capable of being bullied by your menaces; was I to be intimidated and frightened by that lawleſs power which you have greatly contributed to erect in America, I ſhould not dare to do it.

Re-examine their claim of rights, the great baſis of American pretenſions, and we ſhall find that the claim of the congreſs is an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right of legiſlature in all caſes of taxation and internal polity; <hi>and that to the legiſlature of Great-Britain, there is not left the leaſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a law of any denomination or kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever for the colonies.</hi> And you yourſelves have now inſiſted that the legiſlature of every colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is <hi>equally ſupreme and as unlimited</hi> as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of Great-Britain. Are not theſe clear, evident declarations of independence? and do you think you have already, by your deſpotic authority, ſo effectually ſubdued the ſpirit of liberty, and even the freedom of ſpeech, that we dare not call facts by their true and proper names? If you do, you are groſsly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.

            <p>One word more before I conclude; you ſay the author of the plan of union, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſigned the aſſociation.

But that he and a number of other delegates did not ſign it as their <hi>private act,</hi> or as <hi>binding on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their conſtituents,</hi> is as true. Nor was the ſigning of that gentleman and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others who voted againſt many parts of the aſſociation, and particularly the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation agreement, which many foreſaw would be ruinous to America, held or eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014060_0039_0F92DD470B41CE30"/>
in congreſs as their <hi>private act,</hi> and which they pledged themſelves to ſee carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: Otherwiſe, the congreſs knew they never would have ſigned it. And therefore to prevail on them to ſign it, it was ſaid it ſhould be done <hi>by order</hi> of the congreſs; and then it would be the act of a majority, and not of each private perſon, nor his particular act. That ſuch was the caſe of a ſpeaker of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly who ſigned a bill or other legiſlative act <hi>by order,</hi> tho' againſt his judgment, which could not be conſidered as his private act, but that of the majority who made the order. In conſequence of this mode of reaſoning, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was made, and the clauſe next preceding the delegates names was added to the aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe words. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the foregoing aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being determined upon by the congreſs, <hi>was ordered</hi> to be ſigned by the <hi>ſeveral</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, and <hi>thereupon</hi> we have here unto ſet our <hi>reſpective</hi> names <hi>accordingly.</hi>
               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> Now, however juſt this reaſoning may be thought, it was the reaſoning of the congreſs and it was one, among other reaſons, which prevailed on the author of the plan, and a number of other delegates to ſign the aſſociation. Thus you find that the laſt effort of your malevolence to ſlander the character of this gentleman, has, like the reſt, proved abortive; and muſt recoil upon yourſelves, as both of you were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014060_0040_0F92DD47CD5F7640"/>

            <p>I will now conclude with giving you my ſerious advice. I think you ſtand in much need of it; and I aſſure you I really intend it for your benefit, and it muſt be owing to your own perverſeneſs if it ſhould prove otherwiſe. Take it therefore ill or well I care not. Know then that there is ſuch a thing as honour and candour in argument, and that whoever deſerts them for the ſake of perverting truth, loſes character, and muſt be deſpiſed by all ſenſible and honeſt men. Believe, that a bad cauſe can never be ſupported by ſophiſms, bold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, or evident untruths; and that the fair cauſe of liberty requires no ſuch aids. Do not perſuade yourſelves, that by your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry you can render that "ſupreme" and independent, which in its nature is limited, ſubordinate and dependent: Nor that you can, by your futile diſtinctions, pare away the eſtabliſhed meaning of the moſt ſacred things—nor induce the honeſt and virtuous to perjure themſelves, and with the load of that perjury in their hearts, to take up arms againſt their lawful Sovereign. Lay aſide your reveries of independence, and your high expectations of gratifying your ambition on the ruins of your country; for the virtuous and the wiſe of that country are aware of your deſign, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
