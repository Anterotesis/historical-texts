            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE ſcience of hiſtory has its peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and is in ſome reſpects ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful and important. The pleaſing and profitable are here ſo blended together, that it is alike calculated to entertain and improve. Such are the changes and revolutions in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtoms, that the hiſtory of a few years back, affords, perhaps more agreeable novelty, than the inventions of the fanciful in our own time. Hiſtory, eſpecially eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hiſtory, is alſo a ſource whence may be drawn the foundeſt maxims of prudence, and moſt ſubſtantial improvements in piety. We here become acquainted with a variety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom we never ſaw, may learn their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, trace their motives of acting, and thus acquire great knowledge of mankind. While we are here furniſhed with many illuſtrious models of goodneſs, benevolence, and piety; we alſo light on characters of a contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, whoſe pride and ambition, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and vice, and conſequent overthrow, are
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033798_0003_0FF92F031D12EAB8"/>
on record for our admonition. The authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic hiſtory of the church does indeed contain the records of divine providence towards her, and furniſhes us with indubitable teſtimony, that a holy God will not ſuffer iniquity and vice to go unpuniſhed, nor virtue and piety unrewarded.</p>
                  <p>Senſible of the many important advantages reſulting from a careful attention to eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hiſtory, the inſpired penman in this Pſalm gives a brief hiſtoric detail of God's marvellous dealings with his ancient people; and of their ungrateful requital of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; from their departure out of Egypt, to the time of David's promotion to the throne of Iſrael. Many things occur in the hiſtory of this people, ſo extraordinary and important, adapted to admoniſh and inſtruct all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations, that they ought never to be forgotten. And thus God expreſsly enjoined upon the Iſraelites, at the giving of the law, that they ſhould not only ſtudy it, and become thoroughly acquainted with it themſelves; but alſo faithfully inculcate it upon their children, that the knowledge thereof, might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through every ſucceeding generation—<hi>For he eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a law in Iſrael, which he commanded our fathers, that they ſhould make them known
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033798_0004_0FF92F19C3665C80"/>
to their children; that the generation to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their children.</hi> In exact conformity to this precept was this Pſalm compoſed. Though we have a hiſtory of the ſame events at large, elſewhere; yet we here have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment, containing only the more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and important occurrences, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the whole is reduced into a ſmall compaſs, may be collected at once, and hence is more adapted to immediate uſe.</p>
                  <p>For the inſtruction and admonition of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations, the pious and learned, on various occaſions, have taken great pains to collect materials for, and to furniſh the church with, authentic eccleſiaſtical hiſtories; and tranſmit to poſterity every thing calculated to ſubſerve the intereſts of religion—That the Jews, in ages to come, might ſee the bread which God provided for their fathers in the wilderneſs, he directed Moſes to have an omer full of Manna laid up in a pot, before the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Lord, and there to be kept for their generations.</p>
                  <p>This pſalm is introduced, with a mixture of authority and affection, ſuitable to a divine teacher. <hi>Give ear, O my people to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth;</hi>"
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033798_0005_0FF92F2E651B8EB8"/>
that is, attend with reverence to the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive admonitions I am now about to give you, taken from the memorable events of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, relative to your forefathers, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit your devout regard, and that of every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding age to the end of time. <hi>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of old.</hi> Though this pſalm contains a narrative of facts, eaſy to be underſtood; yet, if we conſider it as having a typical reference to goſpel times, it then becomes parabolical, as to its ſpiritual meaning and ultimate deſign. And thus Paul, referring to things related in this pſalm, ſaith, <hi>now all theſe things happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them for examples, and they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> And the things that I am about to relate, are ſuch as <hi>we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us:</hi> that is, they are not things that have been done in another nation, and among another people, and hence of doubtful credit; but they are things that you have heard, and known to be on record in your ſacred books; which your forefathers, who were eye-witneſſes of them, have faithfully regiſtered, and tranſmitted to you.</p>
                  <p>My text next follows, which the pſalmiſt appears to have uttered with an ardour of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033798_0006_0FF92F3AC67F96E8"/>
and a moſt generous regard for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of religion, in generations to come.—<hi>We will not hide them from their children, ſhewing to the generation to come the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works that be hath done.</hi> Though the recollection of the ingratitude, with which your forefathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited the marvellous goodneſs and grace of God, is humiliating in the higheſt degree; that did we merely court the applauſe of their children, we ſhould paſs in ſilence this unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant part of the hiſtory; yet, as this may be profitable for their admonition, we will hide no part from them—We will relate with the ſame fidelity, thoſe things that may mortify, or excite pain, as thoſe that are calculated to afford pleaſure. We will not conceal any thing from their children. The principle which actuated the ſacred hiſtorian, was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and animating. Not confining his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſelf, nor to a few particular friends, nor yet to the people of his own time, his views reached forward into futurity, and his love embraced millions of unborn ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion. The prophetic grace imported to him, expanded his ſoul, and extended his views to the generations to come, and raiſed his thoughts ſuperior to every thing low or groveling. His conduct on the occaſion, does
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033798_0007_0FF92F4E034E34E8"/>
honor to him as a citizen of Iſrael, as a patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and is worthy of him as a prophet of the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shewing to the generation to come,</hi> or the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter generations of chriſtianized Gentiles, as the meaning may probably be. This conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives the prophet's views a ſtill further extent and larger ſcope. His love was warm—his pious zeal fervent—his language animated—his object grand and important, the glory of God, in the welfare of all ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works,</hi> mentioned in the text, were, is obvious from the context. They were his marvellous acts of righteouſneſs and grace, towards his ancient people, from the time they left Egypt, to the royal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of David over them.</p>
                  <p>From the text thus explained, I ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe, with ſpecial application to this church and ſociety; taking notice of the more remarkable or leading providences of God towards her, from her firſt origin to the preſent time, which is now one hundred years. That we may adhere as ſtrictly to the ſpirit of the text, as the occaſion will admit, I purpoſe to draw a parallel, or point out the reſemblance, between <hi>the praiſes of the Lord
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033798_0008_0FF92F61CF4E3298"/>
and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works,</hi> towards Iſrael, in the period to which this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rory relates; and towards you, and your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. Though it might favor of arrogance and ſuperſtition, to ſuppoſe that the Iſraelitiſh church was intended to ſet forth this, or any other chriſtian ſociety in particular; yet in the former we have an emblem of the whole chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church in general; and perhaps more ſtriking inſtances of reſemblance can be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in few chriſtian ſocieties, than in this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. The Iſraelites could ſay, at the time this hiſtory commences, that they ſprang from anceſtors of eminent piety—Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob. Though ſome of their poſterity of later times, have prided themſelves in their pious deſcent, in a manner that did them no credit, either as men, or as pious men; yet it is doubtleſs a privilege of no inconſiderable value, to deſcend from pious anceſtors—To be dedicated to God in infancy, and placed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pale of the viſible church by believing parents, to have their prayers treaſured up before God in our behalf, and our minds early furniſhed with pious inſtruction, and nurtured to habits of virtue; are privileges, which no conſiderate perſon will undervalue—and thus the advantage of being a Jew formerly, and the profit of circumciſion, ſaith Paul, are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033798_0009_0FF92F7F582E5690"/>
much every way, chiefly, becauſe that unto them were committed the oracles of God—Now theſe are privileges with which you were born; and in the enjoyment of which you have grown up—You ſprang from anceſtors of eminent piety; who gave ſtrong proof of the ſteadineſs of their faith, and of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken adherence to their chriſtian principles—In the firſt inſtance, to eſcape perſecution, or that they might guilty enjoy a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the worſhip of their God; and that the morals of their youth might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to corruption among a diſſolute people; your forefathers fled acroſs the Atlantic, and chearfully ſubmitted to all the hardſhips that attended the ſettlement of a wilderneſs of a northern climate—Though they endured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible ſufferings of cold, hunger, and nakedneſs; and dangers from the ſavage natives of America, and other cauſes; yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Jews, who were for returning to their bondage and oppreſſion in Egypt, we never hear them complain of the lot, providence had appointed them. Moſes eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt—And they preferred a good conſcience to eaſe and wealth—And perhaps in no part of the world ſince the days of the Apoſtles, has religion flouriſhed more, or in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033798_0010_0FF92F95F28359C8"/>
greater purity, than in New-England, the land where they fixed their habitation. They took pains, to have the goſpel immediately planted with them, and taught among them. Theſe are the people from whom you ſprang, and their prayers for you are not at this day obliterated from the book of God's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Did your fathers do ſo much, in their reduced and diſtreſſed circumſtances? What then ought you their children to do, at the height of proſperity, to which you are raiſed?</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. The Iſraelites left Egypt under the guidance of Moſes the ſervant of the Moſt High, and accompanied by Aaron, who was appointed by God to miniſter to them in holy things—And your fathers left Dorcheſter, Roxbury, and Milton, in the ſtate of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, accompanied by a Miniſter of the goſpel. When they came on to theſe ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern provinces, it was not it appears in order to flee from the preſence of the Lord, nor to rid themſelves of religion, as a burdenſome or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable thing—they ſet too high a value on the goſpel and its ordinances, to diſpenſe with them; and were no doubt perſuaded, that to walk with God in all his holy inſtitutions, is the ſureſt road to proſperity and happineſs in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and entirely neceſſary to a well

grounded hope of admiſſion into a better—Hence, when they ſet out, the Ark of God muſt go with them, or they furniſh themſelves with a goſpel miniſter, who is ordained to their particular charge—Their fathers, breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, and friends, accompany them down to the ſhore; where, after kneeling down and mingling their ſupplications to the God of all grace, they take leave of one another, with every expreſſion of chriſtian tenderneſs and brotherly love, expecting to meet again in a ſtate of inſeparable union to each other; and to Jeſus their common head.</p>
                  <p>No people that are wiſe, will abandon or treat with neglect the ſacred inſtitutions of the goſpel; for they are ſcarcely leſs conducive to the peace and welfare of ſociety in this world, than to fit men for bleſſedneſs in the next.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. When the Iſraelites left Egypt, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them the religion and worſhip of the true God, into a land overſpread with iniquity and idolatry. And one leading object, which your fathers contemplated, in their removal to the ſtate of South-Carolina, was, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the ſettlement of churches and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of religion in the Southern plantations</hi>; a ſtriking evidence of their diſtinguiſhed pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and zeal for the general diffuſion of the knowledge of the goſpel of peace.—Probably
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033798_0012_0FF92FC9367F2C00"/>
at the time your fathers came on to Carolina, there were few or no religious ſocieties regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly organized in that ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Am informed by a perſon who has ſeen the records of the church in Dorcheſter in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, that they mention that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper had not been celebrated in the ſtate of South-Carolina, until by this church.</note> Hence they felt the neceſſity of bringing the goſpel with them, that they might not be deſtitute of a bleſſing which they prized more than wealth. Being animated from on high, by a generous zeal for the ſpread of that goſpel, which is able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation; they were induced to leave their fathers, their brethern, and their native land. How far they ſucceeded in this laudable deſign, we at this day are not able preciſely to aſcertain. That their example in this particular is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, worthy of the imitation of the chriſtian world, while nations of our fellow men are periſhing through Heatheniſh ignorance, none may doubt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Moſes and Aaron died, and were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in office by Joſhua and Eleazer. The Reverend paſtor, Joſeph Lord, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied your forefathers from New-England, to South-Carolina, has alſo had ſucceſſors in the ſacred office of the goſpel miniſtry in this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033798_0013_0FF92FDD00457540"/>
church. The firſt was the Reverend Hugh Fiſher, who died on the ſixth of October, 1734—The Reverend John Oſgood ſucceeded him, and entered on the paſtoral charge of this church, the twenty-fourth of March, 1735: and died the ſecond of Auguſt, 1773; whoſe ſympathy and affection, as the friend of his people—whoſe labors, as the ſervant of Chriſt—whoſe watchfulneſs, as the biſhop of ſouls—whoſe care, as the ſhepherd of his flock—whoſe piety, fidelity, and ſucceſs in the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial work, will by you be remembered to his praiſe for generations to come; and are now ſtars in the crown of his rejoicing in Heaven, which ſhall ſhine with growing ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, when yon great lamp which illumes the heavenly orbs ſhall be put out: for they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as the ſtars for ever and ever.—The three ſucceeding years after the death of Mr. Oſgood, the church was occaſionally ſupplied, by Dr. Zubly, Meſſrs. Cook, Daniel Robarts, and others.—In the year 1776, the Reverend Moſes Allen ſucceeded to the paſtoral charge of this church, and continued in it until No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1778, when it was entirely broken up, and diſperſed by the Britiſh army. At the concluſion of the war, the people returned
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033798_0014_0FF92FF036E0DBD0"/>
to their plantations, and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to meaſures for the reſtoration of their religious privileges, ſtatedly aſſembling on the Lords day, previous to their procuring a Miniſter, and uniting in the duties of ſocial worſhip. In Auguſt 1784, the Reverend Abiel Holmes entered on the miniſterial work among you, and continued his pious labors with you, until the twenty-firſt of June 1791—Your preſent paſtor ſucceeded him in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred office the fourth of the enſuing Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—And ſirs, your fathers are gone as well as your miniſters, and you have riſen up in their ſtead—One generation paſſeth away, and another haſteneth after it—We have here no continuing city. With our loins girded, and our lamps trimmed and burning, ſhould we therefore hold ourſelves in readineſs to go hence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. The Jews were a pilgrimating people. Forty years they had their encampments in the wilderneſs, journeying from place to place, without any fixed abode—This alſo hath been a pilgrimating church—In the year 1696, or probably in the beginning of the year 1697, your fathers arrived in South-Carolina, where they made a ſtand, and named their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Dorcheſter, after the place of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. They continued here about fifty-ſeven
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033798_0015_0FF930006B09E9F0"/>
years—When, finding their lands inſufficient for the riſing generation, and a diſpoſition in numbers, from this circumſtance, to remove; and apprehending this would operate to the injury of the ſociety, and eſpecially to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of ſuch as ſhould leave it, they wiſely contemplated a general removal—And after ſending forward ſeveral perſons, at different times, into this ſtate, to ſeek out a convenient ſpot, and prepare the way; and hearing from them a good report of the lands, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of the ſociety with Mr. Oſgood, who at that time was their paſtor, effected a removal to this place in the year 1754. The remaining part followed them, as ſoon as their circumſtances would admit—thus evidencing their brotherly love—their union of heart, and unaffected regard for goſpel ordinances. The ſame attachments and ſentiments of piety were again manifeſted, in the univerſal return of the people to their plantations, at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Britiſh war. Happy is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe hearts are united by ſupreme affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the God of love, and to one another by pure chriſtian friendſhip. If this be your caſe, aſcribe the whole praiſe to him, whoſe great love is the ſource of all our bleſſings.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. The ancient people of God found much oppoſition to encounter, and many difficulties
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033798_0016_0FF930105B5CE200"/>
to ſurmount in their various journeyings—At one time they lacked bread, at another they were parched with thirſt, at another again, their progreſs was oppoſed, by nations hoſtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclined towards them—And in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as well as others, their ſtate in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was intended to ſet forth that of the chriſtian church; and has been reſembled by this ſociety in particular—Your difficulties and trials, and thoſe of your fathers, have been many and great, perhaps almoſt ſingular—They doubtleſs had many difficulties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, in their firſt ſettling in Carolina—Many ſad diſcouragements, heavy loſſes, and diſappointments, alſo attended them in their removal from Carolina into this ſtate—And the loſſes you ſuſtained, and the ſufferings you endured in the Britiſh war, exceed deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were equalled perhaps by few ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in America—Your houſe of worſhip, dwelling houſes, and crops were conſumed by fire; yourſelves driven from your plantations, and diveſted of your property for many years; and your lives expoſed to the mad unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cruelties of men, ill affected towards the American cauſe—And your ſavage neighbors, have been, as pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your ſides almoſt continually—The peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence alſo hath prevailed among you, to a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly

degree in many inſtances—What numbers of you are conſtantly clad in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth? With more than common emphaſis may it be ſaid of you, that one generation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and another haſteneth after it—A few years give an almoſt entire change of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this church—The aſpects of providence have often been dark and threatening towards you; and you have been admoniſhed of the Lord out of the whirlwind—Happy are they, who endure the chaſtenings of the Lord as ſons and daughters, patiently ſubmitting to his rod—While they, who like a refractory bullock, harden themſelves againſt diſcipline, and thus provoke the holy one of Iſrael to caſt them out of his preſence, and abandon them of his care, are inexpreſſibly wretched.</p>
                  <p n="7">7th. Though the Jews were an afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet the interpoſing goodneſs of God was on many occaſions ſignally manifeſted in their favor. When ready to be ſwallowed up by their enemies, with a ſtrong hand, and an out ſtretched arm, the God of Jacob granted them deliverance and victory—He guided them in the wilderneſs like a flock, and led them on ſafely—He gave them laws and teſtimonies, and entruſted them with the oracles of divine truth. To them prophets and teachers were raiſed up, and a Saviour revaaled. <hi>Aſk now,</hi>

ſaith Moſes, <hi>of the days that are paſt, which were before thee ſince the day that God created man upon the earth, and aſk from one ſide of Heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</hi> Did ever people hear the voice of God ſpeaking out of the midſt of the fire, as thou haſt heard, and live? or hath God aſſayed to go and take him a nation from the midſt of another nation, by temptations, by ſings, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? Though neither this, nor any other church under the goſpel, hath been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the reſt of the world, as the Iſraelites were formerly; yet have you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced many diſtinguiſhing marks of divine favor—under the frowning aſpects of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you have often ſuſtained much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, than you have been ready to expect. Judgments have been intermixed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies—At other times, dark clouds have been diſpelled, your ſky has brightened, and you have been unexpectedly lifted on high by proſperity—God hath given you, not only the neceſſaries and comforts of life, but wealth, and an abundance of leiſure, in which you have had
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033798_0019_0FF9304176C8E700"/>
excellent opportunities of furniſhing your minds with uſeful knowledge, and becoming thoroughly acquainted with his laws and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies—By the goodneſs of God, you have alſo had his word and ſpecial ordinances diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to you with but little interruption—When the paſtoral office hath been vacated, the Lord hath interpoſed in your favor, by healing the breach, and filling up the gap in a little time— The diſpenſing of goſpel ordinances, appears alſo to have been attended with conſiderable ſucceſs among you: that we hope and truſt, not a few, in the courſe of a century paſt, from this church, have joined the church triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; who are now mingling their ſongs of praiſe to the Lamb that was ſlain, with thoſe of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the celeſtial choirs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8th. The Jews were formerly a people by themſelves, encloſed on every ſide by Heathen nations—In ſome degree ſimilar hath been the ſtate of this church—She hath been ſo detached in her ſituation, as to be able to have but little intercourſe with any regular church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt—Her neighbors, inſtead of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any friendly aid to the ſupport of religion, have termed her members <hi>Saints,</hi> by way of reproach, and endeavored to laugh them out of their religion. And as the providence of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033798_0020_0FF930551100B8E0"/>
God was particularly concerned, in preſerving the Iſraelites, a diſtinct people, and preventing them from intermixing with their Idolatrous neighbors; ſo when we conſider the local ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this church, the preſervation of her exiſtence to this day, is doubtleſs to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſpecial care, and interpoſing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heaven; and ought by you, to be numbered among the diſtinguiſhed praiſes of the Lord. It has been often remarked of this ſociety, that they diſcover a ſingular attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one another, while they treat ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with a degree of ſhineſs—This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hath probably, in the train of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, contributed conſiderably to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the truth and ſimplicity of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel among you—Without directly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this treatment of ſtrangers, it may not have ſo much ariſen, from that narrow and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal ſpirit, to which it hath generally been imputed as from other cauſes—Particularly, from a concern for the morals and piety of the riſing generation, and a conviction that you needed the utmoſt vigilance, to protect them from the contagious influence of vice and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion.—Nor are we to impute your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the faith of Jeſus, principally to your own wiſdom and vigilance. As the Iſraelites had been often overwhelmed by ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033798_0021_0FF93072D4151918"/>
and idolatry, had not the great Shepherd of Iſrael hedged up their way from deſtruction; ſo, to the ſame divine care are you indebted, that the ſeducing artifices of ungodly men have had ſo little influence, in leading your youth aſtray; that your children have been taught to walk in the ſteps, and to pattern after the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their fathers—That a ſociety, locally ſituated as you have been, ſhould be preſerved from general ſeduction one hundred years, muſt be attributed to the gracious care, and powerful protection of that heavenly Father, who keepeth covenant and ſheweth mercy unto them that love him and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unto a thouſand generations.</p>
                  <p n="9">9th. The Jews were a ſtiff-necked, perverſe, and rebellious people, who ſet not their hearts unto the Lord, and whoſe ſpirit was not right with God—And to what ſhall we impute the diſtreſſes and calamities, that have befallen this church, but to their ſins? Though this is not a ſtate of retribution, in which exact juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is diſtributed; yet a righteous God chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens not thoſe who ſin not—Your iniquities have been the occaſion of all your painful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities—And while we hope, that theſe in the main, have been ſent in mercy, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled to the advancement of your religious wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, it would ſurely be wiſe in man to avoid
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033798_0022_0FF930888F95BF00"/>
that ſin and diſobedience, which render afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions needful—You are to remember, that ſin derives great and awful aggravation, from the light ſinned againſt, and the convictions that are withſtood. And as the ſins of the Jews were, in theſe reſpects peculiarly aggravated; ſo it is a circumſtance that hath rendered your ſins highly diſpleaſing in the ſight of God, that they have been committed againſt the cleareſt light, and the richeſt diſplays of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love—The Jews formerly were favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above other nations in a religious point of view—In like manner have you been favored in this reſpect above many; yea above moſt others—Not to mention other things, perhaps you have too much reſted in, and relied on your external privileges, and tokens of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favor; minding too little the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part, the temper of your minds and the ſtate of your ſouls; and have been more concerned to bear the name, than to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the character of chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="10">10th. The Jews, though a ſtiff-necked and ungrateful people generally, yet there were many perſons of eminent piety among them—And that your fathers were men of eminent piety, appears from ſeveral circumſtances, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuggeſted. As further proof of this, we may add, their indefatigable endeavors and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033798_0023_0FF9309E860CCC30"/>
care, to have the ordinances of the goſpel regularly and faithfully diſpenſed to them—As often as the miniſterial office hath been rendered vacant among them, they have made immediate application, for the healing of the breach and the filling of the vacancy; ſeeking the direction of infinite wiſdom, and looking up to the great fountain of bleſſings for ſucceſs. And though, in ſeveral inſtances, they have failed in their firſt applications; yet diſcouraged by no difficulties, they have ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſevered, until ſucceſs hath been granted them.—When deſtitute of a miniſter, they have uniformly kept up public worſhip on the Lord's day, reading practical diſcourſes. Their punctuality in ſupporting the goſpel, is alſo to be noticed, as an evidence of the high value they ſet on it, and of their unaffected regard for it—When you ſee a people creating difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about ſupporting the goſpel, it may be marked as a ſymptom of declenſion in the ways of God—May the eminent piety of your fathers, enkindle your zeal, and animate you to pattern after their example.—How your ſtanding is now, compared with former times, may not be eaſy to aſcertain—It is to be feared, you have ſomewhat degenerated, from the purity and Godly ſimplicity of your forefathers—In numbers you appear rather to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033798_0024_0FF930AB21DE8070"/>
encreaſe—From the beſt accounts I have been able to obtain, the church now conſiſts of ninety-eight white perſons, and forty-nine blacks, in all, one hundred and forty-ſeven—Fifty-one have been received to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſince my reſidence among you, which is now five years—twenty-ſix white perſons have died from the communion in that time—ſay, eight or ten blacks, and three or four white communicants have removed from us—That the church now contains about twelve mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers more, than it did five years ago. This ſeems matter of ſome encouragement, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſtrengthen your faith, and animate your hope, that the prayers treaſured up with God for the preſervation and proſperity of this church, will be heard, and anſwered through generations to come. May the Lord Jehovah be a wall of protection around about you, and a glory in the midſt of you; crowning with abundant ſucceſs, your pious care, to ſeaſon the minds of your children with wiſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inure them to habits of virtue; that they may be induced to tranſmit with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the principles of our holy religion to their children, and the generation to come be taught, to fear the God of their father.—</p>
                  <p>Laſtly. God gave the Iſraelites corn from Heaven, and fed them with Angels food—
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033798_0025_0FF930B7A100F1B0"/>
And you have been furniſhed with the true bread of life, of which the Manna was but a faint repreſentation. <hi>Your fathers did eat, Manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead,</hi> ſaid Jeſus. <hi>I am the living bread, which came down from Heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live forever, and a man may eat of this bread and not die; and the bread that I will give is my fleſh.</hi> This bread hath been the food of every believing ſoul—Did God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, his ancient people with water from the rock to quench their raging thirſt? To you hath the inexhauſtible fountain of the waters of life ſtood open—To this you have been made welcome to come and receive, to the extent of your wiſhes—Jeſus, the rock whence theſe waters iſſue, hath been proclaiming to you, <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</hi>—Yea he hath been crying aloud, <hi>if any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink; and whoſoever will, let him come, and take of the waters of life freely.</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033798_0026_0FF930CB2F894BD8"/>
of Iſrael—His providence is to be no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticed in every ſtep you have taken; and his grace to be acknowledged, in all the great bleſſings beſtowed upon you.—They have all flowed from his everlaſting love, and are ſo many teſtimonials of his faithfulneſs to them that fear him and truſt in his mercy. To the ſovereign grace of God, is it to be imputed, that you were not with millions of others, born in a land of Heatheniſh ignorance and ſavage barbarity; that you ſprang not from profane irreligious parents; that you were not bred up ſtrangers to the way of life and peace. To the ſovereign grace of God were your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers indebted, for their eminent piety, by which they were induced to bring the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with them to this country; and to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved kindneſs are you to aſcribe, your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the goſpel and its ordinances, in ſo much purity at this day. Such of you as ſet any proper value on theſe bleſſings, or feel any ſuitable temper towards God, will be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively led, in view of theſe things, to enthrone him in your hearts, and to exalt him in your thoughts—Oh! beware of the ingratitude, diſobedience, and rebellion of the ancient Jews, as you would eſcape the awful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which they were viſited.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. By this ſubject, you ſhould alſo be led

to impreſs on your hearts, and to treaſure up in your memories, the great things which God hath done for you and your fathers—The paſſover was expreſsly enjoined on the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites as a memorial of their preſervation from that fatal ſtroke, by which Egypt was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and all her firſt born ſlain. Moſes and Aaron were directed, to lay up before the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Lord, the pot of Manna, to be a memorial in their generations, of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner in which God furniſhed their fathers with bread—And the principal deſign of this diſcourſe, is, to bring into view the ſpecial care, and diſtinguiſhed favor of Heaven towards this church in the generations that are paſt; that the preſent and ſucceeding ones may know and remember the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works that he hath done, in reſpect of their forefathers, to their laſting benefit—Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the things that you have heard, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on the tablets of your hearts, that you may be able to talk of them when ſitting in your domeſtic circles, and when walking by the way, that your children may be able to relate them to their children, and they again to theirs—They will have a happy tendency to cheriſh pious impreſſions, and to animate you to a ſteady regard for, and faithful adherence

of the eminent piety of your fathers, and as you deſire this day, to rejoice their righteous ſpirits, fill Heaven with ſhouts of praiſe, and acclamations of joy:—As you deſire to follow them to the courts of the bleſſed, and have them for your companions forever: as you would not be eternally excluded, from the preſence and love of that God, deprived of whoſe favor, exiſtence will be a curſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Leaving for a moment the century paſt, let us look forward through a century to come, and aſk, where will you be at the cloſe of it? Objects awfully ſolemn, here riſe into view. All ſwept off the ſtage of time—laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on the boundleſs ocean of eternity—not one will be left—Your fathers, who left New-England one hundred years ſince, are gone—not one of them remains—The ſame will be ſaid of you, one hundred years hence—You muſt then, either be ſuffering the righteous, unutterable vengeance of an holy God, with Devils and deſpairing Ghoſts, or ſharing with the bleſſed, the pure and endleſs joys, which a bleeding Saviour purchaſed, and which the glorious preſence of the exalted Redeemer ſhall kindle; either ſinking from gulph to gulph in Hell, under the pangs of eternal death; or towering, from glory to glory in Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in beautitude divine—Seeing ſuch grand and weighty matters are before us, and our
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033798_0030_0FF93115C55762C8"/>
time ſhort, how doth it ſtand us in hand to watch and pray.</p>
                  <p>Finally—By what hath been ſaid, you are taught, the great care and vigilance of your fathers, to preſerve their riſing poſterity from the contagious influence of vice and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſucceſs with which their pious efforts have been crowned—Permit me to recommend them to you in this particular, as affording an example, highly worthy of your immitation. Your pious paſtor, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded me in the miniſterial office, obſerving the peculiarities of your local ſituation, and the expoſed ſtate of your youth, often looked forward to the riſing generation with an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate concern, and carried your attention with him. Nor hath the ſubject been ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed over, during my miniſtrations among you—While it is believed, that you have not treated with diſregard your miniſterial admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions on this head; it is thought, that you cannot beſtow too much attention to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which the future exiſtence and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this church are ſo deeply concerned. Ye aged infirm parents, who are juſt taking your leave of us, feel the ſubject in its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; let it eſpecially occupy your thoughts, and employ your care, the few remaining hours of life—Account not yourſelves paſt a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for uſefulneſs, while your lips can utter a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033798_0031_0FF9312D21405058"/>
word of council or admonition; or your ſouls, breathe forth one pious wiſh to the God of grace, for his bleſſing on your offspring—Let the ſubject lie with weight on the mind of every parent. Oh! look forward, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of what infinite everlaſting conſequence, that your youth, and your little ones ſhould be guided in the path of life! Spare no pains, omit no care that may conduce to the training of them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord—to the eſtabliſhing of their minds in the principles of our holy religion, and inuring them to habits of virtue and piety. In the mean time, abide ſtedfaſt in God's covenant, plead his promiſes, and depend on his grace; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his faithfulneſs, and be encouraged, to look forward with hope—<hi>Jehovah</hi> is a great God, whoſe ſtrength and ſalvation the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites of old, often experienced; and your fathers long ſince. He is alſo a faithful God, who keepeth covenant and ſheweth mercy unto them that fear him, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—Let it therefore be your care, to ſhew unto the riſing generation, the praiſes of the Lord, and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works, and truſt in his grace; then may you fall aſleep in Jeſus, with tranquil ſouls and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hopes; for though you die, the church ſhall live among your children, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for ages to come.</p>

                  <p>THE diviſion of time into years hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained conſiderable uſe among men, in reſpect of ſettling and adjuſting their worldly matters. And is it not, at leaſt, equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that we endeavor to derive aid from this diviſion of time, in the regulation and adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the more weighty matters of our ſoul's concern? While we enquire into the ſtate of our accounts with our fellow men, as citizens of this world, how proper it is, that we alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ſtate of our accounts with God, as being his ſtewards, and candidates for the inexpreſſible and everlaſting rewards of the inviſible world.</p>
                  <p>The year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-ſeven laſt night expired, and we this morning have entered the threſhold of a New Year. There are a number of ſerious queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which it ſeems eſpecially proper, that we ſhould aſk ourſelves at ſuch a ſeaſon: there are many ſerious reflections and reſolutions, which it is highly ſuitable we ſhould make at
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033798_0035_0FF931982F58E150"/>
ſuch a time. If this diſcourſe may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of adminiſtering to your aid in theſe things, and thus of contributing to your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious welfare, the labor of it will receive the reward it ſeeks.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome things, that are valuable for their own ſake, and there are other things that are valuable, only as a mean of obtaining ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, or only in a ſubordinate view. Whether time is really valuable in any other but the latter ſenſe, ſeems to admit of ſome doubt; or in other words, whether, under the condition of there being no hereafter, that the concluſion of this life puts a final period to the exiſtence of man—is it better for us to be, or never to have been, ſeems not eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine—ſo many painful loſſes and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do the greater part of men in this life ſuffer, and ſo many ſcenes of anguiſh and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror do they paſs through, in this world of ſin and guilt, that the evil they endure, ſeems to equal or exceed the good they enjoy. Death and the grave, with their ghaſtly attendants, and the painful diſeaſes that uſher them in, we all have to account on as certain, or they are entailed upon us. And how often are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuffer, in a ſenſe, the pangs of death, in the loſs of one near connection and another dear friend? Therefore, ſaid the wiſe man,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033798_0036_0FF931A74FA5CC60"/>
I hated life; becauſe the work that is wrought under the ſun is grievous unto me; for all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.—But time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſeaſon in which to prepare for eternity, is of unſpeakable value. The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to which ſin hath made us liable, which await the ungodly in a future ſtate, and which, in time we enjoy the means of eſcaping; and the bleſſedneſs to which we may in time ſecure a title, being both, unutterable and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, render time unſpeakably precious—It is unſpeakably precious as a ſeaſon in which to effect theſe moſt valuable ends—yea it hereby acquires infinite value, as it is the only ſeaſon in which theſe infinitely valuable ends can be obtained.</p>
                  <p>In the context the Apoſtle addreſſed the Epheſian chriſtians, in a variety of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuited to their ſtanding, as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently emerged from a ſtate of Heatheniſh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance—"<hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs,</hi>" ſaid he, "<hi>but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children of light.</hi>" And in the verſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding my text, "<hi>ſee then that ye walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe.</hi>" Since you are happily brought from a ſtate of Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eniſh ignorance, to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt and the intereſting truths of his goſpel, ſo it is eſpecially incumbent on you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033798_0037_0FF931BB885CAFA0"/>
anſwerably to this privileged ſtate. Not fooliſhly undervalueing this goſpel, nor heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly neglecting to enquire whether any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is to be derived from it or not; but wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtimating the bleſſings it proclaims, and conducting with that chriſtian prudence and circumſpection, which ſhall moſt effectually ſecure to you a ſhare in them. The exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is purſued in my text, which next follows: Redeeming the time, becauſe the days are evil.</p>
                  <p>In diſcourſing from theſe words, I purpoſe, firſt, to explain the exhortation or injunction they contained; and ſecond, offer ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to enforce it. I am then firſt, to explain the exhortation or injunction in the text—"<hi>Redeeming the time.</hi>" This exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be remarked, has by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators been ſuppoſed to have been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally deſigned, as a caution to chriſtians to avoid perſecution, and not unneceſſarily to provoke their enemies, to cut off their lives in the midſt of their days. While it is not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that ſome chriſtians have improperly expoſed their lives to the rage of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; perhaps more from a ſpirit of bigotry and blind zeal, than from the dictates of an enlightened conſcience; and while it is not doubted, but that they have herein acted amiſs, yet, to admoniſh againſt imprudence of this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033798_0038_0FF931D5769B7630"/>
ſort, is ſcarcely to be ſuppoſed the principal object of this exhortation—The word redeem, or elſe the word in the original here rendered, redeeming, ſeem properly to denote, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſomething that we have loſt. The exhortation ſeems therefore eſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend or enjoin, extraordinary care and diligence, in improving every portion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining time in the beſt manner; and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting it to the moſt valuable purpoſes; that we may thereby, as far as poſſible, regain the years that we have ſpent in ſin and folly. Time thus ſpent may fitly be accounted on as loſt, or worſe than loſt.—The Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably had immediate reference to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, as having ſpent a conſiderable portion of their time in Heatheniſh ignorance, practiſing the moſt egregious enormities. He would therefore, by this conſideration, impreſs their minds with a deep ſenſe of the importance of extraordinary care and diligence, in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of their remaining time. And thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them in the proceeding context, of there having been ſometimes darkneſs; and of a number of the vile practices, in which they had freely indulged themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Happy would it be for the chriſtian world, were there none who have been born in a chriſtian land, and inſtructed in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033798_0039_0FF931E9C48ADB68"/>
of our holy religion from their tendereſt age; who nevertheleſs, have equal reaſon to liſten to, and regard this injunction, with the Epheſians, when addreſſed in the text—Where is the man that can ſay, he has not ſpent any, or even much time, in ſin and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in things that will turn to no laſting good account; and which therefore, he may fitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count on as loſt time? And who is there, that is not ſenſible, that it is eſpecially incumbent on him, from this circumſtance, to exerciſe extraordinary care and diligence, in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and improvement of his remaining time; thereby to recover, as far as poſſible, ſuch portions as are loſt?</p>
                  <p>But in order thus to redeem time, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that we ſhould be appriſed of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which properly belongs to time. While perſons miſtake this, it is unlikely that they will redeem time to any good purpoſe—The treaſuring up of wealth, the pleaſurable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and gratifications of the fleſh, may not be deemed the chief and proper buſineſs of man in this world. We need but a ſmall portion of earthly good things, for a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſubſiſtence here; and ſuch a portion may ordinarily be obtained, without making it our chief buſineſs to acquire riches. The ſeaſon in which we can enjoy them is ſo ſhort and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033798_0040_0FF8C8AC42CDA6C0"/>
precarious, and the gratification of bodily ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petites affords ſuch momentary delight; that to ſuppoſe God had primary regard to theſe, in allotting to man a ſeaſon in this world, is to entertain very unworthy conceptions of him. The buſineſs of man in time, is emphatically, to prepare for eternity. And thus the ſacred word enjoins, <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs.</hi>—Man having loſt the image, and forfeited the favor of God; and in his infinitely condeſcending goodneſs a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of grace being ſet up, he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to allot unto man a ſeaſon in this world, to retrieve the loſſes ſuſtained by the fall, and to ſecure unto himſelf an happy immortality. That preparation for eternity, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the proper buſineſs of man in time, does then eminently conſiſt, in regaining the image and favor of God; without which, rational exiſtence becomes a curſe. It will imply that we make our peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt—that we mortify the love of ſin in our hearts, and regulate our lives by the precepts of chriſtianity, that we preſs forward with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ardour of ſoul, after the moſt exalted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in that moral rectitude, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary to capacitate us, for the enjoyments of divine love. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs of man in time, to which every
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033798_0041_0FF9320F07AD7FF8"/>
other ſhould be held in entire ſubordination. Every ſcheme ſhould be formed, and every buſineſs be undertaken, with an ultimate view, to the furthering of this buſineſs. That time which is employed in putting forward this, is ſpent to good purpoſe; every advance we make in it, is ſo far obtaining the grand end, for which time is given to man. And that which is ſpent, in buſineſs foreign from, or unconnected with this, may be ſet down as ſo much loſt time. It paſſes away, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, only the memory of guilt and folly. To redeem time in the ſenſe of the text then is, to beſtow extraordinary care and diligence, that all our remaining time be employed to the beſt advantage, for the promotion of this work; that ſo we may, in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve loſſes ſuſtained, through the miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of former ſeaſons. This ſeems to be the only way, by which time can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, or ſuch loſſes retrieved; for there is no recalling time—The year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-ſeven is forever gone.</p>
                  <p>I paſs ſecond, to offer ſeveral conſiderations to enforce this injunction.—1ſt. We ſhould be induced to comply with it, by the conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of our having ſpent much time, foreign from the buſineſs properly belonging to it.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033798_0042_0FF93226B2613398"/>
That we have all done this, will ſcarcely be denied by any. We have lived, ſome ten, ſome twenty, ſome thirty, ſome forty, and others fifty years in this world—and what have we done? What worthy of rational immortal creatures? How many of theſe years are a mere blank, as to any thing good done in them? What a mixture of guilt and folly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the reflecting eye, even of thoſe who have been the moſt diligent and circumſpect? What ſad neglects have they to charge upon themſelves? How many blank days do they find? How little of the proper buſineſs of man in time have they executed, compared with what they might have done, or with what might reaſonably have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them? In reſpect of the laſt year, how little hath been done, compared with what might have been? What progreſs have you made in the knowledge and love of God? What victory have you gained over the world and the fleſh? And how much yet remains to be done? And alas! how many have never yet entered on the proper buſineſs of time? Have never yet commenced a life of holineſs, nor taken one ſtep towards making their peace with God? How many, whoſe whole life is a mere blank, as to any thing done, that will turn to any valuable account to them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033798_0043_0FF9324799E6C490"/>
How ſirs, ſhould theſe humiliating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations awaken up all our ſouls, and teach us the neceſſity of retrieving, as far as poſſible, theſe affecting loſſes, by extraordinary care and diligence in the improvement of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. We ſhould be induced to comply with the injunction in the text, by the conſideration of the ſhortneſs of our remaining time. The whole extent of time, from the beginning of the creation, to the preſent day, or even to the end of the world; is but a contracted ſpan, a hands breadth,—a mere point compared with the unnumbered ages of eternity. One ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of time bears a much greater proportion to ſix thouſand years, than ſix thouſand years do to eternity. The whole extent of time bears no proportion to, admits of no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with eternity. What then is the portion of time that falls to the lot of any one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual? What is the life of man at the preſent day, in reſpect of thoſe who live to what is termed old age? How much ſhorter ſtill muſt be our remaining time? Yet we are all living for eternity; preparation for that endleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſſive duration muſt be made in this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhort as it is, or go forever unmade. With what energy doth this teach us, that every hour ſhould be deemed precious; and that we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033798_0044_0FF9325BAC29D110"/>
ſhould beſtow the utmoſt care and diligence, to retrieve, as far as poſſible, paſt loſſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. You ſhould be led to comply with the exhortation in the text, by this circumſtance alſo, that the duration of your remaining time is exceedingly precarious or uncertain. You may certainly know that your remaining time is ſhort, while you know not how ſhort—A number of our friends who ſaw the laſt New-Year, are gone forever; and no doubt, before the concluſion of this year, a number of us will be gone, and time to us be no more. Whether it will be you, or you, or me, or how many of us, we know not; or to what day, or month in the year life will be prolonged, is quite uncertain. Should the eyes of any one or more of us, be faſt cloſed in the ſleep of death, before to-morrow's light, or this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's twilight, it would be no rare thing. However differently from this you may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating, whatever ſchemes you may be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for months and years to come; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unfiniſhed purſuits may now employ your attention; yet death is not wont to wait our time, but hath in ten thouſand inſtances over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken men at unawares, full of earthly ſchemes and purſuits. What then but one year more, or perhaps not a hundredth part of it, in which to redeem the miſpent time of the whole of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033798_0045_0FF8C8C2D7ADA540"/>
our former lives? How then ſhould we ſpend that? What extraordinary diligence is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us? And what care ſhould we take, that this diligence be employed in the beſt things; that every hour be devoted to the moſt valuable purpoſes? that ſo we may, as far as poſſible, buy back our loſt opportunities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. We ſhould alſo be induced to comply with the injunction in the text, by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that <hi>an happy, or miſerable eternity depends on the good, or ill improvement of time.</hi> It is from this circumſtance that time derives its chief value. Of however little value it may be conſidered in itſelf; yet its value in this relative view, exceeds all human calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the creature can comprehend nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the depth, fullneſs, and duration of that miſery, which we have an opportunity of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeing; nor the height, perfection, and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that felicity, which we have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſecuring in time. Time is thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely precious in a double point of view, for as on the good improvement of it depends our eſcape from infinite, everlaſting miſery, and our attainment of infinite everlaſting bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs—With what care and diligence ſhould we ſtudy, ſo to improve it, as to obtain theſe grand ends—a ſecure ſhelter from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming tempeſt of divine vengeance, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033798_0046_0FF9328AD8F85198"/>
an unfailing title to an inheritance in the Kingdom of Eternal Glory—And having loſt, having fooled away a conſiderable portion of our precious time, how ſhould we ſtrive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the loſs, by extraordinary diligence in future? And it is to be recollected, that a mere eſcape from future miſery, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of future bleſſedneſs, is not the whole that may, and ought to be done by us—There are different degrees in the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap alſo ſparingly; and he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap alſo bountifully</hi>—And again, <hi>there is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory. So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> None therefore may ſuppoſe, that nothing more remains for them to do; for they who have arrived at the higheſt attainments of piety, may ſtill arrive at higher, and will have ſtrong motives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time to the lateſt moment of life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. As a further motive to comply with the injunction, that is uſed by the Apoſtle in the text, offers itſelf to our conſideration—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time, <hi>becauſe the days are evil</hi>—The exhortation was addreſſed to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian chriſtians, at a time when they were threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with ſevere perſecutions, and were in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033798_0047_0FF9329E6AD72DA8"/>
danger of being deprived of their religious privileges. Now this was a proper motive, as well as that of their having ſpent much time in heathen enormities, by which to urge them to extraordinary care and diligence in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſeaſon, they then engaged. Though the days now, may not be evil in preciſely the ſame ſenſe; yet from the growing prevalence of infidelity and vice, the days may fitly be termed evil in a ſenſe, that ſhould effectually excite every friend to the chriſtian cauſe, to extraordinary vigilance in guarding his own mind, and eſpecially thoſe of our youth, from the contagious influence of vice, and in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting the malignant poiſon of infidelity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. Our immediate compliance with the injunction ſhould be gained, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the ſeaſon is haſtening on when time will be no more redeemable. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> There is a buſineſs properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to time, and which can be done only in time. When the night of death, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, ſhall overtake us, this work muſt ceaſe forever. In however imperfect a ſtate it ſhall then be, it muſt ſo remain. And in reſpect of thoſe, who ſhall then have utterly neglected this buſineſs, the neglect will be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033798_0048_0FF8CCA003D40AA0"/>
irreparable. There will now be no retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſpent paſt opportunities, by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diligence in future. Time will be irredeemable—To what care and diligence ſhould this conſideration excite us now, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming ſo valuable a bleſſing. When men ſuffer loſſes of a worldly kind one year, they ordinarily have an opportunity the enſuing year, and feel it incumbent on them, then to make extraordinary exertions, to retrieve thoſe loſſes. How much more ſhould they make extraordinary exertions, to retrieve paſt loſſes, in the more weighty matters, that reſpect the well being of their ſouls through the intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ages of eternity? Eſpecially when we conſider, that if this ſeaſon be neglected, the loſs will be irretrievable: that there will be no ſecond year or enſuing ſeaſon in which to redeem time—To give this conſideration its proper force, enquire within yourſelves, what would a poor tormented ſpirit in hell give, for ſuch an opportunity as you now enjoy of redeeming time? Oh! that we did more accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ourſelves, to live and act in the light of eternity!</p>
                  <p>Permit me to ſuggeſt one conſideration more, to enforce the injunction, and that is, the infinite price that was given to purchaſe time, as a ſeaſon of grace for fallen man—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033798_0049_0FF8C7DC62549AD0"/>
But for the wonderful interpoſition of the ſon of God, the dreadful penalty of the divine law, we may ſuppoſe, would have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately executed; at leaſt we could never have enjoyed time, as a ſeaſon in which to make our peace with God, and prepare for an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py immortality. We derive this bleſſing as a fruit of his infinitely meritorious obedience and ſacrifice. It muſt therefore, in its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eternity, be infinitely precious. And thus it deeply concerns us, by every extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary effort to redeem ſo precious a bleſſing, wherein we have loſt it. And be it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that time having been purchaſed for us at ſo dear a rate, muſt awfully aggravate the condemnation of thoſe, who conſume it in the vanities of this world; utterly neglecting the weighty buſineſs properly pertaining to it. It had been better for ſuch, never to have been born—never to have enjoyed time.</p>

                     <p n="1">1ſt. Let us improve this ſubject, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſtirring up our gratitude, and exciting our thankfulneſs, that we are ſpared to ſee the beginning of a New-Year; and for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033798_0050_0FF92E51E48E3338"/>
bleſſings conferred on us, in the courſe of the one that hath juſt expired. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to a number of our friends, who ſaw the laſt New-Year's Day, time hath ceaſed; they have gone down into the grave, and the ſtream of time hath launched their immortal ſpirits on the immeaſurable ocean of eternity. Their ſeaſon of probation hath ended, their work in time is done. Happy for them if it be well done. Well may we enquire, why is it that we are ſpared? Is it that we are ſetting a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value on time, and taking more care to improve it to the great purpoſes for which it is given to us? Or is it not rather the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing mercy of God that hath ſpared us, while others have been taken? And when we conſider the unſpeakable value of time, as a harveſt ſeaſon for eternity, how does this ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mercy of God, call for our warmeſt thanks? And how are our obligations to gratitude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when we conſider, that through the whole courſe of the year we have quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the means of grace? The beſt council, direction, and aid, for executing the great and proper buſineſs of time. The Lord hath been uſing means of cultivation with us, hath been digging about, and affording us important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, for fruitfulneſs. In addition, he hath loaded us with his temporal benefits, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033798_0051_0FF92E672CDE82E0"/>
crowned the year with an abundant increaſe—He hath bountifully ſpread our tables, and richly filled our cups with bleſſings. Let us therefore call upon our ſouls, and all that is within us to bleſs the Lord; to render unto him the tribute of praiſe, which his great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits claim.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. Let us improve the ſubject, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of enquiring in what manner we have ſpent the laſt year; and what cauſe we have for humiliation before God, that we have made ſo ſmall progreſs in the divine life.— How many hours and days have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mereſt trifles? How much of that precious time, on the right management of which a bleſſed eternity depends; and in the right improvement of every day and hour of which, our everlaſting happineſs is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree concerned; which thouſands on a dying bed, or in the inviſible ſtate would gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, at the price of the whole world, have we been devoting to purpoſes, moſt unworthy of the immortal dignity of man? To pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that anſwer no valuable end in reſpect of this life, and that render it incomparably worſe than loſt, in reſpect of the life to come. They who have been ſetting the higheſt value on time, and have been the moſt careful in improving it, muſt no doubt ſee much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033798_0052_0FF92E7E841B4CD0"/>
to charge upon themſelves. How little have you executed of the proper buſineſs of time? How little good fruit have you brought forth, compared with the religious cultivations with which you have been favored? How many important duties have you omitted, that might have been performed in hours ſpent in vanity? How much loſt time have you need to redeem? What cauſe of humiliation before God, of repairing to the blood of Jeſus for pardon, and to the king of Zion for freſh ſtrength?—And are there not ſome, whoſe whole lives unto this day is ſo much loſt time; who have never yet begun to execute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of time? About whom God hath been digging many years, expecting that they ſhould bear fruit, but who remain unto this day barren trees in his vineyard. Oh conſider! it is through the prevalent interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, that you have been ſpared ſo long. And is he not now coming, ſeeking the expected fruit from you? And what muſt become of you, ſhould he refuſe to interceed for you this year? Should he pronounce you henceforth <hi>curſed</hi>? And have you a right to expect any thing better then this? May the thought ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually awaken up your ſouls, impreſs your minds with a proper ſenſe of the unſpeakable value of time, and perſuade you, from this day
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033798_0053_0FF92E94837C74C0"/>
onward, to purſue with unremitting care and diligence that work, which above every other, claims the attention of man in this his ſtate of probation.</p>
                     <p>Finally; let us improve the ſubject, to the purpoſe of forming wiſe reſolutions, relative to the improvement of our remaining time; and of beginning this day to carry them into effect. By a little attention to the ſubject, you will probably be able to diſcover ſome of your principal omiſſions of duty; and ſome of the principal things, that have been wont to conſume your precious time. And as in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns, you improve your arrangements for the enſuing year, in the light of paſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; ſo much more ſhould you, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more weighty concerns of the world to come. Remember that you have much loſt time to redeem; make therefore ſuch arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the management and diſpoſal of your remaining time, as ſhall the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obtain this grand end. Take heed that you diſpenſe with no duty, whatever ſelf-denial the performance of it may require. Let every hour, not only have employ, but be devoted to the moſt valuable purpoſes. And be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſtrictly to adhere to the ſyſtem you now form, until you ſee real cauſe for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And Oh! let your arrangements be
