            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR's LIFE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>STEPHEN DUCK,</hi> the Author of the following Poems, was born in the year 1705, near the ſeat of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bathurſt,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at <hi>Clarendon Park,</hi> in the county of <hi>Wilts,</hi> of parents remarkable only for their honeſty and induſtry. However, we find he had ſome ſmall ſhare of reading and writing beſtowed on him, with very little or no grammar: For before he had reached his <hi>ſyntaxis,</hi> his mother had a very notable complaint exhibited againſt him by his Schoolmaſter, viz. <hi>That he took his Learning too faſt, even faſter than the maſter could give it him.</hi> So that the prudent parent, to prevent ſo growing an evil, removed her ſon from School to the Plough, leſt he might become too fine a gentleman for the family that produced him.</p>
            <p>The ſeeds of learning being once ſowed in our young plowman, there was no poſſibility of weeding them out: for the labour of his mind generally accompanied that of his body. <hi>Milton</hi> was his conſtant companion in the field and the barn: He had likewiſe made himſelf maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſet of the <hi>Spectators,</hi> and <hi>Bailey's Engliſh Diction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> Our Author, thus equipped, aſcends the Hill of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The courteous reader muſt be informed that our Poet is to be unhappily numbered amongſt thoſe men, whoſe <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>fine parts</hi> are not able to give their yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> which a weak mind with a vigorous conſtitution is generally apt to do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he has had three children born to him in wedlock; at the chriſtening of the laſt child, one of the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men happened to blab it out to the reverend gentleman who performed the ceremony, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Duck <hi>was a man of great learning, and had wit enough to be a parſon; for that he could make verſes like any man, and as good as ever ſhe heard in her life.</hi> Upon the recommendation of this wiſe woman, the doctor who is a dignified perſon in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> had ſome diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Duck,</hi> and gave him a theme, with ſome directions for the improvement of his genius: But when Mr. <hi>Duck</hi> had finiſhed his Verſes, and preſented them to him for his approbation, the Doctor recommended them to the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025421_0003_0FCD2A5843EFF710"/>
flames. This was a moſt cruel diſcouragement; ſo that for a long time after he was almoſt out of conceit with himſelf, and went on writing and burning, and his wife continually ſcolding, becauſe he neglected his labour: And when he was <hi>ſcanning</hi> his lines, ſhe would oftentimes run out and raiſe the whole neighbourhood, telling the people, <hi>That her Huſband dealt with the Devil, and was going mad becauſe he did nothing all day but talk to himſelf, and tell his Fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mangre this ill ſituation of his poetical affairs, his fame at length began to rouſe the Wits of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> to ſome conſideration of him, and he was admitted to the tables of a great many worthy gentlemen. He now wrote his Poem called the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> that on <hi>Poverty,</hi> and the <hi>Threſher's Labour;</hi> which were handed about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with great applauſe, in manuſcript. A copy was ſent to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Tankerville</hi> at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> where the Honourable Mrs. <hi>Clayton,</hi> of her Majeſty's Bed-chamber, happening to ſee it, that Lady immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented it to the Queen: The Verſes became in much reputation at Court by all judges of Poetry; and the Author was then ſent for to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to declare, <hi>ſhe would allow him Thirty Guineas a year, and a little Houſe at Richmond, till he ſhould be better provided for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was aſked by a Noble Earl to write upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> but ſaid, That <hi>as he had no true knowledge, nor had read any thing of the nature of that great Luminary, he was at preſent uncapable of ſuch a taſk.</hi> He has read <hi>Milton</hi> with ſuch attention, (whom he eſteems the firſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets) that he can repeat the whole book by heart. The <hi>Spectators,</hi> he ſays, were of ſingular uſe to him, and <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Engliſh Dictionary</hi> inſtructed him in the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all words which he thought <hi>uncouth.</hi> He gave ſuch anſwers as were entirely ſatisfactory to thoſe who might have any ſuſpicion that the Poems were wrote by ſome other perſon; and as he readily accounted for every thing that ſeemed extraordinary, it is demonſtrable he walks in no other <hi>Stilts</hi> than thoſe of his own Genius, which has juſtly rendered him the admiration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age.</p>

            <p>IT is thought proper to aſſure the Readers, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes are really the productions of the Perſon to whom the Title-page aſcribes them.</p>
            <p>Tho' She pretends not to the Genius of Mr. <hi>DUCK,</hi> nor hopes to be taken notice of by the Great, yet her Friends are of opinion that the Novelty of a <hi>Waſher-Women</hi>'s turning Poeteſs, will procure her ſome Readers.</p>
            <p>If all that follow the ſame employment would amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one another, during the tedious hours of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in this, or ſome other way as innocent, inſtead of toſſing Scandal to and fro, many reputations would remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded, and the peace of families be leſe diſturbed.</p>
            <p>I think it no reproach to the Author, whoſe Life is toilſome, and her Wages inconſiderably, to confeſs honeſtly, that the view of her putting a ſmall Sum of Money in her Pocket, as well as the Reader's Entertainment, had its ſhare of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon this Publication. And ſhe humbly hopes ſhe ſhall not be abſolutely diſappointed; ſince, though ſhe is ready to own that her performance could by no means ſtand a critical examination, yet ſhe flatters herſelf that, with all its faults and imperfections, the candid Reader will judge it to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderably beyond the common capacity of thoſe of her own rank and occupation.</p>

               <l>Enrich'd by Peers, advanc'd by CAROLINE!</l>
               <l>Deign to look down on one that's poor and low,</l>

               <l>No learning ever was beſtow'd on me;</l>
               <l>My life was always ſpent in drudgery:</l>
               <l>And not alone; alas! with grief I find,</l>
               <l>It is the portion of poor Woman-kind.</l>
               <l>Oft have I thought as on my bed I lay,</l>
               <l>Eas'd from the tireſome labours of the day,</l>
               <l>Our firſt extraction from a Maſs refin'd,</l>

               <l>When they by arts or arms were render'd great,</l>
               <l>They laid their trophies at a Woman's feet;</l>
               <l>They, in thoſe days, unto our ſex did bring</l>

               <l>And let our hapleſs ſex in ſilence lie</l>
               <l>Forgotten, and in dark oblivion die;</l>
               <l>But on our abject ſtate you throw your ſcorn,</l>
               <l>And Women wrong, your verſes to adorn.</l>
               <l>You of hay-making ſpeak a word or two,</l>
               <l>As if our ſex but little work cou'd do:</l>
               <l>This makes the honeſt Farmer ſmiling ſay,</l>
               <l>He'll ſeek for women ſtill to make his hay;</l>
               <l>For if his back be turn'd their work they mind,</l>
               <l>As well as men as far as he can find.</l>
               <l>For my own part, I many a <hi>Summer's</hi> day</l>

               <l>As well as you we have a time to dine:</l>
               <l>I hope, that ſince we freely toil and ſweat</l>

               <l>That over, ſoon we muſt get up again,</l>

               <l>Or how ſhould <hi>Cocks in equal Rows appear?</hi>
