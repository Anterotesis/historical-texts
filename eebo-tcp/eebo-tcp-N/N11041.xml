            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have lately heard much, and too much, of the wiſdom of Parliament, the great council, of the nation; that is to ſay, the corrupt majority of that great council, where the moſt votes enforce the vileſt meaſures. We know what this great council once was, and what it ought to be. Let us reflect upon what it now is. It is (alas!) no more at preſent than a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Ay's and No's—Contents and not Contents. And what is this majority? the Miniſter's—What is this Miniſter? the King's; What it the King? my Lord Bute's. What is Lord Bute? an enemy to this nation. I had like to have ſaid what I think, a traytor; but I hope this will be ſaid with more weight in a future impeachment, unleſs popular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſhould juſtly make a leſs ſolemn, but a more dreadful example of this public peſt. Through theſe channels of wiſdom flow all the grievance, oppreſſions, and calamities, which are now ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:013991_0002_0F92591002D134E8"/>felt in England and America. The ſubjects of theſe nations feel all the power of this great and wiſe council, without a ſingle ray of its benignity. It ſhines upon it's Idols, but lowers upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for deſpotic Power, is the great end in view, and the growth of it is cultivated with the greateſt boldneſs and aſſiduity. We now ſee the three great eſtates of this kingdom, which were, in their origin, wiſely deſigned as ſalutary checks upon each other, to preſerve the conſtitution, in an amicable confederacy to deſtoy it. As to the Peers, they are created by the Crown, not for meritorious, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical reaſons. Wealth, and a pliant diſpoſion, are eſſential requiſites. Some minion of the crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes bound for their good behaviour, and then the great ſeal ſtamps them for the tools of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and corrupt miniſter. But your Apoſtate Chathams, Camdens, Richmonds, Buckinghams, Temples, Shelburns, &amp;c. are repudiated. The virtuous minority is too thin to ſave their country. They are out-clamoured, and out-voted. I have heard Lord Chatham's manly eloquence rudely drowned by a combined roar of the miniſter's, majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Houſe of Lords. I have heard that great Orator anſwered by miniſterial mouths without argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without ſenſe, without grammar, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Their Lordſhips may well clear their houſe, and be as much aſhamed of their ſpeeches, as they ought to be of their principles. As to the houſe of Commons, it is filled, and fed three parts out of four, by the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Let me not forget, however, to congratulate them on a new privilege, which they acquired and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:013991_0003_0F925910EAD58BB0"/>in Wilkes's caſe, the rational and modeſt Privilege of electing themſelves. This acquiſition is a great one. It is plain that honourable Houſe eſteems it ſo, becauſe they have lately moſt iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly refuſed to eraſe thoſe baſe and daring innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the rights of the people from their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Thus they have induſtriouſly preſerved the infamy of the laſt deteſted Parliament to poſterity. But they have likewiſe (which was the real deſign) treaſured up a vile precedent to be produced in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times of need, againſt the liberties of their maſters, the people of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>There was a time when this houſe of Commons was not too modeſt to oppoſe the arbitrary wills of Princes. There was a time when they had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty to refuſe ſupplies, when the former had been ill-applied, and as ill-accounted for; when the old had been laviſhed in profuſion and douceurs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and new were demanded for the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, or worſe, the inſidious purpoſes of corruption. There was a time too, when the head of that houſe (the Speaker) had integrity, though ſome parts of that body were corrupt.</p>
            <p>Whoever remembers Onſlow, muſt reſpect his memory; whoever knew him muſt revere it. He reſpected his Sovereign, but he loved the people. He preſerved the dignity and integrity of his ſtation. He diſtinguiſhed nobly and juſtly between a poſt of honour and a poſt of profit. He was neither Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, Placeman, nor Privy Councellor. He knew that it was impoſſible to ſerve two maſters. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to be at the head of a free people. He had a thorough knowledge of the rights, and was zealous in deſending them. He knew that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013991_0004_0F92591183E59EA0"/>for a Speaker of a houſe of Commons to be, with the leaſt conſiſtency, a Courtier and a Demagogue at the ſame time. He knew that if he held a lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place, he could not hold his integrity. He preferred his duty to traſh. He preferred virtuous liberty to miniſterial influence and controul. He prefered honour to infamy, Sincerity to duplicity, and propriety to abſurdity. For what can be more abſurd than a ductile ſpeaker, who is at the head of the commons in the morning, and at the ear of the Sovereign in the evening? At one hour in character of a ſpeaker, at another in the function of a privy Counſellor. Now in the peoples chair, and now at a miniſterial board. To day collecting the ſenſe of the people, and to morrow promoting the intrigues of a court. Co-operating with the people at one inſtant, and forming ſchemes againſt their liberties at another. To crown all, let us ſuppoſe this Speaker an eſtabliſhed placeman for life; to which place an annual income is appendant of 4000<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum, and eventually twice that ſum, or more, in a place which no ſubject had enjoyed for years, till the preſent Speaker (Norton) broke the ground anew. Why had it not been enjoyed for many years? Becauſe it was for life, and the Miniſter had not ſufficient confidence in the ſteady perfidy, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior demerits of any one hireling, to beſtow it, till they were conſcious that Norton deſerved that, and more, Let us view this malleable Speaker, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic ſtateſman, this political Proteous, this double fronted Ianus, in another light, which will fully ſhow the compatibility of the two different functions</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Bute or a Mansfield were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, as they well deſerve, by the Commons
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013991_0005_0F925915F7D93208"/>of England ('tis but a ſuppoſition, for the corruption at preſent makes it impracticable) ſuppoſe it only: Whoſe duty would it be to carry up thoſe bills of impeachment to the bar of the Houſe of Lords? Sir Fletcher Norton. Sir Fletcher? What? a place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a penſioner, a privy counſellor? A bird of the ſame feather? Can Jemmy Twitcher 'peach? I have ſaid enough to be ſufficiently underſtood, and to ſhow how inconſiſtent and abſurd it is for a Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, to be amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biouſly inclined.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to the noble Lords—We ſee among them another majority, not indeed with Lord Bute (for he abſconds) but with his deputy, Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, at their head. No; 'tis Lord Apſley; thoſe inſignia upon the table are his, true, the inſignia, (the bauble, the purſe and mace) are Apſley's; but Apſley himſelf is Mansfield's, as Mansfield himſelf is Bute's. Theſe three dance the hay, like the ſun, moon, and earth, in the Rehearſal, though indeed it is Lord Bute's intereſt at preſent to continue in eclipſe. At preſent that Thane is to all intents and purpoſes, by his two proxies Mansfield and Apſley, at the head of the Houſe of Lords. He has his majority of myrmidons there, as well as among the Commons, where he is repreſented by Lord North. Where then ſhall we find a patriot? in the throne. This (alas) would be a bleſſing "devoutly to be wiſhed."</p>
            <p>But the great eſtates of this kingdom, are now not in a wholeſome, but a dangerous coalition: not in harmony, but in combination; not in friendſhip, but in confederacy. The Houſe of Commons now ſhut the doors againſt their conſtituents, the Lords
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:013991_0006_0F9259162E24D208"/>debate in private, they are aſhamed, as they well may, of their harrangues. Theſe Houſes, are now in truth, a Divan, a Conclave, a Junto, a Cabal, a Gang; but they are no longer what they were, or what they ought to be; they will ſhortly feel the conſequences, of ſuch an unnatural coalition. The body politic can never be healthy, whilſt its func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ill performed; yet this is the great and wiſe council of the nation, in which ſovereigns will confide.</p>
            <p>I know that a majority of votes can ſave Minions and Favourites from the ſcaffold; but they cannot ſave them from public vengeance, nor can they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſovereigns peace, affection, and eſteem, they can augment the civil liſt, from near a million a year to any ſum that royal profuſion may demand; they can allow without entring into preciſe accounts what a king may expend for public uſes, a term of the largeſt the moſt vague and moſt indifinite mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, including every ſpecies of regal, domeſtic, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, and unjuſt profuſion; they can lay ſtill heavier taxes for this purpoſe, as well as for carrying on the further aſſaſſination of America; but they can neither force the united ſubjects of this kingdom to pay thoſe unreaſonable taxes, nor heal the wounds of a civil war if they refuſe. How will our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies France and Spain, embroil the ſcene? at ſuch a criſis, will an importation of Hanoverians; Heſſians, and mercenary troops from the little ſtates of Germany avail? From Hanoverians no aſſiſtance can be expected; they will not be able to defend their own ſtate againſt the deſigning ambitious King of Pruſſia. That great Monarch will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the ill treatment he has received from England;
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013991_0007_0F9259178F9DC5B0"/>Civil war here will afford him the long wiſhed for opportunity.</p>
            <p>Our ſtanding army (if any part ſhould be baſe enough, to fight for tyrants, and the benefit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaves,) will be fully employed; ſuch part of it as is truly Engliſh, will join their countrymen, and put a final period to deſpotiſm and corruption.</p>
            <p>The conſtitutional, and the only conſtitutional force of this Kingdom, the militia, will not fail to ſignalize themſelves in defence of Liberty, in this unhappy period will the patriotic Spirit be ſtill? by what foreign power, amidſt this confuſion at home, is America, at laſt, to be protected, or enſlaved? by which of her friends the French or the Spaniards? Our ſtanding army will be too much wanted here to afford freſh ſuccour to Burgoyne.</p>
            <p>Does that idle notion prevail, any longer in this century, which ſupplied King Charles the firſt with forces and recruits, in the laſt; when that bleſſed martyr, endeavoured to ſubdue this country to his deſpotic will by force of arms? Is paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, and the divine rights of tyrants, of any weight even with the loweſt of the people? Is not the idea and ſpirit of liberty univerſal ſtill? is the invaſion of its rights a ſecret? It is true that we have long lived in an age of venality and corruption, but we alſo live in an age of reaſon and diſcernment. The meaneſt individual among us knows that he has a right to call his life, liberty and property his own, and will die in their defence.</p>
            <p>A fooliſh and wicked King like the preſent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ects, the power of a deſpot; a patriot King uſes the authority of a parent. A ſacrifice to public liberty could not be grateful to a patriot King, it would
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:013991_0008_0F925918459926B8"/>ſully his glory, and diſappoint his views. To a weak or a deſigning Prince liberty is odious, it is an object of perpetual terror and alarm. Under the reign of one, the lives and properties of the ſubject are no longer valuable, then whilſt they are employed to promote the wiſe ends of paternal government, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good; under the other, they are uſeleſs, unleſs they are exerted for the public ſafety, The people live in allegiance to the one, and in league againſt the other; the one reaps all the fruits of national confidence and affection, the other feels all the weight of general diſtruſt, and all the ignominy of individual deſtruction, the one has no favourites, and the other has no enemies. The readieſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence waits upon the father? and the bittereſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations purſue the deſpot of a country.</p>
