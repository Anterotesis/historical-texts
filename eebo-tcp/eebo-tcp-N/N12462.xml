            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the courſe of the Author's itinerant Preaching, as a Candidate, the following Sermon was delivered ſeveral times both in Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts; and as often had the good Fortune to pleaſe ſome; and ſome of his Friends thinking that the Sermon might be profitable; deſired to ſee it in Print: the author ever willing to gratify his Frinds in things lawful, <hi>conſented;</hi> which is the only reaſon he gives for troubling the <hi>Publick.</hi>

            <p>If it ſhould fall into any other hands, than thoſe for whom it is more immediately publiſhed; they are advertiſed, that they will find ſomething old, and ſomething new; out of the common road of thinking; yet the Author thinks it agreeable to the Goſpel plan, and the deſign of his text; and that it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if read with care and deſign of getting good, otherwiſe it had better be let alone.</p>
            <p>As he had no regard either of fear or deffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards Criticks; they may probably, find enough for the exerciſe of their Spleen; and hereby have full Liberty to vent the whole <hi>Quantum</hi> of Criticiſm.</p>

            <p>HEAR, O Heavens; give ear O Earth, be aſtoniſhed, O our Souls! <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Lord of life and glory; <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Lamb of God; <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſon of the Higheſt, not only gave himſelf to the accurſed death of the Croſs, to ſave a periſhing, hell-deſerving world; but <hi>Living,</hi> condeſcends to offer; nay intreat for a reconciliation. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is come, he calls; he knocks at the door of our hearts for admittance; for <hi>liberty</hi> of forming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, and communing with our ſouls; Awake from the Death-begotten dream; Awake from theſe carnal ſlumbers; why thus deaf, when the beloved <hi>Jeſus</hi> calls? Why thus luke-warm in his ſervice? Why thus averſe; thus <hi>inattentive</hi> to his affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cries?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:015745_0004_0FA51CF3D4037D48"/>Lift up O our Souls, and be lifted up ye doors of our hearts, that the King of Glory may come in: He now invites us to a union and fellowſhip with himſelf; to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the joys of the New-Jeruſalem, the city of God: O, the infinite goodneſs, the unfathomable love, the ſtupendious grace of a <hi>cruſified Jeſus</hi>!</p>
            <p>Ye careleſs and profane; may I engage <hi>your</hi> attention to this Grace? will ye hear this language of divinity? will ye liſten to the heavenly voice of your <hi>Friend</hi>? Theſe are his words, O, Sinner, "I know thyworks, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot, ſo then, becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth: Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and increaſed in goods and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and blind and naked." Yet, this is a ſtrange work to me: I eſteem your happineſs far more elegible; why wilt thou not accept of peace and righteouſneſs at my hands? "I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil thee to buy of me gold, tried in the fire, that thou mayeſt be rich; and white rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that thou mayeſt be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear; and anoint thy eyes, with eye ſalve, that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015745_0005_0FA51CF491747D98"/>
thou mayeſt ſee. As many as I love I rebuke and chaſten; be zealous therefore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent."</p>
            <p>And to induce you, to accept of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and that I may leave you without any ſhow of excuſe for refuſal, I further aſſure you that according to the will and appointment of the father, I ſhall readily aſſiſt you by my ſpirit through the goſpel; while you zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly attend thereto; and carefully improve the grace and talents given; and will bring you home to myſelf, unleſs your obſtinacy prevent. "Behold," (attend to my words, and rely on my varacity) "I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him and he with me."</p>
            <p>Such is the Covenant of Grace, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Heaven; that, whoſoever ſhall hear and open to me; <hi>he</hi> ſhall obtain the "gold tried in the fire; the white raiment, and the eye-ſalve;" and I will love him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> O ſinner, is the unfathomable love of God, this, is the voice of a once <hi>cruſified Jeſus</hi> unto thee, if you hear, it is life; if you refuſe, it is death to thy Soul forever.</p>
            <p>But, let us more particularly, enquire how Chriſt helps us to come to him; or what is implied in his ſtanding and knocking at the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015745_0006_0FA51CF5798D3B08"/>
door; what may be implied in our hearing his voice, and opening the door to him; what in his coming into our hearts, and our ſupping together.</p>
            <p>Firſtly. What is Chriſt doing on his part to bring us to a ſtate of reconciliation: Or, what ſhall we underſtand by his ſtanding and knocking at the door?</p>
            <p>Omiting ſeveral niceties, and minute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations on theſe terms, <hi>Behold, Standing, Knocking, Door,</hi> &amp;c. (on which ſome have ſpent much Labour) I ſhall only obſerve in general, that we underſtand hereby that Chriſt in the Goſpel Diſpenſation, its Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and inſtitutions, continualy ſeeks and endeavours to make impreſſions on the hearts of Sinners, that, he may bring them to a ſenſe of duty, and bow their ſtubborn wills to his own ſovereign pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Hence, we are naturally led to obſerve, that Chriſt makes the firſt advance towards the Sinner for Reconciliation and Peace: "<hi>Behold</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>I ſtand at the door.</hi>" Though we are the offending party, and as ſuch, ought to make the firſt ſuit for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; yet Chriſt knowing our infirmity, is pleaſed to magnify his Grace towards us, by making the firſt offers: and thus prove himſelf the beſt of friends unto us, though
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015745_0007_0FA51CF61682B200"/>
we are the worſt of enemies to him: This is of the Lords mercies, and marvelous in our eyes; it is an inſtance of the unparralleled love of Chriſt to our ruined Race, and ardent deſire to ſave that which was loſt. Did Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus wait for us to make the firſt advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reconciliation, eternal death would be inevitable. Our corrupt nature could never lead us unto God: Our fall from Rectitude is ſpiritual death in the ſoul; that we can put forth no holy exerciſe untill Chriſt quicken us from dead works, to ſerve the living God, we are by nature enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, "<hi>For the carnal mind is enmity againſt God:</hi>" How then can we aſk for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation? while thus averſe to the croſs, how ſhall we bow to the Scepter of Jeſus, and come to his footſtool for mercy? <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Jeſus, and he only, can lead man to this.</p>
            <p>Again, Jeſus comes near to invite us: He don't ſtand aloft, or at a diſtance when he calls; no, but he comes to the very threſhold of the heart, he touches it with his power; behold I ſtand <hi>at the door,</hi> and <hi>knock</hi>: Chriſt by his word and ſpirit comes to the heart of every ſinner under the goſpel, and the ſinner knows him to be there, pleading for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſometimes in a way of mercies, at others, in a way of afflictions, we can't plead
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015745_0008_0FA51CFB01C5EF08"/>
that we never had an opportunity to make our peace with Chriſt; Jeſus has come, he has come <hi>near</hi> even to the very door of our hearts, and knocked for admittance, that if we periſh, we muſt periſh with blood on our heads. But,</p>
            <p>Furthermore; Jeſus by ſtanding and knocking at the door of our hearts, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts both a willingneſs and ardent deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in and ſet up his throne there. As we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt an intent to enter our neighbour's houſe by knocking at his door, ſo does Chriſt by knocking at the door of our hearts. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is eaſy and familiar, emblematical of intimacy and friendſhip: Such is the will of Chriſt here exhibited: He would be familiar: He would be at home in all our hearts: He wiſhes to make us all partakers of his own felicity and will effect it, if we will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to fit us for ſuch heavenly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> is the tenor of the Goſpel; from <hi>This,</hi> flow all the kind invitations of Jeſus Chriſt; ſee his deſire to the houſe of Iſrael, "<hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; for as I live faith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that he turn from his evil way and live.</hi>" It is by our own <hi>will,</hi> not God's that we periſh; he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015745_0009_0FA51CFD362FDB50"/>
accounts it his ſtrange work to execute wrath, he would fain withhold the ſword of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that mercy might take the lead, though he be highly provoked; though he has made bare his arm and brandiſhed his ſword; yet through the pleading of mercy, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire after our happineſs, he will ſtay his hand for a ſeaſon: An inſtance of this prerogative of deity towards the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have moſt excellently deſcribed by the Prophet Hoſea, Ch. XI. 8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? How ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Ad<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>

I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim,</hi> for I am God, <hi>and not man.</hi>" Chriſt is not only willing to ſave; but loath to deſtroy; it is the deſire of his ſoul to communicate of happineſs to his creatures, it is infinitely more elegible to him, to glorify himſelf in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; than in our damnation.</p>
            <p>But yet further, though we are averſe to the croſs; yet the matchleſs Jeſus, not only deſires our ſalvation, but is uſing means for our converſion: Behold (ſays he) I ſtand at the door and <hi>knock.</hi> Chriſt now that he is come, is neither idle nor ſilent; but he knocks

at the door of our hearts; he accuſes the ſlumbering ſoul, and brings home convictions to the conſcience. Many are the means of his grace, and divers the methods of his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but he leaves none without a call; nay, repeated calls both of his goſpel, his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, his providences and his holy ſpirit. This work, he generally begins in the days of our youth, while the mind is flexile and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tender; he takes this opportunity, as the faireſt, to engage our thoughts on the things of religion; his calls are the calls of mercy, and invitations of his grace; the Spirit moves gently on the heart, revealing the truths of the goſpel: endeavouring to take our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from youthful luſts and vanities, and ſet them "<hi>on things above, where Chriſt is at the right hand of GOD.</hi>"</p>
            <p>But if theſe calls are not heard, he will chaſtiſe us; neither our encreaſing in years, nor ingratitude under mercies, can ſtay his paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rebuke: Jeſus will verily come and knock harder at the door; he will come with the rod of correction, and teach us the inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human devices, and the uncertainty of temporal enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Are we ſtill ungrateful under mercies, and incorrigible under chaſtiſements, he will knock louder at the door; he will be heard
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015745_0011_0FA51D0089FE3E28"/>
and underſtood before he departs: Judgments grow ſevere and ſmite on every ſide: The ſpirit ſets home convictions on the conſcience with fearful energy, and the terrors of the Lord ſound dreadful in our ears, till we hear as it were, the thundering and ſee the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Mount Sinai, fluſhing immediate vengeance from the Almighty. Here let us ſee and admire the love of God to our hell-deſerving race: Is it not boundleſs unfathoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love? Why did <hi>Jeſus</hi> bleed for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels? Nay, why does he ſtrive with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretches, who always reſiſt his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Why does he uſe ſuch means, and work thus variouſly to ſpare <hi>us</hi> from deſerved ruin? Why does he not rather ariſe in wrath, to avenge abuſed grace, and with his uplifted arm hurl the whole race down to irremida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woe? He is <hi>God!</hi> He is <hi>God,</hi> not man.</p>
            <p>Yet my friends, notwithſtanding all this goodneſs and grace of the beloved Jeſus, is it not a lamentable truth, that the greater part of us have not regarded theſe kind calls, ſo as to open the door unto Chriſt; but from our awaknings have turned, like the dog to his vomit; and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire?</p>
            <p>I obſerve but this once more; Behold (ſays Chriſt) I <hi>ſtand</hi> at the door: here is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015745_0012_0FA51D02028C4478"/>
and long ſufferance of God manifeſt; the calls of Chriſt are not haſty and flighty; he does not call and paſs right on; but <hi>ſtands at the door,</hi> he waits for our anſwer; when he offers peace and reconciliation, he expects our anſwer, whether we accept or not; nay, he does not leave us at the firſt refuſal; but ſtill forbears; how many days, months and years has he waited on us? How often been refuſed? Yet this day we have the offers of life and ſalvation ſounding in our ears; we are witneſſes for Chriſt that he is long-ſuffering and gracious. Let us take heed leſt we tire his patience. He ſays he will not always ſtrive with man; if his viſits are leſs frequent do we feel more careleſs and indifferent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it, that it is time to awake, and cry mightily unto God for his returns, leſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for ever; perhaps this is the laſt offer; now then is the time, or never; this loſt, Hell is certain.</p>
            <p>We have no excuſe to make; but are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of our own ſouls; Chriſt is free and his throne will be forever guiltleſs: (Speaking after the manner of men) he departs with an acking heart and weeping eyes: Shall we ſee his ſorrow; ſhall we hear his lamentation? "<hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto

thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not?</hi>" O ye careleſs and hard-hearted ſinners how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I knocked at the door of your hearts, how often called you by my word and ſpirit, that you would forſake the fooliſh and live? How have I ſtrove to deliver you from Hell? But ye would not be delivered.</p>
            <p>Thus we briefly ſee what Chriſt is doing to engage us to accept of his council, or what is implied in his ſtanding and knocking at the door.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what is required on the ſinner's part in return; Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſhew what is implied in our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice, and opening the door unto Chriſt; If any man hear my voice, and open the door (ſays Chriſt) I will come in to him, &amp;c. might I enlarge, it would be well to note ſomething on the univerſality of this call, "<hi>if any man</hi>:" but ſuffice it to ſay, that the call of the goſpel is not ſpecial, or perſonal; but general, extending to all men. "<hi>Through the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>" all men are freed from their firſt-covenant of grace, or brought into a ſaveable ſtate, that if we periſh we muſt periſh of free choice; none are excluded this covenant, or call of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015745_0014_0FA51D03BA5DAA68"/>
goſpel; to a compliance with which, ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is connected, not as a <hi>reward</hi> to our works or endeavours; but through (as it were) an additional grant of that grace, which firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the covenant, or call of the goſpel: Hence ſaith the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true witneſs, if <hi>any man</hi> hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in, &amp;c. Chriſt not only propoſes the terms on which he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; but alſo draws the line where he will firſt meet the ſinner for this purpoſe, not according to our work but according to his grace.</p>
            <p>Where this line is drawn; and what is requiſite to our coming thereto; is the preſent ſubject-matter of enquiry.</p>
            <p>Let us then as propoſed inquire into the import of hearing Chriſt's voice; which is propoſed as the firſt branch of duty: This, beyond doubt is a knowledge of, and aſſent to the truths of the goſpel revelation; together with a belief, or ſtrong perſuaſion that Chriſt by his ſpirit, through his goſpel, is knocking at the door of our hearts for admittance. This, by our former divines has been called a law work, or the firſt ſtep is converſion. It is a ſtate of rational conviction, and ſpiritual awaknings or the ſtate of the almoſt Chriſt<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> To this ſtate of conſideration and awakening,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015745_0015_0FA51D04550F0D60"/>
the means of grace have a peculiar tendency to bring mankind; eſpecially when accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the ſpirit of God: Hence the men that traveled to Emaus felt their hearts burn within them, while Chriſt talked to them, and explained the ſcriptures: In like manner, the heart of Lydia was opened (under the preaching of Paul) to receive the truth. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preaching of Peter the Jews were ſo pricked to the heart, that they cried as in <hi>agony, "men and brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Every perſon that has come to years of diſcretion, is a witneſs for Chriſt, that <hi>he</hi> hath knocked at the door of his heart: All hear the voice of Chriſt, in his word, providence, or ſpirit, however careleſs and inattentive they may be: Not all that hear the voice of Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, no, but from this ſtep many may, and do fall away, and turn to their former wickedneſs, like the dog to his vomit: But <hi>theſe</hi> are difficult to be renewed again unto repentance: Such was the ſtate of the man that <hi>walked through dry places ſeeking reſt, and finding none; but returning to his houſe, be found it empty, ſwept and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and taking to himſelf ſeven other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more wicked than himſelf they entered in and dwelt there; and his laſt ſtate was worſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015745_0016_0FA51D069BD66760"/>
than his firſt.</hi> This is a true repreſentation of ſinners falling from their convictions, and the fearful conſequences of ſuch conduct.</p>
            <p>Hence furthermore, our hearing the voice of Chriſt is not ſufficient to bring us to that line which he has drawn, but he requires that we <hi>open the door</hi> to him: This will bring us to that line, at which, by an act of grace he has appointed to meet the returning ſinner: But fully to determine how much is implied in this phraze of "<hi>opening the door</hi>" is not a little difficult. Modeſty in expreſſion and thought, becomes mortals on ſuch an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point: Let it be our attendant while we proſecute our inquiry.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable here, that ſome have placed the "<hi>opening of the door,</hi>" in an aſſent of the underſtanding or in hearing the voice as juſt conſidered; which we found ſhort of the end, in that many might and did fall therefrom, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Others have placed it, in a conſent of the will, which, (though an indeterminate phraze; yet, as it is generally underſtood for a united act of underſtanding, will and affections,) as far over-ſhoots the mark, as the other fell ſhort; for it ſuppoſes a gracious exerciſe in the heart, anticedent to a principle of holineſs, or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015745_0017_0FA51CE9E59F5900"/>
the implantation of the new nature; which in the beſt view, is abſurd and contradictory.</p>
            <p>To avoid both of theſe extremes, we muſt ſee what man can do in a ſtate of nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the awaknings of God's ſpirit; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this will not remove the obſtacles which hinder Chriſt from entering the heart. Where, be it obſerved, that though man, by his fall from rectitude, loſt all moral power, nay, and has his "<hi>underſtanding darkned through the ignorance that is in him</hi>;" yet, he is a rational creature and free-agent; and on this <hi>conſideration,</hi> ariſes the requirement in our text, not becauſe Chriſt cannot enter the moſt perverſe and ſtubborn heart, but becauſe he will treat us as free agents and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable creatures; therefore the opening of the door, is ſomething not only conſiſtent with <hi>this,</hi> but within its reach, under the influences of God's ſpirit. Let us view man in this character of <hi>rationality</hi>; we ſhall find him always acting by the firſt law of nature, ſelf-preſervation, this is the caſe of all men in a ſtate of ſpiritual awaknings; they ſeek to avoid the impending evil, however they may miſtake the means: Fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſin, rouſes them to fly from the wrath to come; and apprehenſions of mercy in Chriſt, ſupports them under theſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015745_0018_0FA51D081A3BD9D0"/>
fears. This is according to the principle implanted in our nature and as ſuch is ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and laudable, though not meritorious; but in the preſent caſe, is the higheſt ſource from which a man can act without a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace: And in this we muſt allow him to be a free-agent, capable of chooſing and refuſing; and of conſequence, capable of moral honeſty and ſincerity: He may have the ſame kind and ſame degree of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and honeſty in all his intentions and reſolutions to avoid ſin, from a fear of hell and apprehenſion of mercy through Chriſt, as he can have to fulfil any moral obligation towards man: As it is poſſible he may fail in both; ſo is it poſſible he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in both, under the power of God's ſpirit; though as yet void of a true principle of grace: He is as capable of the one, as the other, the latter of which, no man doubts of; and why of the former? Both, are acts of real honeſty and ſincerity differing but in the <hi>object of intention</hi>; which can never alter a man's capability of performance.</p>
            <p>A man under convictions of ſin, and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ſpirit may have as ſincere <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intentions</hi> to avoid ſin; as the beſt Saint; though ariſing from a different ſource, viz. Fear of puniſhment and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015745_0019_0FA51D08D41CBE20"/>
of mercy in the Lord Jeſus; and therefore more likely to fall away. And the man that does thus exert his honeſty and ſincere endeavours and intentions of avoiding ſin, and yielding that Chriſt ſhall take the lead; does for the preſent lay down his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons; not out of love; but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; that he may eſcape a greater evil: And in ſo doing, I conceive acts from the higheſt principle of human nature in its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtate; and goes to his utmoſt ſtretch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Chriſt comes into the heart.</p>
            <p>I imagine (though with reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and deference to my fathers) that this will anſwer to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, the opening the door to Chriſt. What impediments, what bars, what obſtacles are there in the way? None moſt certainly; but Chriſt may enter the heart without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation: For though there are no longings or out-breathings of ſoul after Chriſt, from a principle of love, ſo neither on the contrary is there reſiſting or ſtriving againſt him: Otherwiſe the honeſty and ſincerity of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution contended for, is entirely deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And that a man (conſiſtent with free agency) may (under the awaknings of the ſpirit) be brought to this ſtate of paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſignation, is not to be doubted; it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015745_0020_0FA51D15E4FEE6C8"/>
has been aſſerted by all ancient Calviniſtical divines, as the ſtate where Chriſt meets the ſinner with ſaving grace. But to make the idea clearer, ſuffer the following ſimilitude ſuited ro the idea, ſinners commonly have of GOD: Suppoſe a man was captivated by a cruel nation, by whoſe laws all captives ſhould be burnt at the ſtake; but yet from ſome ſelf end, or compaſſion they ſhould make this offer to him; that it he would ſubmit to take their mark, and wear their livery, by which, he ſhould be bound to them for ever; he ſhould be immediately unlooſed, and enjoy their privileges; I ſay, ſuppoſe a man in this caſe; would he not be capable of the ſtricteſt honeſty, and higheſt degree of liberty in his choice? Beyond doubt: And if he ſhould accept; though not out of love to them, but dread of the faggot, yet the reward is certain; not for the ſake of his choice, but according to their appointment, for the fulfilment of their veracity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of grace. Exactly ſuch is the caſe with the awakned ſinner; he has no alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but ſubmiſſion to Chriſt or the devil; he ſees a flaming hell on one hand, and has a glimmering hope on the other: Reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the choice (though againſt carnal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) and honeſt and ſincere reſolutions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015745_0021_0FA51D0B1EAC5B20"/>
it, and through an appointment and grant of grace, the conſequence is happy and certain.</p>
            <p>When the man thus honeſtly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſes a ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heart without violence to the will or free-agency of the man: This removes the impediments which lay in the heart to obſtruct Chriſt; or it opens the door to him: The man can do no more till Chriſt come in; he cannot put forth exerciſes of grace to welcome him into his heart, anticedent to the implantation of the new nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtands in this ſtate of paſſiveneſs and reſignation, while Chriſt enters and forms himſelf in the ſoul. Which is the next thing to be conſidered, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will come in to him.</p>
            <p>Here is the line where we firſt meet Chriſt: Having yielded the point of ſaving ourſelves, as above, he is ready to help us; by applying to our ſouls the healing Balm of Giliad. But had Chriſt come in before this reſignation, he muſt have deprived us of free-agency, and made us act as <hi>meer machines,</hi> not accountable creatures, and thus have deſtroyed all virtue throughout the whole moral ſyſtem: But the holy Jeſus will ſooner ſuffer us to go down to hell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own choice, than do this to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015745_0022_0FA51D0BCF7532F8"/>
have his ſaving influences; we moſt ſee and feel our guilty ſtate and need of his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſubmit to receive it: Then he enters the heart by our permiſſion; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed the door he takes full poſſeſſion of the heart. Now he binds the ſtrong man, the <hi>influences of Satan,</hi> and deſtroys the old man, the <hi>body of ſin and corruption</hi>: Having got poſſeſſion of the underſtanding, he leads on to the will and affections: He raſes the devil's kingdom to the ground and ſets up his own in its ſtead, and thus <hi>leads captivity captive and gives gifts unto men.</hi> He forms the ſoul into a conformity to the divine pattern; gives a new heart and a new ſpirit, fitting the man for every good work; and he believes to the ſalvation of the ſoul. This leads us to conſider in the laſt place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What is implied in Chriſt's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the returning ſinner, &amp; he with him. Eating and drinking, are often uſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for enjoyment and fulneſs of ſpiritual good things: Our ſupping with Chriſt may then imply that we experience the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them who hunger and are filled with the fullneſs of Chriſt: And alſo that we are now at peace and agreement; for being formed in Chriſt, we can no more be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, but delight in him and he in us;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015745_0023_0FA51D0F6C82D620"/>
hence he ſays, <hi>my father will love him and I will love him, and we will come unto him and take up our abode with him.</hi> Chriſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctifies, but abides in our hearts, and delights to commune with us by his ſpirit hence this ſupping together is called the <hi>Fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> there are ſpiritual communications from Chriſt to believers and out breathings of ſoul in believers after Chriſt: Truly ſays the beloved deſciple <hi>our fellowſhip is with the father, and in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt not only puts life into the ſoul; but maintains it, and upholds fellowſhip with it: This is the bleſſedneſs of them that open the door unto the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful and true witneſs, he ſups with them, and they with him.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015745_0024_0FA51D10F034F528"/>Let all the unregenerate ſpeedily open the door unto Chriſt. For the inforceing of this exhortation, I ſhall ſhow that Chriſt has removed every impediment and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the way; except, what ariſes from their own <hi>wilfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us my friends, conſider ſome of thoſe objections you ſet in ſuch a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light againſt coming to Chriſt: You ſay we are externally poor and vile, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eye of the world; Jeſus will not regard us if we come. What ſirs, will you change God into a devil that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in wickedneſs! Is he taken with the glitter of a fop, the title of a noble, or chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a wit? No, this is a helliſh deluſion: GOD is no reſpecter of perſons, he looks at the ſincerity of the heart; the humble beggar on the dung-hill, is more acceptable to GOD, than the haughty king on the throne: Chriſt knows no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rich and the poor, honored and deſpiſed in this world: But all who ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to him, are his friends. Neither grandure or poverty can influence GOD; for all are his, the beggar even as the king. <hi>Hence,</hi> 1 Cor. I. 26. <hi>ye ſee brethren, your calling, how that not many mighty, not many noble are called, but GOD hath choſen the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015745_0025_0FA51D11F37D1B48"/>
fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed hath God choſen.</hi> So ſays James, Chap. II. 5. <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promiſed to them that love him:</hi>" Thus you have encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather than diſcouragement; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore open the door unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſome of you will ſay, we are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally vile and poluted with ſin, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot, and may not come to Chriſt until we are better.</p>
               <p>This is not of God, but of Satan and your own proud hearts; you are the very perſons Chriſt is now inviteing, for you he died; for you he lives: To this very purpoſe, he made himſelf a propitiatory ſacrifice for ſin: He tells you that he is the phyſician of ſouls, and that the ſick, not the whole need the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. Were you whole, or clean from ſin, you would have no need of Chriſt. Were you ſick in body nigh unto death, would you wait till you were better, or well, before you applied to the doctor? No; why not thus reaſonable in ſpiritual ſickneſs? Becauſe you are polluted, you need purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Apply to Chriſt then as you are; he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015745_0026_0FA51D129F0B8E38"/>
knows your polution, and will have you know it and apply to him in all of it, by opening the door: When he thus finds you in your blood, he will ſay to your ſouls live; he expects you as filthy as ſin can make you; but he has white raiment to cover your nakedneſs, that your ſhame no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>However great your guilt; though your ſins are many and black as hell; yet you ſhall be welcome: Hear the words of Chriſt, <hi>though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow; though they be red like crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhall be like wool.</hi>" Thus your internal vileneſs can be no diſcouragement, but to the contrary: Come then, open the door to Chriſt, and you ſhall receive of his white raiment; and <hi>your beauty ſhall be perfect through the comelineſs that he ſhall put on you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome of you will ſay, we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great; but old ſinners, who have been guilty of great neglects, and repeated refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of God's grace; that we are afraid to look towards the mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p>Sirs, your confeſſion is honeſt; but your application of it is neither to your own comfort or the honor of God's grace: Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſloth and indolence ſeem to be prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,

and ſatan's ſtratagems too eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. But awake, be zealous and repent; I dare aſſure you there is hope; nay, from your own objection it is plain; if Chriſt is irreconceliable, how is it that his ſpirit ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you thus to ſee and confeſs your former neglect's and refuſals? It is plain that though you have forſaken God, he has not forſaken you, but is now calling; Chriſt is knocking at the door, hear his voice then, and open the door ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>You can never anſwer for any delays, but hereby you add fuel to fire; you encreaſe your guilt; your conduct is irrational. Was a man under ſentence of Death for rebellion, but had an offer of pardon on condition he would wear the King's livery; (though his idea of the ſervice was diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet) would he heſitate one moment about accepting, to ſave his life? No, go ye then and do likewiſe: Time may be yet, but cannot be long; therefore make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delays. There is grace ſufficient; did not Chriſt caſt ſeven devils out of Mary Magdalene and received her into favour? Did he not pardon the thief on the Croſs? Why then are ye ſo faithleſs? Come open the door, he now calls, <hi>Turn O backſliding children, for I am married unto you; and I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015745_0028_0FA51D142C052270"/>
will take you one of a city, and two of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and I will bring you to Zion.</hi> Here then, is no impediment, but Chriſt ſtands with open arms to receive you.</p>
               <p>Well ſay you, granting all this to be true; yet we have no ſtrength or ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt; and without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God; we can therefore do nothing.</p>
               <p>Friends you do not reaſon wiſely in this matter: But ſhew a diſingenuous mind, and heart bent on evaſion. Your objection is pointed, not againſt opening the door to Chriſt, but againſt the exerciſes of faith and holineſs while in a ſtate of nature; in which caſe, your inability and impotency is readily granted, but yet not excuſable, both as the fault is yours, and alſo, as you have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be delivered from it. Though you cannot put forth the exerciſes of faith and repentance; yet you can honeſtly and ſincerely yield to receive ſuch a principle of action: The point is not whether you can prefer Chriſt, or holineſs to your luſts and carnal pleaſures: but whether under your awaknings, you can prefer Chriſt's offer of giving you ſuch a temper of holineſs, to the flames of hell, which has been already prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both poſſible and rational. However
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015745_0029_0FA51D14E2D2A088"/>
averſe to the ways of holineſs, yet having the torments of hell on the one hand, and the offers of Chriſt to come in and form our-hearts for holineſs on the other, and no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative but this, you could certainly make a choice, and this honeſt and ſincere. This is exactly agreeable to the vulgar ſaying, out of two evils chuſe the leaſt, of which no man was ever ſuſpected of inability: This, as has been ſhewn, removes all impediments out of the heart; not only makes the man humble, but reſigned, that Chriſt can come in conſiſtent with man's free choice, uſing no kind of violence. Therefore Sirs, though you have no ſtrength or ability to believe, yet you can open the door to Chriſt; which being done, he will give you a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holineſs, and anoint your eyes with eye-ſalve that you may ſee the beauty of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and deformity of ſin, and believe to the ſalvation of your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thus all impediments are removed out of the way of your coming to Chriſt, but what ariſes from your own wilfulneſs, come then and delay not: But be aſſured that if you periſh, you periſh of free choice, and hell juſtly your deſert: If you now refuſe Chriſt, and faſt bolt the door againſt him, rely on it he will be revenged; he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015745_0030_0FA51D177720BB60"/>
his inſtruments of death, and will make his arrows drunk with blood, from the beginning of revenge on the enemy. Life will be a curſe; death ſhall be a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; Judgment will diſcover your folly; The brazen brow ſhall be broke, and ſtifled convictions have a fearful reſurrection: A flaming hell ſhall be your bed! Devils and and damned ſouls your inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions! God your enemy, and eternity before you. But on the contrary, open the door to Chriſt; life will be a bleſſing; Death wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Judgment merciful: Heaven your portion: God your friend: Angels your companions, and eternity happy. You ſhall be crowned with a crown of gold, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of honor, dignity and power. Be cloathed with white robes, ſignificant of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and righteouſneſs: Shall hold palmes in <hi>your</hi> hands, enſigns of peace and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, through the blood of Chriſt, and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den harps, expreſſive of the heavenly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and employments, and ſhall live, chanting praiſes to God and the lamb forever and drinking in full draughts of heavenly pleaſures, flowing everlaſting at God's right hand.</p>
