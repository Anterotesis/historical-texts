            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſprung a Leak, and in 18 Hours ſunk before our Eyes; where we were left to drive before Wind and Sea, in our open Boat; yet through the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mercies of our God, (after eight Days Toſſing on the Ocean, on which we failed 170 Leagues) we landed on One of the <hi>Bahama</hi> Iſlands, called <hi>Cat-Iſland,</hi> where with Souls filled with Joy we ſang to our Deliverer, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing both in his Judgments and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, who preſerved us on the Deep, and provided for us in the Deſart, where we lay marooned ſome Months, until Providence brought us to <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> where I waged with One (eſteemed the richeſt in the Province) in the ſame Service I was in with You, and he would have beſtowed his Bounty on me, but there was that righteous Seed in me, which begs not its Bread, neither would it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to receive more than my Hire, his Riches being the Product of <hi>Negro</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves, which would have made me a Debtor and an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor

            </opener>
            <p>UNDER the Conſideration of the Shortneſs of the Life of Man, and the End for which he was created, engaged my Mind to the Lord that he would make known his Truth unto me, beyond Cuſtom or Tradition in which moſt content themſelves. And though in the Time of Ignorance the Lord winks, and the Sincere in Heart in all Societies and Gatherings are owned by him, yet if he farther manifeſts himſelf, who ſhall withſtand him? Tho' in Believing I made not haſte, but deſired to try all Things, and hold faſt by that Univerſal Love I was then a Witneſs of, in which I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in my Sprit for the Freedom and
<pb facs="unknown:003212_0009_0FF01D3222CD35D0"/>
Redemption of the whole Body, as being a living Member thereof; Tho' I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it would much more have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to thy Peruſal, had it been done by an abler Hand, as many there are under the ſame Suffering, to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the Faith of ſome. Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice not thou over ſuch, but be warned by them, leſt thou alſo fall. Yet to the Glory of the Grace and Power of the Lord, who cauſes Good to redound from Evil to thoſe that love him (which does not excuſe the Evil-Doer) that many have known Deliverance from this Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Practice, and the Offence given by it, being thereby drove into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, where they have ſeen the Ground and Nature thereof, and the Fruit it brings forth, the End of which is for the Fire; Therefore with a ſingle Eye to the Lord, and as it concerns thy own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Welfare, let it have its due weight with thee before thy Day is determined, and receive it as a Token of Love, and in that Simplicity in which it is committed unto thee, in as few Words as my poor

Capacity and the Eaſe of my Spirit will admit of, without the leaſt Prejudice to any Mortal, much leſs to the Cauſe of the Goſpel, or the true Miniſters thereof, who are for the Gathering of all Nations into the ſame Love; and they that deſpiſe them in that, deſpiſe him that ſent them; and they that deny him and his Goſpel before Men, them will he alſo deny before his Father and the Holy Angels: Yet we are forewarned by our Lord, to try the Spirits which would go forth to deceive, if poſſible, the very Elect; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaw them gone forth from amongſt them, recommending the Believers for their Protection againſt ſuch, to the Holy Unction in them, in which they diſcern the Voice of the Lord from the Stranger's, who never ſince his Fall could bear the Light, much leſs his Inſtruments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a ſure Defence to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; for if the Trumpet give not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sound, who ſhall prepare for the Battle?

perfect the Saints Faith, who in this Practice are an Offence to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to the Church of God. And let none think this too uncharitable a Judgment, conſidering the Nature of this Sin, ſeeing the Leaſt unrepented of is damnable, yet the greateſt Sin againſt Chriſt as the Son of Man, with true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (which is always accompanied with Forſaking and Reſtitution) is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable through the great Mercy of our God in his Son, which brings Joy to the very Angels in Heaven, and to his Church and Miniſters on Earth, whoſe Hearts and Souls are open for the Gathering of ſuch unto God.</p>

And take them amongſt a People of a ſtrange Language, and unnatural Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, which is hard for them to bear whoſe Conſtitutions are tendered by the Heat of their Native Country; for God that made the World, and all Men of one Blood, that dwell upon the Face of the Earth, has appointed them Bounds of their Habitations, <hi>Acts,</hi> 17.26.

            <p n="8">VIII.

And were you ſo living in the Body as to be ſenſible of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſome Souls go through on this Account, ſurely you would not be guilty of it, but act as they that ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Liberty.

            <p n="9">IX. Alſo <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Seed all the Families of the Earth are bleſſed, is eminent for his Regard to the Lord's Covenant, in that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all his Houſhold, both Children and Servants, whether born in his Houſe, or bought with Money, to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with him, that they might keep the Way of the Lord,<hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 9. So that herein <hi>Abraham</hi> fought them to the Lord, in the Faith, which was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for Righteouſneſs, and his End was anſwered, for <hi>Abraham</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God with all his Houſe, which, had he come by them as we do by the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves, they would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have regarded <hi>Abraham,</hi> or believed in the Lord, or his Ordinance. But does this appear in this Trade, that we ſeek them to the Lord and his Goſpel, or their Liberty and Property to us and our Children, let the Impartial judge, ſince we go for them for that very End: Therefore you are ſhort of the Law, which muſt be fulfilled before a higher

And tho' they held <hi>Iſrael</hi> as an Abomiation, yet it did not excuſe them from being overthrown, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly with the Name of the <hi>Houſe of Bondage</hi> throughout all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And then <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not offer their Offerings, neither could they ſing the Lord's Song in the ſtrange Land, but hung their Harps on the Willows when they were captivated in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> the Divine ſaw ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, as a great Milſtone in the Sea. Then will the Saints be glad and rejoice, that have not defiled themſelves with any of her Merchandize, the worſt of which is Slaves and Souls of Men; and thoſe Virgin Souls, whoſe Garments are not ſpotted with the Fleſh, but are thus redeemed from the Earth, can ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb, ſaying, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! juſt and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints!

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003212_0032_0FF01D0996063EA0"/>
or any other National Evil, but dare go no farther than the Law of God admits of, therefore cannot be inſtrumental to hurry into Eternity ſuch unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who being void of the Fear of God, and under the Inſtigations of the Devil, would rather hazard an untimely Death than be confined to labour for an honeſt Livelyhood; But when the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death is paſſed on them, and they wait for their eternal Habitations according to their Deeds, the Deceit of the Enemy is then diſcovered, and his falſe Supports fall, and they with them, into the moſt miſerable Condition, that they would then be glad of the worſt Terms of Labour, which before a ſmall Share for their Crimes (it being the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote for Idleneſs) or Captivity, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of Nature, which will ſubdue the wildeſt of Creatures) might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, as ſome Parts of the World have had good Experience of. And theſe Things bearing upon my Spirit, under Suffering with the Afflicted, that their Cauſe may be conſidered; it is not that Sin ſhould be countenanced, which God hath forbidden, but that Judgment may be mixed with Mercy, according to the Law of God, which has ſuch Regard to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003212_0033_0FF01D5B6DE2EED8"/>
Mercy, which always was to overſhadow the Judgment-Seat, that it enjoyns Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, not only to the Widow and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and Strangers, and Servants, but even to the inferiour Creatures, tho' they belonged to an Enemy, as <hi>Ex. xxiii.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>If thou meet thine Enemy's Ox, or his Aſs, going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again; and if thou ſee the Aſs of him that hateth thee, lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Burden, thou ſhalt ſurely help with him.</hi> And the 12th Verſe, <hi>Six Days thou ſhalt do thy Work, and on the Seventh Day thou ſhalt reſt, that thine Ox and thine Aſs may reſt.</hi> But perhaps thou'lt ſay then, <hi>Doth God take Care for Oxen?</hi> Yes, verily, the Law hath ſo guarded againſt the hard-hearted <hi>Jews,</hi> that it tenderly regards the very Birds of the Air, that if thou find one of their Neſts by the Way as thou goeſt, that the Dam ſhould not be taken with the Young; and tho' five of them ſhould be ſold for one Farthing, yet not without the Father, unto whom every Hair of our Head is numbred; then if I abuſe one of them, will it not groan unto its Creator, who made it of his good Pleaſure, and every Thing that hath Breath gives him Praiſe; who when he was intreated for <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:003212_0034_0FF01D5EF2CF2BF0"/>
the Seat of Violence, he had a Regard alſo for the Cattle, and does hear their innocent Complaint; as we ſee, when <hi>Balaam</hi> in his Anger ſmote the Aſs with a Staff, that the Lord opened the Mouth of the Aſs to reprove the wrathful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who coveted the Gain which the Righteous-Seed cannot live on, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto. A good Man, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is merciful to his Beaſt: The Beaſt ſerves us, and ſhould we not be ungrateful for their Service if we take not due Care of them: For the Nature and Spirit of a Man may be known by his Government over the inferior Creatures, which the Lord created for his Glory, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of Man. And ſhould not we, in Love and Thankfulneſs to him that made them (in which Senſe we are Brethren) and in Gratitude for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, take Care that they have Food and Reſt, and what elſe is convenient for them? and not only for our own Profit, but from a Principle of Juſtice in my ſelf: For ſhould I receive Benefits from them, and yet be ſo barbarous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them what is neceſſary, then certainly I have eſtrayed from the righteous Law of <hi>God</hi> written on my Heart. And if I ſhould kill or torment any of God's
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003212_0035_0FF01D6160D3E670"/>
Creatures, only to ſatisfie my Will, I act unjuſtly, and ſhew forth the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor my Maſter, and the ſame Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will be mete to me again; and tho' it were a Snake, or a Beaſt of Prey, let us take Care of entring into the ſame Beaſtly Property to deſtroy it. The Creature made not it ſelf, nor was it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in vain. Neither ſhould we oppreſs the Creation, by coveting to winter more Creatures than we have provided ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for. Would this be doing as we would be done by? Were we going a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Sea, would we not lay in Store for the worſt Weather and the longeſt Time? in which Duty the very Bee and the Ant are Inſtruction to us; and ſhall we want Wiſdom, or neglect to provide for the Creatures under our Charge, when our Intereſt is bound up therein? Neither ſhould we deface their Beauty, by Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their Ears, or other Ornaments which God has given them, according to his Law in Nature, for Defence from Flies and Weather; and yet we go to the very <hi>Indies</hi> for Fans and Umbrella's, which are for the ſame Service to us; for which the very <hi>Indians</hi> upbraid us, for Robbing the Creatures of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Covering, and yet cover our ſelves
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003212_0036_0FF01DB56682B808"/>
with borrowed Hair, which is unnatural, which ſhews the great Degeneracy &amp; Fall of Man from his firſt Creation; but as Man comes to be reſtored again thereto, thro' Chriſt, he acts in that Nature, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exert it ſelf otherwiſe than in pure Love and Tenderneſs towards all the Creation of God. And were we come to this innocent Life, of doing as we would be done by throughout all the Creation, whereby we could not inculcate any Principles in our Children, that proceed from the wrathful Nature, then ſhould we much more enjoy our ſelves, and they would eaſily be ſubdued by Love, which univerſally governs without a Sword, ſo that the very dumb Creatures have a Senſe of it, and are governed by ſuch in Peace, not finding Matter to raiſe the wrathful Nature in them: For as Love begets Love, ſo does Wrath beget Wrath, and they that take up the Sword ſhall periſh by it: So that every Sin brings its own Suffering; as we may obſerve by our neighbouring Province of <hi>South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina,</hi> when the Inhabitants in their Commerce with the <hi>Indians,</hi> would force their Wives or Captives from them, tho' for Debt, for which they ſold them for Slaves; which when the <hi>Indians</hi> beheld,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003212_0037_0FF01D656F7CB530"/>
it ſoon raiſed the ſame Property in them, to the Loſs of many Lives, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing of their Situations; and many fled in Canoes and Periagua's to Sea for Safety, rather than expoſe themſelves to the Fury of the <hi>Indians;</hi> who before were a peaceable People to them that were in Peace; which gave <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and Company Victory over them, and was their Safeguard beyond the Sword, and remains ſo throughout all Generations; which gave them Occaſion to bleſs the Lord, who removed their <hi>Indian</hi> Captive by Death, that nothing might appear to contradict that Love which united us in the Beginning as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by whom we were ſupported, which in Gratitude makes them near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, who made Room for us without Reſiſtance, as a Land given unto us by the Providence of God, which the Sword could never have done; and they as a wiſe People perceived theſe Things, and may judge many of us, that have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Innocency by our evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being derogated from that Love which might have been a Means of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them into the Nature of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, both the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> alſo, which excepts not nor deſpiſes any for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003212_0038_0FF01D67025A3BE0"/>
their Complections: Remember <hi>Miriam</hi> was ſmote for it with a Leproſy, tho' under the Law, being gone from the Teſtimony, which is the ſame in Male or Female, White or Black, whereby we are brought into Favour with the Lord; as in the Time of the Prophets, when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was under Suffering in the Dungeon, the only Interceder for his Liberty was <hi>Ebedmelech.</hi> the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian,</hi> for which he was ſingularly in the Lord's Favour, and rewarded according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as one that put his Truſt in the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxix. 18. Alſo under the Goſpel, there was not the leaſt Exception againſt the believing <hi>Ethiopian</hi>'s partaking of the Priviledge of Baptiſm; therefore let us not forbid or hinder them to be baptized, but ſtand clear of theſe Things, which the righteous Seed throughout the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe (which makes up the true Church) is redeemed from, who are in the Faith that a more general Purgation will be, whereby numberleſs Numbers will be brought in, and the Lyon's Nature will be ſubdued by the Lamb's, that the Child may play with the Aſp at the Mouth of the Cockatrice's Den; for not any Thing hurts or deſtroys in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, neither makes afraid. But what
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003212_0039_0FF01D68CC2A6910"/>
have they to do with Peace, who would impoſe that on another they would not bear themſelves? Did not they lay a Precedent to the <hi>Indians,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to do to them as they had done to other Nations? And what can we ſay againſt Bondage for Bondage? Which cauſed the Legiſlative Power, wiſely to make Laws againſt making or receiving <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves, ſeeing the Evil Ground, and the Fruit it brought forth; for every Principle acts in its own Centre in Nature, as the Loadſtone draws what has Affinity with it ſelf. So when the Sun draws up the Clouds from the Sea, which empty themſelves over the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, how induſtriouſly does it center towards the Ocean again, from whence it was raiſed, and had its own Being. So what has its Original from Covetouſneſs, which is the Root of all Evil, and ſo leads to Wrath and Violence to effect it, muſt needs leaven us into the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we may ſupport it by the ſame Power; therefore we cannot expect That to be bleſſed to us, which is the Product from an Evil Root, for then Satan would be divided againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:003212_0040_0FF01D6B588AD640"/>XII. Tho' I am ſenſible that ſome well-meaning People have unthinkingly run into it, neglecting the Oracle of God, have looked at others, and eſpecially thoſe who have preſumed to mention the Lord's Name, and to take his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into their Mouths, who are the greateſt of Deceivers, and have betrayed them into this Practice, as if it was no Evil, till they have ſeen their own Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and Bondage, and that they have been led aſtray by the others Hypocriſy, &amp; then they would gladly have been clear, and to have come to their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for whoſe Sakes am I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that you may wait upon the Lord to know his Will concerning you, who is able and willing to help the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere out of it, that would freely part with all for his Sake, and their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, knowing that Sin muſt bear his Judgments, that we fall not ſhort of his Mercies; for how can any Man in this Goſpel Diſpenſation, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not ſeared, die in Peace, to leave theſe poor Creatures in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtances; for though their Matter might grant them all Enjoyments but Liberty, how does he know what
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003212_0041_0FF01D0021553400"/>
barbarous Hands they may fall into when he is gone, which then would make their Bondage and Severity more grievous to them; which often happens; for thoſe that are trained up in this Sin, become more hard &amp; dark than the reſt of humane Race; which I have often experienced in my Travels amongſt Men concerned; and the more Men have pretended to Religion, the more dark have they been, ſtriving to cover their Sin.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Which leads me to caution all that have not defiled themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to ſhun it as thou valueſt thine own Soul, which ſhould be more to thee than the Gain of the whole World; that if thy Father ſhould offer to give thee Slaves, center thou to the WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS of JESUS in thy Soul, which cannot conſent to Sin, and in the Openings of the Univerſal Love of God in Chriſt for all Mankind, reſiſt the Temptation, whereby thou mayſt come over thy Parents for Good, by thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying an Intereſt ſo near to thee. I offer nothing but what I deſire to rule my Life by, and take to my own Soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Temptation; for I am ſo far from any Antipathy to the Black
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003212_0042_0FF01CE46FC90840"/>
People, that if it was a Trade ordained of God, I would lay out my Intereſt that Way.</p>
            <p>But I have not ſo learned Chriſt, as to think, much leſs to believe, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love of the Father, in him that ſuffered that ignominious Death of the Croſs, for the Redemption of the whole Creation, ſhould allow his Followers in the moſt arbitrary and Tyrannical Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that Hell has invented on this Globe; which would better become the Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by humane Force, than for the Miniſters of the Prince of Peace: For he that would propagate the Goſpel thereby deſtroy it. Therefore let us wait for Acceſs to the Throne of Grace, that we may have Admittance to the Balance of the Sanctuary, to weigh theſe Things; and then put in thy Lordlineſs and Riches, and Eſtates founded on Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and tho' thou haſt built a Town with Blood, and eſtabliſhed a City with Iniquity; and thou could'ſt put in the Glory of the whole World, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and is but according to the Prince of the Power of the Air; and then ſee if it will anſwer to the Loſs of eternal Riches, to thy Soul, which coſt

the Blood of thy Redeemer; under the Senſe of which am I thus drawn forth unto thee, that if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord I might be of Service but to one Soul, I ſhould be ſufficiently recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for my thus expoſing my ſelf to the Cenſures of Men; and for this Labour of Love, and the Groans and Supplications that have been offered up unto the Lord Night and Day, that this Trade, with the whole Train of Iniquity attending it, might be ſwept out of all Churches that make Mention of thy Name; that the Knowledge of thee, the Lord, might ſpread over the Univerſe, whom to know is Life eternal; that thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel may be preach'd in the true Property of it, to the Drawing in of Souls unto thee; that the Light of the Moon may be as the Sun, and the Light of the Sun as Seven Days; and that all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Violence, that has hindred the Progreſs of thy Truth, may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, with the Author thereof, to the Pit that is Bottomleſs.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. And tho' I eſteem my ſelf leſ than the leaſt of all his Mercies, and the unworthieſt to offer my Mite, yet the Lord knows the Sufferings I have gone

through on this Account, and eſpecially by Falſe Brethren, who, like <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> have known the Work of the Lord, and his Deliverance through the Sea, from the Oppreſſors who were overthrown therein, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards return to the ſame Nature which ſtrikes at the Life of the true Seed; to fit under their Miniſtry, but more to join with their Spirits in Prayer, who are Spots in our Feaſts of Charity, which is Love; though I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to deſpiſe the leaſt Child in the Truth, that may offer a few Words in Prayer or Praiſe, tho' never ſo brokenly, if in the Life and Senſe of what is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is thoſe that have covenanted with this Iniquity, for themſelves and their Poſterity to all Eternity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith <hi>Drixelex,</hi> ſhall Men be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed to Eternity becauſe they would Sin to Eternity; even as God is eternal; if he would ſuffer it, which burdens the Church, and the true Miniſters thereof, with the dry Repetition of their old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; and no Marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed like unto an Angel of Light, and his Miniſters according to the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, whoſe End ſhall be according to their Works,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003212_0045_0FF01D741850BF28"/>
and tho' they might have been of Service in Time paſt, yet if thro' their wicked Lives and Practices the Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws, let not ſuch Spirits uſurp Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to teach in the Church, who are worſe than thoſe that withſtood <hi>Moſes;</hi> or that ſhipwrack Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in an open Apoſtacy, are not ſo pernicious, as this Practice in thoſe that are eſteemed Miniſters of the Son of God, and are owned and ſuffered in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to tell of the Goodneſs of the Lord in the Form and Words of Truth, and yet deny him in Actions; which leads the young Generation that have not known the Lord, nor yet the Works that he has done for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to think <hi>Friends</hi> were thus in the Beginning; but my Soul, in Fellowſhip with them in the Spirit, hath witneſſed better Tidings of them, who quitted themſelves like Men, and the Lord's Power and Spirit was with them, in their Labours and Sufferings, under Oppreſſion even unto Death, in which they rejoiced, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer with the Seed that Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which forever reigns over the Heads of Oppreſſors, tho' they may wrongfully aſſume their Names, and their Maſter, and his Goſpel, which is clear,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003212_0046_0FF01D77816EED98"/>
and denies all ſuch that would introduce this abominable Practice into the Church of Chriſt, which miniſters Death and Darkneſs over the Churches; like the fallen Star that opened the Bottomleſs Pit, and let out the Smoke thereof, which darkned the very Sun and Air, and even perverts the very Order of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that not any thing therein has its natural Savour, while ſuch a Darkneſs has happened to thoſe that bear the Name of our worthy Elders, ſhould ſo lay waſte their Teſtimonies which they maintained with their Blood; for had you denyed them and their Maſter, you had never been capable of plunging my Soul into ſuch Sufferings and Death, where I had been ſwallowed up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unto Eternity, had not the Lord, who is rich in Mercy, given me a ſecret Hope which ſuſtained me, and ſhewed me his Way in the Sea, and his Paths in the great Waters, where he anchored my Soul unto himſelf, from all Fleſh; and brought to my Remembrance his Works of Old, and the Times that were paſt, when his Candle ſhone upon my Head, and when by his Light I walked thro' Darkneſs; and the Religious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I had, tho' in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

being governed by one, whoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Tears to the Lord, and good Counſel to us, in the very Power of Truth, did more ſubdue our evil Natures, than Correction; which gave me, though a Youth, a Senſe at my firſt Landing in theſe Parts, the Inconſiſtency this Trade had with a Chriſtian Education; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the Senſe I had of the Truth of God, and the Extenſion of his Goodneſs in this Goſpel Diſpenſation, wherein he has ſingularly manifeſted his Love unto all Men; in the Senſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shade of which, I have set with great Delight, and the Overflowings of his Goodneſs has been ſweet to my Taſte, and becauſe of the Flavour of the good Ointment, which hath ſpread to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Border of the Garment, therefore hath my Soul loved and delighted in him, as the univerſal Love of the Father. <hi>And after all theſe Favours, 0 Lord, and thy manifold Mercies and Viſitations of Love, ſhall I disbelieve thee in whom there is no Offence? that haſt pronounced thy Woe to the Offender againſt the leaſt Believer in thee, that it were better a Milſtone were hung about his Neck, and that he fathomed the Bottom of the Sea!

perſuaded tho' one roſe from the Dead.

Yet the Lord often raiſed his Prophets and Miniſters, to teſtify againſt their Practices; who proceeded to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, not only of Principles, which of themſelves are dead, like Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, but of Doctrine and Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003212_0071_0FF01D1EAFB5A750"/>
according as the Day appeared, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were faithful, having ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Teſtimony with their Blood, as an Army of Martyrs, from whence have proceeded, as the Seed of the Church, many righteous Plants, who have at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Times made a large Progreſs toward a Reformation; which was not ſo fully accompliſhed, until the Lord ſingularly favoured our worthy Elders and Fathers, with the Knowledge of his Truth, as it is in Jeſus, which gave them an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the humane Part in Man, which is from the Earth, tho' never ſo learned, cannot act in Things divine, which is beyond its Sphere; therefore they found a Neceſſity to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on a higher Power, that worked in them; which by the Diſcoveries it made, was known to be a divine Light, and Grace from Chriſt, for the Salvation of every Man that cometh into the World, that gives heed thereto; that they may witneſs the Miniſtration of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the very Root of Iniquity; which is to be conſumed in the Fire, that a Way may be opened to a more glorious Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs, performed by the Spirit of God, which makes up the Baptiſm of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

we have Fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, thus circulated in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, cleanſeth them from all Sin, by which a Divine Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is partook of between Chriſt and his Church, who cannot live without that Bread which cometh down from above, and that Water that is in Believers a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Well ſpringing up in them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life. But theſe Points of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine not being my immediate Concern, but as it may diſcover the Perfection of their Principles, and the Inconſiſtency this Trading in Bondſlaves hath with the Teſtimonies of theſe laſt Promulgators of the good Old Goſpel, of the Good-will of him who appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, in which they were conſtrained to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that ſame Love that abounded in them to others, without Exception, that they might partake of the ſame Salvation by it; and there are many living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that are as Seals of their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they were of God, having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the ſame divine Life and Power with them, who were in their own Eyes, and the Eſtimation of the World, as the Offscouring of all Things, becauſe of their Weakneſs and Meanneſs; by which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

to be the Lord's Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thro' them, who choſe the weak Things of the World to confound the mighty; who as with the Jaw Bone of an Aſs ſlew the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Heaps upon Heaps, that no Fleſh ſhould glory in its Wiſdom, or Strength, or Riches, but in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, which exerciſeth Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs, Judgment and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the Earth, <hi>For in theſe Things I delight,</hi> ſaith the Lord; and this was the very Drift of their Teſtimonies, which they recommended in the Power and Love of God, unto all Men among whom they travelled, without which they declared Faſts, and Sabbaths, and Sacrifices, were unacceptable unto him; yet they were Sons of Thunder againſt all Perſecution and Oppreſſion, whether in Liberty, or Eſtate, or Perſon, that all might enjoy Freedom, both inwardly and outwardly; as may be ſeen by their Epiſtles to the then Powers, and eſpecially to the Prieſts of the Nations, who in thoſe Times were ſo dark, that they oppreſſed the Poor of their own Flock, and even thoſe that could not receive of their Miniſtry; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to an Underſtanding, that no Oppreſſor can be a Miniſter of Chriſt, nor have Fellowſhip with thoſe whoſe
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003212_0074_0FF01D9C4F8CBA68"/>
Life is in the unrighteous Mammon, got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Oppreſſion, which <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> calls an unreaſonable Cruelty and Bondage, which is contrary to the Nature of the Goſpel they were Sharers of: And ſhall we think to perfect by the Fleſh that which was begun in the Spirit? which cauſed them to lay down many Things, not only for their preſent Evil, but becauſe of the evil Ground and Original from whence they ſprung; for if the Root be evil, the Fruit cannot be good, but curſed unto us, in that it eats out the Good like a Canker in many Families where I have dwelt; which I was ſenſible proceeded from this evil Diſcipline to our Brethren and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whereby we may draw our whole Race after us to Deſtruction by ſuch a barbarous Education, which is the High Road thereto, that it hath ſpread over ſome Nations like a Leproſy. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell feared his Brethren fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, not from a Principle of Love in the Damned, but as far as he had been inſtrumental to their Damnation, they might add to his Torment. And what hath more introduced Iniquity amongſt us, and hindred the divine Birth from coming forth, than this Trade? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every Soul that regards its own
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003212_0075_0FF01DA071E99680"/>
Good, beware that they defile not their Habitations by touching therewith, and further the Work; for if there were no Buyers, there would be no Sellers; was the Cauſe removed the Effect would ceaſe; which would directly ſtop the Trade, and manifeſt to every open Eye, the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of thoſe that have them. But this is not to be while the Devil rules in the Children of Diſobedience; yet let us that profeſs (as all true Chriſtians are) to be led by the Spirit of God, which changes not, but as in the Beginning, ſo does now lead thoſe that obey it into all Truth, which ſelected them from the World. to bear their Teſtimonies againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Times, and to confeſs, and proclaim many excellent Doctrines of the univerſal Redemption by the Grace of God, unto which they directed us, and recommended their Teſtimonies as a Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard to us from Deceivers, by which there is an infallible Diſcerning of Spirits, and diſcovers the Ground and Tendency of every Thought and Principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come forward to Perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt, that is perfect, which to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the eternal Truth, of God is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thro' that Power that raiſed Jeſus,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003212_0076_0FF01DA39AA32EF0"/>
as the firſt Fruits of the Reſurrection from the Dead, who is the Well-Spring of all our Mercies, thro' his Blood, and is aſcended on high, making Interceſſion for us, and has given Gifts unto Men for their Perfection. But what haſt thou to do with this Diſpenſation, that haſt not diſcerned thy own Spirit and Condition? How ſhalt thou miniſter to Spirits in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Thou, that teacheſt a Man ſhould not ſteal, but work with his Hands the Thing which is good; and yet doſt thou become a Receiver, which by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law is judged together? and blame <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> for Oppreſſion, and yet be guilty of the ſame Practice? As nothing is more hateful than Oppreſſion, which will make a wiſe Man mad, ſo what can more contradict it ſelf, than to deny the Uſe of the Carnal Sword, and yet receive of the Prey, which at beſt is but gained by the Power thereof? So that this Trade is far wide of Friends Principles in the Beginning; and is ſo to all them that are led by the ſame Truth: And ſhall we be ſo implicit, as not to ſee ſo unjuſt a Practice, which the darkeſt Times or Apoſtacy has not exceeded? To what Purpoſe then is it to ſuch to pretend to a Reformation? But it is not
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003212_0077_0FF01DA5297CCDC8"/>
ſo with the Honeſt-hearted, that mourns with them that mourns, and ſuffers with the Sufferers, even in the natural Body, and much more in the ſpiritual Body, that nothing might be ſuffered in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel that ſacrifices to an Idol, which hurts the tender Conſcience that has a Zeal for the Promotion of the Truth, knowing that the Luke-warm the Lord will ſpue out of his Mouth, unto which he will not return: Which is an Anſwer to thoſe, who finding that their Teſtimonies againſt Oppreſſion return upon their own Heads, they would have this Practice left paſſive, as if a Man's Liberty was a Matter indifferent: But, Beloved, was it your own Caſe, you would then make it, as indeed it is, the weighty Matters of the Law, Judgment, Juſtice, and Charity which is Love, which is the greateſt of all.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. But ſome object, that they may be brought to the Chriſtian Religion thereby, which is the greateſt of Charity. Which diſcovers the great Darkneſs this Trade brings with it; tho' the Apoſtle ſaith of ſuch, that do Evil for Good to come, their Damnation is juſt; and it is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003212_0078_0FF01DBCCD65B7D0"/>
well known that the Ground of this Trade had no ſuch Intention; however our Saviour's Rule diſcovers it, <hi>By the Fruit the Tree is known,</hi> which produces amongſt us no ſuch Conſequence; for how ſhould you be Inſtruments to gain them to the Goſpel, who have joined, or had Fellowſhip with their Enemies in Countenancing the Trade, by receiving of the Benefit; but Chriſt's Church will not be built up by that Power, who is able to take the Kingdom from others, and give it unto them.</p>
            <p>And tho' they may be bad in their own Country, yet Vengeance is the Lord's, and he will repay it in his own Time.</p>
            <p>And ſome alſo offer, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Neceſſity to be ſupported by the Labour of Bondſlaves, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without them. So might the Maſters of the Gally-Slaves anſwer; But if it is ſo, it were better to loſe that Life, that we may find a Life in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; which I am ſenſible, in the loweſt Ebb of Poverty, cannot ſubmit to any unjuſt Means for a Living, and yet begs not its Bread, but knows its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003212_0079_0FF01DA78AF83270"/>
port from the Providence of God, which cauſeth the Graſs to grow for the Cattle, upon whom the Eyes of all Creatures wait, and he gives them their Food in due Seaſon; who opens his Hand, and ſatisfies the Deſire of every living Thing; and ſhall we diſtruſt this Providence, who are under the Goſpel, unto whom the Promiſe is, if we ſeek the Kingdom and the Righteouſneſs thereof, all other Things ſhall be added; ſufficient for the Day is the Evil thereof; and much more the Miniſters of the Goſpel who are to live by it; for ſurely, if you overflow in Spirituals, that you are able to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto the Church for the Good of Souls, you need not go back to the Heathen for Support in Temporals: Yet if theſe Things offered are contrary to the Openings of Truth in any Soul, let not ſuch be wanting in tender Love to inform me better; which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in a private Manner, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the leaſt Satisfaction of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with either Nature, Reaſon, Humanity, or Morality, and much leſs with Chriſtianity: Therefore, becauſe of the Love that I bear to Truth and Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, it remained as a Burden to my Life,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003212_0080_0FF01DAA1E348758"/>
until I in ſome Meaſure, according to my weak Capacity, expreſſed my ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Manner, to lay open the Ground and Nature thereof, as a Caution to thoſe that have not conſidered it, and that I might diſcharge my Conſcience, before I go hence, as a Duty incumbent to my Brethren; that we may all ſee our Place and Service in the Creation, during our ſhort Abode in Time, that nothing may hinder our Happineſs to Eternity; and tho' ſome ſhould reſiſt the Truth until their Underſtandings become dark to that Principle, which would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it fully unto them, in the Day of their Viſitation, yet the Truth and its Witneſſes will be clear of their Blood; tho' their Loſs, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s, may be lamented, in that they have reſiſted ſo many Viſitations of the Love of God; whereby they might, as pruned Branches, have ſhewn forth the Work of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, and diſplayed unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then throughout the Earth, the Nature of the Vine that bore them; and then Beautiful would they have appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, being ſhod with the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel of Peace, but terrible as an Army with Banners, againſt the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003212_0081_0FF01DAD77932858"/>
Whore and all her unrighteous Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. But how is this Beauty defaced, by thine Eye becoming evil towards thy Brother, which hath darkned thy whole Body; and by how much thou haſt been enlightned, by ſo much the more art thou become dark, or thou wouldſt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that all Unrighteouſneſs is ſhut out of the Kingdom; How then ſhall the Unrighteous teach, or overſee, or diſcipline the Church, that have not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for God in their own Houſes, but have mixed with the Heathen for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, until they have loſt the Savour of the Goſpel; which hath been the greateſt of Sorrows to thoſe, that are ſenſible from whence ſuch are fallen, and for all that are concerned or ſuffer by the Trade. If <hi>David</hi> ſo much lamented for the Fall of one beloved <hi>Jonathan,</hi> how ſhall the very Earth mourn for the Fall of Multitudes that are born of her! And much more let ſuch Prieſts or Teachers, that have not preached a better Doctrine than this, either in Precept or Example, let them mourn between the Porch and the Altar, that if it may pleaſe the Lord who is Rich in Mercy, to work their Redemption, left while they preach to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003212_0082_0FF01DAF090B00A0"/>
others, they themſelves become Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and draw their Flock with them to Perdition. Ah! my Friends! the Conſideration of theſe Things hath been Sorrow of Heart (beyond what may be mentioned) to thoſe that have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Worth of Souls. Let ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſee, if there is any Sorrow to be compared to it; which I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have choſen to have bewailed in the Wilderneſs, were it the Lord's Will, than thus to have appeared againſt a Crime ſo much in Requeſt; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Idleneſs in the Rich, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Slaves, that it hinders the Poor from Bread; which are Evils in the Commonwealth, and no Doubt had their due Weight with our late Aſſembly, who in a great Meaſure have diſcountenanc'd the Trade, which has given them Honour in the Hearts of the Juſt, who are refreſhed thereby, whoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are to the Lord, that he would proſper the Work in their Hands, and rejoice that there are thoſe that ſeek the Good of both Church and State.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame Love that deſires the Welfare of both, is this freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
