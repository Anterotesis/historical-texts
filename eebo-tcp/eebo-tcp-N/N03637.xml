            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Words contain the ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of King <hi>Agrippa;</hi> which having ſome reference to what went before, it may not be improper to relate to You the Subſtance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Verſes, to which theſe Words are ſo cloſely connected.</p>
            <p>THE Chapter then, out of which this Text is taken, contains an admirable Account the Great Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gave of his wonderful Converſion from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> when he was called to make his Defence before <hi>Feſtus</hi> and another <hi>Gentile</hi> Governor. Our Bleſſed Lord had long ſince foretold, that, <hi>When the Son of Man ſhould be lifted up, his Diſciples ſhould be brought before Kings for his Name's ſake, for a Teſtimony unto them.</hi> And very good was the Deſign of Infinite Wiſdom in thus ordaining it: For Chriſtianity being from the very Beginning a Doctrine of the Croſs, the Princes and Rulers of the Earth thought themſelves too high to be inſtructed by ſuch mean Teachers, or too happy to be diſturbed by ſuch unwelcome Truths:

               </gap> Apoſtles, by being arraigned as Criminals before them, gained Opportunities of Preaching to them <hi>JESUS and the Reſurrection.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Knew full well that this was the main Reaſon, why his bleſſed Maſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Enemies at this Time to arraign him at a publick Bar: And therefore, in compliance with the Divine Will, thinks it not ſufficient barely to make his Defence, but endeavours at the ſame Time to convert, his Judges. And this He did with ſuch Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and of Power, that <hi>Feſtus,</hi> unwilling to be convinced by the ſtrongeſt Evidence, cries out with a loud Voice, <hi>Paul, much Learning doth make thee mad.</hi> To which the brave Apoſtle (like a true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the Holy JESUS) meekly replies, <hi>I am not mad, moſt noble Feſtus, but ſpeak forth the Words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I know that thou believeſt them.</hi> At which the Paſſions of the King began to work ſo ſtrongly, that he was obliged in open Court to own himſelf affected by the Priſoner's preaching, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly to cry out, <hi>Paul, almoſt thou perſuadeſt Me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>

WHICH Words, taken with the Context, afford us a lively Repreſentation of the different Reception the Doctrine of CHRIST's Miniſters, who come in the Power and Spirit of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> meets with now-a-days in the Minds of Men. For notwithſtanding They like the Great Apoſtle, <hi>ſpeak forth the Words of Truth and Soberneſs;</hi> and with ſuch Energy and Power, that <hi>all their Adverſaries cannot gainſay or reſiſt:</hi> yet too many, with the moſt Noble <hi>Feſtus</hi> before mentioned, being, like him, either too proud to be taught, or too ſenſual, too careleſs, or too worldly-minded to live up to their Doctrine,—in order to excuſe themſelves cry out, that <hi>much Learning,</hi> much Study, or what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, much Piety, <hi>hath made them Mad.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004446_0006_100D9D62009A6F28"/>
Lord, When ſaw we Thee an hungred, or a thirſt, or a Stranger, or naked, or ſick, or in Priſon, and did not miniſter unto Thee? Then ſhall be anſwer them, Verily I ſay unto you, Inaſmuch as Ye have not done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye did it not unto me: And theſe ſhall go away into Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> I thought proper to give You this whole Paſſage of Scripture at large, becauſe our Saviour lays ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticualar Streſs upon it; and yet notwithſtanding it is ſo little regarded, that, were we to judge by the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> one ſhould be tempted to think there were no ſuch Verſes in the BIBLE.</p>
            <p>BUT, to proceed in our Character of an <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian:</hi> If we conſider him in reſpect to Himſelf; as before we ſaid he was ſtrictly honeſt to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſo he is likewiſe ſtrictly ſober in himſelf: But then both his Honeſty and Sobriety proceed from the ſame Principle of a falſe Self-love. It is true, He <hi>runs not into the ſame Exceſs of Riot</hi> with other Men; but then it is not out of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, but either becauſe his Conſtitution will not away with Intemperance; or rather becauſe he is cautious of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting his Reputation, or unfitting himſelf for temporal Buſineſs. But though he is ſo Prudent as to avoid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Exceſs, for the Reaſons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet he always goes to the Extremity of what is lawful. It is true, He is no Drunkard; but then he has no Chriſtian Self-denial to plead for him. He cannot think our Saviour to be ſo auſtere a Maſter, as to deny us to indulge ourſelves in ſome Particulars: And ſo by this Means he is kept out of a Senſe of true Religion, as much as if he had lived in Debauchery, or any other Crime whatever. As to ſettling his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004446_0006_100D9D62009A6F28"/>
Principles as well as Practice, He is guided more by the World than by the Word of GOD. As for his Part, he cannot think the Way to Heaven ſo narrow as ſome would make it; and therefore conſiders not ſo much what the Scripture requires, as what ſuch and ſuch a Man does, or what will beſt ſuit his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations. Upon this account, he is not only very Cautious himſelf, but likewiſe very careful of young Converts, whoſe Faces are ſet Heavenward; and therefore is always acting the Devil's Part, and bidding them <hi>ſpare themſelves,</hi> though they are doing no more than what the Scripture ſtrictly requires of them to do: The Conſequence of which is, that He ſuffers not Himſelf to <hi>enter into the Kingdom of GOD, and They that are entering in he hinders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS lives the <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian:</hi> Not that I can ſay, I have fully deſcribed him to you; but from theſe Out-lines and Sketches of his Character, if your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have done their proper Offices, and made a particular Application of what has been ſaid to your own Hearts, I cannot but fear that ſome of you may obſerve ſome Features in his Picture, obious as it is, too near reſembling your own; and therefore cannot but hope, at the ſame Time, that you join with the Apoſtle in the Words immediately following the Text, and wiſh yourſelves <hi>not only Almoſt, but Altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is Time for me to proceed to the <hi>Second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Thing</hi> Propoſed; namely, to Conſider the Reaſons why ſo many are no more than Almoſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the firſt Reaſon I ſhall mention is, becauſe ſo many ſet out with falſe Notions of Religion; and tho'
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004446_0007_100D9D64CB561D68"/>
they live in a Chriſtian Country, yet know not what Chriſtianity is. This perhaps may be eſteemed a hard Saying, but Experience ſadly evinces the Truth of it: For ſome place Religion in being of this or that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; more in Morality; moſt in a round of Duties and a Model of Performances; and few, very few, acknowledge it to be, what is really is, a thorough, inward Change of Nature, a Divine Life, a Vital Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of JESUS CHRIST, an Union of the Soul with GOD; which the Apoſtle expreſſes by ſaying, <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is One Spirit.</hi> Hence it happens that ſo many, even of the moſt knowing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, when you come to converſe with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Eſſence, the Life, the Soul of Religion, I mean our <hi>New Birth in</hi> JESUS CHRIST, confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite ignorant of the Matter, and cry out with <hi>Nicodemus, How can this Thing be!</hi> And no wonder then, that ſo many are only <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> when ſo many know not what <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is: No marvel ſo many take up with the <hi>Form,</hi> when they are quite Strangers to the <hi>Power of Godlineſs;</hi> or content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Shadow, when they know ſo little about the Subſtance of it. And this is one Cauſe why ſo many are <hi>Almoſt,</hi> why ſo few are <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A SECOND Reaſon that may be aſſigned why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a ſervile Fear of Man: Multitudes there are, and have been, who though awakened to a Senſe of the Divine Life, and <hi>have taſted and felt the Powers of the World to come;</hi> yet, out of a baſe ſinful Fear of being counted ſingular, or contemned by Men, have ſuffered all thoſe good Impreſſions to wear off again. It is true they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004446_0007_100D9D64CB561D68"/>
have ſome Eſteem for JESUS CHRIST; but then, like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> they would <hi>come</hi> to him only <hi>by Night:</hi> They are willing to ſerve him; but then they would do it <hi>ſecretly for fear of the Jews:</hi> They have a mind to <hi>ſee JESUS,</hi> but then they cannot <hi>come to him becauſe of the Preſs,</hi> for fear of being laugh'd at, and ridiculed by thoſe with whom they uſed to ſit at Meat. But well did our Saviour propheſy of ſuch Perſons, <hi>How can ye love me which receive Honour one of another?</hi> Alas! have they never read, that <hi>the Friendſhip of this World is Enmity with GOD;</hi> and that our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has threatned, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me or of my Words, in this wicked and adulterous Generation, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when He cometh in the Glory of his Father and of his Holy Angels?</hi> But no wonder that ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> ſince ſo many <hi>love the Praiſe of Men more than the Honour which cometh of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A THIRD Reaſon why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a reigning Love of Money. This was the pitiable Caſe of that forward young Man in the Goſpel, who came running to our Bleſſed Lord, and kneeling before him, enquired what <hi>He muſt do to inherit Eternal Life;</hi> to which our Bleſſed Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Thou knoweſt the Commandments, Do not Kill, Do not commit Adultery, Do not Steal:</hi> To which the Young Man replied (Oh that every Young Man here preſent could do ſo too!) <hi>All theſe have I kept from my Youth.</hi> But when our Lord proceeded to tell him, <hi>Yet lackeſt thou One Thing, Go ſell all that thou haſt and give to the Poor,—he was grieved at that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and went away ſorrowful, for he had great Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons!</hi> Poor Youth! He had a good Mind to be a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004446_0008_100D9D67544B2508"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to inherit Eternal Life, but thought it too dear, if it could be purchaſed at no leſs an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence than of his whole Eſtate! And thus many, both Young and Old, now-a-days come running to worſhip our Bleſſed Lord in publick, and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his Goſpel, What they muſt do to inherit Eternal Life: but when they find they muſt renounce the Self-Enjoyment of Riches, and <hi>forſake All</hi> in Affection, <hi>to follow Him,</hi> They cry, <hi>The LORD pardon us in this Thing!—We pray Thee, have us excuſed.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT is Heaven ſo ſmall a Trifle in ſuch Men's Eſteem, as not to be worth a little gilded Earth? Is Eternal Life ſo mean a Purchaſe, as not to deſerve the temporary Renunciation of a few tranſitory Riches? Surely it is? But however inconſiſtent ſuch a Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be, this inordinate Love of Money is too evidently the common and fatal Cauſe why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR is the reigning Love of Pleaſure a leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, or a leſs fatal Cauſe why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians.</hi> Thouſands and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands there are, who deſpiſe Riches, and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be True Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST, would parting with their Money make them ſo; but when they are told that our Bleſſed Lord has laid it down as an indiſpenſable Condition, that <hi>Whoſoever will come after him muſt deny himſelf;</hi>—like the pitiable Young Man before mentioned, they <hi>go away ſorrowful:</hi> For they have too great a Love for ſenſual Pleaſures: They will, like <hi>Herod,</hi> perhaps ſend for the Miniſters of CHRIST, as He did for <hi>John,</hi> and hear them glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But touch them in their <hi>Herodias,</hi> tell them they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004446_0008_100D9D67544B2508"/>
muſt part with ſuch or ſuch a darling Pleaſure; and with Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> they cry out, <hi>Haſt thou found us, O our Enemy?—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TELL them of the Neceſſity of Mortification, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Self-Denial, and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them <hi>cut off a Right Hand or pluck out a Right Eye:</hi> They cannot think our Bleſſed Lord requires ſo much at their Hands, though an inſpired Apoſtle has commanded us to <hi>mortify our Members which are upon the Earth:</hi> And He himſelf, even after he had converted Millions, and was very near arrived to the End of his Race, yet profeſſed that it was his daily Practice to <hi>Keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, leſt after he had preached to Others, He himſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſome Men would be wiſer than this Great Apoſtle, and chalk out to us what they falſely imagine an eaſier Way to Happineſs. They would flatter us we may go to Heaven without offering Violence to our ſenſual Appetites; and <hi>enter into the Strait Gate</hi> without <hi>ſtriving</hi> againſt our carnal Inclinations. And this is another Reaſon why ſo many are only <hi>Almoſt,</hi> and not <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Fifth and laſt Reaſon I ſhall aſſign why ſo many are only <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a Fickleneſs and Inſtability of Temper.</p>
            <p>IT has been, no doubt, the Misfortune that many a Miniſter and ſincere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> has met with to weep and wail over Numbers of promiſing Converts, who ſeemingly began in the Spirit, but after a while have fell away, and baſely ended in the Fleſh; and this not for want of right Notions in Religion, nor out of a ſervile Fear of Man, nor out of a Love of Money or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004446_0009_100D9D6A35D1A620"/>
ſenſual Pleaſure, but out of an Inſtability and Fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper.</p>
            <p>THEY look'd upon Religion merely for Novelty; as ſomething which pleaſed them for a while, but after their Curioſity was ſatisfied, they have laid it aſide again; Like the Young Man that came to ſee JESUS with a Linnen Cloth about his naked Body, they have followed him for a Seaſon, but when Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more Reſolution, they have been ſtripped of all their good Intentions, and <hi>fled away naked.</hi> They at firſt, <hi>like a Tree planted by the Water-ſide,</hi> grew up and flouriſhed for a while; <hi>but having no Root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> no inward Principle of Holineſs and Piety, like <hi>Jonah's</hi> Gourd, were ſoon <hi>dried up, cut down, and withered.</hi> Their good Intentions are but too like the violent Motions of the Animal Spirits of a Body newly beheaded, which though impetuous, are not laſting. In ſhort, they ſet out well in their Journey to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but finding the Way either narrower or longer than they expected,—through an Unſteadineſs of Temper, They have made an Eternal Halt, and ſo <hi>returned like the Dog to his Vomit, or like the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I tremble to pronounce the Fate of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Professors, <hi>who having put their Hands to the Plow,</hi> for want of a little more Reſolution, ſhamefully <hi>look back.</hi> How ſhall I repeat to them that dreadful Threatning, <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him!</hi> And again, <hi>It is impoſſible,</hi> that is, exceeding difficult at leaſt, <hi>for thoſe that have been once enlightned, and have taſted the Good Gift of GOD's</hi> Holy Spirit, <hi>and the Powers of the World to come, if
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004446_0009_100D9D6A35D1A620"/>
They ſhould fall away, to be renewed again unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Goſpel is ſo ſevere againſt Apoſtates, yet many that begun well, through a Fickleneſs of Temper, (Oh that none of us here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may ever be ſuch) have been by this Means of <hi>the Number of thoſe that turn back unto Perdition.</hi> And this is the Fifth and laſt Reaſon I ſhall give why ſo many are only <hi>Almoſt</hi> and not <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT you, Brethren, have not <hi>ſo</hi> learned CHRIST, GOD forbid that a Fear of a little Contempt, a Love of a little worldly Gain, or a Fondneſs for a little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſure, or Want of a ſteady Reſolution, ſhould hinder you from entering into Eternal Life, or make you ſo ſottiſh as to think you may compound Matters between GOD and your Souls.</p>
            <p>III. PROCEED we therefore now to the <hi>Third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Thing</hi> propoſed, namely, To conſider the Folly of being no more than an <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the firſt Proof I ſhall give of the Folly of ſuch a Proceeding is,—that it is ineffectual to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is true, ſuch Men are Almoſt Good, but <hi>almoſt</hi> to hit the Mark is <hi>really</hi> to miſs it. GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to <hi>love him with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength:</hi> He loves us too well to admit any Rival; becauſe ſo far as our Hearts are empty of GOD, ſo far muſt they be unhappy. The Devil indeed, like the falſe Mother that came before <hi>Solomon,</hi> would have our Hearts divided, as ſhe would have had the Child; but GOD, like the true Mother, will have all or none. <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart,</hi> thy whole Heart, is the general Call to all: And if we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004446_0010_100D9D6C00BB31E0"/>
do not perform this Condition, we never can expect the Divine Mercy.</p>
            <p>PERSONS may indeed flatter themſelves that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Obedience will ſerve their Turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but GOD at the Great Day will ſtrike them dead, as he did <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> by the Mouth of his Servant <hi>Peter,</hi> for pretending to offer him all their Hearts, when they <hi>kept back</hi> from him the greateſt <hi>Part.</hi> They may perhaps impoſe upon their fellow Creatures for a while, but He that enabled <hi>Ahijah</hi> to cry out, <hi>Come in, thou Wife of Jeroboam,</hi> when ſhe came diſguiſed to enquire about her ſick Son, will alſo diſcover Them through their moſt artful Diſſimulations, and if <hi>their Hearts are not whole with him,—appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT Secondly, What renders an half-way Piety more inexcuſable is, that it is not only inſufficient to our own Salvation, but alſo moſt prejudical to that of Others.</p>
            <p>AN <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian</hi> is one of the moſt hurtful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World: He is a <hi>Wolf in Sheep's Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> He is one of thoſe falſe Prophets our Bleſſed Lord bids us beware of, in his Sermon on the Mount, who would perſwade Men, that the Way to Heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was obſerved before, <hi>enter not into the Kingdom of GOD themſelves, and thoſe that are entering in, they hinder.</hi> Theſe, theſe are the Men that turn the World into a lukewarm <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit; that hang out falſe Lights, and ſo ſhipwreck unthinking benighted Souls in their Voyage to the Heaven where they would be. Theſe are they that are greater Enemies to the Croſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004446_0010_100D9D6C00BB31E0"/>
of CHRIST, than Infidels themſelves: For of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer every one will be aware; but an <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> through his ſubtle Hyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, <hi>draws away many after him;</hi> and therefore muſt expect to <hi>receive the greater Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT Thirdly, As it is moſt prejudicial to ourſelves and hurtful to others, ſo it is the greateſt Piece of Ingratitude we can expreſs towards our Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST. For did He come down from Heaven, and ſhed his precious Blood, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thoſe Hearts of ours, and ſhall we only give him half of them? Oh how can we ſay we love Him, when our Hearts are not wholly with him? How can we call Him our Saviour, when we will not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſincerely to approve ourſelves to Him, and ſo let him ſee of the Travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied!</p>
            <p>HAD any of us purchaſed a Slave at a moſt expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Rate, that was before involved in the utmoſt Miſeries and Torments, and ſo muſt have continued for ever,—had we ſhut up our Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from him; and was this Slave afterwards to grow rebellious, or deny giving us but half his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: How, how ſhould we exclaim againſt his baſe Ingratitude! And yet this baſe ungrateful Slave thou art, O Man, who acknowledgeſt thyſelf to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from infinite unavoidable Miſery and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, and yet wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not give thyſelf wholly to Him. But ſhall we deal with GOD our Maker in a Manner we would not be dealt with by a Man like ourſelves? Shall we mete but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs Meaſure of Love to our Saviour, than we would have dealt to ourſelves? GOD forbid!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004446_0011_100D9D6ED71EEE18"/>
IV. No, (that I may come to the laſt Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, namely, to add a Word or two of Exhortation to be not only <hi>Almoſt,</hi> but <hi>Altogether Chriſtians)</hi> Let us ſcorn all ſuch baſe and treacherous Treatment of our King and Saviour, nay our GOD. Let us not take ſome Pains all our Lives to go to Heaven, and yet plunge ourſelves into Hell at laſt. Let us give GOD our whole Hearts, and no longer <hi>halt between two Opinions: If the World be GOD, let us ſerve</hi> That; <hi>If</hi> Pleaſure <hi>be a GOD, let us ſerve</hi> That; but <hi>if the LORD He be GOD,</hi> let us, Oh <hi>let us ſerve Him alone.</hi> Alas! Why, why ſhould we ſtand out any longer? Why ſhould we be ſo in Love with Slavery, as not wholly to renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, which, like ſo many ſpiritual Chains, bind down our Souls, and hinder them from flying up to GOD. Alas! What are we afraid of? Is not GOD able to reward our entire Obedience? If He is, as the <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian's</hi> lame Way of ſerving Him ſeems to grant,—Why then will we not ſerve Him entirely? For the ſame Reaſon we do ſo much, why do we not do more? Or do you think that being only half Religious will make you happy, but that going farther will render you miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and uneaſy? Alas! this, my Brethren, is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion all over! For what is it but this <hi>half Piety,</hi> this wavering between GOD and the World, that makes ſo many that are ſeemingly well diſpoſed, ſuch utter Strangers to the Comforts of Religion? They chuſe juſt ſo much of Religion as will diſturb them in their Luſts, and follow their Luſts ſo far as to deprive themſelves of the Comforts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Whereas, on the contrary, would they ſincerely
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004446_0011_100D9D6ED71EEE18"/>
               <hi>leave all</hi> in Affection, and <hi>give their Hearts</hi> wholly <hi>to GOD;</hi> They would then (and they cannot 'till then) experience the unſpeakable Pleaſure of having a Mind at Unity with itſelf, and enjoy ſuch a Peace of GOD, which even in this Life paſſes all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and which they were entire Strangers to before. It is true, if we will devote ourſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to GOD, we muſt meet with Contempt; but then it is becauſe Contempt is neceſſary to heal our Pride. We muſt renounce ſome ſenſual Pleaſure; but then it is becauſe thoſe unfit us for Spiritual ones, which are infinitely better. We muſt renounce the Love of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> World; but then it is that we may be filled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Love of GOD: And when that has once enlarg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d our Hearts, we ſhall, like <hi>Jacob</hi> when he ſerved for his beloved <hi>Rachael,</hi> think nothing too difficult to undergo, no Hardſhips too tedious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, becauſe of the Love we ſhall then have for our dear Redeemer. Thus eaſy, thus delightful will be the Ways of GOD even in this Life: But when once we throw off theſe Bodies, and our Souls are <hi>filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD,</hi> Oh! What Heart can conceive, What Tongue can expreſs, with what unſpeakable Joy and Conſolation we ſhall then look back on our paſt ſincere and hearty Services, which have procured us ſo invaluable a Reward! Think you then, my dear Hearers, we ſhall repent we had done too much; or rather think you not we ſhall be aſhamed that we did no more; and bluſh we were ſo backward to give up All to GOD, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended hereafter to give us Himſelf?—Let me therefore, to conclude, exhort you, my Brethren, to have always the Unſpeakable Reward of an entire

Obedience ſet before you; and think withal, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Degree of Holineſs you neglect, every Inſtance of Piety you paſs by, is a Jewel taken out of your Crown, a Degree of Bleſſedneſs loſt in the Viſion of GOD. Oh! do but always think and act thus, and you will no longer be labouring to compound Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between GOD and the World; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, be daily endeavouring to give up your ſelves more and more unto Him; you will be always Watching, always Praying, always aſpiring after far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degrees of Purity, and Love, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly always preparing yourſelves for a fuller Light and Enjoyment of that GOD, in whoſe Preſence there is Fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe Right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore! <hi>Amen! Amen!</hi>
