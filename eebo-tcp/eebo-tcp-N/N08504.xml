            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This was the Doctrine of Chriſt in that prepared Body, wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that ſtanding Doctrine to this Moment of time, and will be ſo while any Man breathes upon the Earth; there is no other Way, no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to ſet forward from Earth to Heaven, all being driven out of Paradiſe by the Cherubim ſet with a flaming Sword, there is no returning to that bleſſed Life, but by the Loſs of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cauſe Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of Return again but by this new Birth.

               </gap> the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are ſet to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, ſo you muſt return into the favour of God again, by the Light of Chriſt; and you have Line upon Line, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living Soul, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickening Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickened, and raiſed up into the Life of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> till the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> be taken away from them.</p>
            <p>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a ſlain people to the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in which Life there was a working of the Myſtery of Iniquity in every

Part of Man. One cries, lo! here is Chriſt, another, lo! there is Chriſt, and every one is following his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is ſtill but the vain Spirit of Man, running and ſtriving to recover himſelf; and this is the Cauſe there is ſo much Profeſſion of God, and ſo little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be regenerated, you muſt come to the Light of Chriſt, there is no other Way to it. He will ſearch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and ſet your Sins in order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compaſs you about; therefore you muſt ſee your ſelves a loſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a ſinful People, and ſo come to feel the Weight of your Sins upon your Conſciences, there is no other Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, 'till you have a Trumpet ſounding in your Ears, to awaken you, that you may ariſe from the dead, that Chriſt may give you Light; there is no other Way, dear People, you muſt bring your Deeds to the Light of Chriſt, and abide in the Sentence of Condemnation: If you ſave your Lives, you loſe them; if you Will loſe your Lives for Chriſt's ſake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt's Forerunner, declared, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to unlooſe, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire, whoſe Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010874_0005_0F851BD3A555E068"/>
will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable Fire.</hi> What is it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you to read the Scripture, if you know not this fiery Baptiſm, which all muſt know that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated; deceive not your ſelves, Chriſt will <hi>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and</hi> that <hi>obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtand here as a Witneſs of the Lord of Life this Day, there is no Way for People to come to Salvation, but they muſt know Chriſt revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but rendering Vengeance upon the carnal Mind, ſelf-pleaſing, and all inordinate Affection; he comes with Vengeance to take away thy Life— he will baptize thee with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire. If thou knoweſt not this, thou art not a true Chriſtian, thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph.</p>
            <p>If thou liveſt at home in the Body, and flyeſt for thy Life, and wilt not be willing to loſe thy Life for Chriſt, if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt not have Chriſt to waſh thee (ſome for Shyneſs, and ſome for ſelf Love will refuſe this) if Chriſt doth not waſh thee thou haſt no part in him; you muſt come to Chriſt to purify you in the Fiery Furnace; <hi>the Day of the Lord ſhall burn as an oven,</hi> (as the prophet ſpeaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his People from their Sins, <hi>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and eſtabliſhed with Righteouſneſs.</hi>
