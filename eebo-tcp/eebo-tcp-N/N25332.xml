            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE winter, preceding the ſpring of 1798, was more ſeverely cold, and the cold continued longer than uſual in this winter.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of March and April was wet and cold.</p>
               <p>From the 4th of May to the 23d, there was no rain, though the wind was generally N. and N. E. and ſome days diſagreeably cold.</p>
               <p>24th May, began to rain, and continued wet and cold to the 31ſt. The wind then changed to S. W. and the weather became warm and fair.</p>
               <p>From the 5th to the 14th of June there were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhowers, ſome days heavy, and one day loud thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The ponds became full of water—the roads deep with mud. From the 16th to the 19th, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantly cold. From the 19th to the 26th, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with frequent ſhowers. 27th, cool, Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter only 76 at two P. M. Mark Miller died to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, under the care of doctors Wiſter and Hodge, with ſymptoms of the Yellow Fever at Mrs. Reeves's in Gallowhill-ſtreet. He had been much fatigued and debilitated from loading a veſſel at Almond-ſtreet wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for ſome time. He had, alſo, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, ſlept on the bed in which her ſon had died of the Fever the preceding Autumn. Dr. Hodge was at this time indiſpoſed with jaundice from a diſeaſed liver.</p>
               <p>24th and 30th, fair and pleaſant, wind S. E.</p>
               <p>The laſt week of June was remarkably healthy.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER PHILIPS next door neighbour to A. Thompſon was attacked with fever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with malignant ſymptoms on the laſt of July or firſt of Auguſt; died under the care of Dr. Griffitts on the 4th inſt., being the 4th or 5th day from the Attack.</p>
               <p>Moſes Cox at corner of 2d and Spruce, died on the 6th.</p>
               <p>John Saunders occupied in the ſtore of Lloyd and Sparks on the wharf a ſhort diſtance below Walnut St. attacked on the 3d.</p>
               <p>Mr. Samuel Ruſſel clerk to Mr. H. Henderſon. Mr. John Lawrence. Mr. Morgan's ſon. Stephen Davis, who lodged next door to Philips's. Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph. A Tobacconiſt's boy. Mr. Iſaac Lloyd, all in the ſame neighbourhood, with ſeveral others whoſe names I do not recollect, were all taken ill with a fever of a malignant kind within two or three days of each other.</p>
               <p>The unuſual number of deaths that occurred in the firſt week of Auguſt, alarmed the Citizens and became a topic of general converſation.</p>
               <p>The caſe of a man who had worked on board the Ship Deborah, who died of a fever highly malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the latter end of July, had been reported by Dr. Proudfit, but being a ſolitary caſe had excited but little apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>On the 5th, Achiſon Thompſon's child was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with the fever.</p>
               <p>The College of Phyſicians met on the 6th at which time about 26 caſes of the fever were all that were known to exiſt in the city, and after conferring together they unanimouſly agreed to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,

it to be their duty to lay before the Managers of the Marine and City Hoſpitals, the following facts reſpecting its origin, and the means of checking its progreſs.</p>
                           <p>We have upon inquiry diſcovered that a caſe of this fever exiſted in the city on the 6th of June, and that ſeveral caſes of it exiſted in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with each other. They appeared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the ſtagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increaſe of the fever from the foul air of ſeveral ſhips lately arrived in the port, and from ſome damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29 July. In the courſe of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a ſingle fact that could ſupport the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of contagion being imported in the bodies or cloaths of ſick people in the ſhips or veſſels which lie between Walnut and Spruce ſtreets, where the diſeaſe has prevailed moſt. Many reſpectable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern authorities aſſert that the yellow fever is <hi>not contagious</hi> in the Weſt-Indies, and repeated obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſatisfy us that it is rarely ſo, during the <hi>warm weather</hi> in the United States. None of the caſes we have as yet ſeen have propagated it, and we conceive it to be an error as abſurd in its nature as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a diſeaſe ſhould adhere to the timber of a ſhip after a ſea voyage, and ſhould ſpread from the timber of the ſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contact through an extenſive neighbourhood, and ceaſe to communicate itſelf afterwards by long and cloſe connection of the ſick with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and attendants. We lament that this fact, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many others, upon the nature and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

of the yellow fever, which were ſtated in our letter to the Governor on the 1ſt of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legiſlature of the ſtate, have been treated with total neglect in the preſent health law: the diſtreſs we felt upon ſeeing that law is, however, much alleviated by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that we have not contributed, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by ſupporting an erroneous opinion, to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the preſent alarming calamity of our city.</p>
                           <p>We beg leave to recommend for the purpoſe of checking the progreſs of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</p>
                           <p>1ſt. The removal of all the families from thoſe parts of the city where the diſeaſe, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamination of the atmoſphere, appears chiefly to exiſt, and the preventing thoſe parts being viſited by the citizens.</p>
                           <p>2dly. The removal of all ſhips and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and ſtores of the city.</p>
                           <p>3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; alſo the waſhing of the gutters every day, and of the ſtreets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</p>
                           <p>4thly. The appointment of a ſufficient number of phyſicians to take care of ſuch of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</p>
                           <p>5thly. Publicly to adviſe the citizens to avoid all the uſual exciting cauſes of fever, ſuch as intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, fatigue, exceſſive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating paſſions of the mind.</p>
                           <p>6thly. To adviſe them, in every caſe of indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, however ſlight in appearance, to apply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for medical aid.</p>

ONE of the Fellows of the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of Philadelphia, aſſerts, that the College is in poſſeſſion of unequivocal evidence, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever, (which is eſſentially the ſame as the Yellow Fever of the Weſt Indies) now exiſting in this city, was brought into it by an infected veſſel, lately arrived from the Weſt Indies. The writer of this note has already ſeen it, in more than one inſtance, communicated by contagion, at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtance from that part of the city where it firſt made its appearance. The evidence on which this information is founded will be detailed as ſoon as health and ſafety ſhall be reſtored to the city. In the mean time the writer thought it would be an act of treachery to withhold the above information at a time when attempts are again making to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and miſlead the public mind.</p>

                              <p>THE Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hoſpitals have obſerved with deep regret the fatal conſequences of delay in the applications for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aid to perſons afflicted with the prevailing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever, and that the removal of patients to the City Hoſpital, in many caſes, is procraſtinated until they are literally ſent there to die.</p>
                              <p>They recommend, in the moſt earneſt manner, the early removal of patients to the City Hoſpital, where, the public may be aſſured, that every poſſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and accommodation will be afforded.—The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic are informed, that the care of patients, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the City Hoſpital, is committed to Doctor Phyſick and Doctor Cooper, who reſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly there, and whoſe profeſſional eminence, it is preſumed, will ſecure a juſt confidence.</p>
                              <p>An Apothecary alſo reſides at the Hoſpital, with an ample ſtore of the beſt medicines.</p>
                              <p>The Board conſider this recommendation as of the higheſt importance, and entreat the attention of their fellow-citizens.</p>

                        <p>I AM ſorry to diſcover by your letter, your want of ſucceſs in the treatment of our malignant fever at the City Hoſpital. I do not wonder at it. You ſeldom ſee the diſeaſe in its firſt ſtage, and when you do, you meet it in an aggravated ſtate by the motion your patients undergo in being conveyed to the Hoſpital.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to your requeſt, I have ſat down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of the practice which I have adopted in our preſent epidemic. In the treatment of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever of laſt year, I have occaſionally lamented the loſs of patients after reducing the pulſe by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the liberal uſe of purging medicines. I have ſuſpected that death occurred in thoſe caſes, from the ſtagnation of acrid bile in the gall bladder, or its cloſe adherence to the upper bowels in the manner deſcribed by Doctor Mitchell in his account of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741. The ſlow pulſe which occurs about the 4th day, I ſuſpect further to be the effect of this bile. Its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in a much more morbid ſtate in the Jaundice,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033589_0022_0FF792826BBCF9C8"/>
in reducing the pulſe, is well known. Mr. John Hunter ſays he once met with an inſtance in which it fell to 32 ſtrokes in a minute in that diſeaſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving theſe facts in my mind, I reſolved to try to remove this bile by exciting an artificial cholera morbus, about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more diſpoſed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for ſeveral years, that a cholera morbus is nothing but the firſt grade of bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever thrown in upon the bowels, juſt as the Dyſentery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common bilious or intermitting fever.</p>
                        <p>I began this mode of treating the fever eight days ago. My ſolicitude for the iſſue of it was very great. Thank God it has ſucceeded to my wiſhes, and thereby leſſened in a great degree, the anxiety and diſtreſs which accompany our attendance upon this ferocious diſeaſe. The medicines I uſe for <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> the gall-bladder and bowels and <hi>diſcharging</hi> the contents are, tartar emetic, gamboge, jalap and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel, combined, or given ſeparately, and in ſmall or large doſes, according to circumſtances. Perhaps Turpeth Mineral might be added to this liſt of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and purging medicines with advantage. In one caſe I gave four grains of tartar emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and downwards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the leaſt cramp or pain in the ſtomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon my patient. The next day he was out of danger. The perſon thus reſcued from the grave, was a ſon of Mr. Richard Renſhaw. Indeed I have not, as yet, loſt a ſingle patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one inſtance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of 16 years of age, to whom I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven near thirty grains of tartar emetic in the courſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033589_0023_0FF792840E1963E8"/>
of a few hours without producing the leaſt evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his ſtomach or bowels. I have obſerved the ſame encreaſe of ſtrength after its operation, that we obſerve after bleeding and purging in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever.</p>
                        <p>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies. I gave them on the firſt day of the diſeaſe in the year 1793, and always without ſucceſs. They uniformly did harm when given in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever in its worſt grade, in 1797. The reaſon of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was becauſe they were given <hi>before</hi> the violent mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid action in the ſyſtem, was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the diſeaſe, they are perfectly ſafe. The time for exhibiting them ſhould be regulated by the pulſe, and other ſymptoms. In moderate caſes of the fever, they are as proper in its firſt ſtage, as on the 4th day. As there is a bliſtering point in all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſo there appears to be an <hi>emetic point</hi> in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever It may occur on the ſecond, and it may be protracted to the ſixth or ſeventh day of the diſeaſe. I have not given the medicines I have mentioned in any caſe where the patient complained of pain or burning in the ſtomach, but I have conſidered a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, and a moderate degree of puking as no obſtacle to it's uſe, for Dr. Phyſick has taught me by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, that theſe ſymptoms may exiſt without the leaſt inflammation in the ſtomach, and that they have been abſent where the ſtomach has appeared after death to have been highly inflamed.</p>
                        <p>The cure of the fever ſhould not reſt upon a ſingle doſe of the medicine. I have given two doſes of it in a day in ſeveral caſes, and have given it in one caſe every day for three ſucceſſive days.</p>
                        <p>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are exactly alike. They vary not only in different
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033589_0024_0FF7928979188808"/>
climates, but in the ſame climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the ſame ſeaſon. The fever of 1797 differed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars from the fever of 1793, and the preſent epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the caſes I have ſeen, it exceeds the fever of laſt year in its malignity. Theſe variations in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes call for correſponding changes in our practice.</p>

                        <opener>FOR THE BOARD OF HEALTH.</opener>
                        <p>SINCE my laſt report, which was on the 15th inſtant, I have been engaged in attending three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with the malignant fever, out of town, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of which they appear to have received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their leaving it. Since my return to town, I find the woman who nurſed Mr. Douglaſs's ſon has been affected with the ſame diſeaſe, though ſhe was ſalivated from rubbing him with mercurial ointment, and muſt have received it from him by contagion,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033589_0028_0FF7929250E89918"/>
as ſhe had never been out of the houſe for ſix days previous to the attack.</p>
                        <p>I alſo know two perſons that have taken the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe this year who had it laſt year. A young man at the corner of Second and Lombard ſtreets, who lived in the family of Mr. Cockburn, at the corner of Spruce and Front ſtreets, (who with his wife and a boy lately died in the ſame houſe of the exiſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) and his brother is now in the diſeaſe. There are at this time 10 or 12 perſons with it in the Alleys near Mr. Hunter's, the druggiſt, in Second-ſtreet. Dr. Paſchalis has had five applications ſince laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one, a French jeweller in Second near Cheſnut ſtreet, Mr. Valence and ſiſter in Spruce-ſtreet, &amp;c. Dr. Church is attending two freſh caſes in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Mrs. Roberts, in Chriſtian-ſtreet. You need not be reminded of the caſes in Race and Vine ſtreets, and in Kenſington. In ſhort, the diſeaſe is rapidly and ſenſibly ſpreading into every part of the city, and can no longer be ſuppreſſed till froſt arrives to diſarm it of its power. If this be the caſe, (and that it is, paſt events demonſtrate) would it not be adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (I mean not to dictate but merely to enquire, from motives of pure and, in the preſent inſtance, diſintereſted humanity) to apprize the citizens which ſtill remain in town, of their danger, and to furniſh them with inſtructions how to eſcape its deſtructive ravages?</p>
                        <p>Advice from you, in your collective capacity, would have the virtue of a law, and would be prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed. From an individual it would appear preſumptious or at leaſt officious, and inſtead of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the effect intended, would only ſerve to rouſe the demon of envy, or provoke the venom of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I ſubmit the matter to your better judgment, and am, with ſincere reſpect, yours, &amp;c.</p>

                              <p>The preſent alarming ſituation of our city, is alas, truly deplorable—almoſt in a general ſtate of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the diſeaſe, to whoſe virulence, medicinal ſkill is lamentably compelled, to acknowledge its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority! Former experience is rendered in a great meaſure uſeleſs by the very material difference in the nature of the diſeaſe—The moſt copious bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the moſt violent purgatives have been found ineffectual; and the ſucceſs that will attend the new ſyſtem of emptying the gall-bladder, is at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the diſorder, I have very great reaſon to doubt it. I have known, lately, ſeveral inſtances that could not be accounted for upon any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than that of contagion. The moſt ſtriking of the caſes I allude to, is, where ſeveral of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the diſorder from a perſon in the family, whom they had for ſeveral days cloſely attended; without having themſelves been in any part of the city that could even have been ſuppoſed to be infected. I would caution my fellow-citizens not to truſt too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been ſo induſtriouſly propagated. A confidence in it, in caſe it ſhould happen to be erroneous, may prove the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thouſands, while by acting under a diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033589_0030_0FF792968986F700"/>
of it, and uſing every poſſible precaution, as many lives may be preſerved. It is at leaſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether it is or is not contagious, and there being a doubt, I think the wiſeſt courſe to be purſued is obvious. I would adviſe my friends to avoid, as much as poſſible, expoſing themſelves to the night air or morning fogs, nothing tending more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prediſpoſe the body to infection.</p>
                              <p>Temperate living both in eating and drinking is of as much conſequence. Any thing that enriches the blood—any thing that has the ſmalleſt tendency to inflammation is moſt carefully to be avoided. I ſpeak this, my fellow-citizens, with confidence. Both in '93 and '97 I knew many inſtances, where people ſituated in the very bed of infection, by living with extraordinary temperance, eſcaped. The idea entertained by many perſons, that generous living, or in other words, high ſeaſoned food, and a glaſs of good Madeira, from the beſt and moſt effectual bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, is too prepoſterous and abſurd to merit much comment. Conſtant experience and the plaineſt principles of common ſenſe flatly contradict it. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and at the ſame time, nouriſhing food, conſiſting chiefly of vegetables and ripe fruits, avoiding meats as much as poſſible, and never uſing any but in their ſimpleſt ſtate, I would ſtrongly recommend. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe, by heating the blood, ſeldom fails to be ſucceeded by a violent attack of the diſorder, and is therefore to be guarded againſt. I ſhall conclude my obſervations, by remarking that cooling drinks prepared with cream of tartar, tamarinds, lemons, currant jelly, or any kinds of acid fruits, are highly proper both as preventatives and remedies; and that nothing has a better or more powerful effect in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting putrid appearances than a conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting uſe of acids.</p>

                              <p>IT is an obſervation founded in truth, that few if any people in the world, have gone further in works of philanthrophy than the citizens of Philadelphia. Let him who diſcredits it, take an impartial ſurvey of the various inſtitutions erected in this city, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſuffering humanity, many of which are ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the voluntary contributions of benevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and his doubts ſhall vaniſh—Yet ſome further regulations appear to be indiſpenſable—there are perſons for whom, either the laws have made no proviſion, or to whoſe pitiable condition the hand of mercy, under the laws, has not been extended.</p>
                              <p>It is but recently that a poor wretch was ſuffered to lie and periſh in one of the ſtreets in the Northern Liberties, without the leaſt kind of aſſiſtance having been afforded him: whether the police officers are juſtly cenſurable for a neglect of duty, or otherwiſe, is not my buſineſs to enquire; the fact is, however, certain. Had his caſe been duly attended to, this hapleſs ſon of miſery might, perhaps, have been reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from an untimely grave.</p>
                              <p>In the Pennſylvania Hoſpital, a perſon cannot be admitted, but under certain qualifications; but this inſtitution is liberal in its principles, and in its prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is a point of prudence, and perhaps of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not to receive into the alms-houſe, any perſon having a contagious diſorder, it is not knowingly done—and, unleſs the object be afflicted with the prevailing malady, or ſuſpected to be ſo, he cannot procure an entrance into the City Hoſpital.</p>
                              <p>A few days ſince a circumſtance occurred which was truly diſtreſſing—A German, a ſtranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the Pennſylvania <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033589_0032_0FF7929B54EC4708"/>
cognizance, and he was refuſed. He then ſolicited an entrance into the alms-houſe, but having the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, and not being entitled to a place of reſidence here, he was unſucceſsful. His next application was to captain Allen, health-officer of the port, but the captain conceiving himſelf unauthorized to ſend him to the City Hoſpital, the poor wretch was turned away without any hope of relief. What became of him I know not, but the deep diſtreſs, anxiety, and deſpondency depicted in his countenance produced a correſpondent ſentiment of ſympathy in the minds of the byſtanders, all of whom ſeemed to regret his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required.</p>
                              <p>Let us but recall the caſe of this unfortunate man home to our own boſoms—diſeaſed, friendleſs and diſconſolate—ſituate in a ſtrange country, where he knew not the countenance of a ſingle human being; incapable of providing for himſelf, and unable from illneſs to leave the city; willing to take refuge even in an infected hoſpital, and I am ſure there is no man who is not abſolutely callous to the voice of miſery, and dead to every thing which bears the ſtamp of humanity, who will not approve of ſome plan being fallen on for the comfortable accommodation of ſuch of his ſuffering fellow-men—A plan for this laudable purpoſe is not only very feaſible, but of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy practicability. I would adviſe then, that a temporary building be immediately erected near the City Hoſpital, into which all diſeaſed perſons, willing to go, ſhould be freely and without ceremony ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If, on experiment, they are found to have the prevailing malady, they ſhould be placed in the hoſpital; if otherwiſe, they ſhould be provided for as circumſtances would render humane and proper. But, as a more permanent and effectual eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there ſhould be attached to the inſtitution of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033589_0033_0FF7929F0EBAC850"/>
the alms-houſe, not directly joining it, an infirmary, into which all perſons deſigned to be accommodated in the inſtitution, ſhould at firſt be ſent there to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo an examination of judicious phyſicians, and afterwards either to be provided for in the infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or to be otherwiſe diſpoſed of, as their ſeveral caſes might require. Surely there can be no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objection to a plan of this kind—the expence would be trifling, compared with the magnitude of the object, and the good which might reſult from it, would be incalculable. The man who will ſet about accompliſhing this object, muſt ſucceed—and will doubtleſs have, not only the ineſtimable enjoyment of an approving mind, but the bleſſing of many a woe-worn object of wretchedneſs.</p>
                              <p>If public inſtitutions will not ſhelter under their roofs, diſeaſed and penny-leſs wretches, can it, or ought it to be expected, that private perſons will?

                              <p>I am not ſo tenacious of my plan but that I will moſt cordially ſupport a better, if one more eligible is propoſed by a more happy genius: but this is no time for temporiſing, or halting between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſomething muſt be promptly done; and I now call on my fellow-citizens, in the name of every thing dear to humanity, not to heſitate, or trifle on the occaſion. To the guardians of the poor, and the managers of the marine and city hoſpitals, I make the appeal, and truſt it will not be in vain—They have the power and the means of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the object; they are men; they muſt be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a fellow-feeling for the unfortunate, and muſt be convinced of the urgency of the occaſion.

                  <p>Mr. Davis, who retired to Norriſton to eſcape the fever, died on the 24th, being the ſixth day from the attack. Had been repeatedly bled and purged with mercury by Dr. H. for the firſt three days—

                  <p>Official accounts from Boſton ſtate, that the fever there is on the decline.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Cooper, one of the reſident phyſicians of the City Hoſpital, and Dr. Sayre, appointed to attend the poor of the Northern Liberties, are both very ill to-day, though pronounced in the public papers of yeſterday to be on the recovery.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Cooper appears to have received the diſeaſe by contagion, in the Hoſpital, as he had not been in any other part of the city for more than three weeks before his attack.</p>

                        <p>IMPELLED by the awful progreſs and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to addreſs your feelings, as well as your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in order to avert the fatal deſtruction which, with rapid ſtrides, is pervading our ill-fated city and ſuburbs.</p>
                        <p>The beſt ſkill of our phyſicians, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of medicine, it muſt be acknowledged, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unequal in the conteſt with this devouring poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>With the moſt affecting ſympathy and anxious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, we have to the beſt of our judgments, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to employ, as circumſtances appeared to require, the power and the means entruſted to us, in arreſting its progreſs, and alleviating its concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant miſeries. We ſhall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but we have neither the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033589_0045_0FF792C8F58059A0"/>
nor the means to accompliſh ALL THE MEASURES neceſſary to check its extenſion, or provide for the preſſing exigencies of the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the inſtitutions under our direction, are impotent indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occaſion.</p>
                        <p>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends which alone can ſtop its progreſs and diminiſh its horrors.</p>
                        <p>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, cauſed tents to be erected on the eaſt bank of the Schuylkill for the accommodation of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; where near twelve hundred are already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, out of the fund appropriated for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the evils which environ thouſands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of thoſe who are in more fortunate circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at preſent, in the country, is too well known; and the expenſe attending the removal of a family has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged many from the attempt, who are in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtances to live comfortably at home.</p>
                        <p>What remains to be done? Citizens of reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and influence! come forward and form your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a committee for the purpoſe of erecting on the weſt bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected; let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as poſſible—If tents cannot be had, boards in abundance may be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the erection of ſheds. Admoniſh thoſe citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens who have no place of refuge, to take ſhelter there, particularly thoſe from the eaſt part of the city, the diſtrict of Southwark, and the Northern Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—in ſhort, ALL who can leave their homes without manifeſt injury; except thoſe who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the protection of the city and liberties.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="unknown:033589_0046_0FF792CAC61C58A8"/>
The committee ſhould have the general ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to preſerve order; contract for certain ſupplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the loweſt poſſible rates. Thoſe who are not in circumſtances to pay, muſt be ſupplied by the public bounty.</p>
                        <p>It is at leaſt an unequal, perhaps an unjuſt mode of raiſing money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but if on any occaſion it may be juſtified, the preſent may be aſſumed without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
                        <p>We call your attention to the actual and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed ſtate of our city. Conſider the mortality and rapid increaſe of the ſick at ſo early a period. View the liſt of your phyſicians, and <hi>mark how few are at their poſts</hi>—and we believe you will think with us, that the preſervation of health is only to be attained by flight.</p>
                        <p>Do not flatter yourſelves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured; we ſpeak from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not but that the lives of hundreds, perhaps of thouſands, may be preſerved by the adoption of theſe or ſimilar meaſures.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The following directions for the prevention and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thoſe citizens of Philadelphia, who are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure the regular attendance and advice of phyſicians, by</hi> BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. September 3d, 1798.</p>
                        <p>THE ſeeds of the diſeaſe may exiſt in the body, for a conſiderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally EXCITED by one or more of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes, which of courſe ought to be carefully avoided, <abbr>viz:</abbr> fatigue, a long walk, ſtanding in the ſun, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, coſtiveneſs, violent paſſions, or ſudden emotions of the mind, thin dreſſed, light bed cloathes, and above all, the night air.</p>
                        <p>It is of conſequence for our citizens to know that we have but one fever in our city at preſent, and that every febrile indiſpoſition partakes of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from miſtaking the firſt ſtage of the fever for a common cold. The miſtake is a natural one, for it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for medical aid as ſoon as poſſible after
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033589_0049_0FF792D35BE20FC0"/>
feeling the leaſt ſymptom of indiſpoſition at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture.</p>
                        <p>In the forming ſtate of the fever when the patient feels ſlightly indiſpoſed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>A purge of ſalts, caſtor oil, or a doſe of jalap and calomel. If theſe fail of giving relief, a gentle ſweat ſhould be excited in the uſual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pulſe be full, or tenſe, ten or twelve ounces of blood ſhould be loſt, before the uſe of the ſweat, and either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking the purge. Entire reſt from buſineſs and exerciſe of all kinds will be neceſſary to give effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the above remedies.</p>
                        <p>If the exiſtence of the diſeaſe were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been recommended, uſed before the fever was completely formed, there are the ſtrongeſt reaſons to believe there would be much leſs mortality from it.</p>
                        <p>After the diſeaſe is formed, and appears with more or leſs of the following ſymptoms, <abbr>viz.</abbr> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redneſs in the eyes, ſickneſs at the ſtomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The loſs of ten or twelve ounces of blood two or three times a day while the pulſe continues to be FULL, or TENSE.—If the pulſe ſhould be SLOWER, and APPARENTLY WEAKER than natural, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it diſcovers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural fulneſs and tenſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The bowels ſhould be purged at the ſame time with calomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or in pills.—The operation of this purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhould be aided, when practicable, by clyſters compoſed of half an ounce of glauber ſalts diſſolved
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033589_0050_0FF792D942A85410"/>
in half a pint of warm water with ſweet oil, molaſſes, and common ſalt of each a table ſpoonful, in it.</p>
                        <p>The bowels ſhould be kept gently open through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, by means of the above clyſters, and any other gently purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the ſtomach ſhould be ſick and oppreſſed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuhana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the diſeaſe, provided the pulſe has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compoſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach if the vomit ſhould operate more than three or four times.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Calomel ſhould be given from the beginning, in doſes of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to excite a ſalivation. If the calomel ſhould purge more than two or three times a day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have ſeen no death where this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine has produced a ſalivation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. After the pulſe is reduced by bleeding and purging if the diſeaſe has not yielded, a profuſe ſweat ſhould be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or ſix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him at the ſame time large and repeated draughts during twenty four hours of HOT camomile or ſage tea, HOT lemonade or weak punch, or any other HOT liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This ſweat ſhould be continued for twenty-four hours, 'till the patient is out of danger.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Bliſters ſhould be applied to the wriſts and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, in common caſes, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pulſe be reduced, or the ſickneſs
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033589_0051_0FF792DBE4DEE760"/>
at ſtomach is troubleſome. If the head be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, a bliſter ſhould be applied to the neck or to the crown of the head, firſt cutting off the hair and ſhaving it, and if the ſtomach ſhould be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected after the third or fourth day a large bliſter ſhould be applied to it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In caſe of delirium with a languid pulſe, poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of raw garlic with a little muſtard ſhould be applied to the feet.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Freſh air ſhould be admitted into ſick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when the ſkin is hot, and the pulſe full and tenſe. In this ſtate of the fever, the hands, feet and face ſhould be waſhed ten or twelve times a day with cold water. In a cool ſtate of the ſkin, or when the body is covered with ſweat, cool air and cold water are improper.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The body and bed linen of the ſick ſhould be frequently changed, and all offenſive matters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from them, ſhould be inſtantly removed.</p>
                        <p>In caſes of great weakneſs, the patient ſhould not be permitted to riſe from his bed when under the operation of purging phyſick nor upon any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The drinks of ſick people in the beginning of the fever, ſhould be toaſt and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly diſſolved in water, apple wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or barley water. In the latter ſtage of the fever, the drink may be porter and water, claret and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, milk and water, or comomile tea.</p>
                        <p>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever. In its ſecond ſtage the patient may eat bread and milk with roaſted apples or ſoft peaches, chocolate, ſago, tapioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</p>
                        <p>It will be improper to depend excluſively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033589_0052_0FF792DD75B7BD50"/>
force of them all is barely ſufficient in many caſes to overcome this formidable diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>P. S. All the above medicines with ſuitable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections may be had of George Hunter, No. 114, South Second-ſtreet; John J. Malcolm, No.78, South Second-ſtreet; and Robert Stafford, No.36, Market-ſtreet.</p>

                              <p>About the beginning of Auguſt, in conſequence of the foul, unfiniſhed ſtate of ſeveral water-lots, on the Eaſt river, between Co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>nties and the Old-ſlip, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 20 perſons were attacked nearly about the ſame time, with what appeared to be <hi>common colds,</hi> ſome ſlightly, others more ſeverely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighbourhood led to a belief that it aroſe from a <hi>local</hi> cauſe and threatened ſomething more ſerious. The foulneſs of the lots, and eſpecially two vacant ones, being receptacles of every kind of filth, was conſidered as <hi>that cauſe;</hi> and in purſuance of official arrangements, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately covered with wholeſome ſand: The effect was, a general reſtoration of the ſick.</p>
                              <p>In the neighbourhood of the New-ſlip, where the buildings for the moſt part, are ſmall, and many of them inhabited by poor people, who live in a croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, and in ſituations incapable of proper ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033589_0053_0FF792DF5D370CB8"/>
diſeaſes occurred about the 12th—a number of perſons died—but at preſent there appears to be no great cauſe of alarm in that quarter.</p>
                              <p>About the ſame period, or a little later, two or three perſons were ſeized at Bruce's wharf with ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious ſymptoms, and ſome deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the extremely foul condition of Bruce and Marſton's unfilled lots, bounding on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river, at the foot of Pine-ſtreet—the effluvia iſſuing from them being highly putrid and offenſive. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures have been taken, and are now in operation, to cover them with wholeſome earth, by which means it is hoped the evil in that quarter, if it has ariſen from this ſource, may be corrected.</p>
                              <p>About the 20th, ſeveral perſons were ſeized in Cliff-ſtreet, nearly in the ſame manner as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Coenties and the Old-ſlip. At firſt they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſidered their complaints to be mere colds taken by ſleeping with open windows in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hot weather which then prevailed—Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, it was a more ſerious caſe. The patients ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly grew worſe, and ſeveral died as well there as in John, Gold and Rider-ſtreets, and Eden's-Allies, all lying within the vicinity of Burling-ſlip ſewer. Theſe complaints, on inveſtigation, were thought to proceed, in part, from the offenſive ſtate of that ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which had, for ſome time, become a receptacle for various ſpecies of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly oppoſite John-ſtreet, commonly called Golden-hill-ſtreet—ſo that, whenever a South or S. E. wind prevailed, it blew through the ſewer, and bore a column of effluvia up John-ſtreet, and through that into Cliff, and the adjacent ſtreets, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the atmoſphere intollerably bad. The beſt informed phyſicians are of this opinion. The head of the ſewer has ſince been cloſed by a valve-door,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033589_0054_0FF792E228581C18"/>
and a conſiderable quantity of quick lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A ſimilar door, with the ſame intention, has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Ferry-ſtreet ſewer.</p>
                              <p>Other cauſes are alſo alledged, and with great plauſibility, at leaſt, if not certainty.</p>
                              <p>It is well known that the ceſſation of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe with the French Iſlands, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their hoſtile violence, has greatly leſſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the demand for proviſions: of courſe large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of beef remained in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-ſtreet. Much of this, from what is now ſeen to be an improper mode of packing, as directed by a late law, has lately become tainted, emitted a very putrid effluvium—corrupting the air and contributing its ſhare as a cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. We learn that the commiſſioners of the health-office have taken meaſures to have it all inſpected, and the ſpoiled removed out of town. Much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready has been ſent away, and the remainder is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as faſt as poſſible.</p>
                              <p>Theſe cauſes, with the immenſe fall of rain, and violent heats, experienced in the courſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, are ſuppoſed to have originated the diſeaſe which has ſpread ſuch panic as to drive many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies into the country.</p>
                              <p>On the moſt diligent enquiry however, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out, that any great ſubject of alarm exiſts, except in the neighbourhood of the New-ſlip—in the vicinity of Darling-ſlip-ſewer—and at the foot of Pine-ſtreet, at which places ſeveral perſons have died.</p>
                              <p>Individual caſes have alſo occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can diſcover. Theſe, it is generally thought were taken at one or the other of the places before mentioned.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="54" facs="unknown:033589_0055_0FF792E7D0E33248"/>
An opinion has been avowed by ſome, that the diſeaſe has been imported, or aroſe from damaged coffee, thrown out of a ſhip on Kelley's dock, weſt of the New-ſlip. This, in the preſent inſtance, is utterly groundleſs, and can ſerve no purpoſe but that of deluſion. The quantity of refuſe-coffee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to by our advocates for imported contagion did not exceed half a peck, and was the mere ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the hold.</p>
                              <p>We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a liſt of the perſons interred in the ſeveral burial grounds, that during the laſt week, they averaged about 12 per day—and that previous to Sunday laſt, there was no very unuſual mortality for the ſeaſon.</p>
                              <p>With reſpect to new caſes, enquiry at the beſt ſources, enables us to ſay they have very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined within the laſt 24 hours, and that the diſeaſe yields more readily to medicine.</p>
                              <p>How far this ſtatement authorizes the extreme alarm which precipitates ſo many citizens out of town, we do not know; but it would at leaſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable that all who remove ſhould leave their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, cellars and yards in a cleanly condition—that ſuch as remain may not be expoſed to the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their careleſſneſs and indiſcretion.</p>
                              <p>The ſyſtem of cleanlineſs adopted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the health-office, we are happy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is purſued with increaſed vigour; and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable efforts are daily made by that board, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every ſource of impure air in the city.</p>
                              <p>This ſtatement may be depended on—it is the reſult of enquiry of the firſt authority.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033589_0067_0FF793085B928860"/>
the recommendations of the Managers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and City Hoſpitals.</p>
                              <p>THE fever which at this time prevails in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate city and ſuburbs, is the very ſame in kind as that which prevailed in '93 and '97, occaſioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of quarantines; as I propoſe to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a future paper.</p>
                              <p>This contagion however appears, from numerous obſervations, and the moſt authentic facts, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing fever, only under <hi>particular</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: theſe circumſtances, removed or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the contagion becomes inactive and harmleſs.</p>
                              <p>This fever had not been obſerved to exiſt in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia for more than thirty years before the year '93—and has never been known to exiſt in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon in this climate; differing in this reſpect, from thoſe contagious fevers that are bred in jails, hoſpitals and priſon ſhips; but perfectly reſembling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turkiſh dominions in Europe bordering upon Aſia.</p>
                              <p>The circumſtances which render the contagion of the yellow fever active and favor its ſpreading or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming epidemic, appear to be, hot, rarified and ſtagnant, or confined air, more eſpecially when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and altered in its ſalutary quality by putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from dead vegetable and animal ſubſtances. Under the recited circumſtances the majority of thoſe who approach very near to, or come in contact with the ſick, ſo as to receive the exhalations emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the lungs or ſkin, become in the courſe of a few days, moſt commonly on the fifth or ſixth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch expoſure, affected with the ſame kind of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as all that approach within the ſame diſtance
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033589_0068_0FF7930CA3033DD8"/>
to the ſick do not afterwards take the diſeaſe though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their conſtitutions are not diſpoſed to favour its operation, that is, that they are poſſeſſed of a power to reſiſt its action or impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the ſtomach, or with thoſe in the arteries paſſes out again, with ſome of the uſual excretions.</p>
                              <p>The circumſtances which, in moſt caſes, appear to give effect to the contagion, ſo as to produce fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, after it has been received into the circulation through the medium of the ſtomach, lungs or ſkin, appear to be ſuch as have the power of inducing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and great debility in the ſeveral functions of the body, and conſequent ſpaſm or conſtriction of the extreme veſſels, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Among the chief of theſe, may be reckoned, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den expoſure to cold, after great fatigue, or after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly heated by exerciſe and expoſure to the ſcorching rays of the ſun.</p>
                              <p>Intemperance, ſucceeded by abſtinence, frequent blood letting, purging, faſting, and conſtant terror or dread of the diſeaſe, have all a ſimilar effect.—Whereas moderate and refreſhing exerciſe, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate uſe of ſuch nouriſhing food as has no tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſtimulate or inflame, and rather to preſerve the bowels laxative than otherwiſe, and the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate uſe of diluted fermented liquors, particularly ſound bottled porter and claret, have the moſt ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effect in preventing the operation of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and alſo of rendering the diſeaſe milder and more manageable by the phyſician, when it does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, than when it occurs in thoſe previouſly debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated.</p>
                              <p>The air in the open ſtreets, I believe, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſufficiently contaminated by the contagious articles (let the patients be ever ſo numerous in the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033589_0069_0FF79311103166A8"/>
houſes) to communicate the diſeaſe to any perſon walking in the middle of the ſtreet, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the oppoſite ſide. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Ruſſel, in his account of a peſtilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phyſicians that have publiſhed an account of the diſeaſe, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is alſo eſtabliſhed by the events of laſt year, and by thoſe of '93.</p>
                              <p>In the year '93, all the priſoners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the penſioners in the alms houſe; and the patients in the Pennſylvania hoſpital, eſcaped the diſeaſe, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the precaution of preventing the admiſſion of any ſick or ſuſpicious perſon, as well as every infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed article into thoſe places.</p>
                              <p>All the families, alſo, that remained in the city, and confined themſelves and their domeſtics ſtrictly to their own houſes, and ſuffered no ſick perſon, or any one lately recovered from the diſorder, or any material from an infected houſe, to come near them; and employed ſome truſty perſon to furniſh them with marketing and other neceſſaries from ſources free from infection, eſcaped the diſeaſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This was alſo the caſe with all the farmers that attended the market, that cautiouſly avoided ſleeping at, or going into any of the chambers of the taverns or places where they put up. This could not have been the caſe if the whole atmoſphere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxious exhalations.</p>
                              <p>By obſerving the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, thoſe inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the country, may certainly preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from taking the fever.</p>

obſervers; and they are facts that may be fitly oppoſed to the popular notions of contagion, ſo apt to affect the imagination in moments of conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſmay.</p>
                              <p>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have frequently ſeen perſons, whoſe office it is to attend the ſick, eſcape the diſeaſe in large airy apartments, without obſerving any precaution at all; but have ſeldom obſerved this to be the caſe in ſmall confined places unfavourable for ventilation, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the circumſtances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Cleanlineſs, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be eſſential for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</p>
                              <p>Perhaps if phyſicians and nurſes were ſtudiouſly to guard againſt breathing when near the patient, and were never to ſwallow their ſaliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew ſome agreeable aromatic ſubſtance; were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to approach the ſick with an empty ſtomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occaſioned tenderneſs of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at leaſt render the diſeaſe much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</p>

                  <p>The following intereſting remarks were publiſhed in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 13th inſtant:</p>
                  <p>"WE are apt to magnify whatever reſpects our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It ought not therefore to be ſurprizing if the papers of our city were full of remarks on the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fever. The extenſive miſfortunes that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces occupying almoſt excluſively our attention, our ſubſcribers at a diſtance would not fail to liſten with an indulgent ear to our tale of diſtreſs, and ſuffer us to fly to the only ſolace left us, that of expreſſing our ſorrow. So far, however, have the citizens of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia been from indulging themſelves in fruitleſs expreſſions of regret, that our papers contain few animadverſions, and no diſcuſſions, reſpecting the diſeaſe. They have not omitted to record facts, but every mind has been ſuffered without prejudice to form its own deductions. This APPARENT apathy has riſen not from any real indifference or want of feeling, but from a conviction derived from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that in the colliſion of hoſtile opinions, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is often loſt ſight of, and an obſtinate adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to error is generated in its room. In the year '93 the medical pen was, in moſt inſtances, dipped in gall. The ſeveral combatants took their peculiar grounds and diſdained, in too many caſes, to ſave the life of a human being by following any other ſuggeſtions, than their own. They diſtracted the public mind, and ſhook all confidence in medical aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The very reverſe of this has been exhibited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent ſeaſon. No men have allied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſupport of a favourite theory. The pride of opinion has exiſted but in a limited ſphere. The practice of one phyſician has become aſſimilated to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033589_0072_0FF7931A7B0F4EF8"/>
that of another; and from the beſt information thoſe preſcriptions appear to be very generally purſued, which are mild, and more congenial to nature than thoſe remedies, if remedies they may be called, which too often only reſcue us from the diſeaſe to inflict upon us one more fatal.</p>
                  <p>"Theſe ideas will not, at preſent, be purſued further. The chief deſign of theſe notices is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the ſuperior malignity of the preſent diſeaſe over that which prevailed in '93. It is computed that in that year 23,000 citizens left the city. They formed probably two-fifths of the inhabitants. This year certainly three-fourths, but more likely five-ſixths of the citizens, have departed. Taking the intermediate number, the reſult will be that twice the proportion of citizens remained in Philadelphia in '93 that do this year. Some allowance, however, is to be made for the increaſed population. But on the other hand, when the caution of the citizens is conſidered, and the arrangements that were made to reſiſt its influence this year, the laſt circumſtances will be found to balance the former. Beſides it ought to be remembered, that in a place contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a given population, if an epidemic rages, its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is not checked in the exact ratio of the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the inhabitants, but with much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. Notwithſtanding theſe circumſtances, the diſeaſe continues to rear its head, and to threaten mortality this year ſuperior to that in '93."</p>

                              <p>THE great advantage to be derived to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from an inſpection of the bodies of ſuch as have died of ſo formidable an epidemic, as the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, muſt be obvious to all. The following caſes of diſſection may throw ſome light on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe, as it prevails in this town, and may, we hope, be of ſome uſe, in inveſtigating the treatment beſt adapted to the purpoſe of checking or ſuppreſſing its deſtructive ravages.</p>
                              <p>The firſt caſe was of a man, who died on the 6th day from the ſeizure, and as no application was made to a phyſician, till the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe had nearly expired, the ſtate of the organs may be conſidered in a great meaſure as the natural effect of the diſeaſe, undiſturbed by art.</p>
                              <p>In the cavity of the cheſt, the lungs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably affected—They contained an uncommon quantity of dark blood in their veſſels, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them apparently more denſe than uſual; the veſicles not being diſtended with air, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance conſequently leſs compreſſible than uſual.—The poſterior part of both lobes was extremely livid, and in the cavities of the thorax was contained a large portion of extravaſated blood, firmly coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to the quantity of eight or ten ounces, as nearly as could be eſtimated.</p>
                              <p>The pericadium contained as much as two or three ounces of fluid blood. The heart was of its uſual ſize; but the coronary veins were ſo diſtended
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033589_0075_0FF793235A56D7F8"/>
with blood, as to exhibit the appearance of a moſt ſucceſsful injection. In the cavity of the abdomen, the part moſt conſpicuouſly morbid was the liver.—This organ appeared to be much inflamed both on its convex and concave ſurface; its ſubſtance was much indurated, and on cutting, reſembled in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a boiled liver. The gall bladder was contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a very ſmall ſize, and contained not more than a quarter of an ounce of a thick, glutinous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſpiſſated ſubſtance, reſembling pith. There were no marks of any conſiderable quantity of the bile having been lately contained in the ſack, and none of the neighbouring parts had the leaſt tinge that denoted its preſence. On cutting through the ductus communis choledochus, no bile iſſued from the aperture; the hepatic duct had alſo evidently for ſome time, ceaſed to tranſmit its fluid from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The ſtomach exhibited an enormous diſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its veins, eſpecially round the pylorus, and had every mark of great inflammation. The inteſtines in general, were in the ſame ſtate with the ſtomach; the ſmaller were conſiderably diſtended, and the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger contracted. The ſpleen was uncommonly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, but in other reſpects in its natural ſtate. The peritonaeum on the under ſide of the diaphragm, and the pleura on the upper, bore the veſtiges of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, but no other parts of thoſe membranes appeared to have been diſeaſed.</p>
                              <p>The omentum was conſiderably thickened, and from the turgeſcence of its blood veſſels, of a colour unuſually dark. There were no appearances in the thoracic or abdominal viſcera of ſuppuration, nor was any degree of foeter perceived to ariſe from them; nor was there the leaſt mark of even incipient putrifaction in any part of the body. It may be proper to remark on this caſe, that in every ſtage of the diſeaſe, the diſcharges from the bowels, were of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033589_0076_0FF79324EE44E4F8"/>
the colour and conſiſtence of water gruel, excepting a few evacuations of a matter ſimilar to what is called the black vomit; and that this uſually fatal ſymptom had alſo preceded the patient's death on the fourth day of the diſeaſe.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond caſe. The ſubject of this diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the body of a perſon, who died on the 12th day of the attack with ſymptoms of a mixed kind; a remiſſion of the diſeaſe had taken place at the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od uſually critical, upon which, on the 6th day, a delirium enſued, and continued to the moment of fatal termination.</p>
                              <p>On opening the cranium, the brain was found to have its veſſels aſtoniſhingly deſtined with blood, an ounce or two of ſerum was effuſed between the dura and pia mater. Under the ſagittal future, and by the ſide of the longitudinal ſinus, where the large veins terminate in that cavity, a lymphatic band, about an inch wide, extending nearly the whole length of the ſinus, was formed by the coagulable lymph, which had been effuſed from the blood veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, by the violence of the preceding inflammation, and this ſubſtance had ſerved as a medium of adheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the dura and pia mater in that part.</p>
                              <p>The lungs adhered very firmly to the pleura on the right ſide, and appeared poſteriorly to have been much inflamed, and in ſome parts to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in portions of about the ſize of a pigeon's egg. The left lobe adhered ſo firmly to the pleura, as not to be ſeparated but by tearing the ſubſtance of the lungs, which here appeared extremely diſeaſed, and in a ſtate of actual ſuppuration throughout its whole ſubſtance. The heart was in its natural ſtate. The liver was much enlarged, and in a ſtate that denoted a high degree of inflammation; the convex ſurface, of the great lobe near the gall bladder exhibiting marks of extravaſation, as if violently contuſed.—
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033589_0077_0FF79326DA5C61F0"/>
The gall bladder was full of bile, and the ducts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                              <p>The ſtomach was nearly in its natural ſtate, but on the inſide, the ſurface of the villous coat, was beſmeared with a matter, which ſeemed to be of the ſame nature with the black vomit, tho' nothing of this kind had been ejected in the courſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                              <p>The duoderum, was much inflamed for ſeveral inches from its commencement at the ſtomach, and the whole tract of the ſmaller inteſtines was in the ſame ſtate. The urinary bladder was contracted to the ſize of a pullet's egg, and its inner coat appeared to have been in a high ſtate of inflammation, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels having been diſtended to ſuch a degree, as to have ſuffered a rupture, and to have effuſed a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood into the cavity of this organ.</p>
                              <p>The ſtate of the lungs in this ſubject, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the conſequence, chiefly of a previous diſeaſe, independent of that which proved fatal here. An af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the lungs had ſometime exiſted, whilſt the ſubject was in other reſpects intolerable health, and in the purſuit of his buſineſs; ſo that a pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption would in all probability, have ſhortly put a period to his life, had the diſeaſe of which he died, never overtaken him.</p>
                              <p>The third caſe. In this inſtance the diſeaſe terminated fatally on the fourth day.</p>
                              <p>Upon opening the thorax, the lungs diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marks of inflammation, anteriorly, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely gorged with blood, in the poſterior part of their reſpective lobes.</p>
                              <p>The liver exhibited marks of inflammation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on its concave ſide, and poſterior part; its texture was altered, and of a very denſe conſiſtence. The gall bladder was completely obliterated, its coats having coaleſced with the contiguous parts ſo
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033589_0078_0FF79328C6F10210"/>
as to form with them one confuſed membranous ſubſtance. The ſtomach was externally to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a natural ſtate, but its inner coat was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that black coloured fluid, denominated the black vomit.</p>
                              <p>The color in ſome parts had been much infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as well as part of the omentum where attached to this inteſtine.</p>
                              <p>It is worthy of remark, that in both the caſes, where the gall bladder had been diſeaſed, and ceaſed to perform its functions; or where the liver had been rendered incapable of ſecreting the bile, the body became yellow, before death; whereas in the other, where the bile was found in due quantity, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance did not occur.</p>
                              <p>From the above diſſections, which evinced a deficiency of ſecretion in the billary organs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of cure ſeemed to be directed towards a courſe, which might obviate the inflammation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the organs diſeaſed, and open the excretory ducts of the liver, that the fluid might reſume its courſe into the inteſtines.</p>
                              <p>It is with the higheſt degree of pleaſure, that we communicate to the public our hopes that after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evacuations, the uſe of calomel may be found to anſwer theſe important purpoſes. This medicine has been accordingly uſed with much ſucceſs in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen patients within eighteen days, all of whom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one, have recovered; or have paſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous period. It has been given not in the uſual doſes, for the purpoſe of an evacuant by the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, but in ſmall doſes of one, two or three grains, every hour or two, ſo as to produce a ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as ſoon as poſſible; with this view, from one hundred to two hundred and thirty grains of calomel have been given in the courſe of two or three days, commencing the uſe of it immediately after the firſt
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033589_0079_0FF792AA98666A08"/>
copious evacuations by bleeding and purging; and in every inſtance as the ſalivation came on, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe has abated.</p>
                              <p>Coinciding in ſentiment, reſpecting the uſe of mercury, ſo as to produce a ſalivation, we with pleaſure mention the learned doctor Ruſh, of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. But the method is more explicitly and highly recommended by James Clark, M. D. F. R. S. E. in a treatiſe on the yellow fever, as it appeared in the iſland of Dominica, in the years, '93, '94, '95, and '96.</p>
                              <p>The doctor recommends the free uſe of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both as a remedy and preventative—and ſays, the officers of the army and navy, who have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and can be prevailed upon, on their arrival in the Weſt-Indies, to undergo one or two courſes of mercury, taking a few laxative medicines, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining themſelves to a moderate uſe of wine, and living chiefly on vegetables and fruits for the firſt two months after their arrival, may rely almoſt to a certainty, on eſcaping the fever.</p>

The corpſe was firſt diſcovered by the very offenſive ſmell which was found to proceed from the houſe. From the time that has elapſed, ſince the family left the houſe, the corpſe, it is thought, muſt have been laying there at leaſt a month—It was in ſo high a ſtate of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when diſcovered, that it was removed by pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the coffin, in which it was depoſited!</p>
                     <p>In addition to the above, a man was found in a houſe in South Water-ſtreet, near Cheſnut-ſtreet—it is ſuppoſed that he had been dead for three weeks—it was diſcovered by a man having occaſion to go into the houſe for ſome things which he had left; on opening the door, there was ſuch a ſtench came out of the houſe, that he was obliged to retreat.</p>
                     <p>A negro man entered the houſe and found the body of a man almoſt devoured by vermin; infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was given at the Health-Office, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; the people waited till 8 o'clock in the evening and heard nothing from the Health-Office, two black men were hired for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dollars, to take the corps and throw it into the

One half of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is daily carried to the grave. If we remain in town it is probable that the fever will continue five or ſix weeks longer, and by that time one half of our number will have been ſick, and one fourth of us will be no more.</p>

The names of the revd. Mr. Hendel, paſtor of the German Preſbyterian church, and Hillary Baker, <abbr>eſq.</abbr> mayor of the city of Philadelphia, are on the liſt of deaths to-day.</p>
                  <p>The city appears deſerted and diſconſolate, and the diſtreſſed imagination paints the fell meſſenger of death, waving his sable plume over the affrighted city, and ſtriking with his dread wand the opening tomb.</p>

                  <p>It appears from the returns of this day, that the late increaſed coolneſs of the air has increaſed the liſt of new caſes.</p>
                  <p>There are now near one thouſand perſons in the ſheds or board tents, in the encampment in Maſters fields, all from the City, Liberties and ſuburbs.</p>

On Sunday laſt the 23d inſt. the phyſicians at the encampment preſcribed for 32 patients who had different complaints; of theſe 32, there were only 14 that had the malignant fever. One of them had been out of the city nine days before he was attacked with the diſeaſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Hutchinſon Thompſon, a boy ten years of age.</p>
                  <p>Only four freſh caſes of fever have occurred at the encampment ſince the 23d, though freſh families are daily coming out of the city, and though many of them have been much expoſed to the late rains and damp ground. This furniſhes a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of thoſe who maintain the opinion, that the prevailing fever is propagated by contagion from the diſeaſed, and not by any depravity or nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious particles diffuſed through the atmoſphere from putrid vegetable or dead animal matter. For theſe breathed the ſame air as the reſt of the citizens, but none but thoſe that had received the contagion from the diſeaſed, were affected by cauſes allowed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to be powerfully adapted to excite the diſeaſe into action.</p>
                  <p>There were only 35 perſons with the fever in Boſton the 21ſt inſt. (Phila. Gaz.)</p>
                  <p>The fever in the jail of Philadelphia has hitherto been confined to the vagrants and criminals; the eaſt wing has been converted into an hoſpital, and every humane and ſalutary meaſure adopted for the convenience and cure of the ſick. (Ph. Gaz.)</p>
                  <p>There were 7 deaths at Wilmington on the 25th inſt.</p>

                  <head>REMARKS, WHICH FOLLOW THE ABOVE.</head>
                  <p>The above return has excited conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional alarm in town and country. It is certainly melancholly: but we deſire to praiſe Heaven, a ſmart north-eaſterly ſtorm, which we hope and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, will check the march and diſſipate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy of the peſtilence, and thoroughly cleanſe our atmoſphere, yeſterday morning commenced its ſalutary operation, and terminated laſt evening in a ſtrong north-weſter. We expect in a few days to congratulate our friends in the country, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Hygeia to the metropolis; and to invite their return.</p>
                  <p>In continuing this melancholy detail, we cannot ſuppreſs thoſe painful emotions, which naturally ariſe, when contemplating one of the greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which ever befel an infant nation. Almoſt all the ſeaports of the United States has, more or leſs, within theſe few years, been viſited with a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which threatens to depopulate many of our faireſt towns and villages. To arreſt the progreſs of this deſtroying angel, has as yet, been attempted in vain. It appears to defy the ſcience, ſkill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity of our moſt eminent phyſicians—and to yield to nothing but the froſts of winter. It ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly behoves every well-wiſher to his country, to continue to ſearch for the cauſe of the calamity, and, if poſſible, to remove it.</p>

The phyſicians of the encampment preſcribed for 32 patients to-day, not one of whom had any ſymptom of the yellow fever—but the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion complained of diarrhoea, catarrh, intermitting fever, or cutaneous eruption.</p>
                  <p>There are at preſent at the encampment more than 1300 perſons including children.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cooper, town clerk of Boſton, ſtates that ſince the return on the 24th to the 26th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 20 perſons have recovered, 7 have died, 44 new caſes have occurred, 97 remaining ſick, 20 of whom are on the recovery.</p>
                  <p>From 26th to 28th, 26 had recovered, 5 died and 12 new caſes had occurred, 72 remaining ſick, of whom 30 were on the recovery.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cooper aſſures the public, that the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns are particularly correct.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Campbell of Woodberry, and Dr. Martin of Cheſter, both phyſicians of eminence, are dead of the prevailing diſeaſe,</p>

The deaths ſtill about 40. The diſorder is much among the poor, who are unable to procure ſuitable nurſing. Simple remedies are found moſt availing. Caſtor oil and ſalts, with injections, are all the medicines, excepting lime water and milk, that are given by our moſt ſkilful and ſucceſsful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. Herb teas, particularly catmint, are very freely uſed to occaſion perſpiration, and where the patient has an attentive and prudent nurſe, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally under this treatment have recovered. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perſons have been ſick in my houſe, and except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, have all been treated in this way, and all recovered. My ſiſter had calomel, and ſuffered more than the others, though her attack was much leſs ſevere than either of them. I could mention other inſtances, but this may ſuffice. This practice is now ſo generally uſed, that many inſtances occur, where the nurſes never call for the aid of a phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and have much ſucceſs."</p>

                  <p>(Porc. Gaz. of Oct. 6.)</p>
                  <p>The health committee of New-London, in their report of the 25th ult. recommend to the citizens who have moved out, not to return at preſent, as the number of new caſes laſt week, has exceeded any preceding week.</p>
                  <p>Twenty-two perſons ſick at the encampment;—only one of whom had any ſymptoms reſembling the malignant or yellow fever. The complaints are opthalmia 4—remitting fever 1—intermitting fever 6—all with regular cold and hot ſtages, ſucceeded by perfect intermiſſions; ſome quotidians, and ſome tertiant.—Spurious pleuriſy 2—rheumatiſm 2—di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhoea 1—diarrhoea infantum 3—dyſentery 2.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, in a letter written ſome years ſince to Dr. Franklin, aſſerts, "That the yellow fever has chiefly raged in America in large families, towns, camps or ſhips, and has been twice brought into Virginia by ſhips of war;" and adds, "It is remarkably contagious, as appears from the greateſt part of a family being affected by it from perſons who had taken it in another place.</p>
                  <p>

"The moſt effectual remedies were lenient pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and clyſters frequently repeated till a copious diarrhoea and bilious ſtool enſued; with aqueous and bland drinks, and occaſional bleedings adapted to the indications expreſſed by the pulſe and pain of head, ſtomach or inteſtines. He alſo aſſures him, that he found mild purges and clyſters much more effectual than any other remedies ſo long as the pain and tenderneſs of the ſtomach, and conſtant propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to puke continued, upon receiving any thing into it, without regard to the period or duration of the diſeaſe, though the lowleſs of the pulſe ſeemed to oppoſe it."</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen ſeveral caſes this year of perſons that had the diſeaſe in '93 and '97, and have ſeen ſeveral inſtances of reinſection every time that the diſeaſe has appeared in the city ſince the year '93.</p>
                  <p>Hannah Norris died at M. Fiſher's <abbr>eſq.</abbr> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks after having recovered from the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in '93. Dr. Pleaſants died under ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in '97. Mr. Young, Mr. Conoly, Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Liſle, and ſeveral others, recovered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſecond attack. This year Drs. Cooper, Meaſe, and Leib, David Parke, Mrs. Mendenhall, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, had the diſeaſe that had it before. Thoſe caſes, however, have been very few in compariſon of thoſe that have eſcaped it, who have once had it.</p>
                  <p>It appears from Dr. Stark's diſſections, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the ſtomach, however induced, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame ſymptoms as the yellow fever; and that what is called the black vomit is owing to a mortification of the vellous coat of the ſtomach,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033589_0107_0FF7935067773DB0"/>
and blood which has eſcaped from the dilated veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and become putrid.</p>
                  <p>[See Stark's Clinical and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Obſervations.]</p>
                  <p>It appears from Dr. Crawford's experiments, that the gaſes or aerial exhalations, extricated from the fleſh of animals, by putrefaction, conſiſt of animal hepatic air, i. e. hydrogen holding ſulphur in ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a ſmall proportion of azotic gas, or air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its ozygene. And the ſmell of the breath and of the perſpirable matter, in malignant fevers, evidently demonſtrate that they contain animal hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic, hydrogenous gas, and not ſuper oxygenated azote, as has been preſumed by Dr. S. L. Mitchell, of New-York.</p>
                  <p>In theſe fevers a viciated ſecretion takes place, and the excretions occaſion a ſimilar fever when taken into a sound body.</p>

where ſo much caution and prudence is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>The apprehenſion of the Board has been awakened by the too haſty return of many individuals, who have inconſiderately hazarded their own health and the public welfare; ſeveral of whom, the Board are ſorry to add, have been ſeized with the fever ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their return.</p>
                        <p>The weather, ſince the 6th inſt. has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unfavourable, &amp; the number of the ſick have conſiderably encreaſed; which would be augmented by the accumulation of perſons, particularly thoſe from a pure atmoſphere. The Board earneſtly ſolicit public attention to conſiderations ſo important; and entreat the forbearance of their fellow-citizens, until returning health ſhall invite them home.</p>
                        <p>The Board cannot too ſtrongly impreſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and neceſſity of cleanſing and purifying, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the return of the inhabitants), the bedding, cloathing, and houſes, in which the diſeaſe has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted; for which purpoſe, they recommend <hi>the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe of lime.</hi> They alſo repeat their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the commiſſioners, to have the pumps fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and copiouſly worked, as the water is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenſive and unwholeſome.</p>
                        <p>The Board aſſure their fellow-citizens that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the health of the City and Liberties ſhall be ſo reſtored as to admit of the return of the inhabitants with ſafety, not a moment ſhall be delayed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the glad tidings.</p>

                        <p>It is probable one of my attendants in the ſtore may ſoon fall a victim to an inveterate bilious fever. On Sunday he requeſted of me leave to go down the river to ſee a ſhip, (for he had never ſeen one) and as he was a good fellow, and ſeldom out, I conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with a charge of good behaviour. With him went a party of five youths, and having to wait for the flood tide, they did not return till late in the night. The two ſucceeding days he was well, but on Wedneſday was taken with an ague, pains in his joints, eyes inflamed, and vomiting of bile; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                        <p>It ſeems difficult to aſcertain the riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this fatal diſeaſe; but the circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated are theſe:</p>
                        <p>1ſt. I underſtand the ſhip Neſtor, in which the ſuſpected infection came, was from Philadelphia or Boſton; but what paſſage ſhe had, I know not.</p>
                        <p>2d. 'Tis reported that three ſailors died on board before ſhe reached City Point.</p>
                        <p>3d. Before my youth went on board, a negro aſhore adviſed him not to go there, for people had died in that ſhip of the fever; and when the captain came aſhore with the boat for them, he refuſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the captain ſeriouſly avered that the negro was angry with him, and reported this maliciouſly to the young men, who at length conſented to go.</p>
                        <p>4th. The ſhip had nothing in but dirt balaſt from the town ſhe left, and it being Sunday, all or chief part of the hands were aſhore. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they had pumped out of her ſeveral gallons of fetid bilge water, the ſcent of which even then remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unpleaſant, for it had been in her ſome weeks.—Moſt of the hands who pumped it ſickened and died, as did ſeveral of thoſe who helped to land the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="unknown:033589_0112_0FF7935CCD523F70"/>
5th. Since the youths left the ſhip, ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in that neighbourhood have died of the like fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Dr. Walker, who viſited them while a black vomiting was on ſome of them, is now very ſick in the houſe oppoſite us, but I hope is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>6th. The youths left the ſhip at 6 o'clock P. M. and from getting aground frequently did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home before midnight. In the day they were expoſed to an hot ſun, and at night to an heavy dew.</p>
                        <p>7th. On the Tueſday of that ſame week, at 12 o'clock, my lad was taken with an ague, and before night every one of the party that went in the veſſel had an high fever, but two of the negroes who went to row and avoided the ſhip, eſcaped the fever.—Many are willing to attribute the diſeaſe to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſun and dew, and ſay theſe negroes kept up perſpiration by rowing home, while the whites lay expoſed to the cool dew in an open boat. My youth was bled on Wedneſday morning, but his veins were ſo ſmall and low, that Dr. Shore could not let as much blood as he wiſhed, (only a tea cup full) for they approve of copious bleeding. His complaint was a deadly ſickneſs at the ſtomach, with pains in every limb, attended with frequent vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of yellow bile. During his diſorder he took a quantity of pills which operated well; injections were adminiſtered; each temple cup'd; ſtomach and legs bliſtered; and the laſt medicine given was, I believe, an emetic powder. On Saturday he was very reſtleſs, and at night a delirium and ſtupor came on; thus he remained till Sunday, when the above emetic was given, ſoon after which he made ſome efforts to vomit, but did not; his eyes began to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate exceedingly, and with much oppreſſion at his breaſt, he expired. His corps was not more yellow
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033589_0113_0FF79361E8018038"/>
than uſual; four perſons were interred when he was, carried off by fevers, I believe.</p>
                        <p>The captain (Wilſon) of the ſhip Delight, which lay near the Neſtor, and with whom the youths dined, did not live ſo long as my lad; but he was a very intemperate man, even in his ſickneſs, and had been on Monday expoſed to wet and the heat of the ſun. He died in town, diſtracted with the fever and liquor he drank when he came up.—The eyes of every one were remarkably glaſſy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, but not red as is generally repreſented.</p>
                        <p>This ſummer I went to the tin factory oppoſite us, to get ſome tin which they kept in a back houſe; the yard was ſo exceſſive filthy, I aſked them if they were hatching the yellow fever? they hoped not; but every creature of them have had a fever like the above; ſome had it before the ſhipping came; and ſeveral about this town have the like fever, but are chiefly on the recovery. One Mr. Cooper, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh merchant at Blandford, (in this town) died yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning; and I ſuppoſe there are four or five in town ſick of the ſame diſeaſe. Our family phyſician is juſt recovering; his head was bliſtered, and he was delirious ſeveral days. One of the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners told me he ſuffered more with it in one day, than with all the pain and ſickneſs of his whole life, (which was 30 years) and could get no relief till the doctor allowed him to drink cold water in ſmall draughts at a time. This enabled him to keep his medicine down, which he could not do before. Our phyſicians think the diſeaſe originates from the ſun, heat, dew, filth, &amp;c.—probably it does, for no one caught it of my young man; and had it been the ſmall-pox, I dare ſay they would have felt the affects of it. Every doſe of medicine I gave him with my own hand, that he might have a fair chance. I uſed no preventative, but burnt tar frequently in the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033589_0114_0FF79363870B9AA8"/>
houſe and ſprinkled it fore and aft with vinegar, keeping every window open day and night. Since writing the above, I underſtand that two of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond craft, that had been employed at one of theſe ſhips, loſt almoſt every hand on board; one of them had only a boy left. We have cool nights now, but the middle of the day is very warm and dry. When our family phyſician (Dr. Shore) recovers, you ſhall know more of this fever. I have been much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at home; and as City Point is 12 miles off, and ſeveral ſhips have been there, I cannot get a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account of it. I believe ſeveral died in one of the ſhips at the Cape, but the captain endeavoured to conceal it, that it might not prevent his getting hands. Your friend and ſervant.</p>

Only two new caſes of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever have occurred at the encampment for ſome days.

                  <p>From comparing the effects of mercury, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent caſes, it appears to me, now, to be proper to excite ſalivation in every caſe where malignant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are evident at an early period of the fever; but that it is ſuperfluous, if not injurious, to induce ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation in caſes where inflammatory ſymptoms are predominant, till theſe are induced by ſufficient
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033589_0117_0FF7936C525D4F28"/>
blood-letting and purging, which in the majority of caſes ſo circumſtanced, cure the diſeaſe without the aid of any additional remedy. The yellow fever correſponds in this reſpect with the variolous fever, or ſmall-pox. In thoſe caſes where the eruption appears with a confluent aſpect, accompanied with great debility, oppreſſion, and uneaſineſs about the region of the heart, mercury has been long recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by ſeveral eminent phyſicians as a more effectual remedy than any other, when reſtrained by the addition of opium, from occaſioning frequent evacuations by the bowels. But I believe no one can deem it neceſſary to employ ſo violent a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the diſtinct and ſimple form of the diſeaſe, when more ſafe ones will anſwer as well.</p>
                  <p>It was the general practice laſt year, as well as the preſent, to give mercury in all caſes indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, which was certainly injudicious, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes retarded the cure, eſpecially in caſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with inflammatory ſymptoms; but in caſes where nervous ſymptoms predominated from the beginning, &amp; unaccompanied with ſevere pain in the head, eyes, or ſtomach, or with ſymptoms of dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or gravel, calomel was found more ſucceſsful when given in doſes of two grains every two hours, and the application of two or three drachms of ſtrong mercurial ointment to the region of the liver and to different parts of the body four times in the courſe of every 24 hours, reſtraining the mercury by the addition of a few drops of laudanum, occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it occaſioned more than one or two evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the courſe of the day, till ſigns of ſalivation appeared, and no longer; the patient, at the ſame time, abſtaining from all fleſh meats and vinous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. The early and repeated application of bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in ſuch caſes, were generally beneficial; but blood-letting did injury.</p>

                              <head> From the Philadelphia Gazette of this date. A DESCRIPTION Of the ENCAMPMENT at Maſters' place.</head>
                              <p>THE encampment at Maſters' place is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe work, conſidering the ſhort period in which it was executed. Buildings comfortable, convenient, and in every reſpect well adapted to the occaſion, have been erected in eight or nine days, ſufficient to accommodate 2000 people. Beſides thoſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there were erected, in the ſame time, an hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a large ſtore-houſe and offices, a bake-houſe and oven, and five kitchens, each with eight large fire places. This little town is built on a well choſen ſpot, and is laid out in regular order the ſtreets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſecting each other. The rules and regulations, which are printed and put up in different parts of the encampment, do honour to the heads and hearts of the committee. The entire prohibition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous liquors, except in caſes of real neceſſity, is a ſtriking feature in thoſe excellent rules; in ſhort, they have eſtabliſhed a ſyſtematical police.—They puniſh ſlight offences by withholding the proviſions for a reaſonable time, and for thoſe more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they expel the offender. All intercourſe with the city is cut off (except on ſpecial occaſions) which is enforced by placing ſentinels at proper diſtances around the encampment, who do not permit any perſon to paſs or repaſs, by night or day, without leave from one of the committee or ſteward.

The moſt ſcrupulous regard to juſtice is obſerved in the diſtribution of the proviſions, which are of an excellent quality, and ſerved out in abundance.—The ſtrict decorum that has been ſo eminently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the encampment, amongſt characters too, ſome of whom are no doubt very abandoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the moſt aſſiduous attention in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee as well as ſuperior addreſs.</p>
                  <p>Official accounts ſtate, that the fever has ſo far ſubſided at Boſton, as to render it perfectly ſafe for the inhabitants to return, and proſecute their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as uſual.</p>

                  <p>A letter to the Editor of the Chro. from Phila. mentions, "that in that city and New-York, 21 printers have fallen vactims to the terrible calamity which has deſolated thoſe places. To what cauſe to attribute this uncommon mortality, puzzles many—but in my opinion," adds our correſpondent, "it has ariſen from ſo large a number deeming it their duty to be found at their poſts: while moſt other profeſſions fled. I know nothing peculiarly attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of diſeaſe in the materials uſed in printing-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—but as nothing but flight can ſave, if it appears at another ſeaſon, I ſhall conſider it a bounden duty to avoid it."</p>

                  <p>About 50 perſons from different parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, attended the Friends yearly meeting on the 22nd of September, of theſe, 17 were ſoon after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with fever, the majority within five days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leaving the city, where ſome of them had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained only one and others two nights; and of the 17 attacked with fever, 12 died. Among thoſe that died was Warner Mifflin, an influential and much lamented member of that ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Warner Mifflin was not taken ill till the 16th day after he left the city.—Joſeph Turner, from the head of Cheſter, who had been in the city only four hours, died ſoon after his return home.</p>

                  <p>If I am not unaccountably deceived, the preſent prevailing fever, in many reſpects, bears a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the ſmall-pox. They are both more malignant in ſome conſtitutions than others; they are both leſs fatal to children and the generality of women than to men. They are both more fatal to men addicted to intemperate and voluptuous living; the groſs and the corpulent, than to temperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who are engaged in active occupations.</p>
                  <p>Hence like ſmall pox, the preparation requiſite to render the diſeaſe mild and ſafe, muſt vary with the temperament and conſtitution of each individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
                  <p>Where the inflammatory diatheſis predominates, which is commonly the caſe in children from two to twelve years of age, and to young perſons accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to activity in the open air, mercury is not a proper preparative; but in all caſes where the want of vigour is manifeſt, and a diſpoſition to diſeaſes of debility, or the nervous type, are evident, mercury, and in ſuch manner as not to evacuate much, in all probability muſt be among the firſt preparatives to be found in the Materia Medica. In the cure, I am certain it can only be employed with ſafety and with efficacy, in caſes where the inflammatory diatheſis, is not conſiderable; or in caſes of nervous and ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tendency,</p>
                  <p>The incautious and too copious employment of mercury has in ſeveral inſtances been followed by the moſt deplorable effects. In ſome caſes it has occaſioned not only the loſs of teeth, but of part of the jaw bone. In ſome, a rigid contraction of the lower jaw—a gangrene of, and conſequent loſs
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033589_0122_0FF79377D42AE720"/>
of part of one of the cheeks—the tonſils and palate—loſs of ſpeech, &amp;c. The ſphacelus and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent eroſions in ſome caſes have been followed by profuſe diſcharges of blood, which have put a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy period to the patient's life. Theſe facts are mentioned to put leſs experienced phyſicians upon their guard, and to prevent them from acting like the Hungarian phyſicians, mentioned by Kramer and Lind, who, becauſe they had ſeen beneficial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from mercury in ſyphilitic ulcers, could not be perſuaded that it would not have a ſimilar affect in caſes of ſcurvy, but gave it to 400 patients and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to a man.</p>

            <p>HAVING in the preceding Memoirs, noted the riſe, progreſs, and fatal effects of the fever, lately prevalent in this city, and other parts of this country, (the contagious nature of which is acknowledged by all, excepting a few perſons that are diſtinguiſhed for nothing but the ſingularity of their opinions, and a pertinacious adherence to a tenet, which both by the illuſtrations of reaſoning and the common ſenſe of their fellow citizens, has been declared abſurd and utenable.) I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſtate ſuch evidence as has come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reſpecting the origin of the diſeaſe, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which is of the higheſt importance to the future intereſt and proſperity of this country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to Philadelphia in particular.</p>
            <p>Certain circumſtances having given riſe to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that the contagion which gave origin to the diſeaſe was imported in the ſhip Deborah, which arrived at Philadelphia, from Jeremie, and anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near Race ſtreet wharf, on the 18th of July.

            <p>It appears from facts collected by Dr. Daniel De Beneville, and communicated in writing to Dr. Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts, that the firſt perſon that had the yellow fever in Kenſington, (to which place the Deborah had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for the purpoſe of undergoing repairs on the 28th. of July), was a lad of the name of Joſeph Streeton, that had been on board of her while ſhe lay in the city—This lad was taken ſick on the 29th, of July and died the 3d of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>James Porter, apprentice to Joſeph Grice, ſhip carpenter, next door to Streeton's, was taken with the fever on the 1ſt. of Auguſt, and died on the twelfth.</p>
            <p>James Aſhmore, an apprentice to Wm. Yard, ſhip carpenter, who had worked on board the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, while ſhe lay in the city was attacked with the fever, on the 2d. of Auguſt, and died on the fifteenth.</p>
            <p>James Kerr, George Adams, and one Simons, all apprentices to Wm. Yard, worked on board the Deborah, and were all taken ſick a few days after James Aſhmore, and all recovered.</p>
            <p>Two labouring men, who worked on board the Deborah, were taken ſick on the 3d. of Auguſt, one died, the other recovered. Samuel Baker, Dr. De Beneville, his wife and houſe keeper, who reſided near the wharf where the Deborah lay, were all attacked with the fever, in the courſe of a week after her arrival at Kenſington; and before the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Auguſt the whole neighbourhood was infected.</p>

That the Deborah was an infected veſſel, appears evident, from the teſtimony of her mate, Mr. John Lewis, the carpenter that was with her, during the whole voyage, the cook, ſeveral ſeamen, and a paſſenger of the name of Dickiſon—all of whom agree, that ſhe loſt ſeven perſons with a fever, on her paſſage from Jeremie, to Philadelphia, and five of her crew, while in the port of Jeremie.—Mr. Lewis the mate of the Deborah, informed me in preſence of two witneſſes that the Deborah had been employed as a tranſport for the Britiſh troops at St. Domingo, for ſome time previous to her taking in her cargo, at Jeremie.</p>
            <p>Dr. Wiſtar, was informed by the cooper; of the deaths on board, and the carpenter, John Bodin's depoſition was taken by the mayor of Burlington.</p>
            <p>Captain Yard, himſelf ſometime after his arrival in Philadelphia, in converſation with a gentleman whoſe teſtimony may be relied on, acknowledged that while the Deborah lay at Jeremie, a very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſe was prevalent there, which the natives called the Malad, de Siam, of which the captain, and the chief part of the crew of an Engliſh ſhip from Liverpool, died, and the reſt were ſo terrified that they deſerted the ſhip.</p>
            <p>When the Deborah arrived at the Health-Office near the fort, with about an hundred perſons on board including paſſengers,—two of the ſeamen who appeared to be in a convaleſcent ſtate, were taken to the Marine Hoſpital, and a black woman.</p>

The ſize and martial appearance of the Deborah, (for ſhe carried ſeveral guns) led a number of young men and boys to viſit her; among, others, was a lad of the name of James Wright, and a young man belonging to Mr. Clemens. The former lived in Water above Cheſnut ſtreet, the latter in Third near Walnut ſtreet, one of theſe was attacked the 30th, the other the 31ſt of July. The latter died on the 6th day from the attack, the former recovered.</p>
            <p>As the diſeaſe appeared about this time in different parts of the city, which had been uncommonly healthy all the preceding ſeaſon, it is probable that others ſuffered from the like inconſiderate curioſity.</p>
            <p>From theſe as from a focus, it gradually diverged over the whole city.</p>
            <p>A Brig from Jamaica, with Coffee, ſome of which was damaged, arrived at Mr. Roſs's wharf, in the neighbourhood where the diſeaſe made its firſt and moſt formidable aſſault, on the 29th of July, but as the diſeaſe had made ſome progreſs before that date, there can be no room for ſuſpecting that to have given origin to it. Beſides there are no facts in proof of a fever of a contagious kind ever having been produced either by damaged vegetables or by the exhalations from bilge water, as I have ſufficiently ſhewn in my Obſervations on the Cauſe and Cure of Bilious Fevers, publiſhed laſt year.</p>
            <p>But that the contagion which gives riſe to ſuch a fever as the one under conſideration, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in an active ſtate, in the clothing of theſe that have been ſick or that have died of it, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks if excluded from freſh air, is well known to thoſe converſant with medical hiſtory.</p>
            <p>We are informed in the laſt edition of the works
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033589_0135_0FF79396E207AF68"/>
of the late learned Dr. Mead, that a ſack of infected cotton imported into Bermudas in the year 1695. gave origin to a fever ſo malignant, that the living ſcarcely ſufficed to bury the dead. It is alſo record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the impriſoned ſeeds of a peſtilential fever, which depopulated Marſeilles in the year 1720, made their eſcape from a ſailor's bundle, lately arrived from the Levant.</p>
            <p>The importation of the contagion which gave riſe to the plague in London in the year 1665, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt depopulated that city in the courſe of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumnal months, is a fact too notorious to expatiate upon. A ſimilar fever, which deſtroyed 80,000 of the inhabitants of Moſcow and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent villages in 1771, was introduced by Turkiſh priſoners, as appears from the account of Mertins, one of the phyſicians appointed by the empreſs to attend the infected. This fever, like the one with which we have been viſited, yielded to the power of froſt. We have the authority of the experienced Lind, that the yellow fever was introduced into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in the year 1741 by a trunk of infected cloathing received from Barbadoes; and of Dr. Lining, that every time it had appeared in Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it had been traced to ſome perſon or veſſel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently arrived from the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>The yellow fever which prevailed in New-Haven in the year 1794, was traced to imported contagion, as appears from the ſtatement of Dr. Monſon, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Webſter's collection of papers on bilious fevers. For more examples of the ſame kind, I refer to a book which I publiſhed laſt year, entitled, "Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the Cauſes and Cure of Bilious Fevers."</p>
            <p>The introduction of the diſeaſe into Cheſter, Marcus-Hook and Wilmington, ſoon after its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in Philadelphia, are additional proofs in ſupport of the opinion that the late fever was derived from imported contagion.</p>

A lad belonging to John Wood, a potter, who had ſlept two nights on board a ſhallop employed in trading to Philadelphia a ſhort time before he was taken ill, was the firſt that died of the yellow fever in Cheſter, and he died on the 31ſt day of July.—Another lad that had ſlept on board the ſame ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop with Mr. Wood's lad, was taken ill the ſame day but recovered in the courſe of a week. The one that died had the black vomit, and his corpſe became very yellow.</p>
            <p>Seven days after the deceaſe of the firſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lad, his mother and brother were both attacked with fever, and the brother was buried 11 days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>William Siddons, jun. who had ſet up with the firſt mentioned lads during their illneſs, was taken with the fever on the firſt of Auguſt, and died the 8th. Charles Warrick, who had alſo viſited them, was attacked with fever the 4th of Auguſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 9th. Abby Engle, who lived next door to Siddons, died the 16th of Auguſt. Jeſſe Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at whoſe houſe Abby Engle died, was attacked a few days after her deceaſe, on board his ſhallop at the Fort, and died on the 28th of Auguſt. After the firſt of September, the diſeaſe ſpread into every part of that village, which contained but about 50 families, and before it ceaſed, deſtroyed 50 perſons, ſeveral of whom were of the firſt note in the place; though it was gradually deſerted by all, excepting ſix or ſeven families. Of all that were ſick at Cheſter, there were not more than five or ſix that recovered.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe appears to have been introduced into Marcus-Hook by infected perſons from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The firſt death was on the 10th of Auguſt.—From the liſt kept by R.

                  <head>Extract of a Letter from Dr. Sayres, dated Marcus Hook, November, 24, 1798.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt caſe of yellow fever, that came under my notice in Marcus Hook, was on Auguſt 2d. 1798. This was a ſhallop man, who came from Philadelphia, four days previous to the attack of the Fever—he died, the 6th. day of the diſeaſe, with the higheſt ſymptoms of putreſcency. The next five caſes of diſeaſe, were perſons, who were but a few days from Philadelphia, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from two to eight days. The diſeaſe, appeared to increaſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in this place, and in Cheſter, by the 20th. of Auguſt; The ſymptoms on the firſt attack, were more ſtrongly marked—and the proportionate number of deaths, were much increaſed by the firſt of September. The number of caſes which came under my notice from the ſecond day of Auguſt, until the 26th. of October, was eighty two—Fifty-ſeven of theſe, died.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of thoſe, who were lately from Philadelphia, died between the ſecond and the ſixth day after their attack. The inhabitants of this place and Cheſter, who had the diſeaſe, and had not been in Philadelphia, recovered in greater proportion.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe appeared, in a number of caſes, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently communicated by contagion—in ſome caſes from the ſick—and ſeveral caſes from the bed linen, &amp;c.—Though in a conſiderable number of caſes, which ſpeedily terminated fatally, I was not able to trace the ſmalleſt veſtige of contagion, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly applied, or received.</p>
                  <p>Free and copious bleeding was made uſe of in the firſt ſtage with evident advantage in moſt caſes. We bled in very few inſtances, with ſucceſs, after forty eight hours from the attack of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="unknown:033589_0138_0FF77DF1F149EF68"/>
The greateſt number of ſucceſsful caſes, were, where free bleeding was inſtantly uſed, before the fever had continued many hours; and immediately followed by a free uſe of calomel, &amp;c. ſo as to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate very freely and copiouſly upon the alimentary canal, and free ſweating afterwards. In general, our caſes terminated unfortunately, except we found ſalutary ſymptoms appear in ſixty hours from the attack.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters were uſed freely, after ſymptoms of high debility took place—and in ſome caſes with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt advantage. In no inſtance that I ſaw, was bleeding ſucceſsful, after two days and an half—but when uſed in a few of ſuch caſes, it appeared evidently to ſink the patient and to haſten his death.</p>
                  <p>We uſed bark, wine, and a number of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtimulants, on the firſt appearance of debility taking place; but with little ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Finding the common round, of medicine, prove ſo ineffectual in the advanced ſtage of the diſeaſe, I determined to uſe a different mode of treatment—in three caſes of adults, two of which had the black vomiting on them, and the third, was in a gore of putrid blood from the mouth and noſe. I forbid medicine, and directed very cold water and brandy mixed ſtrong, to be given freely as poſſible:—It had the happy effect of checking the puking in the two caſes, when the ſtomach had rejected every kind of mild drink, &amp;c. and by continuing that practice, almoſt ſo as to produce high intoxication, for two or three days, thoſe two caſes, were recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt from a ſtate of death. The third caſe, was much benefited apparently for three days—but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a high putreſcent ſtate when I went firſt to ſee him, and having loſt a very conſiderable quantity of blood from the mouth, noſe, &amp;c. his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="138" facs="unknown:033589_0139_0FF793A0BA3BD258"/>
There was a number of ſeamen died here, with the diſeaſe, though from no ſingle veſſel, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ganges) more than two or three.</p>
                  <p>"We were ſeldom able to produce ptyaliſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſeaſe terminated fatally. In every caſe where mercury affected the ſalivary glands at an early period of the diſeaſe, the patient recovered—and I obſerved that immediately after the ſpitting took place, every favourable ſymptom of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health began to appear."</p>

                  <p>THE firſt caſe of yellow fever which happened in Wilmington, this ſeaſon, was in the perſon of one of the inhabitants of the borough, who caught it in Philadelphia about the 1ſt of Auguſt, ſickened on the road home, and died ſoon after. The contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not communicated from this caſe. The Philadelphians flocked in upon us immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. I viſited a young man from Philadelphia, in the fever, on the 10th of the ſame month. This man was among the firſt, if not the very firſt, that was ſent to our newly inſtituted Hoſpital. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver became epidemic between the 15th and 20th.—It commenced with perſons immediately from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, as well inhabitants of the borough, as of the city. Shallop-men and others, who paſſed from one place to the other, by water, were the firſt victims. From theſe it extended rapidly to the inhabitants of fixed reſidence. A ſhip manned chiefly by French royaliſts, that entered our port after the ſickneſs had
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033589_0140_0FF793A252185EB8"/>
commenced, was alſo ſuſpected of contributing to the evil; but of this I have no evidence. From all the information that came to my knowledge, every phyſician of this place, and all others of correct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation agree, that the diſeaſe was imported to us from Philadelphia, by infected goods and furniture, as well as infected perſons. We ſuppoſe the diſeaſe to be propagated by contagion, from infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, cloathing, veſſels, houſes, &amp;c. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, however, that ſtronger exhalations ariſe from perſons affected by this fever, than in other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diſeaſes; and we have reaſon to believe that many were affected by the contagion, at a diſtance from the ſick reaching quite acroſs our ſtreets. No inſtance of thoſe who ſled to the country communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to others, has come to my knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vicinity of Wilmington. It is ſaid that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſort have happened at Marcus-Hook and other places; but for theſe I cannot vouch.</p>

            <p>"One half of all the ſick that were ſent to the tents died." This Dr. Monro aſcribes to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute interdection of the uſe of mercury there. In his own-practice, no perſon died after ſalivation came on, nor did he know of an inſtance, under the care of any other phyſician in that place.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was not conſtantly the caſe in Philadelphia.</note> "The diſeaſe was ſenſibly checked ſoon after the cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which occurred the latter end of September; revived with the returning warm weather, but was entirely extinguiſhed by the 3rd of November."</p>
            <p>It is now known that a lad of the name of Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, was attacked with the yellow fever the 26th of July, on board the ſchooner John, from Boſton, which lay at Roſs and Simpſon's wharf, a little way below Walnut-ſtreet. Mr. Lloyd and his clerk had been on board of her a few days before their attack; and a woman and two of the hands died (according to the report of the maſter to Dr. Dorſey) on her outward paſſage.</p>
            <p>An unanſwerable argument that the fever did not originate from domeſtic cauſes, is afforded by the exemption of Baltimore, Georgetown, Alexandria, Norfolk, Wilmington, (N. C.) Charleſton, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe this year prevailed, and was attended with a degree of mortality unexampled in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (conſidering the comparative ſmallneſs of the number that remained within the ſphere of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion)
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033589_0142_0FF793A69F9363A8"/>
in all the commercial towns north of Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore; whereas all the commercial towns south of Baltimore have eſcaped, Peterſburg excepted, and the diſeaſe was introduced into Peterſburg by the ſhip Neſtor from Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible to believe, that the late fever, (which is conſidered by the advocates for its domeſtic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to be only a higher grade of the common bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever which appears in low marſhy countries every ſummer and autumn) could originate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come epidemic on the high, dry and ſandy banks of Kenſington? in the paved, clean and open ſtreets of Philadelphia, where every wind that blows has a free courſe? on the high and gravelly hills of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington? on the elevated ſhores of York, waſhed on either ſide by Ocean's briny waves? and not make its appearance on the flats of Baltimore, or the putrid fens of Charleſton and Savannah, where bile flows in inceſſant ſtreams; and where the debilitated inhabitants faint under the inſufferable blaze of a vertical ſun?</p>
            <p>If the united opinion of a number of men of the firſt abilities and moſt extenſive profeſſional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be of authority on the preſent intereſting queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of the College of Phyſicians, preſented laſt year to the Legiſlature, ought to be admitted: the ſubſtance of which follows. The College is in poſſeſſion of ſtill ſtronger facts and documents in ſupport of their opinion this year.</p>
            <p>"The College is of opinion, that the yellow fever is derived from imported contagion. For this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they aſſign the following among other reaſons: "The diſeaſe in queſtion is eſſentially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate from domeſtic cauſes. It alſo differs eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from them in the circumſtance of being conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; a bilious fever originating from domeſtic

cauſes having never been to our knowledge contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this climate."</p>
            <p>And that the yellow fever, which has committed ſuch deplorable ravages in different commercial ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe ſtates, ſince the year 1793, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the exhalations of putrid vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which occaſion intermitting, remitting, or bilious fevers, but was of peſtilential origin, is fully eſtabliſhed by the facts publiſhed in the year 1795, by Dr. Chiſholm, ſurgeon-general to the Ordinance in the Weſt-India Iſlands, to which valuable publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the reader is referred.</p>

PRESUMING that the public mind will no longer be held in ſuſpenſe reſpecting the origin of the fatal malady by which the fair proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, of this, and other commercial cities, in this country, have been repeatedly blaſted; I truſt the legiſlature, the enlightened guardians of the public welfare, will proceed, without delay, to eſtabliſh more effectual rules, than thoſe, at preſent exiſting, to prevent the future return of the awful calamity.</p>
            <p>Supineneſs or an ill judged parſimony on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intereſting occaſion, would force commerce to deſert our coaſts, and involve the inhabitants of our cities, in abſolute ruin, which would ſoon be followed by that of agriculture, for the exiſtence of the one, is neceſſary to that of the other.</p>
            <p>It has lately been propoſed by a reſpectable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the inhabitants of this city, to petition either for an intire interdiction of the Weſt India trade, during the ſummer, and autumnal months, or, (if that ſhould be thought too great a ſacrifice), for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch quarantine rules, as ſhall effectually preclude the introduction of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>To effect this deſirable purpoſe, I beg leave to recommend the rules publiſhed in the Gazette of the United States, of the 21ſt of September, ſigned, <hi>Mentor;</hi> and to prevent it from ſpreading when introduced, I believe the rules with the ſame ſignature publiſhed in the Gaz. of the U. S. of Septr. 25th or 26th, if ſtrictly complied with, will
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033589_0145_0FF793AE1DAD9478"/>
always be found effectual. Similar rules were put in practice with the moſt happy effects, the preſent year, not only in the Pennſylvania Hoſpital, by Mr. Samuel Coats, who reſided there, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the fever, and in the Alms-Houſe, by Mr. Cummins, and Dr. James, where the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners and orphans were numerous, but in the priſon for convicts, under the direction of the American Howard, who took his reſidence in that dreary and dangerous abode, about the 20th. of September, at which time the diſeaſe had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable havoc among thoſe wretched votaries of rapine and diſorder.</p>
            <p>The number of male convicts confined in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at that time was about 140; The females were leſs numerous.</p>
            <p>The vagrants and untried criminals had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>The males and females were confined in ſeparate, and diſtant wings of the priſon.</p>
            <p>Eighteen of the male criminls, on account of their late inſurrection, were confined in dungeons; the remainder occupied different apartments on the ſame floor.</p>
            <p>Several of the men were ill of the fever at that time. The women were all in health, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that condition during the whole time that the diſeaſe prevailed in the city.</p>
            <p>A ward in the Eaſt wing was immediately appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for the reception of the ſick, who were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the ſound, and every neceſſary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation provided for them. Theſe were attended by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. A ſeparate apartment was provided for the convaleſcents. More nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aliment than they had been accuſtomed to, (for they had been allowed for many days only ſufficient food to prevent them from famiſhing) with a
