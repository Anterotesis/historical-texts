            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE winter, preceding the Å¿pring of 1798, was more Å¿everely cold, and the cold continued longer than uÅ¿ual in this winter.</p>
               <p>The greateÅ¿t part of March and April was wet and cold.</p>
               <p>From the 4th of May to the 23d, there was no rain, though the wind was generally N. and N. E. and Å¿ome days diÅ¿agreeably cold.</p>
               <p>24th May, began to rain, and continued wet and cold to the 31Å¿t. The wind then changed to S. W. and the weather became warm and fair.</p>
               <p>From the 5th to the 14th of June there were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿howers, Å¿ome days heavy, and one day loud thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The ponds became full of waterâthe roads deep with mud. From the 16th to the 19th, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿antly cold. From the 19th to the 26th, Å¿ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with frequent Å¿howers. 27th, cool, Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter only 76 at two P. M. Mark Miller died to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, under the care of doctors WiÅ¿ter and Hodge, with Å¿ymptoms of the Yellow Fever at Mrs. Reeves's in Gallowhill-Å¿treet. He had been much fatigued and debilitated from loading a veÅ¿Å¿el at Almond-Å¿treet wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for Å¿ome time. He had, alÅ¿o, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, Å¿lept on the bed in which her Å¿on had died of the Fever the preceding Autumn. Dr. Hodge was at this time indiÅ¿poÅ¿ed with jaundice from a diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed liver.</p>
               <p>24th and 30th, fair and pleaÅ¿ant, wind S. E.</p>
               <p>The laÅ¿t week of June was remarkably healthy.</p>

               <p>MoÅ¿es Cox at corner of 2d and Spruce, died on the 6th.</p>
               <p>John Saunders occupied in the Å¿tore of Lloyd and Sparks on the wharf a Å¿hort diÅ¿tance below Walnut St. attacked on the 3d.</p>
               <p>Mr. Samuel RuÅ¿Å¿el clerk to Mr. H. HenderÅ¿on. Mr. John Lawrence. Mr. Morgan's Å¿on. Stephen Davis, who lodged next door to Philips's. Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph. A TobacconiÅ¿t's boy. Mr. IÅ¿aac Lloyd, all in the Å¿ame neighbourhood, with Å¿everal others whoÅ¿e names I do not recollect, were all taken ill with a fever of a malignant kind within two or three days of each other.</p>
               <p>The unuÅ¿ual number of deaths that occurred in the firÅ¿t week of AuguÅ¿t, alarmed the Citizens and became a topic of general converÅ¿ation.</p>
               <p>The caÅ¿e of a man who had worked on board the Ship Deborah, who died of a fever highly malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the latter end of July, had been reported by Dr. Proudfit, but being a Å¿olitary caÅ¿e had excited but little apprehenÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p>On the 5th, AchiÅ¿on ThompÅ¿on's child was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with the fever.</p>
               <p>The College of PhyÅ¿icians met on the 6th at which time about 26 caÅ¿es of the fever were all that were known to exiÅ¿t in the city, and after conferring together they unanimouÅ¿ly agreed to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutions,

                           <p>"THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE of Philadelphia, having taken into conÅ¿ideration the exiÅ¿tence of a Malignant Bilious Fever in the city, have conceived
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033589_0013_0FF7926C774D0B20"/>
it to be their duty to lay before the Managers of the Marine and City HoÅ¿pitals, the following facts reÅ¿pecting its origin, and the means of checking its progreÅ¿s.</p>
                           <p>We have upon inquiry diÅ¿covered that a caÅ¿e of this fever exiÅ¿ted in the city on the 6th of June, and that Å¿everal caÅ¿es of it exiÅ¿ted in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with each other. They appeared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the Å¿tagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increaÅ¿e of the fever from the foul air of Å¿everal Å¿hips lately arrived in the port, and from Å¿ome damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29 July. In the courÅ¿e of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a Å¿ingle fact that could Å¿upport the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of contagion being imported in the bodies or cloaths of Å¿ick people in the Å¿hips or veÅ¿Å¿els which lie between Walnut and Spruce Å¿treets, where the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e has prevailed moÅ¿t. Many reÅ¿pectable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern authorities aÅ¿Å¿ert that the yellow fever is <hi>not contagious</hi> in the WeÅ¿t-Indies, and repeated obÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Å¿atisfy us that it is rarely Å¿o, during the <hi>warm weather</hi> in the United States. None of the caÅ¿es we have as yet Å¿een have propagated it, and we conceive it to be an error as abÅ¿urd in its nature as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿hould adhere to the timber of a Å¿hip after a Å¿ea voyage, and Å¿hould Å¿pread from the timber of the Å¿hip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contact through an extenÅ¿ive neighbourhood, and ceaÅ¿e to communicate itÅ¿elf afterwards by long and cloÅ¿e connection of the Å¿ick with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and attendants. We lament that this fact, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many others, upon the nature and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

of the yellow fever, which were Å¿tated in our letter to the Governor on the 1Å¿t of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legiÅ¿lature of the Å¿tate, have been treated with total neglect in the preÅ¿ent health law: the diÅ¿treÅ¿s we felt upon Å¿eeing that law is, however, much alleviated by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that we have not contributed, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by Å¿upporting an erroneous opinion, to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the preÅ¿ent alarming calamity of our city.</p>
                           <p>We beg leave to recommend for the purpoÅ¿e of checking the progreÅ¿s of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</p>
                           <p>1Å¿t. The removal of all the families from thoÅ¿e parts of the city where the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamination of the atmoÅ¿phere, appears chiefly to exiÅ¿t, and the preventing thoÅ¿e parts being viÅ¿ited by the citizens.</p>
                           <p>2dly. The removal of all Å¿hips and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and Å¿tores of the city.</p>
                           <p>3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; alÅ¿o the waÅ¿hing of the gutters every day, and of the Å¿treets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</p>
                           <p>4thly. The appointment of a Å¿ufficient number of phyÅ¿icians to take care of Å¿uch of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</p>
                           <p>5thly. Publicly to adviÅ¿e the citizens to avoid all the uÅ¿ual exciting cauÅ¿es of fever, Å¿uch as intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, fatigue, exceÅ¿Å¿ive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating paÅ¿Å¿ions of the mind.</p>
                           <p>6thly. To adviÅ¿e them, in every caÅ¿e of indiÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition, however Å¿light in appearance, to apply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for medical aid.</p>

ONE of the Fellows of the College of PhyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of Philadelphia, aÅ¿Å¿erts, that the College is in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of unequivocal evidence, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever, (which is eÅ¿Å¿entially the Å¿ame as the Yellow Fever of the WeÅ¿t Indies) now exiÅ¿ting in this city, was brought into it by an infected veÅ¿Å¿el, lately arrived from the WeÅ¿t Indies. The writer of this note has already Å¿een it, in more than one inÅ¿tance, communicated by contagion, at a conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diÅ¿tance from that part of the city where it firÅ¿t made its appearance. The evidence on which this information is founded will be detailed as Å¿oon as health and Å¿afety Å¿hall be reÅ¿tored to the city. In the mean time the writer thought it would be an act of treachery to withhold the above information at a time when attempts are again making to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and miÅ¿lead the public mind.</p>

You Å¿eldom Å¿ee the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in its firÅ¿t Å¿tage, and when you do, you meet it in an aggravated Å¿tate by the motion your patients undergo in being conveyed to the HoÅ¿pital.</p>
                        <p>In anÅ¿wer to your requeÅ¿t, I have Å¿at down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of the practice which I have adopted in our preÅ¿ent epidemic. In the treatment of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever of laÅ¿t year, I have occaÅ¿ionally lamented the loÅ¿s of patients after reducing the pulÅ¿e by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the liberal uÅ¿e of purging medicines. I have Å¿uÅ¿pected that death occurred in thoÅ¿e caÅ¿es, from the Å¿tagnation of acrid bile in the gall bladder, or its cloÅ¿e adherence to the upper bowels in the manner deÅ¿cribed by Doctor Mitchell in his account of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741. The Å¿low pulÅ¿e which occurs about the 4th day, I Å¿uÅ¿pect further to be the effect of this bile. Its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in a much more morbid Å¿tate in the Jaundice,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033589_0022_0FF792826BBCF9C8"/>
in reducing the pulÅ¿e, is well known. Mr. John Hunter Å¿ays he once met with an inÅ¿tance in which it fell to 32 Å¿trokes in a minute in that diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving theÅ¿e facts in my mind, I reÅ¿olved to try to remove this bile by exciting an artificial cholera morbus, about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for Å¿everal years, that a cholera morbus is nothing but the firÅ¿t grade of bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever thrown in upon the bowels, juÅ¿t as the DyÅ¿entery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common bilious or intermitting fever.</p>
                        <p>I began this mode of treating the fever eight days ago. My Å¿olicitude for the iÅ¿Å¿ue of it was very great. Thank God it has Å¿ucceeded to my wiÅ¿hes, and thereby leÅ¿Å¿ened in a great degree, the anxiety and diÅ¿treÅ¿s which accompany our attendance upon this ferocious diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. The medicines I uÅ¿e for <hi>Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> the gall-bladder and bowels and <hi>diÅ¿charging</hi> the contents are, tartar emetic, gamboge, jalap and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel, combined, or given Å¿eparately, and in Å¿mall or large doÅ¿es, according to circumÅ¿tances. Perhaps Turpeth Mineral might be added to this liÅ¿t of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and purging medicines with advantage. In one caÅ¿e I gave four grains of tartar emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and downwards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the leaÅ¿t cramp or pain in the Å¿tomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon my patient. The next day he was out of danger. The perÅ¿on thus reÅ¿cued from the grave, was a Å¿on of Mr. Richard RenÅ¿haw. Indeed I have not, as yet, loÅ¿t a Å¿ingle patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one inÅ¿tance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of 16 years of age, to whom I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven near thirty grains of tartar emetic in the courÅ¿e
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033589_0023_0FF792840E1963E8"/>
of a few hours without producing the leaÅ¿t evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Å¿tomach or bowels. I have obÅ¿erved the Å¿ame encreaÅ¿e of Å¿trength after its operation, that we obÅ¿erve after bleeding and purging in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever.</p>
                        <p>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the WeÅ¿t-Indies. I gave them on the firÅ¿t day of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in the year 1793, and always without Å¿ucceÅ¿s. They uniformly did harm when given in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever in its worÅ¿t grade, in 1797. The reaÅ¿on of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was becauÅ¿e they were given <hi>before</hi> the violent mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid action in the Å¿yÅ¿tem, was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, they are perfectly Å¿afe. The time for exhibiting them Å¿hould be regulated by the pulÅ¿e, and other Å¿ymptoms. In moderate caÅ¿es of the fever, they are as proper in its firÅ¿t Å¿tage, as on the 4th day. As there is a bliÅ¿tering point in all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Å¿o there appears to be an <hi>emetic point</hi> in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever It may occur on the Å¿econd, and it may be protracted to the Å¿ixth or Å¿eventh day of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. I have not given the medicines I have mentioned in any caÅ¿e where the patient complained of pain or burning in the Å¿tomach, but I have conÅ¿idered a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ea, and a moderate degree of puking as no obÅ¿tacle to it's uÅ¿e, for Dr. PhyÅ¿ick has taught me by his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ections, that theÅ¿e Å¿ymptoms may exiÅ¿t without the leaÅ¿t inflammation in the Å¿tomach, and that they have been abÅ¿ent where the Å¿tomach has appeared after death to have been highly inflamed.</p>
                        <p>The cure of the fever Å¿hould not reÅ¿t upon a Å¿ingle doÅ¿e of the medicine. I have given two doÅ¿es of it in a day in Å¿everal caÅ¿es, and have given it in one caÅ¿e every day for three Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive days.</p>
                        <p>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are exactly alike. They vary not only in different
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033589_0024_0FF7928979188808"/>
climates, but in the Å¿ame climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the Å¿ame Å¿eaÅ¿on. The fever of 1797 differed in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars from the fever of 1793, and the preÅ¿ent epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the caÅ¿es I have Å¿een, it exceeds the fever of laÅ¿t year in its malignity. TheÅ¿e variations in diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿es call for correÅ¿ponding changes in our practice.</p>
                        <p>I have communicated an account of the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of diÅ¿charging the contents of the gall-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and bowels to Å¿everal of our brethren. I ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope it may be univerÅ¿ally Å¿ucceÅ¿sful in their hands.</p>
                        <p>If any thing new occurs in your practice in the HoÅ¿pital, do me the favor of informing me of it.</p>

                        <p>SINCE my laÅ¿t report, which was on the 15th inÅ¿tant, I have been engaged in attending three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, with the malignant fever, out of town, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of which they appear to have received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their leaving it. Since my return to town, I find the woman who nurÅ¿ed Mr. DouglaÅ¿s's Å¿on has been affected with the Å¿ame diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, though Å¿he was Å¿alivated from rubbing him with mercurial ointment, and muÅ¿t have received it from him by contagion,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033589_0028_0FF7929250E89918"/>
as Å¿he had never been out of the houÅ¿e for Å¿ix days previous to the attack.</p>
                        <p>I alÅ¿o know two perÅ¿ons that have taken the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e this year who had it laÅ¿t year. A young man at the corner of Second and Lombard Å¿treets, who lived in the family of Mr. Cockburn, at the corner of Spruce and Front Å¿treets, (who with his wife and a boy lately died in the Å¿ame houÅ¿e of the exiÅ¿ting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) and his brother is now in the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. There are at this time 10 or 12 perÅ¿ons with it in the Alleys near Mr. Hunter's, the druggiÅ¿t, in Second-Å¿treet. Dr. PaÅ¿chalis has had five applications Å¿ince laÅ¿t even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one, a French jeweller in Second near CheÅ¿nut Å¿treet, Mr. Valence and Å¿iÅ¿ter in Spruce-Å¿treet, &amp;c. Dr. Church is attending two freÅ¿h caÅ¿es in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Mrs. Roberts, in ChriÅ¿tian-Å¿treet. You need not be reminded of the caÅ¿es in Race and Vine Å¿treets, and in KenÅ¿ington. In Å¿hort, the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e is rapidly and Å¿enÅ¿ibly Å¿preading into every part of the city, and can no longer be Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed till froÅ¿t arrives to diÅ¿arm it of its power. If this be the caÅ¿e, (and that it is, paÅ¿t events demonÅ¿trate) would it not be adviÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (I mean not to dictate but merely to enquire, from motives of pure and, in the preÅ¿ent inÅ¿tance, diÅ¿intereÅ¿ted humanity) to apprize the citizens which Å¿till remain in town, of their danger, and to furniÅ¿h them with inÅ¿tructions how to eÅ¿cape its deÅ¿tructive ravages?</p>

From an individual it would appear preÅ¿umptious or at leaÅ¿t officious, and inÅ¿tead of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the effect intended, would only Å¿erve to rouÅ¿e the demon of envy, or provoke the venom of Å¿lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                              <p>The preÅ¿ent alarming Å¿ituation of our city, is alas, truly deplorableâalmoÅ¿t in a general Å¿tate of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, to whoÅ¿e virulence, medicinal Å¿kill is lamentably compelled, to acknowledge its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority! Former experience is rendered in a great meaÅ¿ure uÅ¿eleÅ¿s by the very material difference in the nature of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿eâThe moÅ¿t copious bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the moÅ¿t violent purgatives have been found ineffectual; and the Å¿ucceÅ¿s that will attend the new Å¿yÅ¿tem of emptying the gall-bladder, is at leaÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the diÅ¿order, I have very great reaÅ¿on to doubt it. I have known, lately, Å¿everal inÅ¿tances that could not be accounted for upon any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than that of contagion. The moÅ¿t Å¿triking of the caÅ¿es I allude to, is, where Å¿everal of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the diÅ¿order from a perÅ¿on in the family, whom they had for Å¿everal days cloÅ¿ely attended; without having themÅ¿elves been in any part of the city that could even have been Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be infected. I would caution my fellow-citizens not to truÅ¿t too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been Å¿o induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly propagated. A confidence in it, in caÅ¿e it Å¿hould happen to be erroneous, may prove the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction of thouÅ¿ands, while by acting under a diÅ¿be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033589_0030_0FF792968986F700"/>
of it, and uÅ¿ing every poÅ¿Å¿ible precaution, as many lives may be preÅ¿erved. It is at leaÅ¿t doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether it is or is not contagious, and there being a doubt, I think the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t courÅ¿e to be purÅ¿ued is obvious. I would adviÅ¿e my friends to avoid, as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible, expoÅ¿ing themÅ¿elves to the night air or morning fogs, nothing tending more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prediÅ¿poÅ¿e the body to infection.</p>
                              <p>Temperate living both in eating and drinking is of as much conÅ¿equence. Any thing that enriches the bloodâany thing that has the Å¿malleÅ¿t tendency to inflammation is moÅ¿t carefully to be avoided. I Å¿peak this, my fellow-citizens, with confidence. Both in '93 and '97 I knew many inÅ¿tances, where people Å¿ituated in the very bed of infection, by living with extraordinary temperance, eÅ¿caped. The idea entertained by many perÅ¿ons, that generous living, or in other words, high Å¿eaÅ¿oned food, and a glaÅ¿s of good Madeira, from the beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t effectual bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, is too prepoÅ¿terous and abÅ¿urd to merit much comment.

Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and at the Å¿ame time, nouriÅ¿hing food, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting chiefly of vegetables and ripe fruits, avoiding meats as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible, and never uÅ¿ing any but in their Å¿impleÅ¿t Å¿tate, I would Å¿trongly recommend. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciÅ¿e, by heating the blood, Å¿eldom fails to be Å¿ucceeded by a violent attack of the diÅ¿order, and is therefore to be guarded againÅ¿t.

                              <p>IT is an obÅ¿ervation founded in truth, that few if any people in the world, have gone further in works of philanthrophy than the citizens of Philadelphia. Let him who diÅ¿credits it, take an impartial Å¿urvey of the various inÅ¿titutions erected in this city, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Å¿uffering humanity, many of which are Å¿uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the voluntary contributions of benevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and his doubts Å¿hall vaniÅ¿hâYet Å¿ome further regulations appear to be indiÅ¿penÅ¿ableâthere are perÅ¿ons for whom, either the laws have made no proviÅ¿ion, or to whoÅ¿e pitiable condition the hand of mercy, under the laws, has not been extended.</p>
                              <p>It is but recently that a poor wretch was Å¿uffered to lie and periÅ¿h in one of the Å¿treets in the Northern Liberties, without the leaÅ¿t kind of aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance having been afforded him: whether the police officers are juÅ¿tly cenÅ¿urable for a neglect of duty, or otherwiÅ¿e, is not my buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to enquire; the fact is, however, certain. Had his caÅ¿e been duly attended to, this hapleÅ¿s Å¿on of miÅ¿ery might, perhaps, have been reÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from an untimely grave.</p>
                              <p>In the PennÅ¿ylvania HoÅ¿pital, a perÅ¿on cannot be admitted, but under certain qualifications; but this inÅ¿titution is liberal in its principles, and in its prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is a point of prudence, and perhaps of neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not to receive into the alms-houÅ¿e, any perÅ¿on having a contagious diÅ¿order, it is not knowingly doneâand, unleÅ¿s the object be afflicted with the prevailing malady, or Å¿uÅ¿pected to be Å¿o, he cannot procure an entrance into the City HoÅ¿pital.</p>
                              <p>A few days Å¿ince a circumÅ¿tance occurred which was truly diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ingâA German, a Å¿tranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the PennÅ¿ylvania <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap> his caÅ¿e did not come Å¿trictly within their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033589_0032_0FF7929B54EC4708"/>
cognizance, and he was refuÅ¿ed. He then Å¿olicited an entrance into the alms-houÅ¿e, but having the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entery, and not being entitled to a place of reÅ¿idence here, he was unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sful. His next application was to captain Allen, health-officer of the port, but the captain conceiving himÅ¿elf unauthorized to Å¿end him to the City HoÅ¿pital, the poor wretch was turned away without any hope of relief. What became of him I know not, but the deep diÅ¿treÅ¿s, anxiety, and deÅ¿pondency depicted in his countenance produced a correÅ¿pondent Å¿entiment of Å¿ympathy in the minds of the byÅ¿tanders, all of whom Å¿eemed to regret his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required.</p>
                              <p>Let us but recall the caÅ¿e of this unfortunate man home to our own boÅ¿omsâdiÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, friendleÅ¿s and diÅ¿conÅ¿olateâÅ¿ituate in a Å¿trange country, where he knew not the countenance of a Å¿ingle human being; incapable of providing for himÅ¿elf, and unable from illneÅ¿s to leave the city; willing to take refuge even in an infected hoÅ¿pital, and I am Å¿ure there is no man who is not abÅ¿olutely callous to the voice of miÅ¿ery, and dead to every thing which bears the Å¿tamp of humanity, who will not approve of Å¿ome plan being fallen on for the comfortable accommodation of Å¿uch of his Å¿uffering fellow-menâA plan for this laudable purpoÅ¿e is not only very feaÅ¿ible, but of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaÅ¿y practicability. I would adviÅ¿e then, that a temporary building be immediately erected near the City HoÅ¿pital, into which all diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed perÅ¿ons, willing to go, Å¿hould be freely and without ceremony ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If, on experiment, they are found to have the prevailing malady, they Å¿hould be placed in the hoÅ¿pital; if otherwiÅ¿e, they Å¿hould be provided for as circumÅ¿tances would render humane and proper. But, as a more permanent and effectual eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there Å¿hould be attached to the inÅ¿titution of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033589_0033_0FF7929F0EBAC850"/>
the alms-houÅ¿e, not directly joining it, an infirmary, into which all perÅ¿ons deÅ¿igned to be accommodated in the inÅ¿titution, Å¿hould at firÅ¿t be Å¿ent there to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo an examination of judicious phyÅ¿icians, and afterwards either to be provided for in the infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or to be otherwiÅ¿e diÅ¿poÅ¿ed of, as their Å¿everal caÅ¿es might require. Surely there can be no reaÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objection to a plan of this kindâthe expence would be trifling, compared with the magnitude of the object, and the good which might reÅ¿ult from it, would be incalculable. The man who will Å¿et about accompliÅ¿hing this object, muÅ¿t Å¿ucceedâand will doubtleÅ¿s have, not only the ineÅ¿timable enjoyment of an approving mind, but the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of many a woe-worn object of wretchedneÅ¿s.</p>
                              <p>If public inÅ¿titutions will not Å¿helter under their roofs, diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed and penny-leÅ¿s wretches, can it, or ought it to be expected, that private perÅ¿ons will? And eÅ¿pecially at a time, when the horror attached to the idea of introducing the yellow fever into their families, produces, in the minds of moÅ¿t, a Å¿pecies of morbid panic, which paralizes every Å¿entiment of hoÅ¿pitality towards Å¿uÅ¿pected individuals.</p>
                              <p>I am not Å¿o tenacious of my plan but that I will moÅ¿t cordially Å¿upport a better, if one more eligible is propoÅ¿ed by a more happy genius: but this is no time for temporiÅ¿ing, or halting between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Å¿omething muÅ¿t be promptly done; and I now call on my fellow-citizens, in the name of every thing dear to humanity, not to heÅ¿itate, or trifle on the occaÅ¿ion. To the guardians of the poor, and the managers of the marine and city hoÅ¿pitals, I make the appeal, and truÅ¿t it will not be in vainâThey have the power and the means of accompliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the object; they are men; they muÅ¿t be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed of a fellow-feeling for the unfortunate, and muÅ¿t be convinced of the urgency of the occaÅ¿ion. To

provide for thoÅ¿e who cannot provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, is an indiÅ¿penÅ¿ible duty. Let us do all we can, and leave the iÅ¿Å¿ue to that all-wiÅ¿e, and all-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling Providence, who will bleÅ¿s every honeÅ¿t la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and who regards with equal care, the whole family of mankind.</p>

                        <p>IMPELLED by the awful progreÅ¿s and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trained to addreÅ¿s your feelings, as well as your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, in order to avert the fatal deÅ¿truction which, with rapid Å¿trides, is pervading our ill-fated city and Å¿uburbs.</p>
                        <p>The beÅ¿t Å¿kill of our phyÅ¿icians, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of medicine, it muÅ¿t be acknowledged, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unequal in the conteÅ¿t with this devouring poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</p>
                        <p>With the moÅ¿t affecting Å¿ympathy and anxious Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, we have to the beÅ¿t of our judgments, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to employ, as circumÅ¿tances appeared to require, the power and the means entruÅ¿ted to us, in arreÅ¿ting its progreÅ¿s, and alleviating its concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant miÅ¿eries. We Å¿hall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but we have neither the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033589_0045_0FF792C8F58059A0"/>
nor the means to accompliÅ¿h ALL THE MEASURES neceÅ¿Å¿ary to check its extenÅ¿ion, or provide for the preÅ¿Å¿ing exigencies of the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the inÅ¿titutions under our direction, are impotent indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occaÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends which alone can Å¿top its progreÅ¿s and diminiÅ¿h its horrors.</p>
                        <p>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, cauÅ¿ed tents to be erected on the eaÅ¿t bank of the Schuylkill for the accommodation of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; where near twelve hundred are already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, out of the fund appropriated for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the evils which environ thouÅ¿ands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of thoÅ¿e who are in more fortunate circumÅ¿tances.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at preÅ¿ent, in the country, is too well known; and the expenÅ¿e attending the removal of a family has diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged many from the attempt, who are in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿tances to live comfortably at home.</p>
                        <p>What remains to be done? Citizens of reÅ¿pecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and influence! come forward and form your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves into a committee for the purpoÅ¿e of erecting on the weÅ¿t bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected; let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as poÅ¿Å¿ibleâIf tents cannot be had, boards in abundance may be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the erection of Å¿heds. AdmoniÅ¿h thoÅ¿e citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens who have no place of refuge, to take Å¿helter there, particularly thoÅ¿e from the eaÅ¿t part of the city, the diÅ¿trict of Southwark, and the Northern Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiesâin Å¿hort, ALL who can leave their homes without manifeÅ¿t injury; except thoÅ¿e who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary for the protection of the city and liberties.</p>

The committee Å¿hould have the general Å¿uperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to preÅ¿erve order; contract for certain Å¿upplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the loweÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ible rates. ThoÅ¿e who are not in circumÅ¿tances to pay, muÅ¿t be Å¿upplied by the public bounty.</p>
                        <p>It is at leaÅ¿t an unequal, perhaps an unjuÅ¿t mode of raiÅ¿ing money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but if on any occaÅ¿ion it may be juÅ¿tified, the preÅ¿ent may be aÅ¿Å¿umed without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itation.</p>
                        <p>We call your attention to the actual and undiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿ed Å¿tate of our city. ConÅ¿ider the mortality and rapid increaÅ¿e of the Å¿ick at Å¿o early a period. View the liÅ¿t of your phyÅ¿icians, and <hi>mark how few are at their poÅ¿ts</hi>âand we believe you will think with us, that the preÅ¿ervation of health is only to be attained by flight.</p>
                        <p>Do not flatter yourÅ¿elves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured; we Å¿peak from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not but that the lives of hundreds, perhaps of thouÅ¿ands, may be preÅ¿erved by the adoption of theÅ¿e or Å¿imilar meaÅ¿ures.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The following directions for the prevention and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thoÅ¿e citizens of Philadelphia, who are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure the regular attendance and advice of phyÅ¿icians, by</hi> BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. September 3d, 1798.</p>
                        <p>THE Å¿eeds of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e may exiÅ¿t in the body, for a conÅ¿iderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally EXCITED by one or more of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauÅ¿es, which of courÅ¿e ought to be carefully avoided, <abbr>viz:</abbr> fatigue, a long walk, Å¿tanding in the Å¿un, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, coÅ¿tiveneÅ¿s, violent paÅ¿Å¿ions, or Å¿udden emotions of the mind, thin dreÅ¿Å¿ed, light bed cloathes, and above all, the night air.</p>
                        <p>It is of conÅ¿equence for our citizens to know that we have but one fever in our city at preÅ¿ent, and that every febrile indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition partakes of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from miÅ¿taking the firÅ¿t Å¿tage of the fever for a common cold. The miÅ¿take is a natural one, for it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for medical aid as Å¿oon as poÅ¿Å¿ible after
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033589_0049_0FF792D35BE20FC0"/>
feeling the leaÅ¿t Å¿ymptom of indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent juncture.</p>
                        <p>In the forming Å¿tate of the fever when the patient feels Å¿lightly indiÅ¿poÅ¿ed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>A purge of Å¿alts, caÅ¿tor oil, or a doÅ¿e of jalap and calomel. If theÅ¿e fail of giving relief, a gentle Å¿weat Å¿hould be excited in the uÅ¿ual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pulÅ¿e be full, or tenÅ¿e, ten or twelve ounces of blood Å¿hould be loÅ¿t, before the uÅ¿e of the Å¿weat, and either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking the purge. Entire reÅ¿t from buÅ¿ineÅ¿s and exerciÅ¿e of all kinds will be neceÅ¿Å¿ary to give effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the above remedies.</p>
                        <p>If the exiÅ¿tence of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been recommended, uÅ¿ed before the fever was completely formed, there are the Å¿trongeÅ¿t reaÅ¿ons to believe there would be much leÅ¿s mortality from it.</p>
                        <p>After the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e is formed, and appears with more or leÅ¿s of the following Å¿ymptoms, <abbr>viz.</abbr> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redneÅ¿s in the eyes, Å¿ickneÅ¿s at the Å¿tomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The loÅ¿s of ten or twelve ounces of blood two or three times a day while the pulÅ¿e continues to be FULL, or TENSE.âIf the pulÅ¿e Å¿hould be SLOWER, and APPARENTLY WEAKER than natural, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it diÅ¿covers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural fulneÅ¿s and tenÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The bowels Å¿hould be purged at the Å¿ame time with calomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or in pills.âThe operation of this purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine Å¿hould be aided, when practicable, by clyÅ¿ters compoÅ¿ed of half an ounce of glauber Å¿alts diÅ¿Å¿olved
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033589_0050_0FF792D942A85410"/>
in half a pint of warm water with Å¿weet oil, molaÅ¿Å¿es, and common Å¿alt of each a table Å¿poonful, in it.</p>
                        <p>The bowels Å¿hould be kept gently open through the whole courÅ¿e of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, by means of the above clyÅ¿ters, and any other gently purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the Å¿tomach Å¿hould be Å¿ick and oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuhana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, provided the pulÅ¿e has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compoÅ¿e the Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach if the vomit Å¿hould operate more than three or four times.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Calomel Å¿hould be given from the beginning, in doÅ¿es of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to excite a Å¿alivation. If the calomel Å¿hould purge more than two or three times a day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have Å¿een no death where this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine has produced a Å¿alivation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. After the pulÅ¿e is reduced by bleeding and purging if the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e has not yielded, a profuÅ¿e Å¿weat Å¿hould be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or Å¿ix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him at the Å¿ame time large and repeated draughts during twenty four hours of HOT camomile or Å¿age tea, HOT lemonade or weak punch, or any other HOT liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This Å¿weat Å¿hould be continued for twenty-four hours, 'till the patient is out of danger.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. BliÅ¿ters Å¿hould be applied to the wriÅ¿ts and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, in common caÅ¿es, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pulÅ¿e be reduced, or the Å¿ickneÅ¿s
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033589_0051_0FF792DBE4DEE760"/>
at Å¿tomach is troubleÅ¿ome. If the head be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, a bliÅ¿ter Å¿hould be applied to the neck or to the crown of the head, firÅ¿t cutting off the hair and Å¿having it, and if the Å¿tomach Å¿hould be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected after the third or fourth day a large bliÅ¿ter Å¿hould be applied to it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In caÅ¿e of delirium with a languid pulÅ¿e, poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of raw garlic with a little muÅ¿tard Å¿hould be applied to the feet.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. FreÅ¿h air Å¿hould be admitted into Å¿ick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when the Å¿kin is hot, and the pulÅ¿e full and tenÅ¿e. In this Å¿tate of the fever, the hands, feet and face Å¿hould be waÅ¿hed ten or twelve times a day with cold water. In a cool Å¿tate of the Å¿kin, or when the body is covered with Å¿weat, cool air and cold water are improper.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The body and bed linen of the Å¿ick Å¿hould be frequently changed, and all offenÅ¿ive matters diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from them, Å¿hould be inÅ¿tantly removed.</p>
                        <p>In caÅ¿es of great weakneÅ¿s, the patient Å¿hould not be permitted to riÅ¿e from his bed when under the operation of purging phyÅ¿ick nor upon any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The drinks of Å¿ick people in the beginning of the fever, Å¿hould be toaÅ¿t and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly diÅ¿Å¿olved in water, apple wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or barley water. In the latter Å¿tage of the fever, the drink may be porter and water, claret and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, milk and water, or comomile tea.</p>
                        <p>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever. In its Å¿econd Å¿tage the patient may eat bread and milk with roaÅ¿ted apples or Å¿oft peaches, chocolate, Å¿ago, tapioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</p>
                        <p>It will be improper to depend excluÅ¿ively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033589_0052_0FF792DD75B7BD50"/>
force of them all is barely Å¿ufficient in many caÅ¿es to overcome this formidable diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                        <p>P. S. All the above medicines with Å¿uitable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections may be had of George Hunter, No. 114, South Second-Å¿treet; John J. Malcolm, No.78, South Second-Å¿treet; and Robert Stafford, No.36, Market-Å¿treet.</p>

                              <p>A VERY conÅ¿iderable alarm having taking place among the citizens, and the moÅ¿t exaggerated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports circulated about the country, of the Å¿ickneÅ¿s with which certain parts of the city are afflicted, we have thought it a duty to make Å¿uch enquiries as might enable us to place the matter in a point of view, as near the truth as poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                              <p>About the beginning of AuguÅ¿t, in conÅ¿equence of the foul, unfiniÅ¿hed Å¿tate of Å¿everal water-lots, on the EaÅ¿t river, between Co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>â¢</desc>
                                 </gap>nties and the Old-Å¿lip, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 20 perÅ¿ons were attacked nearly about the Å¿ame time, with what appeared to be <hi>common colds,</hi> Å¿ome Å¿lightly, others more Å¿everely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighbourhood led to a belief that it aroÅ¿e from a <hi>local</hi> cauÅ¿e and threatened Å¿omething more Å¿erious. The foulneÅ¿s of the lots, and eÅ¿pecially two vacant ones, being receptacles of every kind of filth, was conÅ¿idered as <hi>that cauÅ¿e;</hi> and in purÅ¿uance of official arrangements, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately covered with wholeÅ¿ome Å¿and: The effect was, a general reÅ¿toration of the Å¿ick.</p>
                              <p>In the neighbourhood of the New-Å¿lip, where the buildings for the moÅ¿t part, are Å¿mall, and many of them inhabited by poor people, who live in a croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, and in Å¿ituations incapable of proper ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033589_0053_0FF792DF5D370CB8"/>
diÅ¿eaÅ¿es occurred about the 12thâa number of perÅ¿ons diedâbut at preÅ¿ent there appears to be no great cauÅ¿e of alarm in that quarter.</p>
                              <p>About the Å¿ame period, or a little later, two or three perÅ¿ons were Å¿eized at Bruce's wharf with Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious Å¿ymptoms, and Å¿ome deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the extremely foul condition of Bruce and MarÅ¿ton's unfilled lots, bounding on the EaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river, at the foot of Pine-Å¿treetâthe effluvia iÅ¿Å¿uing from them being highly putrid and offenÅ¿ive. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures have been taken, and are now in operation, to cover them with wholeÅ¿ome earth, by which means it is hoped the evil in that quarter, if it has ariÅ¿en from this Å¿ource, may be corrected.</p>
                              <p>About the 20th, Å¿everal perÅ¿ons were Å¿eized in Cliff-Å¿treet, nearly in the Å¿ame manner as thoÅ¿e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Coenties and the Old-Å¿lip. At firÅ¿t they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conÅ¿idered their complaints to be mere colds taken by Å¿leeping with open windows in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hot weather which then prevailedâUnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, it was a more Å¿erious caÅ¿e. The patients ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly grew worÅ¿e, and Å¿everal died as well there as in John, Gold and Rider-Å¿treets, and Eden's-Allies, all lying within the vicinity of Burling-Å¿lip Å¿ewer. TheÅ¿e complaints, on inveÅ¿tigation, were thought to proceed, in part, from the offenÅ¿ive Å¿tate of that Å¿ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which had, for Å¿ome time, become a receptacle for various Å¿pecies of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly oppoÅ¿ite John-Å¿treet, commonly called Golden-hill-Å¿treetâÅ¿o that, whenever a South or S. E. wind prevailed, it blew through the Å¿ewer, and bore a column of effluvia up John-Å¿treet, and through that into Cliff, and the adjacent Å¿treets, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the atmoÅ¿phere intollerably bad. The beÅ¿t informed phyÅ¿icians are of this opinion. The head of the Å¿ewer has Å¿ince been cloÅ¿ed by a valve-door,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033589_0054_0FF792E228581C18"/>
and a conÅ¿iderable quantity of quick lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A Å¿imilar door, with the Å¿ame intention, has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Ferry-Å¿treet Å¿ewer.</p>
                              <p>Other cauÅ¿es are alÅ¿o alledged, and with great plauÅ¿ibility, at leaÅ¿t, if not certainty.</p>
                              <p>It is well known that the ceÅ¿Å¿ation of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourÅ¿e with the French IÅ¿lands, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equence of their hoÅ¿tile violence, has greatly leÅ¿Å¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the demand for proviÅ¿ions: of courÅ¿e large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of beef remained in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-Å¿treet. Much of this, from what is now Å¿een to be an improper mode of packing, as directed by a late law, has lately become tainted, emitted a very putrid effluviumâcorrupting the air and contributing its Å¿hare as a cauÅ¿e of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e. We learn that the commiÅ¿Å¿ioners of the health-office have taken meaÅ¿ures to have it all inÅ¿pected, and the Å¿poiled removed out of town. Much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready has been Å¿ent away, and the remainder is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as faÅ¿t as poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                              <p>TheÅ¿e cauÅ¿es, with the immenÅ¿e fall of rain, and violent heats, experienced in the courÅ¿e of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿t, are Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have originated the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e which has Å¿pread Å¿uch panic as to drive many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies into the country.</p>
                              <p>On the moÅ¿t diligent enquiry however, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out, that any great Å¿ubject of alarm exiÅ¿ts, except in the neighbourhood of the New-Å¿lipâin the vicinity of Darling-Å¿lip-Å¿ewerâand at the foot of Pine-Å¿treet, at which places Å¿everal perÅ¿ons have died.</p>
                              <p>Individual caÅ¿es have alÅ¿o occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain inÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can diÅ¿cover. TheÅ¿e, it is generally thought were taken at one or the other of the places before mentioned.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="54" facs="unknown:033589_0055_0FF792E7D0E33248"/>
An opinion has been avowed by Å¿ome, that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e has been imported, or aroÅ¿e from damaged coffee, thrown out of a Å¿hip on Kelley's dock, weÅ¿t of the New-Å¿lip. This, in the preÅ¿ent inÅ¿tance, is utterly groundleÅ¿s, and can Å¿erve no purpoÅ¿e but that of deluÅ¿ion. The quantity of refuÅ¿e-coffee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to by our advocates for imported contagion did not exceed half a peck, and was the mere Å¿weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the hold.</p>
                              <p>We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a liÅ¿t of the perÅ¿ons interred in the Å¿everal burial grounds, that during the laÅ¿t week, they averaged about 12 per dayâand that previous to Sunday laÅ¿t, there was no very unuÅ¿ual mortality for the Å¿eaÅ¿on.</p>
                              <p>With reÅ¿pect to new caÅ¿es, enquiry at the beÅ¿t Å¿ources, enables us to Å¿ay they have very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined within the laÅ¿t 24 hours, and that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e yields more readily to medicine.</p>
                              <p>How far this Å¿tatement authorizes the extreme alarm which precipitates Å¿o many citizens out of town, we do not know; but it would at leaÅ¿t be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿eable that all who remove Å¿hould leave their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, cellars and yards in a cleanly conditionâthat Å¿uch as remain may not be expoÅ¿ed to the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their careleÅ¿Å¿neÅ¿s and indiÅ¿cretion.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿yÅ¿tem of cleanlineÅ¿s adopted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ioners of the health-office, we are happy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve, is purÅ¿ued with increaÅ¿ed vigour; and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable efforts are daily made by that board, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every Å¿ource of impure air in the city.</p>
                              <p>This Å¿tatement may be depended onâit is the reÅ¿ult of enquiry of the firÅ¿t authority.</p>

                              <p>AddreÅ¿Å¿ed particularly to thoÅ¿e citizens whoÅ¿e cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances will not permit them to comply with

the recommendations of the Managers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and City HoÅ¿pitals.</p>
                              <p>THE fever which at this time prevails in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate city and Å¿uburbs, is the very Å¿ame in kind as that which prevailed in '93 and '97, occaÅ¿ioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of quarantines; as I propoÅ¿e to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a future paper.</p>
                              <p>This contagion however appears, from numerous obÅ¿ervations, and the moÅ¿t authentic facts, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing fever, only under <hi>particular</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances: theÅ¿e circumÅ¿tances, removed or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the contagion becomes inactive and harmleÅ¿s.</p>
                              <p>This fever had not been obÅ¿erved to exiÅ¿t in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia for more than thirty years before the year '93âand has never been known to exiÅ¿t in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Å¿eaÅ¿on in this climate; differing in this reÅ¿pect, from thoÅ¿e contagious fevers that are bred in jails, hoÅ¿pitals and priÅ¿on Å¿hips; but perfectly reÅ¿embling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the TurkiÅ¿h dominions in Europe bordering upon AÅ¿ia.</p>
                              <p>The circumÅ¿tances which render the contagion of the yellow fever active and favor its Å¿preading or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming epidemic, appear to be, hot, rarified and Å¿tagnant, or confined air, more eÅ¿pecially when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and altered in its Å¿alutary quality by putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from dead vegetable and animal Å¿ubÅ¿tances. Under the recited circumÅ¿tances the majority of thoÅ¿e who approach very near to, or come in contact with the Å¿ick, Å¿o as to receive the exhalations emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the lungs or Å¿kin, become in the courÅ¿e of a few days, moÅ¿t commonly on the fifth or Å¿ixth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Å¿uch expoÅ¿ure, affected with the Å¿ame kind of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as all that approach within the Å¿ame diÅ¿tance
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033589_0068_0FF7930CA3033DD8"/>
to the Å¿ick do not afterwards take the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their conÅ¿titutions are not diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to favour its operation, that is, that they are poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of a power to reÅ¿iÅ¿t its action or impreÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the Å¿tomach, or with thoÅ¿e in the arteries paÅ¿Å¿es out again, with Å¿ome of the uÅ¿ual excretions.</p>
                              <p>The circumÅ¿tances which, in moÅ¿t caÅ¿es, appear to give effect to the contagion, Å¿o as to produce fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, after it has been received into the circulation through the medium of the Å¿tomach, lungs or Å¿kin, appear to be Å¿uch as have the power of inducing Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and great debility in the Å¿everal functions of the body, and conÅ¿equent Å¿paÅ¿m or conÅ¿triction of the extreme veÅ¿Å¿els, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Among the chief of theÅ¿e, may be reckoned, Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den expoÅ¿ure to cold, after great fatigue, or after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly heated by exerciÅ¿e and expoÅ¿ure to the Å¿corching rays of the Å¿un.</p>
                              <p>Intemperance, Å¿ucceeded by abÅ¿tinence, frequent blood letting, purging, faÅ¿ting, and conÅ¿tant terror or dread of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, have all a Å¿imilar effect.âWhereas moderate and refreÅ¿hing exerciÅ¿e, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate uÅ¿e of Å¿uch nouriÅ¿hing food as has no tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Å¿timulate or inflame, and rather to preÅ¿erve the bowels laxative than otherwiÅ¿e, and the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate uÅ¿e of diluted fermented liquors, particularly Å¿ound bottled porter and claret, have the moÅ¿t Å¿alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effect in preventing the operation of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and alÅ¿o of rendering the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e milder and more manageable by the phyÅ¿ician, when it does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, than when it occurs in thoÅ¿e previouÅ¿ly debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated.</p>
                              <p>The air in the open Å¿treets, I believe, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Å¿ufficiently contaminated by the contagious articles (let the patients be ever Å¿o numerous in the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033589_0069_0FF79311103166A8"/>
houÅ¿es) to communicate the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e to any perÅ¿on walking in the middle of the Å¿treet, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the oppoÅ¿ite Å¿ide. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervations of the judicious and accurate Dr. RuÅ¿Å¿el, in his account of a peÅ¿tilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phyÅ¿icians that have publiÅ¿hed an account of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is alÅ¿o eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by the events of laÅ¿t year, and by thoÅ¿e of '93.</p>
                              <p>In the year '93, all the priÅ¿oners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the penÅ¿ioners in the alms houÅ¿e; and the patients in the PennÅ¿ylvania hoÅ¿pital, eÅ¿caped the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the precaution of preventing the admiÅ¿Å¿ion of any Å¿ick or Å¿uÅ¿picious perÅ¿on, as well as every infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed article into thoÅ¿e places.</p>
                              <p>All the families, alÅ¿o, that remained in the city, and confined themÅ¿elves and their domeÅ¿tics Å¿trictly to their own houÅ¿es, and Å¿uffered no Å¿ick perÅ¿on, or any one lately recovered from the diÅ¿order, or any material from an infected houÅ¿e, to come near them; and employed Å¿ome truÅ¿ty perÅ¿on to furniÅ¿h them with marketing and other neceÅ¿Å¿aries from Å¿ources free from infection, eÅ¿caped the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This was alÅ¿o the caÅ¿e with all the farmers that attended the market, that cautiouÅ¿ly avoided Å¿leeping at, or going into any of the chambers of the taverns or places where they put up. This could not have been the caÅ¿e if the whole atmoÅ¿phere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxious exhalations.</p>
                              <p>By obÅ¿erving the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, thoÅ¿e inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the country, may certainly preÅ¿erve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves from taking the fever.</p>
                              <p>TheÅ¿e are conÅ¿olatory facts, drawn from experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033589_0070_0FF79316193CD4A8"/>
obÅ¿ervers; and they are facts that may be fitly oppoÅ¿ed to the popular notions of contagion, Å¿o apt to affect the imagination in moments of conÅ¿ternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diÅ¿may.</p>
                              <p>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have frequently Å¿een perÅ¿ons, whoÅ¿e office it is to attend the Å¿ick, eÅ¿cape the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in large airy apartments, without obÅ¿erving any precaution at all; but have Å¿eldom obÅ¿erved this to be the caÅ¿e in Å¿mall confined places unfavourable for ventilation, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the circumÅ¿tances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. CleanlineÅ¿s, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be eÅ¿Å¿ential for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</p>
                              <p>Perhaps if phyÅ¿icians and nurÅ¿es were Å¿tudiouÅ¿ly to guard againÅ¿t breathing when near the patient, and were never to Å¿wallow their Å¿aliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew Å¿ome agreeable aromatic Å¿ubÅ¿tance; were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to approach the Å¿ick with an empty Å¿tomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occaÅ¿ioned tenderneÅ¿s of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at leaÅ¿t render the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</p>

                  <p>The following intereÅ¿ting remarks were publiÅ¿hed in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 13th inÅ¿tant:</p>
                  <p>"WE are apt to magnify whatever reÅ¿pects our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves. It ought not therefore to be Å¿urprizing if the papers of our city were full of remarks on the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fever. The extenÅ¿ive miÅ¿fortunes that it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces occupying almoÅ¿t excluÅ¿ively our attention, our Å¿ubÅ¿cribers at a diÅ¿tance would not fail to liÅ¿ten with an indulgent ear to our tale of diÅ¿treÅ¿s, and Å¿uffer us to fly to the only Å¿olace left us, that of expreÅ¿Å¿ing our Å¿orrow. So far, however, have the citizens of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia been from indulging themÅ¿elves in fruitleÅ¿s expreÅ¿Å¿ions of regret, that our papers contain few animadverÅ¿ions, and no diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ions, reÅ¿pecting the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. They have not omitted to record facts, but every mind has been Å¿uffered without prejudice to form its own deductions. This APPARENT apathy has riÅ¿en not from any real indifference or want of feeling, but from a conviction derived from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that in the colliÅ¿ion of hoÅ¿tile opinions, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is often loÅ¿t Å¿ight of, and an obÅ¿tinate adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to error is generated in its room. In the year '93 the medical pen was, in moÅ¿t inÅ¿tances, dipped in gall. The Å¿everal combatants took their peculiar grounds and diÅ¿dained, in too many caÅ¿es, to Å¿ave the life of a human being by following any other Å¿uggeÅ¿tions, than their own. They diÅ¿tracted the public mind, and Å¿hook all confidence in medical aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance.</p>
                  <p>The very reverÅ¿e of this has been exhibited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preÅ¿ent Å¿eaÅ¿on. No men have allied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Å¿upport of a favourite theory. The pride of opinion has exiÅ¿ted but in a limited Å¿phere. The practice of one phyÅ¿ician has become aÅ¿Å¿imilated to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033589_0072_0FF7931A7B0F4EF8"/>
that of another; and from the beÅ¿t information thoÅ¿e preÅ¿criptions appear to be very generally purÅ¿ued, which are mild, and more congenial to nature than thoÅ¿e remedies, if remedies they may be called, which too often only reÅ¿cue us from the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e to inflict upon us one more fatal.</p>
                  <p>"TheÅ¿e ideas will not, at preÅ¿ent, be purÅ¿ued further. The chief deÅ¿ign of theÅ¿e notices is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Å¿uperior malignity of the preÅ¿ent diÅ¿eaÅ¿e over that which prevailed in '93. It is computed that in that year 23,000 citizens left the city. They formed probably two-fifths of the inhabitants. This year certainly three-fourths, but more likely five-Å¿ixths of the citizens, have departed. Taking the intermediate number, the reÅ¿ult will be that twice the proportion of citizens remained in Philadelphia in '93 that do this year. Some allowance, however, is to be made for the increaÅ¿ed population. But on the other hand, when the caution of the citizens is conÅ¿idered, and the arrangements that were made to reÅ¿iÅ¿t its influence this year, the laÅ¿t circumÅ¿tances will be found to balance the former. BeÅ¿ides it ought to be remembered, that in a place contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a given population, if an epidemic rages, its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is not checked in the exact ratio of the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the inhabitants, but with much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. NotwithÅ¿tanding theÅ¿e circumÅ¿tances, the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e continues to rear its head, and to threaten mortality this year Å¿uperior to that in '93."</p>
                  <p>Twenty-Å¿even perÅ¿ons were Å¿ick at BoÅ¿ton on the 12th inÅ¿t. 10 of whom were on the recovery.</p>

                              <p>THE great advantage to be derived to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from an inÅ¿pection of the bodies of Å¿uch as have died of Å¿o formidable an epidemic, as the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, muÅ¿t be obvious to all. The following caÅ¿es of diÅ¿Å¿ection may throw Å¿ome light on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, as it prevails in this town, and may, we hope, be of Å¿ome uÅ¿e, in inveÅ¿tigating the treatment beÅ¿t adapted to the purpoÅ¿e of checking or Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ing its deÅ¿tructive ravages.</p>
                              <p>The firÅ¿t caÅ¿e was of a man, who died on the 6th day from the Å¿eizure, and as no application was made to a phyÅ¿ician, till the firÅ¿t Å¿tage of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e had nearly expired, the Å¿tate of the organs may be conÅ¿idered in a great meaÅ¿ure as the natural effect of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, undiÅ¿turbed by art.</p>
                              <p>In the cavity of the cheÅ¿t, the lungs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably affectedâThey contained an uncommon quantity of dark blood in their veÅ¿Å¿els, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them apparently more denÅ¿e than uÅ¿ual; the veÅ¿icles not being diÅ¿tended with air, and their Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance conÅ¿equently leÅ¿s compreÅ¿Å¿ible than uÅ¿ual.âThe poÅ¿terior part of both lobes was extremely livid, and in the cavities of the thorax was contained a large portion of extravaÅ¿ated blood, firmly coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to the quantity of eight or ten ounces, as nearly as could be eÅ¿timated.</p>
                              <p>The pericadium contained as much as two or three ounces of fluid blood. The heart was of its uÅ¿ual Å¿ize; but the coronary veins were Å¿o diÅ¿tended
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033589_0075_0FF793235A56D7F8"/>
with blood, as to exhibit the appearance of a moÅ¿t Å¿ucceÅ¿sful injection. In the cavity of the abdomen, the part moÅ¿t conÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly morbid was the liver.âThis organ appeared to be much inflamed both on its convex and concave Å¿urface; its Å¿ubÅ¿tance was much indurated, and on cutting, reÅ¿embled in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a boiled liver. The gall bladder was contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a very Å¿mall Å¿ize, and contained not more than a quarter of an ounce of a thick, glutinous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t inÅ¿piÅ¿Å¿ated Å¿ubÅ¿tance, reÅ¿embling pith. There were no marks of any conÅ¿iderable quantity of the bile having been lately contained in the Å¿ack, and none of the neighbouring parts had the leaÅ¿t tinge that denoted its preÅ¿ence. On cutting through the ductus communis choledochus, no bile iÅ¿Å¿ued from the aperture; the hepatic duct had alÅ¿o evidently for Å¿ome time, ceaÅ¿ed to tranÅ¿mit its fluid from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The Å¿tomach exhibited an enormous diÅ¿tenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its veins, eÅ¿pecially round the pylorus, and had every mark of great inflammation. The inteÅ¿tines in general, were in the Å¿ame Å¿tate with the Å¿tomach; the Å¿maller were conÅ¿iderably diÅ¿tended, and the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger contracted. The Å¿pleen was uncommonly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, but in other reÅ¿pects in its natural Å¿tate. The peritonaeum on the under Å¿ide of the diaphragm, and the pleura on the upper, bore the veÅ¿tiges of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, but no other parts of thoÅ¿e membranes appeared to have been diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed.</p>
                              <p>The omentum was conÅ¿iderably thickened, and from the turgeÅ¿cence of its blood veÅ¿Å¿els, of a colour unuÅ¿ually dark. There were no appearances in the thoracic or abdominal viÅ¿cera of Å¿uppuration, nor was any degree of foeter perceived to ariÅ¿e from them; nor was there the leaÅ¿t mark of even incipient putrifaction in any part of the body. It may be proper to remark on this caÅ¿e, that in every Å¿tage of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, the diÅ¿charges from the bowels, were of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033589_0076_0FF79324EE44E4F8"/>
the colour and conÅ¿iÅ¿tence of water gruel, excepting a few evacuations of a matter Å¿imilar to what is called the black vomit; and that this uÅ¿ually fatal Å¿ymptom had alÅ¿o preceded the patient's death on the fourth day of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿econd caÅ¿e. The Å¿ubject of this diÅ¿Å¿ecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the body of a perÅ¿on, who died on the 12th day of the attack with Å¿ymptoms of a mixed kind; a remiÅ¿Å¿ion of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e had taken place at the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od uÅ¿ually critical, upon which, on the 6th day, a delirium enÅ¿ued, and continued to the moment of fatal termination.</p>
                              <p>On opening the cranium, the brain was found to have its veÅ¿Å¿els aÅ¿toniÅ¿hingly deÅ¿tined with blood, an ounce or two of Å¿erum was effuÅ¿ed between the dura and pia mater. Under the Å¿agittal future, and by the Å¿ide of the longitudinal Å¿inus, where the large veins terminate in that cavity, a lymphatic band, about an inch wide, extending nearly the whole length of the Å¿inus, was formed by the coagulable lymph, which had been effuÅ¿ed from the blood veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els, by the violence of the preceding inflammation, and this Å¿ubÅ¿tance had Å¿erved as a medium of adheÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the dura and pia mater in that part.</p>
                              <p>The lungs adhered very firmly to the pleura on the right Å¿ide, and appeared poÅ¿teriorly to have been much inflamed, and in Å¿ome parts to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in portions of about the Å¿ize of a pigeon's egg. The left lobe adhered Å¿o firmly to the pleura, as not to be Å¿eparated but by tearing the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the lungs, which here appeared extremely diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, and in a Å¿tate of actual Å¿uppuration throughout its whole Å¿ubÅ¿tance. The heart was in its natural Å¿tate. The liver was much enlarged, and in a Å¿tate that denoted a high degree of inflammation; the convex Å¿urface, of the great lobe near the gall bladder exhibiting marks of extravaÅ¿ation, as if violently contuÅ¿ed.â
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033589_0077_0FF79326DA5C61F0"/>
The gall bladder was full of bile, and the ducts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿tomach was nearly in its natural Å¿tate, but on the inÅ¿ide, the Å¿urface of the villous coat, was beÅ¿meared with a matter, which Å¿eemed to be of the Å¿ame nature with the black vomit, tho' nothing of this kind had been ejected in the courÅ¿e of the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e.</p>
                              <p>The duoderum, was much inflamed for Å¿everal inches from its commencement at the Å¿tomach, and the whole tract of the Å¿maller inteÅ¿tines was in the Å¿ame Å¿tate. The urinary bladder was contracted to the Å¿ize of a pullet's egg, and its inner coat appeared to have been in a high Å¿tate of inflammation, the veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els having been diÅ¿tended to Å¿uch a degree, as to have Å¿uffered a rupture, and to have effuÅ¿ed a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood into the cavity of this organ.</p>
                              <p>The Å¿tate of the lungs in this Å¿ubject, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the conÅ¿equence, chiefly of a previous diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, independent of that which proved fatal here. An af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the lungs had Å¿ometime exiÅ¿ted, whilÅ¿t the Å¿ubject was in other reÅ¿pects intolerable health, and in the purÅ¿uit of his buÅ¿ineÅ¿s; Å¿o that a pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umption would in all probability, have Å¿hortly put a period to his life, had the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e of which he died, never overtaken him.</p>
                              <p>The third caÅ¿e. In this inÅ¿tance the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e terminated fatally on the fourth day.</p>
                              <p>Upon opening the thorax, the lungs diÅ¿cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marks of inflammation, anteriorly, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely gorged with blood, in the poÅ¿terior part of their reÅ¿pective lobes.</p>
                              <p>The liver exhibited marks of inflammation eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on its concave Å¿ide, and poÅ¿terior part; its texture was altered, and of a very denÅ¿e conÅ¿iÅ¿tence. The gall bladder was completely obliterated, its coats having coaleÅ¿ced with the contiguous parts Å¿o
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033589_0078_0FF79328C6F10210"/>
as to form with them one confuÅ¿ed membranous Å¿ubÅ¿tance. The Å¿tomach was externally to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a natural Å¿tate, but its inner coat was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that black coloured fluid, denominated the black vomit.</p>
                              <p>The color in Å¿ome parts had been much infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as well as part of the omentum where attached to this inteÅ¿tine.</p>
                              <p>It is worthy of remark, that in both the caÅ¿es, where the gall bladder had been diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, and ceaÅ¿ed to perform its functions; or where the liver had been rendered incapable of Å¿ecreting the bile, the body became yellow, before death; whereas in the other, where the bile was found in due quantity, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance did not occur.</p>
                              <p>From the above diÅ¿Å¿ections, which evinced a deficiency of Å¿ecretion in the billary organs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of cure Å¿eemed to be directed towards a courÅ¿e, which might obviate the inflammation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the organs diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, and open the excretory ducts of the liver, that the fluid might reÅ¿ume its courÅ¿e into the inteÅ¿tines.</p>
                              <p>It is with the higheÅ¿t degree of pleaÅ¿ure, that we communicate to the public our hopes that after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evacuations, the uÅ¿e of calomel may be found to anÅ¿wer theÅ¿e important purpoÅ¿es. This medicine has been accordingly uÅ¿ed with much Å¿ucceÅ¿s in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen patients within eighteen days, all of whom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one, have recovered; or have paÅ¿t the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous period. It has been given not in the uÅ¿ual doÅ¿es, for the purpoÅ¿e of an evacuant by the inteÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, but in Å¿mall doÅ¿es of one, two or three grains, every hour or two, Å¿o as to produce a Å¿ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as Å¿oon as poÅ¿Å¿ible; with this view, from one hundred to two hundred and thirty grains of calomel have been given in the courÅ¿e of two or three days, commencing the uÅ¿e of it immediately after the firÅ¿t
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033589_0079_0FF792AA98666A08"/>
copious evacuations by bleeding and purging; and in every inÅ¿tance as the Å¿alivation came on, the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e has abated.</p>
                              <p>Coinciding in Å¿entiment, reÅ¿pecting the uÅ¿e of mercury, Å¿o as to produce a Å¿alivation, we with pleaÅ¿ure mention the learned doctor RuÅ¿h, of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. But the method is more explicitly and highly recommended by James Clark, M. D. F. R. S. E. in a treatiÅ¿e on the yellow fever, as it appeared in the iÅ¿land of Dominica, in the years, '93, '94, '95, and '96.</p>
                              <p>The doctor recommends the free uÅ¿e of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both as a remedy and preventativeâand Å¿ays, the officers of the army and navy, who have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure and can be prevailed upon, on their arrival in the WeÅ¿t-Indies, to undergo one or two courÅ¿es of mercury, taking a few laxative medicines, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining themÅ¿elves to a moderate uÅ¿e of wine, and living chiefly on vegetables and fruits for the firÅ¿t two months after their arrival, may rely almoÅ¿t to a certainty, on eÅ¿caping the fever.</p>

                              <p>WHEREAS, it hath pleaÅ¿ed Almighty God, to viÅ¿it the cities of New-York, Philadelphia, and the borough of Wilmington, in the Å¿tate of Delaware, with a malignant and mortal fever, which excites great apprehenÅ¿ions in the minds of the citizens of Baltimore (who have been bleÅ¿Å¿ed with an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon degree of health this Å¿eaÅ¿on) leÅ¿t daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with thoÅ¿e places may introduce the Å¿aid diÅ¿order into this city, and makes them deÅ¿irous that all intercouÅ¿e, during the preÅ¿ent critical period, Å¿hould be reÅ¿trained:</p>
                              <p>I have, therefore, deemed it proper, in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the powers veÅ¿ted in me by law, to iÅ¿Å¿ue this proclamation, hereby forbidding the entrance into the city of Baltimore, or within three miles thereof, of all perÅ¿ons whomÅ¿oever who have come from the cities of New-York or Philadelphia, or from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of Wilmington, in the Å¿tate of Delaware, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033589_0082_0FF792B71F650C60"/>
the citizens of Baltimore from having any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with them, until they can produce an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved certificate of their abÅ¿ence from thoÅ¿e places at leaÅ¿t fifteen days previous thereto, excepting only Å¿uch perÅ¿ons as may come into Baltimore, or within three miles thereof, on or before TueÅ¿day next, the 18th inÅ¿t. conformably to my proclamation of the 18th day of AuguÅ¿t, and the carriers of the mail.</p>
                              <p>This proclamation to remain in full force until public information is given to the contrary, of which all perÅ¿ons concerned are to take notice and govern themÅ¿elves accordingly.</p>
                              <p>Given under my hand and the Corporate Seal of the city of Baltimore, this 15th  day of September, in the year of our Lord one thouÅ¿and Å¿even hundred and ninety-eight. (L. S.)</p>

Two of the criminals were killed before the reÅ¿t Å¿urrendered, If theÅ¿e unprincipled wretches had Å¿ucceeded in their attempt, in all probability the city would have been pillaged and, perhaps, Å¿et on fire.</p>
                  <p>Three men were found dead in a very putrid and offenÅ¿ive condition, yeÅ¿terday. The following is taken from the Philadelphia Gazette of yeÅ¿terday:</p>

                     <p>A man was found dead the day before yeÅ¿terday in a houÅ¿e in Front near Walnut-Å¿treet, directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opÅ¿ite the Green tree pump. The corpÅ¿e was firÅ¿t diÅ¿covered by the very offenÅ¿ive Å¿mell which was found to proceed from the houÅ¿e. From the time that has elapÅ¿ed, Å¿ince the family left the houÅ¿e, the corpÅ¿e, it is thought, muÅ¿t have been laying there at leaÅ¿t a monthâIt was in Å¿o high a Å¿tate of putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when diÅ¿covered, that it was removed by pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the coffin, in which it was depoÅ¿ited!</p>
                     <p>In addition to the above, a man was found in a houÅ¿e in South Water-Å¿treet, near CheÅ¿nut-Å¿treetâit is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed that he had been dead for three weeksâit was diÅ¿covered by a man having occaÅ¿ion to go into the houÅ¿e for Å¿ome things which he had left; on opening the door, there was Å¿uch a Å¿tench came out of the houÅ¿e, that he was obliged to retreat.</p>
                     <p>A negro man entered the houÅ¿e and found the body of a man almoÅ¿t devoured by vermin; infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was given at the Health-Office, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; the people waited till 8 o'clock in the evening and heard nothing from the Health-Office, two black men were hired for Å¿ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dollars, to take the corps and throw it into the

                  <p>It appears by the public prints, that there were, only 5 perÅ¿ons with the yellow fever at PortÅ¿mouth, on the 10th inÅ¿t.</p>

                  <p>I rode through chief part of the city to-day, and obÅ¿erved very few houÅ¿es, weÅ¿t of Eighth-Å¿treet, Å¿hut up; but Å¿carcely one in an hundred open in any other part, excepting in the northern and Å¿outhern extremities, where the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e appears now to be extending its ravages.</p>
                  <p>There was not a caÅ¿e of fever in any part of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark before the death of Mr. RuÅ¿Å¿el, which was on the 8th of AuguÅ¿t, and very few on the 20th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿t.</p>

                  <p>In an advertiÅ¿ement Å¿igned by Mr. Saml.

Wilmington (Del.) Å¿till continues to be ravaged by the fever. 106 deaths, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 99 adults and 7 chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, have occurred from the 7th of AuguÅ¿t to the 20th inÅ¿tant, incluÅ¿ive, 9 perÅ¿ons died within 24 hours, ending laÅ¿t ThurÅ¿day, the 19th inÅ¿t. MoÅ¿t of the houÅ¿es in the lower part of the town are deÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. (Phila. Gaz.)</p>
                  <p>Similar accounts have been received from the little villages of CheÅ¿ter and Marcus-Hook, on the river Delaware, between Philadelphia and Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                  <p>It appears from a communication from Dr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidÅ¿on to Dr. MeaÅ¿e, publiÅ¿hed in the Medical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itory of New-York, that the atmoÅ¿phere of the WeÅ¿t India IÅ¿lands, where the fever is Å¿o frequently malignant and mortal, contains a conÅ¿iderably great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion of pure air than the atmoÅ¿phere in any part of Europe. Hence a Å¿trong preÅ¿umption ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e does not originate from impure air, but is the offspring of Å¿pecific contagion.</p>

                  <p>It appears from the returns of this day, that the late increaÅ¿ed coolneÅ¿s of the air has increaÅ¿ed the liÅ¿t of new caÅ¿es.</p>
                  <p>There are now near one thouÅ¿and perÅ¿ons in the Å¿heds or board tents, in the encampment in MaÅ¿ters fields, all from the City, Liberties and Å¿uburbs.</p>

On Sunday laÅ¿t the 23d inÅ¿t. the phyÅ¿icians at the encampment preÅ¿cribed for 32 patients who had different complaints; of theÅ¿e 32, there were only 14 that had the malignant fever. One of them had been out of the city nine days before he was attacked with the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, <abbr>viz.</abbr> HutchinÅ¿on ThompÅ¿on, a boy ten years of age.</p>
                  <p>Only four freÅ¿h caÅ¿es of fever have occurred at the encampment Å¿ince the 23d, though freÅ¿h families are daily coming out of the city, and though many of them have been much expoÅ¿ed to the late rains and damp ground. This furniÅ¿hes a Å¿trong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of thoÅ¿e who maintain the opinion, that the prevailing fever is propagated by contagion from the diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, and not by any depravity or nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious particles diffuÅ¿ed through the atmoÅ¿phere from putrid vegetable or dead animal matter. For theÅ¿e breathed the Å¿ame air as the reÅ¿t of the citizens, but none but thoÅ¿e that had received the contagion from the diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, were affected by cauÅ¿es allowed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to be powerfully adapted to excite the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e into action.</p>
                  <p>There were only 35 perÅ¿ons with the fever in BoÅ¿ton the 21Å¿t inÅ¿t. (Phila. Gaz.)</p>
                  <p>The fever in the jail of Philadelphia has hitherto been confined to the vagrants and criminals; the eaÅ¿t wing has been converted into an hoÅ¿pital, and every humane and Å¿alutary meaÅ¿ure adopted for the convenience and cure of the Å¿ick. (Ph. Gaz.)</p>
                  <p>There were 7 deaths at Wilmington on the 25th inÅ¿t.</p>

                  <head>REMARKS, WHICH FOLLOW THE ABOVE.</head>
                  <p>The above return has excited conÅ¿iderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional alarm in town and country. It is certainly melancholly: but we deÅ¿ire to praiÅ¿e Heaven, a Å¿mart north-eaÅ¿terly Å¿torm, which we hope and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, will check the march and diÅ¿Å¿ipate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy of the peÅ¿tilence, and thoroughly cleanÅ¿e our atmoÅ¿phere, yeÅ¿terday morning commenced its Å¿alutary operation, and terminated laÅ¿t evening in a Å¿trong north-weÅ¿ter. We expect in a few days to congratulate our friends in the country, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Hygeia to the metropolis; and to invite their return.</p>
                  <p>In continuing this melancholy detail, we cannot Å¿uppreÅ¿s thoÅ¿e painful emotions, which naturally ariÅ¿e, when contemplating one of the greateÅ¿t cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which ever befel an infant nation. AlmoÅ¿t all the Å¿eaports of the United States has, more or leÅ¿s, within theÅ¿e few years, been viÅ¿ited with a peÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which threatens to depopulate many of our faireÅ¿t towns and villages. To arreÅ¿t the progreÅ¿s of this deÅ¿troying angel, has as yet, been attempted in vain. It appears to defy the Å¿cience, Å¿kill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity of our moÅ¿t eminent phyÅ¿iciansâand to yield to nothing but the froÅ¿ts of winter. It Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly behoves every well-wiÅ¿her to his country, to continue to Å¿earch for the cauÅ¿e of the calamity, and, if poÅ¿Å¿ible, to remove it.</p>

                  <p>Died this morning, Mr. JoÅ¿eph Anthony, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pectable and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed merchant of Philadelphia. He reÅ¿ided in High, near Ninth-Å¿treet.</p>

The phyÅ¿icians of the encampment preÅ¿cribed for 32 patients to-day, not one of whom had any Å¿ymptom of the yellow feverâbut the greateÅ¿t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion complained of diarrhoea, catarrh, intermitting fever, or cutaneous eruption.</p>
                  <p>There are at preÅ¿ent at the encampment more than 1300 perÅ¿ons including children.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cooper, town clerk of BoÅ¿ton, Å¿tates that Å¿ince the return on the 24th to the 26th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 20 perÅ¿ons have recovered, 7 have died, 44 new caÅ¿es have occurred, 97 remaining Å¿ick, 20 of whom are on the recovery.</p>
                  <p>From 26th to 28th, 26 had recovered, 5 died and 12 new caÅ¿es had occurred, 72 remaining Å¿ick, of whom 30 were on the recovery.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cooper aÅ¿Å¿ures the public, that the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns are particularly correct.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Campbell of Woodberry, and Dr. Martin of CheÅ¿ter, both phyÅ¿icians of eminence, are dead of the prevailing diÅ¿eaÅ¿e,</p>
                  <p>ProviÅ¿ion has been amply made for the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent and needy, and for all who can Å¿ubmit to take Å¿helter at the encampment, or to requeÅ¿t Å¿upplies from the guardians of the poor, but the Å¿ituation of thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Å¿enÅ¿ibility will not permit them to have recourÅ¿e to theÅ¿e reÅ¿ources, muÅ¿t be attended with diÅ¿treÅ¿s that may be better conceived than deÅ¿crib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>A conÅ¿iderable number of caÅ¿es of pure intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents have occurred on the high grounds within two miles of the city; in one family near the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on MaÅ¿ters' place, five of the family have had regular paroxiÅ¿ms and intermiÅ¿Å¿ions.</p>

The deaths Å¿till about 40. The diÅ¿order is much among the poor, who are unable to procure Å¿uitable nurÅ¿ing. Simple remedies are found moÅ¿t availing. CaÅ¿tor oil and Å¿alts, with injections, are all the medicines, excepting lime water and milk, that are given by our moÅ¿t Å¿kilful and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icians. Herb teas, particularly catmint, are very freely uÅ¿ed to occaÅ¿ion perÅ¿piration, and where the patient has an attentive and prudent nurÅ¿e, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally under this treatment have recovered. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perÅ¿ons have been Å¿ick in my houÅ¿e, and except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, have all been treated in this way, and all recovered. My Å¿iÅ¿ter had calomel, and Å¿uffered more than the others, though her attack was much leÅ¿s Å¿evere than either of them. I could mention other inÅ¿tances, but this may Å¿uffice.

                  <p>The health committee of New-London, in their report of the 25th ult. recommend to the citizens who have moved out, not to return at preÅ¿ent, as the number of new caÅ¿es laÅ¿t week, has exceeded any preceding week.</p>
                  <p>Twenty-two perÅ¿ons Å¿ick at the encampment;âonly one of whom had any Å¿ymptoms reÅ¿embling the malignant or yellow fever.

                  <p>Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, in a letter written Å¿ome years Å¿ince to Dr. Franklin, aÅ¿Å¿erts, "That the yellow fever has chiefly raged in America in large families, towns, camps or Å¿hips, and has been twice brought into Virginia by Å¿hips of war;" and adds, "It is remarkably contagious, as appears from the greateÅ¿t part of a family being affected by it from perÅ¿ons who had taken it in another place.</p>

"The moÅ¿t effectual remedies were lenient pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and clyÅ¿ters frequently repeated till a copious diarrhoea and bilious Å¿tool enÅ¿ued; with aqueous and bland drinks, and occaÅ¿ional bleedings adapted to the indications expreÅ¿Å¿ed by the pulÅ¿e and pain of head, Å¿tomach or inteÅ¿tines. He alÅ¿o aÅ¿Å¿ures him, that he found mild purges and clyÅ¿ters much more effectual than any other remedies Å¿o long as the pain and tenderneÅ¿s of the Å¿tomach, and conÅ¿tant propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity to puke continued, upon receiving any thing into it, without regard to the period or duration of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, though the lowleÅ¿s of the pulÅ¿e Å¿eemed to oppoÅ¿e it."</p>
                  <p>I have Å¿een Å¿everal caÅ¿es this year of perÅ¿ons that had the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in '93 and '97, and have Å¿een Å¿everal inÅ¿tances of reinÅ¿ection every time that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e has appeared in the city Å¿ince the year '93.</p>
                  <p>Hannah Norris died at M. FiÅ¿her's <abbr>eÅ¿q.</abbr> Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks after having recovered from the firÅ¿t at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in '93. Dr. PleaÅ¿ants died under Å¿imilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances in '97. Mr. Young, Mr. Conoly, Mr. Taylor, Mrs. LiÅ¿le, and Å¿everal others, recovered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Å¿econd attack. This year Drs. Cooper, MeaÅ¿e, and Leib, David Parke, Mrs. Mendenhall, and Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, had the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e that had it before. ThoÅ¿e caÅ¿es, however, have been very few in compariÅ¿on of thoÅ¿e that have eÅ¿caped it, who have once had it.</p>
                  <p>It appears from Dr. Stark's diÅ¿Å¿ections, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Å¿tomach, however induced, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Å¿ame Å¿ymptoms as the yellow fever; and that what is called the black vomit is owing to a mortification of the vellous coat of the Å¿tomach,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033589_0107_0FF7935067773DB0"/>
and blood which has eÅ¿caped from the dilated veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els and become putrid.</p>
                  <p>[See Stark's Clinical and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ObÅ¿ervations.]</p>
                  <p>It appears from Dr. Crawford's experiments, that the gaÅ¿es or aerial exhalations, extricated from the fleÅ¿h of animals, by putrefaction, conÅ¿iÅ¿t of animal hepatic air, i. e. hydrogen holding Å¿ulphur in Å¿oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a Å¿mall proportion of azotic gas, or air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its ozygene. And the Å¿mell of the breath and of the perÅ¿pirable matter, in malignant fevers, evidently demonÅ¿trate that they contain animal hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic, hydrogenous gas, and not Å¿uper oxygenated azote, as has been preÅ¿umed by Dr. S.

where Å¿o much caution and prudence is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>The apprehenÅ¿ion of the Board has been awakened by the too haÅ¿ty return of many individuals, who have inconÅ¿iderately hazarded their own health and the public welfare; Å¿everal of whom, the Board are Å¿orry to add, have been Å¿eized with the fever Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their return.</p>
                        <p>The weather, Å¿ince the 6th inÅ¿t. has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unfavourable, &amp; the number of the Å¿ick have conÅ¿iderably encreaÅ¿ed; which would be augmented by the accumulation of perÅ¿ons, particularly thoÅ¿e from a pure atmoÅ¿phere. The Board earneÅ¿tly Å¿olicit public attention to conÅ¿iderations Å¿o important; and entreat the forbearance of their fellow-citizens, until returning health Å¿hall invite them home.</p>
                        <p>The Board cannot too Å¿trongly impreÅ¿s the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and neceÅ¿Å¿ity of cleanÅ¿ing and purifying, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the return of the inhabitants), the bedding, cloathing, and houÅ¿es, in which the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿ted; for which purpoÅ¿e, they recommend <hi>the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uÅ¿e of lime.</hi> They alÅ¿o repeat their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the commiÅ¿Å¿ioners, to have the pumps fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and copiouÅ¿ly worked, as the water is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenÅ¿ive and unwholeÅ¿ome.</p>
                        <p>The Board aÅ¿Å¿ure their fellow-citizens that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the health of the City and Liberties Å¿hall be Å¿o reÅ¿tored as to admit of the return of the inhabitants with Å¿afety, not a moment Å¿hall be delayed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the glad tidings.</p>

                        <p>It Å¿eems difficult to aÅ¿certain the riÅ¿e and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿s of this fatal diÅ¿eaÅ¿e; but the circumÅ¿tances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated are theÅ¿e:</p>
                        <p>1Å¿t. I underÅ¿tand the Å¿hip NeÅ¿tor, in which the Å¿uÅ¿pected infection came, was from Philadelphia or BoÅ¿ton; but what paÅ¿Å¿age Å¿he had, I know not.</p>
                        <p>2d. 'Tis reported that three Å¿ailors died on board before Å¿he reached City Point.</p>
                        <p>3d. Before my youth went on board, a negro aÅ¿hore adviÅ¿ed him not to go there, for people had died in that Å¿hip of the fever; and when the captain came aÅ¿hore with the boat for them, he refuÅ¿ed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the captain Å¿eriouÅ¿ly avered that the negro was angry with him, and reported this maliciouÅ¿ly to the young men, who at length conÅ¿ented to go.</p>
                        <p>4th. The Å¿hip had nothing in but dirt balaÅ¿t from the town Å¿he left, and it being Sunday, all or chief part of the hands were aÅ¿hore. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they had pumped out of her Å¿everal gallons of fetid bilge water, the Å¿cent of which even then remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unpleaÅ¿ant, for it had been in her Å¿ome weeks.âMoÅ¿t of the hands who pumped it Å¿ickened and died, as did Å¿everal of thoÅ¿e who helped to land the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿t.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="unknown:033589_0112_0FF7935CCD523F70"/>
5th. Since the youths left the Å¿hip, Å¿everal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons in that neighbourhood have died of the like fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Dr. Walker, who viÅ¿ited them while a black vomiting was on Å¿ome of them, is now very Å¿ick in the houÅ¿e oppoÅ¿ite us, but I hope is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>6th. The youths left the Å¿hip at 6 o'clock P. M. and from getting aground frequently did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home before midnight. In the day they were expoÅ¿ed to an hot Å¿un, and at night to an heavy dew.</p>
                        <p>7th. On the TueÅ¿day of that Å¿ame week, at 12 o'clock, my lad was taken with an ague, and before night every one of the party that went in the veÅ¿Å¿el had an high fever, but two of the negroes who went to row and avoided the Å¿hip, eÅ¿caped the fever.âMany are willing to attribute the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Å¿un and dew, and Å¿ay theÅ¿e negroes kept up perÅ¿piration by rowing home, while the whites lay expoÅ¿ed to the cool dew in an open boat. My youth was bled on WedneÅ¿day morning, but his veins were Å¿o Å¿mall and low, that Dr. Shore could not let as much blood as he wiÅ¿hed, (only a tea cup full) for they approve of copious bleeding. His complaint was a deadly Å¿ickneÅ¿s at the Å¿tomach, with pains in every limb, attended with frequent vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of yellow bile. During his diÅ¿order he took a quantity of pills which operated well; injections were adminiÅ¿tered; each temple cup'd; Å¿tomach and legs bliÅ¿tered; and the laÅ¿t medicine given was, I believe, an emetic powder. On Saturday he was very reÅ¿tleÅ¿s, and at night a delirium and Å¿tupor came on; thus he remained till Sunday, when the above emetic was given, Å¿oon after which he made Å¿ome efforts to vomit, but did not; his eyes began to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate exceedingly, and with much oppreÅ¿Å¿ion at his breaÅ¿t, he expired. His corps was not more yellow
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033589_0113_0FF79361E8018038"/>
than uÅ¿ual; four perÅ¿ons were interred when he was, carried off by fevers, I believe.</p>
                        <p>The captain (WilÅ¿on) of the Å¿hip Delight, which lay near the NeÅ¿tor, and with whom the youths dined, did not live Å¿o long as my lad; but he was a very intemperate man, even in his Å¿ickneÅ¿s, and had been on Monday expoÅ¿ed to wet and the heat of the Å¿un. He died in town, diÅ¿tracted with the fever and liquor he drank when he came up.âThe eyes of every one were remarkably glaÅ¿Å¿y, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, but not red as is generally repreÅ¿ented.</p>
                        <p>This Å¿ummer I went to the tin factory oppoÅ¿ite us, to get Å¿ome tin which they kept in a back houÅ¿e; the yard was Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ive filthy, I aÅ¿ked them if they were hatching the yellow fever? they hoped not; but every creature of them have had a fever like the above; Å¿ome had it before the Å¿hipping came; and Å¿everal about this town have the like fever, but are chiefly on the recovery. One Mr. Cooper, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliÅ¿h merchant at Blandford, (in this town) died yeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning; and I Å¿uppoÅ¿e there are four or five in town Å¿ick of the Å¿ame diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. Our family phyÅ¿ician is juÅ¿t recovering; his head was bliÅ¿tered, and he was delirious Å¿everal days. One of the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners told me he Å¿uffered more with it in one day, than with all the pain and Å¿ickneÅ¿s of his whole life, (which was 30 years) and could get no relief till the doctor allowed him to drink cold water in Å¿mall draughts at a time. This enabled him to keep his medicine down, which he could not do before. Our phyÅ¿icians think the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e originates from the Å¿un, heat, dew, filth, &amp;c.âprobably it does, for no one caught it of my young man; and had it been the Å¿mall-pox, I dare Å¿ay they would have felt the affects of it. Every doÅ¿e of medicine I gave him with my own hand, that he might have a fair chance. I uÅ¿ed no preventative, but burnt tar frequently in the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033589_0114_0FF79363870B9AA8"/>
houÅ¿e and Å¿prinkled it fore and aft with vinegar, keeping every window open day and night. Since writing the above, I underÅ¿tand that two of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond craft, that had been employed at one of theÅ¿e Å¿hips, loÅ¿t almoÅ¿t every hand on board; one of them had only a boy left. We have cool nights now, but the middle of the day is very warm and dry. When our family phyÅ¿ician (Dr. Shore) recovers, you Å¿hall know more of this fever. I have been much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at home; and as City Point is 12 miles off, and Å¿everal Å¿hips have been there, I cannot get a Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account of it. I believe Å¿everal died in one of the Å¿hips at the Cape, but the captain endeavoured to conceal it, that it might not prevent his getting hands. Your friend and Å¿ervant.</p>

                  <p>Thirty-Å¿ix patients Å¿ick at the encampment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayâmoÅ¿t part with light complaints, Å¿uch as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh and diarrhoea. Only two new caÅ¿es of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever have occurred at the encampment for Å¿ome days. One of theÅ¿e has been ill eleven daysâhad the black vomit ever Å¿ince the 7th, from the attackâis at this inÅ¿tant with Å¿carcely any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of life. This woman, whoÅ¿e name is Makit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, was attacked five days after a viÅ¿it to the cityâTakes lime water and freÅ¿h milk. Peter Tryon, the other caÅ¿e of the yellow fever, was attacked the day after he came to the encampmentâthis his 3d day.</p>
                  <p>From comparing the effects of mercury, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent caÅ¿es, it appears to me, now, to be proper to excite Å¿alivation in every caÅ¿e where malignant Å¿ymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are evident at an early period of the fever; but that it is Å¿uperfluous, if not injurious, to induce Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation in caÅ¿es where inflammatory Å¿ymptoms are predominant, till theÅ¿e are induced by Å¿ufficient
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033589_0117_0FF7936C525D4F28"/>
blood-letting and purging, which in the majority of caÅ¿es Å¿o circumÅ¿tanced, cure the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e without the aid of any additional remedy. The yellow fever correÅ¿ponds in this reÅ¿pect with the variolous fever, or Å¿mall-pox. In thoÅ¿e caÅ¿es where the eruption appears with a confluent aÅ¿pect, accompanied with great debility, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s about the region of the heart, mercury has been long recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Å¿everal eminent phyÅ¿icians as a more effectual remedy than any other, when reÅ¿trained by the addition of opium, from occaÅ¿ioning frequent evacuations by the bowels. But I believe no one can deem it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to employ Å¿o violent a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the diÅ¿tinct and Å¿imple form of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, when more Å¿afe ones will anÅ¿wer as well.</p>
                  <p>It was the general practice laÅ¿t year, as well as the preÅ¿ent, to give mercury in all caÅ¿es indiÅ¿crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, which was certainly injudicious, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caÅ¿es retarded the cure, eÅ¿pecially in caÅ¿es ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with inflammatory Å¿ymptoms; but in caÅ¿es where nervous Å¿ymptoms predominated from the beginning, &amp; unaccompanied with Å¿evere pain in the head, eyes, or Å¿tomach, or with Å¿ymptoms of dyÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or gravel, calomel was found more Å¿ucceÅ¿sful when given in doÅ¿es of two grains every two hours, and the application of two or three drachms of Å¿trong mercurial ointment to the region of the liver and to different parts of the body four times in the courÅ¿e of every 24 hours, reÅ¿training the mercury by the addition of a few drops of laudanum, occaÅ¿ional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it occaÅ¿ioned more than one or two evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the courÅ¿e of the day, till Å¿igns of Å¿alivation appeared, and no longer; the patient, at the Å¿ame time, abÅ¿taining from all fleÅ¿h meats and vinous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. The early and repeated application of bliÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in Å¿uch caÅ¿es, were generally beneficial; but blood-letting did injury.</p>

                              <head> From the Philadelphia Gazette of this date. A DESCRIPTION Of the ENCAMPMENT at MaÅ¿ters' place.</head>
                              <p>THE encampment at MaÅ¿ters' place is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menÅ¿e work, conÅ¿idering the Å¿hort period in which it was executed. Buildings comfortable, convenient, and in every reÅ¿pect well adapted to the occaÅ¿ion, have been erected in eight or nine days, Å¿ufficient to accommodate 2000 people. BeÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there were erected, in the Å¿ame time, an hoÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a large Å¿tore-houÅ¿e and offices, a bake-houÅ¿e and oven, and five kitchens, each with eight large fire places. This little town is built on a well choÅ¿en Å¿pot, and is laid out in regular order the Å¿treets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terÅ¿ecting each other. The rules and regulations, which are printed and put up in different parts of the encampment, do honour to the heads and hearts of the committee. The entire prohibition of Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous liquors, except in caÅ¿es of real neceÅ¿Å¿ity, is a Å¿triking feature in thoÅ¿e excellent rules; in Å¿hort, they have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed a Å¿yÅ¿tematical police.âThey puniÅ¿h Å¿light offences by withholding the proviÅ¿ions for a reaÅ¿onable time, and for thoÅ¿e more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they expel the offender. All intercourÅ¿e with the city is cut off (except on Å¿pecial occaÅ¿ions) which is enforced by placing Å¿entinels at proper diÅ¿tances around the encampment, who do not permit any perÅ¿on to paÅ¿s or repaÅ¿s, by night or day, without leave from one of the committee or Å¿teward. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers are alÅ¿o appointed, whoÅ¿e duty it is every morning to remove all the filth and to throw freÅ¿h earth into the neceÅ¿Å¿aries. The people are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to expoÅ¿e their bedding to the Å¿un and air at leaÅ¿t three times a week, and to waÅ¿h their cloathing frequently.</p>

The moÅ¿t Å¿crupulous regard to juÅ¿tice is obÅ¿erved in the diÅ¿tribution of the proviÅ¿ions, which are of an excellent quality, and Å¿erved out in abundance.âThe Å¿trict decorum that has been Å¿o eminently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the encampment, amongÅ¿t characters too, Å¿ome of whom are no doubt very abandoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trate the moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿iduous attention in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee as well as Å¿uperior addreÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>Official accounts Å¿tate, that the fever has Å¿o far Å¿ubÅ¿ided at BoÅ¿ton, as to render it perfectly Å¿afe for the inhabitants to return, and proÅ¿ecute their buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s as uÅ¿ual.</p>
                  <p>(P. G.)</p>
                  <p>A letter to the Editor of the Chro. from Phila. mentions, "that in that city and New-York, 21 printers have fallen vactims to the terrible calamity which has deÅ¿olated thoÅ¿e places. To what cauÅ¿e to attribute this uncommon mortality, puzzles manyâbut in my opinion," adds our correÅ¿pondent, "it has ariÅ¿en from Å¿o large a number deeming it their duty to be found at their poÅ¿ts: while moÅ¿t other profeÅ¿Å¿ions fled. I know nothing peculiarly attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in the materials uÅ¿ed in printing-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesâbut as nothing but flight can Å¿ave, if it appears at another Å¿eaÅ¿on, I Å¿hall conÅ¿ider it a bounden duty to avoid it."</p>

                  <p>If I am not unaccountably deceived, the preÅ¿ent prevailing fever, in many reÅ¿pects, bears a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblance to the Å¿mall-pox. They are both more malignant in Å¿ome conÅ¿titutions than others; they are both leÅ¿s fatal to children and the generality of women than to men. They are both more fatal to men addicted to intemperate and voluptuous living; the groÅ¿s and the corpulent, than to temperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who are engaged in active occupations.</p>
                  <p>Hence like Å¿mall pox, the preparation requiÅ¿ite to render the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e mild and Å¿afe, muÅ¿t vary with the temperament and conÅ¿titution of each individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
                  <p>Where the inflammatory diatheÅ¿is predominates, which is commonly the caÅ¿e in children from two to twelve years of age, and to young perÅ¿ons accuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to activity in the open air, mercury is not a proper preparative; but in all caÅ¿es where the want of vigour is manifeÅ¿t, and a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of debility, or the nervous type, are evident, mercury, and in Å¿uch manner as not to evacuate much, in all probability muÅ¿t be among the firÅ¿t preparatives to be found in the Materia Medica. In the cure, I am certain it can only be employed with Å¿afety and with efficacy, in caÅ¿es where the inflammatory diatheÅ¿is, is not conÅ¿iderable; or in caÅ¿es of nervous and Å¿ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tendency,</p>
                  <p>The incautious and too copious employment of mercury has in Å¿everal inÅ¿tances been followed by the moÅ¿t deplorable effects. In Å¿ome caÅ¿es it has occaÅ¿ioned not only the loÅ¿s of teeth, but of part of the jaw bone. In Å¿ome, a rigid contraction of the lower jawâa gangrene of, and conÅ¿equent loÅ¿s

of part of one of the cheeksâthe tonÅ¿ils and palateâloÅ¿s of Å¿peech, &amp;c. The Å¿phacelus and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent eroÅ¿ions in Å¿ome caÅ¿es have been followed by profuÅ¿e diÅ¿charges of blood, which have put a Å¿pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy period to the patient's life. TheÅ¿e facts are mentioned to put leÅ¿s experienced phyÅ¿icians upon their guard, and to prevent them from acting like the Hungarian phyÅ¿icians, mentioned by Kramer and Lind, who, becauÅ¿e they had Å¿een beneficial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from mercury in Å¿yphilitic ulcers, could not be perÅ¿uaded that it would not have a Å¿imilar affect in caÅ¿es of Å¿curvy, but gave it to 400 patients and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to a man.</p>

            <p>HAVING in the preceding Memoirs, noted the riÅ¿e, progreÅ¿s, and fatal effects of the fever, lately prevalent in this city, and other parts of this country, (the contagious nature of which is acknowledged by all, excepting a few perÅ¿ons that are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed for nothing but the Å¿ingularity of their opinions, and a pertinacious adherence to a tenet, which both by the illuÅ¿trations of reaÅ¿oning and the common Å¿enÅ¿e of their fellow citizens, has been declared abÅ¿urd and utenable.) I Å¿hall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Å¿tate Å¿uch evidence as has come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reÅ¿pecting the origin of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which is of the higheÅ¿t importance to the future intereÅ¿t and proÅ¿perity of this country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to Philadelphia in particular.</p>
            <p>Certain circumÅ¿tances having given riÅ¿e to a Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that the contagion which gave origin to the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was imported in the Å¿hip Deborah, which arrived at Philadelphia, from Jeremie, and anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near Race Å¿treet wharf, on the 18th of July.

            <p>It appears from facts collected by Dr. Daniel De Beneville, and communicated in writing to Dr. Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts, that the firÅ¿t perÅ¿on that had the yellow fever in KenÅ¿ington, (to which place the Deborah had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for the purpoÅ¿e of undergoing repairs on the 28th. of July), was a lad of the name of JoÅ¿eph Streeton, that had been on board of her while Å¿he lay in the cityâThis lad was taken Å¿ick on the 29th, of July and died the 3d of AuguÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>James Porter, apprentice to JoÅ¿eph Grice, Å¿hip carpenter, next door to Streeton's, was taken with the fever on the 1Å¿t. of AuguÅ¿t, and died on the twelfth.</p>
            <p>James AÅ¿hmore, an apprentice to Wm. Yard, Å¿hip carpenter, who had worked on board the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, while Å¿he lay in the city was attacked with the fever, on the 2d. of AuguÅ¿t, and died on the fifteenth.</p>
            <p>James Kerr, George Adams, and one Simons, all apprentices to Wm. Yard, worked on board the Deborah, and were all taken Å¿ick a few days after James AÅ¿hmore, and all recovered.</p>
            <p>Two labouring men, who worked on board the Deborah, were taken Å¿ick on the 3d. of AuguÅ¿t, one died, the other recovered. Samuel Baker, Dr. De Beneville, his wife and houÅ¿e keeper, who reÅ¿ided near the wharf where the Deborah lay, were all attacked with the fever, in the courÅ¿e of a week after her arrival at KenÅ¿ington; and before the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of AuguÅ¿t the whole neighbourhood was infected.</p>

That the Deborah was an infected veÅ¿Å¿el, appears evident, from the teÅ¿timony of her mate, Mr. John Lewis, the carpenter that was with her, during the whole voyage, the cook, Å¿everal Å¿eamen, and a paÅ¿Å¿enger of the name of DickiÅ¿onâall of whom agree, that Å¿he loÅ¿t Å¿even perÅ¿ons with a fever, on her paÅ¿Å¿age from Jeremie, to Philadelphia, and five of her crew, while in the port of Jeremie.âMr. Lewis the mate of the Deborah, informed me in preÅ¿ence of two witneÅ¿Å¿es that the Deborah had been employed as a tranÅ¿port for the BritiÅ¿h troops at St. Domingo, for Å¿ome time previous to her taking in her cargo, at Jeremie.</p>
            <p>Dr. WiÅ¿tar, was informed by the cooper; of the deaths on board, and the carpenter, John Bodin's depoÅ¿ition was taken by the mayor of Burlington.</p>
            <p>Captain Yard, himÅ¿elf Å¿ometime after his arrival in Philadelphia, in converÅ¿ation with a gentleman whoÅ¿e teÅ¿timony may be relied on, acknowledged that while the Deborah lay at Jeremie, a very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was prevalent there, which the natives called the Malad, de Siam, of which the captain, and the chief part of the crew of an EngliÅ¿h Å¿hip from Liverpool, died, and the reÅ¿t were Å¿o terrified that they deÅ¿erted the Å¿hip.</p>
            <p>When the Deborah arrived at the Health-Office near the fort, with about an hundred perÅ¿ons on board including paÅ¿Å¿engers,âtwo of the Å¿eamen who appeared to be in a convaleÅ¿cent Å¿tate, were taken to the Marine HoÅ¿pital, and a black woman.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e men Mr. Lewis Å¿ays, were in the city be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Å¿hip.</p>
            <p>AtchiÅ¿on ThompÅ¿on and Mr. Doyle, neighbours to Philips when he was alive, Å¿olemnly declare that Philips brought a man belonging to the Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah to his houÅ¿e, before the arrival of the Å¿hip.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Griffitts preÅ¿cribed for one of the crew of the Deborah at Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ips's while he lay ill who had taken lodgings there 24th of July.

The Å¿ize and martial appearance of the Deborah, (for Å¿he carried Å¿everal guns) led a number of young men and boys to viÅ¿it her; among, others, was a lad of the name of James Wright, and a young man belonging to Mr. Clemens. The former lived in Water above CheÅ¿nut Å¿treet, the latter in Third near Walnut Å¿treet, one of theÅ¿e was attacked the 30th, the other the 31Å¿t of July. The latter died on the 6th day from the attack, the former recovered.</p>
            <p>As the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e appeared about this time in different parts of the city, which had been uncommonly healthy all the preceding Å¿eaÅ¿on, it is probable that others Å¿uffered from the like inconÅ¿iderate curioÅ¿ity.</p>
            <p>From theÅ¿e as from a focus, it gradually diverged over the whole city.</p>
            <p>A Brig from Jamaica, with Coffee, Å¿ome of which was damaged, arrived at Mr. RoÅ¿s's wharf, in the neighbourhood where the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e made its firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t formidable aÅ¿Å¿ault, on the 29th of July, but as the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e had made Å¿ome progreÅ¿s before that date, there can be no room for Å¿uÅ¿pecting that to have given origin to it. BeÅ¿ides there are no facts in proof of a fever of a contagious kind ever having been produced either by damaged vegetables or by the exhalations from bilge water, as I have Å¿ufficiently Å¿hewn in my ObÅ¿ervations on the CauÅ¿e and Cure of Bilious Fevers, publiÅ¿hed laÅ¿t year.</p>
            <p>But that the contagion which gives riÅ¿e to Å¿uch a fever as the one under conÅ¿ideration, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in an active Å¿tate, in the clothing of theÅ¿e that have been Å¿ick or that have died of it, for Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral weeks if excluded from freÅ¿h air, is well known to thoÅ¿e converÅ¿ant with medical hiÅ¿tory.</p>
            <p>We are informed in the laÅ¿t edition of the works
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033589_0135_0FF79396E207AF68"/>
of the late learned Dr. Mead, that a Å¿ack of infected cotton imported into Bermudas in the year 1695. gave origin to a fever Å¿o malignant, that the living Å¿carcely Å¿ufficed to bury the dead. It is alÅ¿o record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the impriÅ¿oned Å¿eeds of a peÅ¿tilential fever, which depopulated MarÅ¿eilles in the year 1720, made their eÅ¿cape from a Å¿ailor's bundle, lately arrived from the Levant.</p>
            <p>The importation of the contagion which gave riÅ¿e to the plague in London in the year 1665, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t depopulated that city in the courÅ¿e of the Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumnal months, is a fact too notorious to expatiate upon. A Å¿imilar fever, which deÅ¿troyed 80,000 of the inhabitants of MoÅ¿cow and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent villages in 1771, was introduced by TurkiÅ¿h priÅ¿oners, as appears from the account of Mertins, one of the phyÅ¿icians appointed by the empreÅ¿s to attend the infected. This fever, like the one with which we have been viÅ¿ited, yielded to the power of froÅ¿t. We have the authority of the experienced Lind, that the yellow fever was introduced into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in the year 1741 by a trunk of infected cloathing received from Barbadoes; and of Dr. Lining, that every time it had appeared in CharleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it had been traced to Å¿ome perÅ¿on or veÅ¿Å¿el re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently arrived from the WeÅ¿t-Indies.</p>
            <p>The yellow fever which prevailed in New-Haven in the year 1794, was traced to imported contagion, as appears from the Å¿tatement of Dr. MonÅ¿on, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿hed in WebÅ¿ter's collection of papers on bilious fevers. For more examples of the Å¿ame kind, I refer to a book which I publiÅ¿hed laÅ¿t year, entitled, "ObÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the CauÅ¿es and Cure of Bilious Fevers."</p>
            <p>The introduction of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e into CheÅ¿ter, Marcus-Hook and Wilmington, Å¿oon after its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in Philadelphia, are additional proofs in Å¿upport of the opinion that the late fever was derived from imported contagion.</p>

A lad belonging to John Wood, a potter, who had Å¿lept two nights on board a Å¿hallop employed in trading to Philadelphia a Å¿hort time before he was taken ill, was the firÅ¿t that died of the yellow fever in CheÅ¿ter, and he died on the 31Å¿t day of July.âAnother lad that had Å¿lept on board the Å¿ame Å¿hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop with Mr. Wood's lad, was taken ill the Å¿ame day but recovered in the courÅ¿e of a week. The one that died had the black vomit, and his corpÅ¿e became very yellow.</p>
            <p>Seven days after the deceaÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lad, his mother and brother were both attacked with fever, and the brother was buried 11 days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>William Siddons, jun. who had Å¿et up with the firÅ¿t mentioned lads during their illneÅ¿s, was taken with the fever on the firÅ¿t of AuguÅ¿t, and died the 8th. Charles Warrick, who had alÅ¿o viÅ¿ited them, was attacked with fever the 4th of AuguÅ¿t and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 9th. Abby Engle, who lived next door to Siddons, died the 16th of AuguÅ¿t. JeÅ¿Å¿e Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at whoÅ¿e houÅ¿e Abby Engle died, was attacked a few days after her deceaÅ¿e, on board his Å¿hallop at the Fort, and died on the 28th of AuguÅ¿t. After the firÅ¿t of September, the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿pread into every part of that village, which contained but about 50 families, and before it ceaÅ¿ed, deÅ¿troyed 50 perÅ¿ons, Å¿everal of whom were of the firÅ¿t note in the place; though it was gradually deÅ¿erted by all, excepting Å¿ix or Å¿even families. Of all that were Å¿ick at CheÅ¿ter, there were not more than five or Å¿ix that recovered.</p>
            <p>The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e appears to have been introduced into Marcus-Hook by infected perÅ¿ons from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The firÅ¿t death was on the 10th of AuguÅ¿t.âFrom the liÅ¿t kept by R. Riley, <abbr>eÅ¿q.</abbr> it appears that the funerals at Marcus-Hook were 21 adults and 6 children, inhabitants; and 24 Å¿trangersâTotalâ52.</p>

                  <head>Extract of a Letter from Dr. Sayres, dated Marcus Hook, November, 24, 1798.</head>
                  <p>THE firÅ¿t caÅ¿e of yellow fever, that came under my notice in Marcus Hook, was on AuguÅ¿t 2d. 1798. This was a Å¿hallop man, who came from Philadelphia, four days previous to the attack of the Feverâhe died, the 6th. day of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, with the higheÅ¿t Å¿ymptoms of putreÅ¿cency. The next five caÅ¿es of diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, were perÅ¿ons, who were but a few days from Philadelphia, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from two to eight days. The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, appeared to increaÅ¿e conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in this place, and in CheÅ¿ter, by the 20th. of AuguÅ¿t; The Å¿ymptoms on the firÅ¿t attack, were more Å¿trongly markedâand the proportionate number of deaths, were much increaÅ¿ed by the firÅ¿t of September. The number of caÅ¿es which came under my notice from the Å¿econd day of AuguÅ¿t, until the 26th. of October, was eighty twoâFifty-Å¿even of theÅ¿e, died.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of thoÅ¿e, who were lately from Philadelphia, died between the Å¿econd and the Å¿ixth day after their attack. The inhabitants of this place and CheÅ¿ter, who had the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, and had not been in Philadelphia, recovered in greater proportion.</p>
                  <p>The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e appeared, in a number of caÅ¿es, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently communicated by contagionâin Å¿ome caÅ¿es from the Å¿ickâand Å¿everal caÅ¿es from the bed linen, &amp;c.âThough in a conÅ¿iderable number of caÅ¿es, which Å¿peedily terminated fatally, I was not able to trace the Å¿malleÅ¿t veÅ¿tige of contagion, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouÅ¿ly applied, or received.</p>
                  <p>Free and copious bleeding was made uÅ¿e of in the firÅ¿t Å¿tage with evident advantage in moÅ¿t caÅ¿es. We bled in very few inÅ¿tances, with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, after forty eight hours from the attack of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="unknown:033589_0138_0FF77DF1F149EF68"/>
The greateÅ¿t number of Å¿ucceÅ¿sful caÅ¿es, were, where free bleeding was inÅ¿tantly uÅ¿ed, before the fever had continued many hours; and immediately followed by a free uÅ¿e of calomel, &amp;c. Å¿o as to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate very freely and copiouÅ¿ly upon the alimentary canal, and free Å¿weating afterwards. In general, our caÅ¿es terminated unfortunately, except we found Å¿alutary Å¿ymptoms appear in Å¿ixty hours from the attack.</p>
                  <p>BliÅ¿ters were uÅ¿ed freely, after Å¿ymptoms of high debility took placeâand in Å¿ome caÅ¿es with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t advantage. In no inÅ¿tance that I Å¿aw, was bleeding Å¿ucceÅ¿sful, after two days and an halfâbut when uÅ¿ed in a few of Å¿uch caÅ¿es, it appeared evidently to Å¿ink the patient and to haÅ¿ten his death.</p>
                  <p>We uÅ¿ed bark, wine, and a number of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Å¿timulants, on the firÅ¿t appearance of debility taking place; but with little Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p>Finding the common round, of medicine, prove Å¿o ineffectual in the advanced Å¿tage of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, I determined to uÅ¿e a different mode of treatmentâin three caÅ¿es of adults, two of which had the black vomiting on them, and the third, was in a gore of putrid blood from the mouth and noÅ¿e. I forbid medicine, and directed very cold water and brandy mixed Å¿trong, to be given freely as poÅ¿Å¿ible:âIt had the happy effect of checking the puking in the two caÅ¿es, when the Å¿tomach had rejected every kind of mild drink, &amp;c. and by continuing that practice, almoÅ¿t Å¿o as to produce high intoxication, for two or three days, thoÅ¿e two caÅ¿es, were recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoÅ¿t from a Å¿tate of death. The third caÅ¿e, was much benefited apparently for three daysâbut, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a high putreÅ¿cent Å¿tate when I went firÅ¿t to Å¿ee him, and having loÅ¿t a very conÅ¿iderable quantity of blood from the mouth, noÅ¿e, &amp;c. his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="138" facs="unknown:033589_0139_0FF793A0BA3BD258"/>
There was a number of Å¿eamen died here, with the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, though from no Å¿ingle veÅ¿Å¿el, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ganges) more than two or three.</p>
                  <p>"We were Å¿eldom able to produce ptyaliÅ¿m, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e terminated fatally. In every caÅ¿e where mercury affected the Å¿alivary glands at an early period of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, the patient recoveredâand I obÅ¿erved that immediately after the Å¿pitting took place, every favourable Å¿ymptom of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health began to appear."</p>

                  <p>THE firÅ¿t caÅ¿e of yellow fever which happened in Wilmington, this Å¿eaÅ¿on, was in the perÅ¿on of one of the inhabitants of the borough, who caught it in Philadelphia about the 1Å¿t of AuguÅ¿t, Å¿ickened on the road home, and died Å¿oon after. The contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not communicated from this caÅ¿e. The Philadelphians flocked in upon us immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. I viÅ¿ited a young man from Philadelphia, in the fever, on the 10th of the Å¿ame month. This man was among the firÅ¿t, if not the very firÅ¿t, that was Å¿ent to our newly inÅ¿tituted HoÅ¿pital. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver became epidemic between the 15th and 20th.âIt commenced with perÅ¿ons immediately from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, as well inhabitants of the borough, as of the city. Shallop-men and others, who paÅ¿Å¿ed from one place to the other, by water, were the firÅ¿t victims. From theÅ¿e it extended rapidly to the inhabitants of fixed reÅ¿idence. A Å¿hip manned chiefly by French royaliÅ¿ts, that entered our port after the Å¿ickneÅ¿s had
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033589_0140_0FF793A252185EB8"/>
commenced, was alÅ¿o Å¿uÅ¿pected of contributing to the evil; but of this I have no evidence. From all the information that came to my knowledge, every phyÅ¿ician of this place, and all others of correct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation agree, that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was imported to us from Philadelphia, by infected goods and furniture, as well as infected perÅ¿ons. We Å¿uppoÅ¿e the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e to be propagated by contagion, from infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, cloathing, veÅ¿Å¿els, houÅ¿es, &amp;c. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, however, that Å¿tronger exhalations ariÅ¿e from perÅ¿ons affected by this fever, than in other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diÅ¿eaÅ¿es; and we have reaÅ¿on to believe that many were affected by the contagion, at a diÅ¿tance from the Å¿ick reaching quite acroÅ¿s our Å¿treets. No inÅ¿tance of thoÅ¿e who Å¿led to the country communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to others, has come to my knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vicinity of Wilmington. It is Å¿aid that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances of this Å¿ort have happened at Marcus-Hook and other places; but for theÅ¿e I cannot vouch.</p>
                  <p>In another letter I Å¿hall be ambitious to make Å¿ome compenÅ¿ation for your former valuable favour to me, by a few obÅ¿ervations, particularly on the cholera infantum, that may not be unacceptable to you: for you will admit, that the Delaware phyÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ought to be of authority in bilious diÅ¿orders.</p>

            <p>Dr. Monro's letter of the 19th November, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms Dr. Tilton's account of the time <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> manner of the introduction of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e into Wilmington, and of its being afterwards communicated by the inhabitants of fixed reÅ¿idence, from one to another.</p>

"A man who had been to the city to rent a houÅ¿e in that part of the city where the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ioned the firÅ¿t alarm, and had been on board an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected veÅ¿Å¿el, was taken Å¿ick on his return to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington, and died Å¿oon after his arrival there, with Å¿ymptoms of confirmed yellow fever."</p>
            <p>"One half of all the Å¿ick that were Å¿ent to the tents died." This Dr. Monro aÅ¿cribes to the abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute interdection of the uÅ¿e of mercury there. In his own-practice, no perÅ¿on died after Å¿alivation came on, nor did he know of an inÅ¿tance, under the care of any other phyÅ¿ician in that place.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was not conÅ¿tantly the caÅ¿e in Philadelphia.</note> "The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was Å¿enÅ¿ibly checked Å¿oon after the cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which occurred the latter end of September; revived with the returning warm weather, but was entirely extinguiÅ¿hed by the 3rd of November."</p>
            <p>It is now known that a lad of the name of Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, was attacked with the yellow fever the 26th of July, on board the Å¿chooner John, from BoÅ¿ton, which lay at RoÅ¿s and SimpÅ¿on's wharf, a little way below Walnut-Å¿treet. Mr. Lloyd and his clerk had been on board of her a few days before their attack; and a woman and two of the hands died (according to the report of the maÅ¿ter to Dr. DorÅ¿ey) on her outward paÅ¿Å¿age.</p>
            <p>An unanÅ¿werable argument that the fever did not originate from domeÅ¿tic cauÅ¿es, is afforded by the exemption of Baltimore, Georgetown, Alexandria, Norfolk, Wilmington, (N. C.) CharleÅ¿ton, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah.</p>
            <p>The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e this year prevailed, and was attended with a degree of mortality unexampled in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (conÅ¿idering the comparative Å¿mallneÅ¿s of the number that remained within the Å¿phere of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion)
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033589_0142_0FF793A69F9363A8"/>
in all the commercial towns north of Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore; whereas all the commercial towns south of Baltimore have eÅ¿caped, PeterÅ¿burg excepted, and the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was introduced into PeterÅ¿burg by the Å¿hip NeÅ¿tor from Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Is it poÅ¿Å¿ible to believe, that the late fever, (which is conÅ¿idered by the advocates for its domeÅ¿tic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to be only a higher grade of the common bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever which appears in low marÅ¿hy countries every Å¿ummer and autumn) could originate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come epidemic on the high, dry and Å¿andy banks of KenÅ¿ington? in the paved, clean and open Å¿treets of Philadelphia, where every wind that blows has a free courÅ¿e? on the high and gravelly hills of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington? on the elevated Å¿hores of York, waÅ¿hed on either Å¿ide by Ocean's briny waves? and not make its appearance on the flats of Baltimore, or the putrid fens of CharleÅ¿ton and Savannah, where bile flows in inceÅ¿Å¿ant Å¿treams; and where the debilitated inhabitants faint under the inÅ¿ufferable blaze of a vertical Å¿un?</p>
            <p>If the united opinion of a number of men of the firÅ¿t abilities and moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive profeÅ¿Å¿ional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be of authority on the preÅ¿ent intereÅ¿ting queÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of the College of PhyÅ¿icians, preÅ¿ented laÅ¿t year to the LegiÅ¿lature, ought to be admitted: the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of which follows. The College is in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿till Å¿tronger facts and documents in Å¿upport of their opinion this year.</p>
            <p>"The College is of opinion, that the yellow fever is derived from imported contagion. For this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they aÅ¿Å¿ign the following among other reaÅ¿ons: "The diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in queÅ¿tion is eÅ¿Å¿entially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate from domeÅ¿tic cauÅ¿es. It alÅ¿o differs eÅ¿Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from them in the circumÅ¿tance of being conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; a bilious fever originating from domeÅ¿tic
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033589_0143_0FF793AAAE2AF840"/>
cauÅ¿es having never been to our knowledge contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this climate."</p>
            <p>And that the yellow fever, which has committed Å¿uch deplorable ravages in different commercial ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theÅ¿e Å¿tates, Å¿ince the year 1793, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the exhalations of putrid vegetable Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances, which occaÅ¿ion intermitting, remitting, or bilious fevers, but was of peÅ¿tilential origin, is fully eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by the facts publiÅ¿hed in the year 1795, by Dr. ChiÅ¿holm, Å¿urgeon-general to the Ordinance in the WeÅ¿t-India IÅ¿lands, to which valuable publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the reader is referred.</p>

PRESUMING that the public mind will no longer be held in Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿e reÅ¿pecting the origin of the fatal malady by which the fair proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, of this, and other commercial cities, in this country, have been repeatedly blaÅ¿ted; I truÅ¿t the legiÅ¿lature, the enlightened guardians of the public welfare, will proceed, without delay, to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h more effectual rules, than thoÅ¿e, at preÅ¿ent exiÅ¿ting, to prevent the future return of the awful calamity.</p>
            <p>SupineneÅ¿s or an ill judged parÅ¿imony on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent intereÅ¿ting occaÅ¿ion, would force commerce to deÅ¿ert our coaÅ¿ts, and involve the inhabitants of our cities, in abÅ¿olute ruin, which would Å¿oon be followed by that of agriculture, for the exiÅ¿tence of the one, is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to that of the other.</p>
            <p>It has lately been propoÅ¿ed by a reÅ¿pectable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the inhabitants of this city, to petition either for an intire interdiction of the WeÅ¿t India trade, during the Å¿ummer, and autumnal months, or, (if that Å¿hould be thought too great a Å¿acrifice), for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of Å¿uch quarantine rules, as Å¿hall effectually preclude the introduction of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>To effect this deÅ¿irable purpoÅ¿e, I beg leave to recommend the rules publiÅ¿hed in the Gazette of the United States, of the 21Å¿t of September, Å¿igned, <hi>Mentor;</hi> and to prevent it from Å¿preading when introduced, I believe the rules with the Å¿ame Å¿ignature publiÅ¿hed in the Gaz. of the U. S. of Septr. 25th or 26th, if Å¿trictly complied with, will
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033589_0145_0FF793AE1DAD9478"/>
always be found effectual. Similar rules were put in practice with the moÅ¿t happy effects, the preÅ¿ent year, not only in the PennÅ¿ylvania HoÅ¿pital, by Mr. Samuel Coats, who reÅ¿ided there, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the fever, and in the Alms-HouÅ¿e, by Mr. Cummins, and Dr. James, where the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ioners and orphans were numerous, but in the priÅ¿on for convicts, under the direction of the American Howard, who took his reÅ¿idence in that dreary and dangerous abode, about the 20th. of September, at which time the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e had made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable havoc among thoÅ¿e wretched votaries of rapine and diÅ¿order.</p>
            <p>The number of male convicts confined in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on at that time was about 140; The females were leÅ¿s numerous.</p>
            <p>The vagrants and untried criminals had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>The males and females were confined in Å¿eparate, and diÅ¿tant wings of the priÅ¿on.</p>
            <p>Eighteen of the male criminls, on account of their late inÅ¿urrection, were confined in dungeons; the remainder occupied different apartments on the Å¿ame floor.</p>
            <p>Several of the men were ill of the fever at that time. The women were all in health, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that condition during the whole time that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e prevailed in the city.</p>
            <p>A ward in the EaÅ¿t wing was immediately appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for the reception of the Å¿ick, who were Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Å¿ound, and every neceÅ¿Å¿ary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation provided for them. TheÅ¿e were attended by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. A Å¿eparate apartment was provided for the convaleÅ¿cents. More nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aliment than they had been accuÅ¿tomed to, (for they had been allowed for many days only Å¿ufficient food to prevent them from famiÅ¿hing) with a
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:033589_0146_0FF793B36E8437E8"/>
Å¿mall allowance of claret, was diÅ¿tributed among thoÅ¿e that had hitherto eÅ¿caped the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, but every kind of exceÅ¿s and irregularity diÅ¿countenanced and prohibited.</p>
            <p>A quantity of green wood was removed from the yard, as well as cart loads of dirt, litter and every putrifiable material that could be diÅ¿covered; the obÅ¿tructed channel opened for the paÅ¿Å¿age of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the pavement kept continually wet and cool, by means of the pump; the vegetables along the wall cheriÅ¿hed; the occupation of Å¿tone-Å¿awing carried on; cleanlineÅ¿s was Å¿trictly obÅ¿erved; every Ward conÅ¿tantly ventilated, and the avoiding all intercourÅ¿e (this laÅ¿t by the direction of the phyÅ¿ician) earneÅ¿tly enjoined. By theÅ¿e means the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e was arreÅ¿ted in its progreÅ¿s, and in the courÅ¿e of three weeks was entirely eradicated.</p>
            <p>Let others profit by this example, and merit the benediction of an approving conÅ¿cience, Å¿weeter than the plaudits of an admiring world.</p>
