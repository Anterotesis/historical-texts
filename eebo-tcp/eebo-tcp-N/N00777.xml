            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is not without ſome Concern upon our Minds, that in the late Writings of our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Bretheren in <hi>England,</hi> we find awful Complaints, about <q>
                  <hi>Bold</hi>
                  <hi>Intruders</hi> into the Work of the Miniſtry, &amp; the ſwarming of that <hi>Vermine,</hi> with an hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Noiſe, not in <hi>Corners</hi> and <hi>Chambers,</hi> but in the very <hi>Pulpits</hi>; likely to prove an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> plague;</q>
upon which they add,
<q>If theſe Illiterate Uſurpers are not ſpeedily and effectually diſcountenanced by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People too, they who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the <hi>Blemiſh</hi> of <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the total Ruine of it.</q>
But it ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us more than a little, to hear of their care that the Confuſions thus complained, may be prevented, by a <hi>Vote</hi> of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000935_0003_0FAD922C97225D00"/>
That they would Employ none to <hi>Preach</hi> in any of their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> but ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arrived unto them with credible <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,</hi> or ſubmitted themſelves unto a ſolemn <hi>Trial</hi> of their Qualifications for the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Miniſtry. Our <hi>Congregational</hi> Bretheren in <hi>England,</hi> being alarumed with a clamour of the Dangers hence ariſing to the Intereſts of our Holy Religion, we do with a like ſatisfaction find, they have lately publiſhed a Declaration, wherein, ſignifying,
<q>That inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they count none meet to diſpenſe the Oracles of God unto others, who are not themſelves Qualified for Communion in all Ordinances, their joining themſelves to a <hi>particular Church</hi> of Chriſt, would be a good Expedient to prevent <hi>Ignorant and Raſh Intruders into the Miniſtry</hi>; ſeeing then, it would be the Duty of <hi>Particular Churches</hi> and their Officers, to take ſpecial care, that none of their Communion, who are not <hi>Qualified,</hi> may enter on that Work; they thereupon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

of Faith, or <hi>Scandalous</hi> in their Lives and Converſations, or otherwiſe <hi>Unmeet for this Holy Employment,</hi> Leſt they bring the <hi>Guilt of theſe mens Sins on their own Souls.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In Conformity to this <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> of our <hi>United Brethren,</hi> we cannot but in the moſt publick manner, call upon our Churches, that they beware of all undue <hi>Precipitancy,</hi> in their Admitting <hi>Unqualified perſons,</hi> to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and Employed, in the Character of <hi>Preachers</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>We have indeed often wiſhed, That the Young men brought up in our own <hi>Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> might appear with <hi>Testimonials,</hi> under the Hands of the <hi>Praeſident</hi> and <hi>Fellows,</hi> That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Trial,</hi> they are found <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Pious,</hi> and likely to be <hi>Bleſſings</hi> unto the <hi>Churches</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Churches</hi> venture too far in ſetting of them up for <hi>Preachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But inaſmuch as there have ſometimes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived among us, <hi>Deceitful Strangers,</hi> who have ſet up themſelves for <hi>Preachers,</hi> and many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary people have diſcovered much ſinful Folly, in ſuffering themſelves to be <hi>ſtrangely Deceived</hi> by thoſe <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> it obliges us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a further point of <hi>Paſtoral Vigilance</hi> over the <hi>Churches,</hi> whereof we are made the <hi>Overſeers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis well known, That Worthy <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Goſpel, Retiring to <hi>New-England,</hi> from other Countreys, have all along met
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000935_0005_0FAD922FA2CA6AF8"/>
with Reſpects from our Churches, <hi>Equal</hi> (to ſay no more) unto what they have ſhown unto any of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> bred among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Heaven is witneſs, to the Injuſtice of the Slander by ſome uttered againſt us, <hi>That we have been ever uncivil to Strangers</hi>; and the <hi>Strangers</hi> themſelves have been Witneſſes, that no where under Heaven could they expect more <hi>Civility,</hi> than that wherewith we have ever treated them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, we have, upon ſufficient Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions Reſolved,
<q>That for the future, no <hi>Stranger</hi> coming as a <hi>Preacher</hi> among us, without ſufficient Aſſurances of his being what he pretends to be, ſhall be Employ'd in our <hi>Pulpits,</hi> without a ſolemn Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Capacities,</hi> for the Tremendous Work, of Preaching the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of God.</hi>
               </q>
And we earneſtly Requeſt, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the ſeveral Aſſociations and Vicinities throughout the Country, to joyn with us, in ſuch a neceſſary Reſolution.</p>
            <p>We do alſo Solemnly Adviſe, all our People, to beware of Running after <hi>New Preachers,</hi> of whoſe Endowments and Principles, they have not had a Reaſonable Atteſtation; leſt they unawares run themſelves into ſhameful and woful Reflections. The Apoſtolical Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>To prove all Things,</hi> does not invite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable

people, to <hi>Run after all Preachers,</hi> (as they too often pervert the ſence of it,) but it only directs people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Examine</hi> by the Word of God, the Doctrine, which they hear, from thoſe that in an orderly way are to be heard as their <hi>Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> being that Grand Inſtitution, whereon depends the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Salvation of men, Satan ſeeks it as a mighty Triumph, to pervert it unto their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Deſtruction. And a people, that <hi>having Itching Ears, do after their own Luſts heap up Teachers to themſelves,</hi> do miſerably render themſelves, obnoxious unto the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thoſe <hi>New Preachers,</hi> that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them unto <hi>damnable Hereſies.</hi> Or, ſuppoſe the <hi>New Preachers,</hi> do broach no <hi>New Errors,</hi> yet if they ſhall prove <hi>Cheats,</hi> that have made the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel</hi> only a <hi>Cloak,</hi> for their <hi>Covetous,</hi> or <hi>Laſcivious,</hi> or other profane Deſigns, they that ſhall have <hi>too ſuddenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> thoſe men, will be <hi>partakers of their Sins.</hi> And the Glorious Ordinances of God will be likely to fall into a loathſome <hi>Contempt</hi> among the people, if Contemptible Fellows can Eaſily proſtitute them unto their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sermons,</hi> wherein the <hi>Everlasting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> is <hi>Preached,</hi> as well as the <hi>Prayers</hi> made in our Congregations; are to be Conſidered, as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000935_0007_0FAD9233C7E11318"/>
a principal part of the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> among the People of God: they are to Glorify God, &amp; our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with agreeable <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Truths</hi> He ha's Revealed unto us; &amp;, as in the <hi>Peace Offering</hi> of old, <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>His</hi> part in them, as well as the People <hi>theirs.</hi> Hence, whether the people that are the Hearers, be many or few, learned or weak, froward or meek, the <hi>Preacher</hi> muſt prepare an <hi>Offering,</hi> as far as he can, Suitable for that God, who is a <hi>Great King and whoſe Name is Dreadful.</hi> But if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very piece of Ignorance, and Arrogance, be ſet up for a <hi>Preacher,</hi> the Name of the Holy God, will be profaned, with an <hi>Offering,</hi> that is made a <hi>Ridicule</hi> in the <hi>Repetition.</hi>

            <p>We are not unſenſible, that one thing, which ha's much Expoſed ſome <hi>Injudicious people</hi> among us, is, An opinion that <hi>Illiterate Men,</hi> may be Serviceable and Admirable <hi>Preachers.</hi> Now, inaſmuch as the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> have given this among their Inſtructions to their Emiſſaries, <hi>To teach that Learning is needleſs in a Miniſter, and if they underſtand the Goſpel, it is Sufficient,</hi> we are ſorry that any of our people ſhould be ſo <hi>Beſotted,</hi> not to ſay, <hi>Bejeſuited.</hi> When the Knowledge of the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts</hi> Revived, <hi>Religion</hi> had a Revival with it: And though ſome <hi>Unlearned</hi> men have been uſeful to the Intereſts of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet no man ever decried <hi>Learning,</hi> but what was, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

to <hi>Religion,</hi> whether he knew it or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When our Lord, choſe <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> to be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> (which often is impertinently pleaded) He would not ſend them forth, until they had been a conſiderable while under His <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,</hi> (a better than the beſt in any <hi>Colledge</hi> under Heaven!) and <hi>then</hi> alſo He Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly Furniſhed 'em with more <hi>Learning,</hi> than any of us, by <hi>ſeven Years Hard Study</hi> can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto. If God, ſhould be provoked by the <hi>Unthankfulneſs</hi> of men, to ſend the Plague of an <hi>Unlearned Miniſtry</hi> upon poor <hi>New-England,</hi> ſoon will the <hi>Wild-Beaſts of the Deſart<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly there, the Houſes will be full of doleful Creatures, and Owles will dwell there.</hi> Ordinarily, that man, who undertakes the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Goſpel, without ſome <hi>Education</hi> for it, is, we doubt, in as preſumptuous an Error, as the unhappy <hi>Uzzah,</hi> that periſhed in his <hi>Error</hi>: though we alſo allow different <hi>meaſures,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> for that <hi>Education.</hi> And that man was never worthy to <hi>Preach</hi> one <hi>Sermon,</hi> who did not feel, and would not own, that all the <hi>Learning</hi> that can be had, is little enough to accompliſh an <hi>Able Miniſter of the New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, As <hi>Luther</hi> obſerved, That God puniſhed the Primitive Churches, with <hi>Falſe Teachers,</hi> for their ſtarving, and ſleighting of their <hi>Faithful Miniſters</hi>; Thus, we fear the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> may
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000935_0009_0FAD92A3066CF178"/>
ſuffer miſchiefs in Time to come from <hi>Falſe Teachers</hi>; and we ſee cauſe to Admire the Compaſſion of Heaven unto this Land, that ſuch Dangerous Things have all this Time done ſo little Damage, unto any of our Churches. But as the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> having been warned by the Apoſtle, <hi>That grievous Wolves would enter in among them,</hi> was afterwards commended by our Saviour, for ſo taking the warning, that <hi>they Tried them who ſaid, they were Apoſtles when they were not ſo, and found them liars</hi>: Even ſo, we would hope, that after this Day, no <hi>Untried perſons</hi> will be Entertained for <hi>Preachers,</hi> in any of our Colonies.</p>
            <p>We lay this Advice before our Churches, purpoſing to do our part, in attending to it.</p>

            <head>An HISTORY, Of Some IMPOSTORS, Remarkably and Seaſonably detected, in the Churches of <hi>New England;</hi> Written to maintain the Advice Publiſhed by ſome of the Pastors in thoſe Churches relating to <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> and prevent all future Miſchiefs from them.</head>
            <p>IT was a notable Diſcipline, by which the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> preſerved themſelves, from the Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Miſchiefs, ariſing by the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Unworthy Preachers:</hi> Their National <hi>Synods</hi> every Time they Sat, would publiſh a <hi>Roll</hi> of thoſe <hi>Unworthy Preachers,</hi> that could be found creeping in among them, and with a deſcription of their Feature, and Stature, and other circumſtances, like what uſes to be given in an <hi>Hue in Cry,</hi> this <hi>Roll</hi> would notify the Crimes laid unto their charge, and admoniſh all People to beware of Entertaining them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000935_0011_0FAD92A575014660"/>The Churches of <hi>New England,</hi> have <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore</hi> been in ſuch <hi>Good Order,</hi> that no man could be Ordained and Received as a <hi>Paſtor</hi> in them, without the Concurrence of the Churches in the Vicinity, and a very ſolemn and publick Action. But a <hi>Good Order</hi> ha's never yet been provided among us, that no Untryed, and Unfit perſon, ſhall ſet up for a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and run about from Town to Town, getting into the too much <hi>unguarded Pulpits,</hi> and threatning our Holy Religion, with no little <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> Now to prevent and redreſs, this <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> it ha's been by ſome Conſiderate perſons deſired, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the <hi>French Roll</hi> may be Exhibited unto the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> which may Exemplify ſome few of the many <hi>Cheats,</hi> that have gone to Impoſe upon them. It is unreaſonable to complain, That the <hi>Crimes</hi> of thoſe Cheats are thus <hi>openly</hi> Expoſed; for, I beſeech you, Sirs, are they not as <hi>openly</hi> Committed? Men are too inſenſible, of the horrible <hi>Villany</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> in the <hi>Crimes</hi> of thoſe Fellows, who ſet up for <hi>Teachers</hi> to the people of God, when God knows they are wicked <hi>Vagrants</hi> and <hi>Varlets,</hi> deſigning to abuſe the Honeſt people; if they imagine it, a <hi>ſevere</hi> Thing, to ſtigmatize them, in the view of all the affronted Churches. The Faults of the <hi>Paenitent,</hi> indeed ſhould be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000935_0012_0FAD92A622371FF0"/>
but theſe pretended <hi>Preachers</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> are not known to <hi>practiſe</hi> the <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> which they <hi>Preach</hi> A <hi>Pillory</hi> were a very gentle puniſhment for the Wretches, who wholly unqualifyed <hi>Steal</hi> into a <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and <hi>Forge</hi> a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto His Churches. Our <hi>Laws</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſuch a puniſhment for them, they that would be faithful to the Churches, will do well (for did not the Apoſtle as much to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menaeus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander</hi>?) to ſet them up in an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Pillory,</hi> with a <hi>Writing,</hi> as it were in <hi>Capitals,</hi> to ſignifie, THESE WERE IMPOSTORS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED MINISTERS.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence and Advantage of this Action, 'tis hoped, will be, That both <hi>Paſtors</hi> &amp; <hi>People,</hi> will be more wary of being too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in asking to <hi>Preach</hi> for them, thoſe to whom they are utter <hi>Strangers: That</hi> needy and profane <hi>Strangers,</hi> will no more venture to <hi>Preach</hi> in a Country, where their detected Wickedneſs will be proclaimed for the <hi>Terror</hi> of all that ſhall come after them: <hi>That</hi> all pious minds will give glory to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who <hi>Walks in the midſt of His Churches,</hi> when they ſee what <hi>Quick Work,</hi> He has ordinarily made in theſe Churches, to diſcover thoſe <hi>Atheiſtical Preachers,</hi> that have ſo horribly mocked Him: and admire
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000935_0013_0FAD92A6DB981258"/>
His Gracious and Watchful <hi>Providence,</hi> in ſtill delivering His Churches, from thoſe <hi>Little Foxes,</hi> that would have ſpoiled them. And now, we will Addreſs our ſelves to do that, which when 'tis done, what will they merit but the Cardinals Bleſſing, who will take no warning?</p>
            <p n="1">§ 1. THE very <hi>Firſt Minister</hi> (one <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) that ever came into <hi>New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> (which was in the Year, 1624.) at his firſt coming did Careſs the good people at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with ſuch extream ſhows of Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and Humility, that the people were mightily taken with him, nevertheleſs within a little while, he uſed moſt malignant Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make <hi>Factions</hi> among them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> Order. At laſt there fell into the Hands of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, his <hi>Letters</hi> home to <hi>England,</hi> fill'd with wicked and lying Accuſations againſt the people, of which things being ſhamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, he did publickly in the Church confeſs with Tears, <hi>That he had ſlanderouſly abuſed the good people, and that God might juſtly lay inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood unto his Charge, for he knew not what hurt might have come through his Writings, and that Pride, Vain glory, and ſelf love had been the cauſes of his miſcarriages.</hi> Theſe things he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſo pathetically, that they again permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000935_0014_0FAD92A79E4A3DF0"/>
him to Preach among them: And yet in two or three months be ſo notoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his miſcarriages, which he had thus bewailed, that his own Wife, thro' the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her mind at his Hypocriſy, could not forbear declaring her Fears, that God would bring ſome heavy Judgment upon their Family, not only for theſe, but ſome former Impieties by him committed, eſpecially in fearful Breaches of the <hi>Seventh Commandment,</hi> which he had with an Oath deny'd, though they were afterwards Evinced. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Baniſhed, he went unto <hi>Virginia,</hi> where he ſoon ended his Dayes.</p>
            <p>The Diſaſter thus befalling of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the <hi>Firſt Miniſter,</hi> that ever came into it, ſeems to have been an Intimation from Heaven unto the Country, to beware in all after times, how they ſuffered <hi>Cheats</hi> in the Evangelical <hi>Ministry</hi> to be Impoſed upon them. Nevertheleſs, there have Crept in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Cheats,</hi> among the Churches, which have been ſpeedily, and notably Detected. It will be neither Needful, nor Uſeful, that they ſhould be <hi>all</hi> Enumerated: <hi>Some</hi> of them ſhall.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. MAny among us, do ſtill Remember, a Fellow that made himſelf Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, by Preaching Zelouſly on that Text, <hi>Let him that Stole, Steal no more</hi>; when he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000935_0015_0FAD92A85752AC30"/>
had at that very Time a parcel of <hi>Stolen</hi> Money in his Pocket. The Sum, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, was <hi>Five Pounds,</hi> but in the dozed Conſcience of the Thief, hardly made the weight of a <hi>Scruple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. I Have been informed, That a certain Gentleman in the Southern parts of this I and, having with much pains, taught an <hi>Iriſh Servant</hi> in his Family, to be <hi>almoſt</hi> able to read <hi>Engliſh</hi>; this fellow, after his Time was out, ſet up for a <hi>Preacher</hi> in a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plantation: But the Gentleman his Maſter, happening ſome Time after to meet our Preaching <hi>Teague,</hi> Severely Chid him, for his preſumpteous Arrogance, and among other Expreſſions, beſtowed this pretty <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Scourge upon him; <hi>If ſuch Fellows as thou art, may ſet up for Preachers, there will be one Text impoſſible ever to be Preached upon, or to be fulfilled or underſtood: The Almighty in one Text, threatens as a Judgment,</hi> A Famine of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of the Lord; <hi>But if ſuch Varlets as thou art, may be Preachers, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſuch a Judgment ſhould ever be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted</hi>!</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. MAny of thoſe perſons, who have gone to Inſinuate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Churches, with <hi>Spirits</hi> in them, that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000935_0016_0FAD92A931C5CE58"/>
were for their Coveteous, or Contentious, or Ambitious, or otherwiſe Evil Inclinations, diſpleaſing to the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> have been immediately and remarkably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, by their being left unto the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Folly of Preaching <hi>Stollen Sermons.</hi> The detected <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> have gone off, <hi>as a Thief is Aſhamed when he is found.</hi> One happy Hindrance to the Deſigns of the <hi>Fiery Serpent</hi> have been this <hi>way</hi> afforded among us.</p>
            <p>Others <hi>Remember</hi> Inſtances; I ſhall not <hi>mention</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5 A Young Fellow, (one <hi>Dick Swayn</hi>) that had been Servant unto a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Ship in <hi>Boſton,</hi> after a thouſand Rogueries, had his Time given him, by the Widow of the Captain, when ſhe became ſo, becauſe that ſhe would not be troubled with ſo Theviſh, Lying and Wicked a Villian. This Fellow was afterwards detected in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, enough to fill a Volumn, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his going in miſerable circumſtances to <hi>Virginia</hi>; from whence he got through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stages, at length unto the Iſland of <hi>Providence</hi>! There the Monſter ſet up for a Preacher of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and putting on a Mighty ſhow of Religion, he was Mightily followed and admired; and the people treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a more than ordinary Liberality. Percieving that it was Time to be gone from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000935_0017_0FAD92A9D2150B28"/>
thence, he forged Letters of his Fathers Death in <hi>England,</hi> by which a vaſt Eſtate was fallen to him; under the umbrage of that Forgery, he gets off immediately by a Veſſel, that muſt firſt carry him to <hi>New England.</hi> Having Preached ſeveral Sermons in the Southern parts of <hi>New England,</hi> he comes to <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the year 1698. Where in private Houſes, he would be ridiculouſly forward in thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf upon <hi>Prayer,</hi> which he would manage with a Noiſe, that might reach all the Neighbourhood. He began to Court Opportunities of <hi>Preaching</hi> among the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but forgetting to change his Name, the Gentlewoman to whoſe Deceaſed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band he had been a Servant, accidentally coming in to the Houſe is here he lodged, and hearing one of that Name exceedingly cryed up, as a worthy, able, eminent man, ask'd for a ſight of him. When to her Aſtoniſhment ſhe found it was <hi>Dick,</hi> even that very Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <hi>Dick,</hi> that had plaid for many abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Pranks in her own Family ſome years ago. The Gentlewoman could Scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her Eyes; and finding the Vagrant not give her any intelligent Account how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it was yet more unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, how he became a <hi>Miniſter.</hi> He begg'd her Pardon for all his old <hi>Knaveries,</hi> but ſhe being adviſed that he was now practiſing of <hi>New</hi> ones, took a courſe that the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000935_0018_0FAD92AC7A5C3750"/>
people ſhould be deprived of ſo <hi>Charming</hi> a <hi>Preacher,</hi> as no doubt, ſome of the Giddy Populace would have counted him. So with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more Diſturbance, but only the cheating ſome credulous Folks, of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sums of Money, he marched off.</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. A Fellow, in this preſent year, 1699 appeared in <hi>Boſton,</hi> pretending to be a Miniſter: concerning whom, an Honeſt and a Diſcreet man, in the Country having a juſt Fear, leſt our Charity ſhould unjuſtly, and unawares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take too kind notice of him, wrote me the following Account.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This day, a man, whoſe Name is <hi>Eleazer Kingsberry,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in diſcourſe with him, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> me, He had Preached the Goſpel four Months; He ſhewed me a <hi>Certificate</hi> to prove it, with about Twelves Names to it, all Written by his own Hand, (the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was drawn by another,) He alſo told me, he Preached the laſt Sabbath, between <hi>Tanton</hi> and <hi>Freetown,</hi> before a conſiderable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; which was confirmed by a man of <hi>Tanton</hi> then preſent. Conſidering how God is likely to be diſhonoured, and the Goſpel ſcandalized, by him, I thought it my Duty to undeceive you, by giving you, the following Relation. He was born, and brought up in <hi>Wrentham,</hi> and bound pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000935_0019_0FAD92AD61C4AF10"/>
to a <hi>Tailor,</hi> but ſo Vitious a Servant, that his Maſter could do no Good with him. He gat <hi>Free,</hi> and Married a Wife; but not long after <hi>Stole,</hi> and left her; and adding to his <hi>Felony</hi> ſeveral other Vicious Tricks, he went to the <hi>Weſtward.</hi> From thence he wrote a Letter to <hi>Wrentham,</hi> which conſiſted chiefly of <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Curſes.</hi> When I now ſpake with him, I adviſed him to follow his <hi>Calling,</hi> and provide for his <hi>Wife,</hi> and not ſeek to Diſhonour God, and deceive his People. He replied, As for his Wife, ſhe was a Devilliſh Jade, and he would never take her more; but when he was Settled, and had an Houſe, he would take her as a Servant; and if ſhe would not obey him, he would kick her into the Fire; but he would go on in <hi>Preaching,</hi> — and he <hi>would wage twenty pieces of Eight, he would get Money, and Credit in a ſhort Time.</hi> — I could fill a Sheet of paper, but I hope, I have ſaid enough to prevent his having any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from you; and what further ought to be done concerning him, I leave to your Conſideration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Miniſters, in <hi>Boſton,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent after him, a Letter under a flying Seal, Solemnly charging him, to leave off the preſumpteous and Blaſphemous courſe, that he had thus taken up, and return unto his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000935_0020_0FAD92AD98360B38"/>
Family and Employment; and giving him to underſtand, that the <hi>Juſtices</hi> every where ſhould be informed of him, as being, <hi>A Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond.</hi> Hereupon, the <hi>Vagabond,</hi> as I am told, changed his Name into <hi>Berry,</hi> &amp; Ran away to a place called, Cape <hi>May,</hi> where I am alſo told, the people were ſo <hi>Bewitched</hi> with him, that they were almoſt ready to tear in pieces any man, that ſhould ſpeak diminutively of him.</p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. BUT tho' this Bird flew away to the Southward, unto Cape <hi>May,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe pretended Name was <hi>May</hi> came upon this Coaſt about the ſame Time. And on that Occaſion, an Excellent and Ingenious perſon, wrote unto me ſuch paſſages as theſe.</p>
            <p>

So <hi>Silly</hi> and <hi>Shallow</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was, that it was impoſſible for any but ſuch to be many miputes in his Company without being ſenſible of it. The firſt thing that made ſome to ſuſpect him was, his uſing to Lift up his <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> with ſtrains of Devotion uſed by none others in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, after he had firſt look'd about to ſee who look'd upon him.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000935_0030_0FAD92B7EA9BE9C8"/>
I <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and that it is my Duty to <hi>Speak,</hi> yet I let fall words from the very firſt, that any Intelligent Hearer might ſee I had ſome <hi>Fear</hi> about him. The cauſe of that <hi>Fear</hi> was this; I found, That altho' 'tis no time of any <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that ſhould force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but Ill men to <hi>Conceal themſelves,</hi> yet he came Aboard the Veſſel under ſome <hi>Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not profeſſing, nor ſuppoſed, for to be a <hi>Minister</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather a <hi>Mendicant,</hi> until they had Sailed many Leagues. I found that he could mention the Name of no one <hi>Miniſter</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> with whom he durſt ſay, that he had any Acquaintance; Leſt, as it ſhould ſeem, he ſhould happen to mention one, with whom we ſhould be better Acquainted. I found, that he was unaccountably <hi>Shy,</hi> of giving us any ſatisfactory Account of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, his Education, his former circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; by no means, could I get him, to tell me, in what Employment, he had ſpent the firſt ſix or ſeven and twenty years of his Life. What appear'd moſt <hi>probable</hi> (and ſince, more <hi>probable</hi>) was, That he was a <hi>Barber. <hi>A blind Charity</hi>,</hi> would ſtill have perſwaded me, to keep alive ſome <hi>hope,</hi> that <hi>Folly</hi> rather than <hi>Deſign,</hi> might ly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his odd conduct; but I ſoon obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſomething</hi> that made me ſay to ſome of my Intimate <hi>Friends, That I fear'd, he
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000935_0031_0FAD92B826A7A140"/>
would prove at laſt, a ſmutty, filthy, wanton Fellow.</hi> However, Things not being yet come to that maturity, I contented my ſelf with calling to mind, the Rule which the Old <hi>Briton</hi> gave his Country-men, to diſcover whether <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> were a <hi>Man of God</hi> or no. Thought I,
<q>If this be an <hi>Honeſt</hi> man, he is an <hi>Humble</hi> man: If he be a <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> of Chriſt, he'll plainly let his <hi>Fellow Servants</hi> know what he <hi>is,</hi> what he <hi>intends,</hi> what he <hi>can</hi> do, and humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to <hi>Them</hi> for <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Aſſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>

But that his <hi>Humility</hi> might be the more notorious, I was preſently informed, that the Blade with an <hi>Arrogance</hi> equal to his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> began to complain, That the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Town, did not immediately Invite him, into their Pulpits; and upon his Complaints, many ſinful people, (who have great cauſe to take no little ſhame unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for their cauſeleſs and ſhameleſs Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) began to Defame the Miniſters, with Slanderous Outcries, <hi>That they were alwayes uncivil to Strangers</hi>; and ſome could beſtow this Compariſon upon them, <hi>That here was come, a better Workman than themſelves, whom therefore they would not ſuffer to ſtay in the Town, if they could help it.</hi> The Paſtors of the Churches, being deſirous to anſwer the Expectations of the people, as far as they

The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had now done but the Duty of <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that would be found faithful to the Churches and Neighbours; but none of their <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> could hinder many of the people, from the great fault of <hi>running them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Temptation,</hi> by giddily running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inſtructions of a Fellow, that had <hi>Shunn'd the Light, becauſe his Deeds were Evil.</hi> The people, (whoſe <hi>Charity</hi> has been for the moſt part ſo <hi>Exemplary,</hi> that, methinks 'tis pitty it ſhould ever be <hi>miſplaced</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi>) ſome of them not only made a

               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:000935_0035_0FAD92BC0EC1D500"/>We have in our Vicinity, a <hi>Small Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> with whom I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Lived in a <hi>Good Correſpondence.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me the vanity, if I ſay, without judging it proper in this place, to <hi>prove</hi> what I ſay, That never any Miniſter ſo diſtant from their perſwaſion, carried it with more civility, and Affection towards perſons of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, then I made it my Endeavour to do Becauſe, I believed, there were Godly perſons among them, I offered them, that if they ſhould come (as they were likely) to have the Divine <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> fail among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I would freely accept them to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with my own Flock; and though they ſhould be ſo ſcrupulous as to Turn their Backs as often as an <hi>Infant</hi> was <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> it ſhould not be made an offence. This Offer I made them, I hope not out of a ſinful Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation to <hi>Enlarge</hi> my Flock; The moſt undeſerved Favour of Heaven, has Employ'd my poor Services, in ſuch Aſſemblies, that I have cauſe to Study how I may <hi>Serve</hi> them <hi>better</hi> before I go to get them <hi>Larger</hi>; but it was purely from a <hi>Spirit of Charity.</hi> Indeed, <hi>I</hi> had no Anſwer but this, <hi>We look upon you, as an Unbaptized man, and therefore we cannot hold Communion with you:</hi> But tho' this <hi>New-Comer</hi> were in their Opinion, <hi>An Unbaptiſed man,</hi> yet they now took this opportunity, to

Nevertheleſs, I cannot wholly <hi>Juſtify</hi> this <hi>Faulty Action</hi>: And their Setting up ſuch a Fellow, under all theſe Ill Circumſtances, to be their <hi>Publick Teacher,</hi> look'd the worſe, becauſe they could not but ſee, that it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in his Numerous Proſelytes, not only the ſleight of a <hi>Learned Miniſtry,</hi> but alſo a diſpoſition which ordinarily Inſpired thoſe that were proſelyted by him, to become <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> and <hi>Revilers</hi> of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Town.

man.</hi> Some Adviſed, the <hi>Arreſting</hi> of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, in <hi>Great Actions,</hi> for <hi>Defaming</hi> of this <hi>Excellent Perſon</hi>; And others had the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> ſo little in Exerciſe with them, as to cry out, <hi>That if this man had been guilty of all that was charg'd on him, yet for that Miniſter to ſpeak ſuch Things to him, was as great an offence as his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had reaſon, to deſire, That the <hi>Truth</hi> might now appear, a little more irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and therefore I went unto the Officers of the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Church, declaring, <hi>That I apprehended my ſelf able to convict the man whom they Employ'd as a Publick Teacher among them, of being a Cheat, and of having horribly Ly'd against his Conſcience, in ſeveral repeated and Notorious Inſtances; and that I deſired on my own behalf, and on the behalf of the other Miniſters in the Town, that they would appoint a place, the next week, where I might prove my Charge to his Face, and they ſhould be Judges of it.</hi> I could not have Imagined it; But the Church being informed of my Demand, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Renewed (as I am told) their <hi>Call</hi> unto him, to continue his <hi>Preaching</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and by their <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> there was an Anſwer of this Importance brought unto me, <hi>That inaſmuch as this man was not a Member of their Church, they did not apprehend themſelves concerned, to take any notice

of what I had offered.</hi> Whereto my Reply was, <hi>Well, I have done my Duty, and I hope, you have conſidered, Whether it will be for Chriſt's Honour, or for your own, to Employ a man, as a Publick Preacher, against whom ſuch a Charge is urg'd, and may be prov'd, if you will but hear it.</hi> And thought I, How much will Chriſtians act beſides themſelves, when <hi>Led into Temptation</hi>! From this Time, even from <hi>September,</hi> (I think) to <hi>December,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd my ſelf no further: being ſatisfied, that it would not be long before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaw how impiouſly this man <hi>mocked</hi> Him, would <hi>Search him out,</hi> and cloath with perpetual Confuſion, thoſe that would perſiſt in Aſſiſting ſuch a <hi>Mocker</hi> of Heaven.

               <hi>Remember</hi> them, and I pray <hi>Him</hi> to caſt them out of His <hi>Remembrance.</hi> At laſt the malice went ſo far, that they began to throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Houſe, inſolent, bitter, bloody <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> wherein, albeit the nameleſs Writers Confeſs <hi>A great Eſteem for me, for my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Spirit towards them that differ from me,</hi> yet they now in moſt venemous Terms of Rage, flew upon me for my <hi>Reviling an Eminent Worthy Stranger,</hi> (as they expreſs it) and <hi>Perſecuting</hi> one who had the <hi>Root of the matter in him,</hi> and one who had now the Liberty of a more <hi>Unſtained Pulpit,</hi> than any of thoſe which had been deny'd him. All theſe, and many more ſuch things, wherein I <hi>heard the Defaming of many,</hi> I bore, I hope, I may ſay, <hi>Silently,</hi> and <hi>Patiently,</hi> &amp; it was a great Fault in me, if not <hi>Prayerfully</hi>: &amp; if I did not ſet my ſelf, to conſider, <hi>What Holy Leſſons were to be Learnt out of ſuch Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:</hi> In which <hi>Leſſons</hi> I ſhould have been ſufficiently <hi>Requited Good,</hi> for the <hi>Curſing</hi> of all the <hi>Shimei's</hi> in the Town.

and Wondrous Providence, often detects theſe <hi>Woful Hyprocrites.</hi> But when ſuch <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are detected, He ſo orders the Detection, that His <hi>Churches,</hi> not only <hi>Should,</hi> but <hi>Shall</hi> take Notice of it.</p>
            <p>There was at <hi>Thyatira,</hi> One that ſet up for a <hi>Teacher,</hi> and was marvellouſly. Approved, Admired, and Followed, by many of the People; at whoſe <hi>Giddineſs</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was therefore Exceedingly offended. But this <hi>Teacher</hi> was in the Iſſue proved an Horrid, Filthy, <hi>Laſcivious Wretch,</hi> and fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dreadful Judgments of God. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt now declares the <hi>Uſe,</hi> that He will have to be made of ſuch a matter; And His <hi>Doctrine</hi> unto us, is This.</p>
            <q>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, who Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men, will by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Diſpenſations of His Providence, make all the Churches to Know, that He is indeed an Heart-Searching Lord.</q>

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi> The <hi>Godhead</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is then to be Known and Own'd in all His Churches.

            <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God, have called our Lord JESUS CHRIST, Expreſsly, <hi>The True God,</hi> and, <hi>The Great God,</hi> and, <hi>God over all</hi>: And the <hi>Churches</hi> of God, muſt accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him.

Bible, which Expreſsly affirms, That there ſhould be a <hi>Man</hi> in the World, who ſhould be <hi>God,</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi> You have it, in Zech. 13.7. <hi>Awake, O Sword, againſt the Man, that is my Equal, ſaith JEHOVAH, the Lord of Hosts.</hi> There was a <hi>Man,</hi> whom the Jewes did Stab with a <hi>Sword</hi>; but of this <hi>Man</hi> tis ſaid, <hi>He is an equal to the Lord of Hoſts</hi>; He muſt therefore be <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Churches</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, muſt preſerve this <hi>Faith</hi> among them: 'tis their very <hi>Life</hi>; all their <hi>Hope,</hi> and all their <hi>Joy,</hi> is <hi>Enwrapped</hi> in it. But the <hi>Faith</hi> of our Lords <hi>Deity,</hi> cannot be preſerved, without the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> We don't know <hi>God,</hi> if we don't know Him as <hi>One God in Three Subſiſtences.</hi> It is therefore maintained by ſome Learned Chriſtians, <hi>That the God of the Spragogue, is not the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob.

Becauſe He proceeds from the <hi>Father,</hi> by an unutterable, an Inconceivable, an Eternal <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> The Jews have a Tradition, that when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> comes, He will tell us the <hi>Right Name</hi> of the Eternal God; He has done it, in Mat. 28.19. <hi>His Name</hi> is, <hi>The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</hi>

            <p>We are to <hi>know,</hi> That the moſt <hi>Hidden</hi> and <hi>Secret,</hi> Things are <hi>known</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis the Voice of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom without falling into the <hi>Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitarian</hi> Error, we muſt call our <hi>Omnipreſent</hi> Lord, in Jer. 23.24. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him? ſaith the Lord Reins</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> are things altogether <hi>Out of ſight.</hi> But the Things that are moſt <hi>Out of ſight,</hi> are <hi>Seen</hi> by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Men</hi> may ſee the <hi>Face</hi> of other men; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſees the very <hi>Reins</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of all men; there is nothing to be <hi>Hidden</hi> from him, tho' it be never ſo <hi>ſecret.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:000935_0060_0FAD92D407D00BB8"/>
Be it <hi>Known</hi> among the <hi>Churches,</hi> That (Job 34.21, 22.) <hi>His Eyes are upon the wayes of man, and he ſees all his goings; Neither is there any Deadneſs nor Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; We are to <hi>Know,</hi> That all our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and the very <hi>Thoughts</hi> of all men, are fully <hi>known</hi> unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Let our <hi>Minds</hi> be conſtantly kept Awake, by that word of our Lord, in Ezek. 11.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</hi> The <hi>Reins</hi> and the <hi>Hearts</hi> of men, are the <hi>Forge</hi> wherein their <hi>Thoughts</hi> are minted. <hi>The Thoughts are free,</hi> we ſay; but they are not <hi>free,</hi> either from the <hi>Law,</hi> or from the <hi>View,</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There are neither <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> nor <hi>Ill Thoughts</hi> in the Souls of any men, but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is infallibly acquainted with them; He will <hi>Requite</hi> the one, and <hi>Revenge</hi> the other. The Scribes of Old, were not the only perſons, of whom it might be ſaid, <hi>The Lord knew their Thoughts.</hi> No, Let it be <hi>known</hi> and ſaid, by every man in all the <hi>Churches,</hi> [Pſal. 139.2.] <hi>Lord, Thou knowest my Thoughts afar off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover; We are to <hi>know,</hi> That the moſt <hi>Secret Conditions</hi> of men are <hi>known</hi> to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Interiour,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> State of men, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knows</hi> what it is, 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He Tries the Reins and

the Hearts</hi>: How? As men <hi>Try</hi> Metals, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Counterfeit</hi> or no.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man does not <hi>know himſelf</hi>; but there is no man whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knows not.</hi> If there be <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the Soul, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Hence an Embaſſador of God, that had been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Defamed,</hi> among thoſe who did not <hi>know</hi> him, cheerfully made his Appeal to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lord, in Jer. 20.12. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, who trieſt the Righteous, and ſeeſt the Reins and the Heart, unto thee I have opened my cauſe.</hi> There is no where an <hi>Iſraelite indeed,</hi> of whom our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may not ſay, <hi>I have ſeen that man</hi>! If there be <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> in the Soul, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</hi> Hence, when there were ſome, who ſeem'd ſuch <hi>Strict Preachers,</hi> that every one said of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Yea, but they are <hi>known</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of them all!</p>
            <p>Furthermore; We are to <hi>know,</hi> That the moſt <hi>Secret Intentions</hi> of men are <hi>known</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

            <p>Yea, Finally; The <hi>Knowledge</hi> which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath of all theſe Things is a very <hi>Exact</hi> and <hi>Perfect Knowledge.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He Searches the Reins and the Hearts.</hi> The <hi>Exactneſs</hi> of the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is implied in the Expreſſion of <hi>Searching.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Searches</hi> to the <hi>Bottom</hi> of all things.

In that Illuſtrious Day of God, when <hi>God ſhall Judge the Secrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and when <hi>God will bring to Light the Hidden Works of Darkneſs,</hi>
               <q>Cunctaque Cunctorum Cunctis arcana patebunt;</q>
            </p>
            <p>Heaven and Earth ſhall then <hi>know,</hi> and it ſhall be terribly proclaimed from the <hi>Riſing of the Sun to the Setting thereof,</hi> and as far as the Trumpet of an Archangel can ſound the Proclamation, <hi>That every thing is known unto our Great Lord Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before that <hi>Laſt,</hi> and <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Notable Day of the Lord,</hi> there do oftentimes fall out, moſt amazing Things, to ſhow the <hi>Churches,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Searches the Reins and Hearts</hi> of the Children of men.

            <p>Conſider of it, O ye <hi>Churches</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Firſt; The <hi>Wonderful Providence</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in diſcovering, of <hi>Secret Sinners,</hi> does plainly diſcover, that He <hi>Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> the moſt <hi>Secret Sins,</hi> in the <hi>Reins</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of men. By various and curious and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <hi>Methods,</hi> does the <hi>Wonderful Providence</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, bring about the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>very of <hi>Secret Sinners.</hi> And thoſe <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> do confirm This; That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knows</hi> the Sinners, and all their <hi>Secret Sins.</hi> Men muſt with ſome Agony of Soul, now cry out, [Pſal. 90.8.] <hi>Lord, Thou haſt ſet our Iniquities before thee, and our Secret Sin, in the Light of thy Countenance.</hi> Men may <hi>Cover their Sins</hi> a long while; but they don't <hi>proſper</hi> in their doing ſo: God makes a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> of them. Sometimes the Holy God
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000935_0068_0FAD92DBCFCE3BF0"/>
ſmites them with ſuch Horror of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that as 'tis ſaid, in Pſal. 64.8. <hi>They ſhall make their own Tongue to fall upon themſelves.</hi> An <hi>Achan</hi> is brought into ſuch Diſtreſs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that he ſhall not be able to forbear Confeſſing, <hi>Thus and thus have I Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thus hath my Sin found me out.</hi> And ſometimes the Holy God leaves them to ſuch horrible <hi>Scandals,</hi> that all the Neighbourhood ſhall with Abhorrence gaze upon them. There was an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> that had <hi>bewitched</hi> the people; he ſeem'd very pious, until God left him unto that Impiety, which made every one to ſay, as in Acts 8.21, 23. <hi>Thy Heart is not Right in the ſight of God, I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Bond of Iniquity.</hi> A <hi>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</hi> will go on, perhaps many months together, until God permits the Clawes and the Teeth of a <hi>Wolf</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd upon him in ſome <hi>Scandalous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Villanies</hi> of theſe men, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but now he makes <hi>all men</hi> to <hi>know</hi> them; and when <hi>that which was done in Darkneſs is heard in the Light,</hi> when <hi>that which was done in Cloſets, is proclaimed on the Houſe tops, Then</hi> 'tis proved, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>knew</hi> all along, what was done in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>in the Cloſets.</hi> The
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000935_0069_0FAD92DD26BD6B60"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as He ſaid concerning thoſe infamous <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> of Old, in Jer. 29.23. <hi>They have committed Villany in Iſrael, and have committed Adultery with their Neighbours Wives and have ſpoken Lying Words; even I know, and am a Witneſs, ſaith the Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; 'Tis moſt Remarkably in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Churches,</hi> that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men,</hi> does by His <hi>Wonderful Providence</hi> diſcover the <hi>Secret Sins</hi> of men. In <hi>Congregations</hi> formed according to the Will of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is that <hi>Secret Sinners</hi> run the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hazards</hi> of that Vengeance, in Prov. 26.26. <hi>His</hi> Sin <hi>is covered with Deceit, his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be ſhew'd before the whole Congregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches</hi> of a pure Conſtitution, repreſent the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> unto the world: Men can't Sin at ſo cheap a rate in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they may in a dark <hi>World,</hi> or in <hi>Churches</hi> that are undiſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>World.</hi> The <hi>Pure Churches</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are <hi>Golden Candleſticks</hi>: Can men think to Sin undiſcovered in the midſt of ſuch <hi>Candleſticks</hi>? There are <hi>Angels</hi> burning in the Heads of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is a ſpecial and a dreeadful <hi>preſence</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>Churches,</hi> that maintain the <hi>Order of the Goſpel.</hi> Hence there are ſtupendous Diſpenſations of
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000935_0070_0FAD92DE6B240D58"/>
His <hi>Providence</hi> in His <hi>Churches,</hi> to bring out thoſe that ſhall there provoke his Infinite Majeſty. Men may go on in a <hi>Courſe of Profanity,</hi> under a <hi>Cloak of Piety,</hi> for ſome while among the <hi>Churches</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and they may applaud their own Contrivance, as long as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they can Enjoy the Applauſe of the Deluded Neighbours. The Jealous Lord Jeſus Chriſt beholds their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daring Abominations, but with a Day of patience, He gives them a <hi>Space to Repent</hi> of the Abominable Things, by which they thus dare the Juſtice of Heaven. It may be ſaid of them, <hi>They conſider not in their Hearts, that I remember all their Wickedneſs, tho' their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are before my face, ſaith the Lord.</hi> At laſt, the Jealouſy of the Holy Lord breaks forth like Fire againſt them, and abandons them to ſome <hi>Follies</hi> that fully diſcover them. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in His Burning Holineſs, gives them up to an <hi>Unclean Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Lying Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Thieving Spirit,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> and the Infatuated Wretches are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Conſternation and Execration to all the World; As it was ſaid, in Pſal. 52.6, 7, 8. <hi>Thy Tongue deviſeth miſchiefs: O thou deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tongue, God ſhall take thee away, and root thee out; the Righteous alſo ſhall ſee and fear, and laugh at him; Lo, this is the man, that ſtrengthened himſelf in his wickedneſs; but I am
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000935_0071_0FAD92DF13C65CD8"/>
a Green Olive Tree in the Houſe of God.</hi> Thus, 'tis an Exclamation made in all the <hi>Churches; Lo, this is the man, that would needs appear ſome body among the Churches of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but the Lord Jeſus Christ hath made all the Churches to know, that they were Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. When the <hi>Wonderful Providence</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in His <hi>Churches,</hi> by Diſcovering the <hi>Secret Sins</hi> of men, ſhowes that He <hi>Searches the Reins and Hearts</hi> of Men, it is the Duty of the <hi>Churches</hi> to take much <hi>Notice</hi> of it. The <hi>Providence</hi> of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſometimes does very Tremendous and Surpriſing Things, in His <hi>Churches,</hi> for the Diſcovering of <hi>Secret Sinners.</hi> The <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of Sin,</hi> will do all they can, to Reſiſt that <hi>Providence</hi> of Heaven, and make nothing of <hi>That,</hi> which is plainly, <hi>The Finger of God.</hi> By ſuch Doings, men bring upon themſelves the Guilt of all the <hi>Sin,</hi> they go to Smother and Shelter, and the <hi>Providence</hi> of Heaven remains irreſiſtible. Such <hi>Partners</hi> with <hi>Sinners,</hi> will do well to Tremble before that Word of God, in Pſal. 28 5. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operation of His Hands, He ſhall Deſtroy them.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Churches</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are to <hi>Take Notice</hi> of what He does in His <hi>Notable Providence.</hi> When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000935_0072_0FAD92DFE924E9C8"/>
gives us to ſee, That He <hi>takes Notice</hi> of His <hi>Churches,</hi> and of what is done among them, it becomes His <hi>Churches</hi> to <hi>take Notice</hi> of His <hi>Providence.</hi> Why, There are <hi>Leſſons</hi> of Great Conſequence, which the <hi>Churches</hi> are to Learn from that <hi>Providence,</hi> wherein they ſee Him <hi>Searching the Reins &amp; Hearts</hi> of men. Tis a moſt <hi>Obſervable</hi> Thing, that is done by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in His <hi>Providence,</hi> when <hi>Secret Sinners</hi> are diſcovered. Now all the <hi>Churches</hi> are to <hi>Obſerve</hi> what is done: For, [Pſal. 107.43.] <hi>Whoſo is Wiſe, will obſerve theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> The <hi>Churches</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when they ſee Him <hi>Searching the Reins and the Hearts</hi> of men, in the Memorable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of His <hi>Providence,</hi> they ſhould make a <hi>Good Uſe</hi> of what they ſee. All the <hi>Churches</hi> are to <hi>Know,</hi> That the Lord <hi>Searches the Reins and the Hearts</hi>; But how are they to <hi>Know</hi> it? Words of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> in the Sacred Language, import Suitable <hi>Reſentment.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>Firſt. All the <hi>Churches</hi> are to <hi>Know,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</hi> for the <hi>Comfort</hi> of ſuch <hi>Hearts,</hi> as are <hi>Sound before Him.</hi> Chriſtians, Are your <hi>Hearts</hi> Vexed with any <hi>Temptations,</hi> or grieved for any <hi>Corruptions</hi>? I may ſay unto you, <hi>Let not your Hearts be Troubled</hi>: But <hi>Know</hi> for your

               <hi>Comfort,</hi> under your <hi>Uneaſineſs,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Knows</hi> all that renders your <hi>Hearts</hi> uneaſy, and is ready to Succour you. Can you ſay with him, in Pſal. 57.7. <hi>My Heart is Fixed, O God, my Heart is Fixed?</hi> It is <hi>Known</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who indeed was He that <hi>Fixed</hi> it. Yea, If there be but the leaſt Spark of <hi>Grace</hi> in thy <hi>Heart,</hi> O man, Tis all <hi>Known</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There is not one <hi>Good Motion,</hi> but it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that <hi>Moved</hi> it, and He <hi>knows</hi> what it is. Have any of us been <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed</hi> and <hi>Reproached</hi> by an Angry Generation of men, and are <hi>Ill Conſtructions</hi> made of our <hi>Faithfulneſs?</hi> What a comfortable <hi>Cordial</hi> may this be to our <hi>Hearts,</hi> That our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>Knowes</hi> how <hi>Faithful</hi> our <hi>Hearts</hi> have been unto Him? As he ſaid in Job 16.19. <hi>Behold, my witneſs is in Heaven, and my Record is on high</hi>; though my <hi>Friends do Scorn me</hi>: The Servants of the <hi>Churches</hi> cannot Eſcape the Severe cenſures of men, if they do what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would have them to do: But ſince <hi>all the Churches Know,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Searches the Hearts,</hi> how Joyfully may we apply unto Him, <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt my Heart, I have ſaid nothing, I have Writ nothing, I have done juſt nothing, but what my Heart aſſured me, it was my Duty to do</hi>!</p>
            <p>Secondly. All the <hi>Churches</hi> are to <hi>Know,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:000935_0074_0FAD92E2C35A5660"/>
That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</hi> for our <hi>Caution</hi> againſt <hi>Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity in our Hearts.</hi> What a <hi>Caution</hi> have we, Sirs, What a powerful <hi>Caution</hi> againſt all Attempts, to <hi>Mock</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with <hi>Hearts</hi> that are <hi>Deceitful above all things,</hi> while they are <hi>Deſperately Wicked?</hi> Let us in our <hi>Churches</hi> labour to approve our <hi>Hearts</hi> unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and let us not go to <hi>Mock</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with any meer <hi>Shows</hi> in Religion. What ſaid the Man of God, in Job 13.9. <hi>Is it Good, that He ſhould Search you out? Or as one man mocketh another, do ye ſo mock Him?</hi> Let it be <hi>Known,</hi> Oh, let it be <hi>Known</hi> to all the <hi>Churchers,</hi> That the Great God, who will not be <hi>Mock'd,</hi> will thoroughly <hi>Diſcern,</hi> and will terribly <hi>Confound,</hi> all thoſe that go to <hi>Mock</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſuch <hi>Cautions</hi> as theſe to be ſet before us.</p>
