            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>NUMBER I.</head>
               <p>TO meddle with the ſubject of the Currency was long deemed a matter of the higheſt imprudence; and tho' all ſaw and felt its decline, few had the hardineſs publicly to declare it. But the depreciation became, at length, an object of ſuch magnitude, and was ſo intimately connected with every movement, both political and military, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye became familiarized to it. The laws acknowledged it, and the news-papers, in ſucceſſive eſſays, proclaimed it aloud. Various have been the ſchemes for remedying the evil; and appreciation, appreciation, has been the cry from one end of the Continent to the other. To combat the general voice, may be thought to ſavour of either folly or vanity. But as no injury can now happen to the public, from even torturing the ſubject into every ſhape, I am willing to riſque the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and venture on the ocean of finance with my little bark. An ocean, much of which remains unexplored, and in which fog banks and iſlands of ice are often miſtaken for land. If I periſh with my little viſionary crew by the falling of ſome mighty projecting promontory, future voyages muſt beware of my fate.</p>
               <p>IT may be neceſſary to premiſe, that in the ſundry calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which I may take occaſion to exhibit, I ſhall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally make uſe of whole numbers; as the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject precludes accuracy.</p>
               <p>BY the reſolves of Congreſs in January, 1779, it appears they had emitted 123 millions of dollars. And in September following, in their circular letter, they ſtate the amount ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to be about 160 millions; and then propoſed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the emiſſions till they ſhould reach 200 millions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of 33 millions borrowed on intereſt. I preſume the ſaid 200 millions are now compleated; for if in eight months (viz. from January to September) the expences were 37 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, when depreciation was on the general average 15 1-2
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:016820_0002_0F9E803CE1CF9038"/>
for 1, the remaining four months would undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume 40 millions, becauſe the average depreciation ſince September has been 35 1-2 for 1.</p>
               <p>DURING the two firſt emiſſions, of 3 millions each, the money I believe continued at par, no actual diminution of value having taken place. How the depreciation has ſince gone on, may be ſeen by a table I ſhall ſubjoin to this letter, taking gold for the ſtandard; which, by the by, has ever been behind every other commodity in advance of price. As we have no account of the quantities of all the ſeveral emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or the dates at which they were actually iſſued, it is in the breaſt of Congreſs alone, to determine with preciſion, how far the depreciation has kept pace with the quantity, and from thence in ſome meaſure to aſcertain, whether the quantity alone, or ſome other concomitant cauſes, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the effect. Was I to judge from mere conjectural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, I ſhould ſuppoſe the value of money has been principally affected by its relative quantity, when compared with the quantity of commodities for ſale. For inſtance, if 10 millions of dollars, at 7<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 each, were ſufficient for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of trade, when we had 40 millions of ſaleables, and we ſhould at any time have 200 millions of dollars, I ſhould ſuppoſe money would be depreciated as 20 to 1, becauſe, not being of intrinſic value, or capable of exportation, there would be 20 times the number of bidders for every article on ſale (for money is in fact the buyer or bidder) and of courſe the poſſeſſors of money could as well afford to give 20 prices for an article, as they could formerly to give <hi>one</hi> price. But if the quantity of ſaleables ſhould be reduced to one half, or 20 millions, I ſhould then ſay that the depreciation was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually 40 for 1; becauſe there was 40 times as much money as was neceſſary for a medium. This I preſume is plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. But to come nearer to the matter of fact, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that, from the beſt information I have been able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, the current money of America formerly never exceeded 16 millions of dollars, when the value of merchandize might be eſtimated at about 45 millions.</p>
               <p>I fancy it will be readily allowed, that we have not at preſent above one fourth part of the quantity of ſaleables which we had formerly, conſequently not much above 11 millions in value. Then, if 16 millions of money conducted the buſineſs of 45 millions of ſaleables, How much is neceſſary to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate 11 millions? The anſwer is, About 4 millions. And
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:016820_0003_0F9E803DB4DF37A0"/>
this proportion of money will be deemed very ſufficient, if we recollect, that 6 millions of running caſh ſerved the whole buſineſs of England in Sir William Petty's time, when the ſaleables amounted to 42 millions and a half. Now as we have of Continental money about 200 millions, at a time when 4 millions would anſwer the purpoſe, it is evident there is fifty times as much as is neceſſary, and the money is in fact depreciated to fifty for one. I do not bring land into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſaleables, as the amount would be too uncertain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but I ſhould ſuppoſe the local emiſſions of the ſeveral States, together with the value of Loan-Office money iſſued under the denomination of Certificates, may be deemed fully to counterbalance any allowance for the ſale of real eſtates; eſpecially when we reflect, that very conſiderable loans have been made ſince the 33 millions mentioned, in September.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, that I am obliged to aſſume my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as no certain data can be formed, yet I conceive I am not much beſide the mark; for if we reaſon back from effects to cauſes, we ſhall find, that on an average the prices of ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables are <hi>more</hi> than 50 for 1, and thence diſcover the medium to be 50 times more than is wanted. And I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of this conjecture from the late prices of goods; which have in ſome meaſure become ſtationary or fixed. For though the quantity of money has been daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, yet the quantity of goods, for ſome time paſt, crouded in upon us, has in ſome meaſure counterbalanced the quantity of money; whereby a kind of equilibrium hath been eſtabliſhed, and trade has fairly regulated itſelf. The merchants endeavoured to advance the prices, but the money on hand was not ſufficient to bear it; and it is juſt now, relatively, as ſcarce as when it paſſed equal to hard money. Should Congreſs continue ſtriking at the rate of 10 millions a month, and 10 millions preſent value of goods ſhould be imported in each month, I think I might venture to aſſert, that no further real depreciation could take place. As to any more capricious turns, they could not be durable. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral equilibrium between the quantity of goods, and the quantity of money would ſoon be reſtored.</p>
               <p>THEN taking for granted, that the real depreciation is fifty for one, the grand queſtion ariſes, "What is to be done?" Some cry, ſtop the preſs, and raiſe by taxes and loans ſufficient for the exigencies of government; ſome are for a ſudden appreciation to the rate of twenty for one; ſome
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016820_0004_0F9E803E5B055FA8"/>
for a foreign loan; and others for calling in the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and re-iſſuing about one ſixth part, which, ſay they, will be as valuable as the whole; and the remaining 5 6th to be funded, and carry an intereſt. Theſe ſeveral modes reſemble the preſcriptions of anxious friends, ſtanding round a ſick bed—Some would bleed—ſome phyſic—one is for poultices, another for a bath of bitter herbs, whilſt poor dame nature is labouring inceſſantly to throw off the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by her own efforts, and would often ſucceed, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the ignorance of quacks. That the money has depreciated, we well know; and many have fatally felt its effects; but thoſe partial evils I preſume are pretty generally at an end. All old contracts are either ſettled or the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered payments abſolutely rejected; for he who can bear to loſe 19<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 in the pound, will not be ruined by the other ſix pence. Let the debtor pay it into the Treaſury, and the Laws ſupport him as long as conſcience will bear it. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dealings are for ready money—not a moment's credit is allowed—the caſh is paid, or the bargain void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Stop the preſſes"</hi>—eaſily ſaid—But how are the current expences to be ſupplied?—<hi>"Raiſe taxes"</hi>—Every State on the Continent, is at it as hard as they can drive, and law after law has been paſſed for ſupplying the quotas called for by Congreſs. In November 1777, five millions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in 1779 fifteen millions and forty-five millions. Yet I believe not one will aſſert, that even one fourth part of the whole is paid into the Treaſury. In Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember laſt, they tell us, no more than three millions had been received. To expect that a country can be brought to pay taxes, voluntarily, to ſupport the whole demands of the year, in the midſt of an expenſive war, is as abſurd, as to ſuppoſe the rent of a houſe will in one year pay for the building of it; nothing but an anticipation of the taxes can effect it. A young country, like America, can by no means be ſuppoſed to have ſuch an overplus of riches as to furniſh the ſum wanted. In England they have long been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to borrow, in time of war, and the accumulating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt has nearly ruined the nation; they can now ſcarce le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy taxes ſufficient to pay the intereſt; for during the whole interval of the laſt peace, they have not, I think, paid four millions into the ſinking fund.</p>
               <p>"BORROW money then—at home—of foreigners—any where—rather than have freſh emiſſions."—What borrow
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016820_0005_0F9E803F41C04DA0"/>
on intereſt, when you may have it without!—Send your reſources to foreign Courts when you may keep them at home!— I would aſk, what is the difference between ſtriking a million of Bills of 50 dollars each, and iſſuing Loan Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Certificates for the ſame amount in notes of 500 dollars each? With reſpect to the quantity of paper, there is none; for Certificates are now as liable to circulation, as the money itſelf. We are not to conclude that the Certificates will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main more dormant than the money did. He who puts money into the Loan-Office, may be preſumed to have no immediate uſe for it; and that it was innocently reſting in his cheſt, without ruſhing into circulation to encreaſe the ſum current; and whenever it becomes convenient to make a purchaſe he would either bring out the caſh or the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate. Therefore to pay an intereſt of 6 per cent for money received at the Loan Office, is in my humble opinion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the country in a laſting tax, purely for the benefit of monied men. A tax which every man of ſmall capital, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan and labourer, muſt annually contribute to raiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt benefit to themſelves. From the firſt moment a Loan-Office was projected, I conceived it an error in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, and it has brought on the country the great evil of a contrariety of intereſts.</p>
               <p>WE ſee a great depreciation has happened of near 50 for 1, and every man who at the firſt paid 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> into the Loan-Office, has in fact ſunk his ſtock to 100<abbr>l.</abbr> and ſo in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the different dates at which they lent to the public; and many of theſe have been foreign lenders upon the credit and honour of the Continent. Now all theſe people have an intereſt different from the people at large, and muſt be continually wiſhing for a reſtoration of the value of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; whilſt the reſt of the community who have gradually borne a ſhare of the loſs by depreciation from time to time, and have ſettled and ſquared all their tranſactions conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably thereto, cannot have a wiſh to ſee the money return to its original value. All they have to deſire is, that the value may remain where it is, or if it ſtill declines, that they may bear no more than their proportion of the loſs.</p>
               <p>IT may be aſked what mode of ſettlement is to be adopted between government and the money lenders. Policy would anſwer <q>emit as much freſh money as will pay off the whole debt immediately,</q> and juſtice would add, <q>let ſuch an addition be made, as will amply reimburſe the lenders,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016820_0006_0F9E803FD93E91F8"/>
eſtimating the value of money at the time of ſubſcribing.</q> Perhaps ſome medium between the two, might be proper; for as people at large have borne their ſhare of the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe ſubſcribers could not expect to ſet down whole. I don't pretend to determine, what ſuch medium ſhould be. I only contend for the immediate diſſolution of the Loan-Office; for why ſhould the Community be burthened with an addition of taxes, merely to pay an intereſt to monied men, for lending paper to government; when that very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per could be as well made without any other expence than ſtriking it; and the larger theſe bills the better; if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars each, it might help to retard the circulation, and leſſen the charge of printing and ſigning. It is to be obſerved, that the whole of my reaſoning on this ſubject turns upon the aſſertion, that Loan-Office Certificates are money to all intents and purpoſes, and operate in proportion to their quantity, equal to a like ſum of Continental bills— if I am wrong my concluſions fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>LOANS on intereſt in England are abſolutely neceſſary; becauſe real gold is paid into the treaſury by the ſubſcribers, but could their government manufacture that gold, as cheap as we can manufacture paper, will any man ſuppoſe they would prefer taking it up on intereſt? ſurely no; the habit we had long been accuſtomed to, of uſing paper money, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it familiar to us; and no one was alarmed with the conſequences of an encreaſing quantity, yet it is a debt to all intents and purpoſes; but being due to ourſelves, the evil is not ſo great as if Foreigners were our creditors. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment might prove dangerous to Great-Britain, ſhould ſhe attempt to carry on a war with paper money, otherwiſe ſhe might pledge her funds for redeeming it and ſave the intereſt, but her complicated trade and connection with foreigners would thereby be involved in great perplexity. It will be ſaid, that much of the circulating medium of Great-Britain is already paper: I grant it with this difference, that it is not legal tender, and a man can at any moment convert it into actual hard caſh. But I have rather wandered from the point: I only mean to prove, that it is highly injurious to America in the preſent ſtate of things, to have a Loan-Office. As to foreign Loans with a view to ſerve the Currency, every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument uſed againſt Loans amongſt ourſelves, applies with equal force againſt them, with this important addition, that the intereſt would be an actual drain of the wealth of our

country. In the former inſtance it would only drain people of moderate and ſmall fortunes for the benefit of the rich; but in the latter both rich and poor would loſe for ever the intereſt ſo paid. How far Foreign Loans may be requiſite to ſupply the Continent with ſuch Foreign neceſſaries, as we have not the means of paying for at preſent, is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which does not come within the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here inſert the table of depreciation the greater part of which I had from a trader, whoſe buſineſs required his accounts to be kept in hard money, and agrees with accounts kept by ſome others with whom I have compared. And yet I am aware it cannot correſpond with all, who may have kept ſuch accounts, becauſe the rates of exchange, between different perſons, have often varied on the ſame day; I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean to demonſtrate the general gradual depreciation; and the table here produced, will come near enough to the truth, for the uſe I propoſe making of it in my next letter.</p>

               <p>IF taxes will not ſupply the preſent exigencies, and Loans, both domeſtic and foreign, are rejected; you ſay appreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the money to 20 for 1 by acts of the ſeveral Aſſemblies, and oblige the venders of goods and tradeſmen to charge their goods and work at that rate. Has not this mode been attempted three ſeveral times, and univerſally failed? Did not general diſcontents and murmurs prevail? Was not every artifice uſed to elude the ſcheme? Were not goods ſecreted? And did not one State take the advantage of the other, in either buying up from their neighbour, or refuſing to have intercourſe with them? Did not Congreſs (aware of the evils it produced) recommend the diſcontinuing ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? And is it not probable the ſame inconveniences will ſtill ariſe? And after the people have been worrying and perplexing each other, will it not be likely to fall through? as trade carried on under reſtraint will be for ever attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to break the fetters. But ſhould ſucceſs attend the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, it would produce the very evil I would wiſh to avoid. An evil of the moſt alarming nature; converting an <hi>imaginary</hi> into a <hi>real</hi> debt, and riveting on the Continent a ſucceſſion of taxes, which we ſhould ſcarce ever be able to get clear of. Suppoſe we conſider this ſubject a little more minutely. We will, for argument's ſake, allow of the deſired appreciation in its utmoſt extent; that by ſome magical ſtroke the whole Continental money, calling it 200 millions, ſhould become equal to gold and ſilver; that a Continental dollar would purchaſe as much as a hard dollar would; why truly we ſhould ſuddenly arrive at the poſſeſſion of immenſe riches, provided we could export this ſame money as a commodity, and import, in lieu thereof, the production of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but as no one can expect this can happen, what is to be done with it? The exceſs of quantity is far beyond the value of ſaleables; is the ſurplus to be locked up? No, we will put it to intereſt with ſuch as want: But this cannot be; for thoſe who are to be the borrowers, cannot find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to veſt it in. What is next to be done with this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus? It appears to be a nominal not a real eſtate; it lies dormant by us, and nothing is to be bought with it, for the proportion in actual circulation anſwers every purpoſe. Is it to exiſt for ever in bits of paper, under the denomination of money? Or is it to be deſtroyed? Burned by all means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016820_0009_0F9E8044D56F8C80"/>
that, in caſe of another war, we may not have too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundance of it, by ſtriking afreſh, and again bring on our backs this monſter depreciation. But how ſhall this ſame money be deſtroyed, in ſuch equal proportions, as to give general ſatisfaction?—Very eaſily, by taxes.—Agreed. We will now, if you pleaſe begin to lay them, and try how long it will take to do the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Here is John Harrow, the farmer, for inſtance. He has a farm of 200 acres, and raiſes 400 buſhels of wheat per an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>num, which, at 20<abbr>l.</abbr> per buſhel, the preſent price, is 8000<abbr>l.</abbr> for which he ſhall pay the old accuſtomed rate of 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 in the pound; his tax will then be 600<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum.—But ſtop, the money is appreciated. John Harrow cannot get above 8<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> per buſhel for his wheat, his 400 buſhels will only amount to 160<abbr>l.</abbr> of conſequence his tax of 1<abbr>

                  </abbr>6 in the pound will yield no more than 12<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum; which is only one fiftieth part. Very pretty, truly! Why, then if this 200 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions is to be made good money, we ſhall take <hi>fifty years</hi> to pay off that portion of the debt, which would have been paid off in <hi>one year,</hi> if the money had not appreciated: That is, John Harrow, inſtead of ſelling 30 buſhels of wheat one year, at 20<abbr>l.</abbr> per buſhel, to raiſe his 600<abbr>l.</abbr> he muſt now ſell this ſame 30 buſhels for 12<abbr>l.</abbr> and have the ſame to do every year for 49 years to come; which would in fact be a tax upon John Harrow of 1500 buſhels, inſtead of 30; and all this for the honor of making our money good.</p>
               <p>WE will now, if you pleaſe, bring it upon a more general ſcale: Pennſylvania formerly raiſed by an 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 tax about 25,000<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum, at 7<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 the dollar. Now Pennſylvania being deemed 1-8th of the Continent, we may ſay the whole Thirteen States would raiſe by a 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 tax about 200,000<abbr>l.</abbr> which is ſomewhat about half a million of dollars. Thus we find it would take only about 400 years to ſink the ſaid 200 millions of dollars. But this ſame 400 years would carry us to ſo diſtant a period, that few of the preſent generation could hope to ſee a ſettlement of the account; and great frauds might be committed by our ſucceſſors; to remedy which, ſuppoſe, for the honor of the preſent race, we ſhould annually pay the whole of our incomes, or 20<abbr>

                  </abbr>6 tax would, and ſo finiſh the job in about 30 years. In the mean time, we may go abroad upon our travels, whilſt our eſtates are out at nurſe, as the Engliſh phraſe is; and at the end of

this quarter of a century we might return, and ſpend the remainder of our lives in Peace and Plenty. But pray, who are to work your eſtates in your abſence?—A good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark— Why then, we muſt 'een drudge on as ſlaves during the ſaid 25 years, live on the huſks and ſell the grain, for the honor of appreciation.</p>
               <p>YOU aſk next "how this enormous debt of 200 millions came upon us? Is it poſſible we can have expended 50 mil. per annum honeſtly and fairly, or have there been frauds and embezzlements?" All very fairly: The quantity of money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing daily beyond the medium neceſſary for circulation, a gradual depreciation took place; every one having plenty of money to buy with, the ſellers advanced their prices, in proportion to the number of bidders, 'till at length they roſe on an average to about 50 for 1. "And have the public expences been managed in this way?" Undoubtedly, all the late expenditures for the army, navy, &amp;c. have been on an average at that rate. Then, ſurely, the different receivers, and all ſubſequent handlers of the money, who have made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs pay 50 prices, ought not to have the ſame money made equal with gold; for, ſhould that be the caſe, the preſent money-holders would be enormous gainers, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for 400 years to come muſt feel its effects. Then you would have the money remain at its preſent value? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it can be kept there; but by no means carried back towards its former value.</p>
               <p>BUT the depreciation will run on rapidly if we keep ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for you intimate that the taxes we may expect to raiſe, will be but as a drop in the bucket.—Pray, what great public evil do you imagine has happened from the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation? —Oh! very great. Our money is good for nothing it will take an eſtate to go to market, every thing is ſo high that common people can ſcarcely find money enough to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the neceſſaries of life, putting taxes out of the queſtion which taxes they ſay muſt be raiſed or we ſhall be all ruined Suppoſe, I was to aſſert in anſwer, that there is at preſen no abſolute neceſſity for high government taxes, that the natural unavoidable tax of depreciation is the moſt certain expeditious and equal tax that could be deviſed. Upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which has lately exiſted, every poſſeſſor of money has paid a tax for it, in proportion to the time he hold it. Like a hackney coach it muſt be paid for by the hour. And this no man can eſcape. It is the very tax the Aſſembly of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016820_0011_0F9E8045F6842958"/>
Pennſylvania have, in vain, attempted to levy, by obliging every perſon to diſcloſe, on oath, the ſum in his poſſeſſion. I ſay, in vain; for I will venture to predict, that the Aſſeſſors will not find out one fifth part of the caſh which is actually amongſt us. But, depreciation is an Aſſeſſor that gets at every farthing, and baffles every attempt to deceive. To make myſelf better underſtood, I will ſtate an account in double columns, viz. Continental and Hard money, at the different dates of depreciation; though it is to be noted, that I have no certain documents, as to <hi>time</hi> or <hi>quantity,</hi> and that I eſtimate the depreciation by the price of gold, which has always been below every other commodity. It will ſerve however to illuſtrate my reaſoning.—When this account is examined, it will probably be thought very ſurpriſing, that the neat expences of 1779, when brought into gold, ſhould fall ſo much ſhort of thoſe in the preceding years. It cannot well be accounted for, but by ſuppoſing, that the large ſums received at the Loan-Office have made up the deficiency; but of this we have no account later than September laſt. The only certain premiſes we can procede on, are; That two hundred millions of dollars have been iſſued; that one hundred and twenty-three millions were expended Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1778; that the remaining ſeventy-ſeven millions were expended in the year 1779; and that the table of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the foregoing part of this paper, is a true ſtate of the decline of the money, when compared with gold. Be the appearance what it may, the fact is, that at whatever dates the two hundred millions have been expended, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money at thoſe dates muſt be taken for the real ſum expended; for though at one time it took ſix thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to purchaſe a thouſand barrels of flour, and at another time two hundred thouſand dollars, the actual expence to the country is exactly the ſame; it is the article ſupplied, and not the nominal ſum paid, which conſtitutes the real expenditure.</p>

               <p>BY this ſtate of the matter, the whole expences have amounted to 48 millions of hard dollars, 43 of which have been ſunk in the time by depreciation. Now I would aſk the beſt financier amongſt us, whether in four years he could have levied a tax of 43 millions of hard dollars, in a more equal or leſs expenſive way? Here have been no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to pay, no embezzlements, no public defaulters, and no appeals, except by the poſſeſſors of old contracts, who have been ungenerouſly and unjuſtly paid off in current nominal value, under ſanction of laws, which ought long ago to have been repealed.</p>
               <p>I can ſcarcely think it poſſible, that thoſe who wiſh to ſee the money reſtored to its original value, have ever adverted ſeriouſly to the ſubject. We find, that Congreſs have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, in the laſt four months, 40 millions of dollars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſums received at the Loan-Office. Now would any man, in his ſenſes, wiſh to have the Continent at the expence of above 10 millions of hard dollars per month? Is he aware that at 4<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 ſterling per dollar, it amounts to nine millions of ſterling pounds for the ſaid four months? A ſum almoſt twice as large as Great-Britain expended in any four months of the laſt war. This would be extravagance in the extreme, and the more inexcuſable as the nature of the caſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016820_0013_0F9E8047A49032F0"/>
by no means requires it. Every man who now receives the money, eſtimates it at the proper diſcount. If he ſells a houſe, a horſe, or a piece of goods, he demands at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prices for them, and in many articles vaſtly more, ſo as to have on an average near 50 prices; then, from what train of reaſoning are theſe money-holders to receive the value of a hard dollar, for every Continental dollar thus obtained, at the fiftieth part of its value? Should the war continue, emiſſions of ſome ſort muſt run on, and the money will ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ſink in value; and, politically ſpeaking, this would not be an evil, for it would ſtill operate as a gradual tax, affecting every individual in the community. Let us, for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſake, ſuppoſe that the war ſhould laſt another year. The expences of that year added to the foregoing emiſſions would probably ſtand, as follows:</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016820_0014_0F9E804819868BC0"/>IN ſtating this ſecond account, I have gone upon the principles of Congreſs having emitted, for the four laſt months, at the rate of ten millions per month; which at fifty for one, is 200,000 hard dollars. This ſum I have taken as the expenditure of every month, and have gradually va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the exchange, exactly in proportion to the quantity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, beyond the ſums required for a medium; from whence it followed, that as the rate of exchange advanced, a proportionable addition to the monthly emiſſion became neceſſary; and though the emiſſions have amounted in this eſtimate to three hundred fifty-nine millions of dollars, we find depreciation has ſtill been our faithful friend, and kept us from ſinking under the burthen. We find, notwithſtanding the enormous ſound, that the ſum of 5 1-4 millions of hard dollars would redeem them all, without any perſon having a right to complain; for, having received the money from time to time at the depreciated rate, no one could reaſonably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to reducing them to that real value.</p>
               <p>WHEN the war is over, I ſhould have no objection to a foreign loan, to pay off the whole currency at the rate then exiſting, which no man could be diſpleaſed with, and great confuſions might be avoided. We ſhould then know what was our real debt, and apply ourſelves in good earneſt to ſink both principal and intereſt as faſt as the country could bear it. But funding paper money with paper money, and paying an intereſt for what we may have without, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the middle and poorer claſs of people, who will have nothing to lend, but will be for ever paying taxes for intereſt money received by the rich. I am therefore averſe to a Loan-Office of any kind at the preſent; to enormous taxes; and by all means object to every ſcheme tending to appreciation.</p>

               <p>FROM the calculations which have been exhibited, it appears, that the <hi>real debt</hi> of America, at the end of the year 1780, will probably amount to no more than five mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and a quarter of hard dollars, excluſive of Loan-Office Certificates; which ſum will be ſunk by an 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 tax in 10 years. This is evident from the principles we have already aſſumed, viz. that Pennſylvania is eſtimated at an eighth of the Continent, and raiſes by an 1<abbr>

But, ſhould the deſired appreciation ſuccede, and the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſum, of 359 1-4 millions of dollars, become equal to its declared value, it would require near 700 years to ſink the whole. It may probably be ſaid, that a ſudden appreciation is not intended, and therefore the reaſoning, here urged, will not apply; to which I anſwer, that the evil of appreciation will be felt in exact proportion to its retrograde motion. If the general appreciation ſhould average 30 for 1 in any given time, accounting back from the preſent, and then remain fixed, I ſhould ſay, that inſtead of 400 years tax, as ſuppoſed in my former numbers, it would only take 100 years. If it was reduced to 20 for 1, it would take 200 years, if reduced to 10 for 1,300 years. Any appreciation whatever will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt the payment of the debts; it would produce an effect to which the whole circle of politics could not produce a parallel, viz. a government refunding to its inhabitants the taxes they have been paying; for we muſt inſiſt that depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation is an actual tax, and that appreciation is an actual refund. For inſtance: John Harrow, in June, 1779, when exchange was 20 for 1, ſold a pair of oxen for 200<abbr>l.</abbr> with which ſum he could have bought two pieces of linen, of 25 yards each, at 4<abbr>l.</abbr> per yard, which formerly ſold at 4<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> per yard. But John Harrow neglecting to make the purchaſe till December, when exchange was 40 for 1, he could buy with the produce of his two oxen no more than one piece of linen, becauſe the price had riſen to 8<abbr>l.</abbr> per yard; then, ſurely, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that John Harrow has paid a tax amounting to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of one ox. On the other hand, ſuppoſe John Harrow kept his money till this day, and a paper dollar ſhould paſs equal to a ſilver dollar, his 200<abbr>l.</abbr> would bring him 40 pieces of linen, by which he would gain 38 pieces. But how think you is the apparent gain to be provided for? Is it not by John Harrow, and every other farmer and inhabitant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving themſelves either in a monſtrous immediate tax, or a duration of moderate taxes on them and their heirs, to the end of the world, for aught we know.</p>
               <p>NOR will the effects of appreciation be in any way equally diſtributed. The monied man will become ſuddenly rich; but the poor man, who has ſeldom a week's caſh beforehand, will be for ever labouring under taxes, to repair the loſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on the public by appreciation. Here it muſt be noted, that I reaſon upon the ſuppoſition of a total and <hi>permanent</hi> appreciation, but I muſt ſo far do juſtice to my own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016820_0016_0F9E804BCB16BEC0"/>
as to declare my belief, that it is a matter abſolutely impracticable; for though, by ſtrenuous efforts, it might be carried into execution, and money be univerſally received at the declared value, I contend that it would be but of ſhort duration; that its quantity would inevitably operate againſt its fixture; and continually preſſing againſt the unnatural barrier, like a river dam'd in its courſe, it would quickly overflow the banks, and deluge the adjacent country with irreſiſtible fury; tearing down whole cities and villages in its way; thouſands upon thouſands would be ruined by the attempt, and general confuſion enſue. All which may be prevented by ſuffering the ſtream to flow in its natural chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, without obſtructions. Let the money find its own weight, it will balance itſelf much better than can be done by any attempt of ours.</p>
               <p>SOME are apprehenſive, that if a check is not given to depreciation, the credit of the money will be reduced to ſo low an ebb, as to become entirely ſtagnant. Theſe timid politicians would do well to look back to the money in its firſt ſtages of depreciation, and enquire of themſelves, what they would have thought, if ſome prying financier had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, that in leſs than 3 years its value ſhould ſink to 40 for 1, would they not have aſſerted, with diſdain, that the matter was impoſſible; that long before it arrived at ſuch a ſtage it would ceaſe to circulate? Nor ought their falſe judgments to have been too ſeverely reflected on, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was but little ſtudied, and leſs underſtood. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we can look back, trace its progreſs and define its cauſe. And from a ſeries of reaſoning, pronounce with ſome certainty, that no interruption to its paſſing can ariſe from its mere quantity. Should it gradually ſink, even to 1000 for 1, I freely declare my opinion, that it would paſs as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as at preſent, and would be relatively as ſcarce. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we have not, in general, ſufficiently attended to the ſubject; otherwiſe we ſhould not ſo haſtily aſſert, that the depreciation has latterly run on with rapidity. It is an error and ariſes from a want of conſidering the proper progreſſion of numbers.</p>
               <p>WHEN the money ſunk from one to two, we all agree that it ſunk one in value, when it fell from two to three, it is ſaid to have ſunken one more; but this I deny, it only ſunk half of one, and when it proceded from three to four, its gradation inſtead of being one, was only one third of one.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016820_0017_0F9E804CD302C688"/>
In other words, when it decreaſed in value from two to four, it fell no faſter than in going from one to two. From four to eight, from eight to ſixteen, and from ſixteen to thirty-two, the actual decline is no greater than from one to two. Hence we find, that when money paſſes from thirty to forty, it makes no larger ſtep, than it did in going from three to four, that is one third more. When once we get into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed numbers, we ſhould conſider, that we proceded by fractions. Exchange riſing from twenty to twenty-one, advances in fact only one twentieth. From twenty to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five is only an advance of five twentieths, or one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and from twenty to thirty it has only advanced ten twentieths, or one half; and that it muſt run all the way from twenty to forty, before the depreciation becomes as great as it did when it roſe from one to two, or from two to four; and the depreciation may continue from forty to eighty, without a greater acceleration than it had in paſſing from one to two. To render this ſubject a little more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, as well as to point out the injuſtice of the preſent laws, reſpecting the payment of debts, we will once more call upon John Harrow for an illuſtration. We will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe John to pay an annuity out of his farm of 32<abbr>l.</abbr> per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, which ſum he uſually raiſed by ſending hickory wood to town. Here the reader will obſerve that the rates of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, reſpecting the dates, are merely imaginary, and not confined to the true ſtate.</p>

               <p>BY this we perceive, that in 1776, money falling from the full value to two for one, John ſaved half of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wood which he cut in 1775—In 1777 he ſaved half of the quantity cut in 1776—In 1778 he ſaved half of the quantity cut in 1777—In 1779 he ſaved half the quantity cut in 1778,—and in 1780 he ſaved half the quantity cut in 1779. When exchange went from par to two, it only advanced one in number, and when it proceded from ſixteen to thirty-two, tho' the depreciation was deemed alarming, its progreſs was but juſt equal to the variation from one to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016820_0018_0F9E804D7B1EB460"/>
two. In the firſt caſe he ſent but half the quantity he did the preceding year; and in the ſecond caſe he likewiſe ſent but half the quantity; and thus we may go on to a very high amount. From the rate of thirty-two for one, we muſt proceed as far as ſixty-four for one, before the money will ſuffer depreciation equal to the firſt alteration from one to two, and it muſt then go on to one hundred and twenty-eight for one, before it has made another ſtride ſimilar to the firſt. Now let any perſon look back to the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of depreciation, and he will find that he has leſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be alarmed, at this day, then he had when it varied from one to two. The jump then made, would have been truly alarming, if it had been properly attended to, but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of caprice, fear and intereſt, produced an effect of which few were aware; and theſe cauſes continued to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, perhaps, till it arrived to four or ſix for one; by which time, I ſhould ſuppoſe, that the waves which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the agitation of the paſſions, were pretty well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and the ſurface of the financial ocean reſtored to its proper level. Effects followed their cauſes, and the ſwell increaſed but as the wind blew. The quantity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney determined its value, and ſo it would probably continue to an exceſs which I ſhould not chooſe to enter on. I know of no period to depreciation, or cauſe of ſtoppage from mere quantity. I am very ſenſible that thoſe who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven themſelves the trouble to think on this ſubject, will charge me with uſing needleſs repetitions, and labouring the matter beyond what is neceſſary. But it is a ſubject of great importance, and cannot be too fully and cloſely inveſtigated. The more points of view we place it in, the better it will be underſtood.</p>
               <p>In Portugal they calculate in mille-rees; that is, in pieces of ſilver, ſuppoſed to contain 1000 parts, being ſomewhat more than one of the Spaniſh dollars; now a thouſandth part of a dollar is a ſum of which, at firſt view, we have no adequate idea, when compared with a farthing, which is our loweſt denomination; but affixing to it a compound va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, or calling it a mille-ree, we can readily ſubdivide it low enough for every purpoſe of trade. Then ſuppoſe deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould continue till it reached 1000 for 1, and we ſhould change the denomination of a dollar to a mille-dollar, that is to a dollar ſubdivided into a thouſand parts, we ſhould as eaſily keep our accounts, and tranſact the affairs of trade
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016820_0019_0F9E804E27B50230"/>
with as much preciſion, as if we were trading in hard dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. A paper bill inſtead of being called one dollar might repreſent the thouſandth part of a dollar, and anſwer every purpoſe of money, if the rate was once eſtabliſhed. And this mode of calculation might continue, even after the paper dollars were all conſumed by a foreign loan, and real gold and ſilver became the only money current. Some may probably think I treat the point in too viſionary a manner; but I requeſt them to ſit down ſeriouſly to the ſubject, and I will then venture to pronounce that they will inevitably fall into my train of thinking.</p>
               <p>THEY will quickly acknowledge, that it is not the amount of nominal dollars which conſtitutes the debt of America; which alone ariſes from the <hi>real</hi> value of home produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, of foreign goods impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>d, and of labour, wages and ſalaries paid; theſe conſtitute our debt. With reſpect to the nominal amount in paper money, I contend that it is of ſmall importance, whether the ſum be called 5 millions or 500 millions, with this proviſo, that we do not, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, tranſmute paper into ſilver, and determine at all events to pay a hard dollar for every imaginary dollar emitted.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the crew of Captain Cooke's ſhip, in his 3 years voyage round the South-Pole, had carried their amuſement of gaming to ſo high a pitch, that it became neceſſary to paſs notes of hand for the payment of the ſums loſt, and that theſe notes had amounted to millions of pounds: Suppoſe they had even divided the entire ſtock of proviſions, and ſome had won from the others their whole ſhare. I would aſk, whether the ſhip would be interrupted in her voyage by ſuch exchange of property, or would ſhe be leſs able to procede than if no ſuch gaming had happened. As a little Common-wealth, her internal reſources and abilities would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remain the ſame; the rich muſt of neceſſity permit the poor to partake of the ſtock for the common good of the voyage, and the ſhip's general deſign of making new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, would be proſecuted without any other difficulties, than thoſe naturally incident to the ſea, and the gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the ſhip's ſtock of proviſions. If freſh ſupplies could from time to time be procured, they might ſail, play and paſs notes from year to year, till the ſhip's bottom could bear them no longer; but ſhould it prove impracticable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch ſupplies, then, and not till then, the voyage

would from neceſſity terminate. So with America—Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the country can ſupply the actual neceſſaries of government, no exceſs of paper money can prove a bar thereto. What we have moſt to fear is from injudicious attempts to give a value to our currency beyond what its quantity demands.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to prove, that the decreaſe of the value of money has been generally occaſioned by its increaſed quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; that in its progreſs it has operated as a tax; that Loan-Office Certificates are money to all intents and purpoſes, and therefore the intereſt ariſing thereon is a burthen on the community, without our deriving the advantage thereby propoſed; that in good policy, theſe Certificates ſhould all be called in, and a juſt compenſation made to the holders; that foreign loans, during the preſent war, may prove ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous drains to the Continent, and can anſwer no one good purpoſe more effectually than paper money would; that a total appreciation of the ſum now current, would bring us under a debt, which an 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 tax for 400 years would ſcarcely clear us from, when on the contrary it is evident, the ſame tax of 1<abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr>6 would ſink the whole in leſs than ten years, if the money ſhould remain at its preſent value. I have alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew, that depreciation has not been ſo rapid as was generally thought; that an increaſe of quantity ought not to alarm us; that the fear of its becoming ſtagnant is entirely groundleſs, and that it would circulate as freely as at preſent, although the quantity ſhould be encreaſed to a great exceſs.</p>
               <p>IF the thoughts I have here thrown together ſhould be deemed injurious to the common intereſts of America, I ſhould be obliged to the writer who would point it out; and ſhould be happy to be releaſed from the dread which has long preyed on my mind, that a general diſtreſs would be brought on the country by appreciating the money. I declare upon honor, that I am no other way intereſted in the event, than as a citizen of America; nor have I, in a ſingle inſtance, an advantage to make by depreciation, but am daily ſuffering by it. I have ſtated my ſentiments with candour, and ſubmit them to the public; and all I aſk in return, is a candid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, and fair refutation, if I am wrong.</p>
