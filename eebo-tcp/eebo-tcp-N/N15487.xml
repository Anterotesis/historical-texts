            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE respect which the Society of the Cincinnati have discovered for your public character inassociating you to their institution, and the affectionate regard which is known to actuate many of its members towards you, in a private relation, are among the motives which induce me to offer you the dedication of a performance, which their partiality has brought into public view.</p>
            <p>As there is no person to whom a review of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may with greater propriety be presented, than to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whose eminent services, in every stage of the war, have justly secured for him the most exalted estimation of his country: So, sir, there is no one within my knowledge, to whose candor and friendship I would rather recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the following production for justice and patronage, than to yourself.</p>
            <p>A stranger to every species of adulation, it is with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident integrity I tell the world, that this is not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

of servile flattery, but the Sincere acknowledgment of one who considers himself highly honored by your friendship, and who will always be solicitous to merit the continuance of a connection, which is at once his pleasure and his boast.</p>

            <p>IMPRESSED with a grateful sense of the flattering dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, which an election to the duty of this day has conferred, and desirous of doing justice to the favorable opinions of my present friends, and former fellow-Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have ventured to accept the hazardous appointment of this honorable station: But when I reflect on the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may <hi>possibly</hi> have been formed—when I consider my own inequality to meet the discernment of this respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table audience, or to answer expectations which the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of my <hi>subject</hi> may have suggested.—I confess that my presumption has transgressed the limits of prudence; and I solicit your candor and indulgence to what might otherwise be considered an excess of dutiful indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

REVOLVING seasons have returned the anniversary of that auspicious day, which hailed our country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and gave freedom to a world.</p>
            <p>To commemorate this vast event—to trace its progress, and mark its confirmation—to observe its influence, and to offer a general anticipation of its consequences, form the interesting objects of our present purpose.—</p>
            <p>PAYING the pious tribute of our gratitude and adoration to the Great Disposer of Human Events, and imploring his continued care and protection over our infant republic, we pass, with pleasing comprehension, to contemplate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of his almighty will and power.</p>
            <p>As it is far from being our wish, I trust it will not be considered our intention (in reciting the causes and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of our late momentous struggle) to revive past en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or to awaken animosities, which respect for our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal character, and the maxims of our faith, should alike dispose us forever to forget and to forgive.</p>
            <p>IT is wisdom to obliterate offences, when their effects have ceased; and it is the dictate of justice to dismiss the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of an injury, which reparation has amply atoned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:019733_0006_0FACA60D6340BFF0"/>
OUR recapitulation of the contest, though but a frail re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of their merits, is due in gratitude to the memory of those heroes, who were Martyrs in the cause of freedom.—The remarks on the sufferings of our country, are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impress the value of that object for which they were sustained; and the deeds of her distinguished citizens are brought forward with no other view, than as being the best incentives to public virtue.—Here then the acrimony of revenge, and the servility of adulation, are both disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as utterly unconnected with those generous principles, which prompted and atchieved our glorious revolution.</p>
            <p>At a period <note n="*" place="bottom">1763.</note> when wisdom, valour, and commercial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence had raised the British empire to pre-eminence over the rest of Europe—when contending kingdoms confessed her superiority, and yielded to her power—when her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial progeny aided her efforts, and shared in her success—when maternal tenderness should have met the advance of filial affection, and cherished an equal endearment.—In this moment of pride and delusion, forgetful of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent acknowledgments, and insensible to past obligation, she puts off the benignity of the parent, and assumes the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of a despot.</p>
            <p>ANXIOUS only to support the splendor of her court, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019733_0007_0FACA60E23FDBAD8"/>
the convenience of her rulers, she extends a tyranny to the extremities of her empire; and, to promote the sordid views of pensioners and place-men, she departs from her national characteristics of generosity and honor.</p>
            <p>A SYSTEM of unconditional slavery towards her colonies is adopted—commercial restrictions are imposed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constitutional taxes attempted to be levied—distinctions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a great nation, and subversive of human equality, are endeavored to be drawn by this unwise and haughty people.</p>
            <p>THE humble petitions of her oppressed children, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed with contempt, and their dutiful remonstrances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with threats and scorn.—The mandates of despotism are issued for military execution, and no alternative prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but the dagger or the rod.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>compelled</hi> to commit our equitable claims to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of arms, and to the event of a contest, rendered still more doubtful by the unprovided state of our magazines, and the defenceless situation of our country, It is the GLORY of America that she balanced not, when freedom or slavery became the alternative, to take the field against a nation of established military character, powerful in resources, and the <hi>then</hi> acknowledged sovereign of the sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:019733_0008_0FACA60EE251BC70"/>
THE love of Liberty outweighed the horrors of war, and death, in its defence, was esteemed an eligible retreat from national servitude. Neither the immediate sufferings of the camp, nor the darkened prospect of protracted war, could damp that ardor which fed the hopes of freedom, nor lessen the sense of those wrongs that urged an irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble separation from our unnatural foe. But, anterior to this ultimate determination, all other means had failed, and the patience of oppressed humanity been long exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—relentless hostility had raged throughout our country, and every aggravation of embittered warfare, been indiscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately inflicted.</p>
            <p>A LIBATION of patriotic blood had been poured to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty on the plains of Lexington.—The virtuous Warren and his brave associates had bled at the altar of honor and their country on Bunker's-Hill.—The flames of Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town had illumined the glory of that day—and every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of compulsion and resistance at once character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ised the vindictive measures of Britain, and the inflexible firmness of her patriotic opponents—As the prelude to an obstinate and bloody war, too frequently stained in its progress with wanton cruelty—We here survey a scene brilliant as the brightest fancy can form, and interesting as every feeling of humanity can render it:—A scene which should impress indelible respect and veneration for the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019733_0009_0FACA60FA22E3A98"/>
memory of those gallant men who upheld the claims of freedom, and maintained the rights of humankind:—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained heroes, who resigned not the trust conferred by their country but with life, nor until repeated repulse had convinced their outnumbering assailants, that the dream of unresisted oppression vanished at Bunker's-Hill.</p>
            <p>THUS were the dark designs of despotism disclosed, and the desolating sword of war unsheathed to support them.</p>
            <p>AT this awful crisis of national calamity the genius of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom descends to direct the councils of America, and the shield of liberty is entrusted to the illustrious WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON;—distinguished amidst the delegated virtue and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her chosen sons, he is elected to lead her armies, and conduct her last appeal.—Propitious appointment! and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of every blessing, which the fondest expectation of anxious freedom could have hoped from the choice:—Far from declining the arduous task which his merits had assigned him, he sacrifices every private consideration to an exalted sense of public duty, quits the pleasures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement without a personal regret, and resigns, with chearfulness, the enjoyments of affluence and domestic felicity, to encounter fatigue and danger in the cause of his country—affording to the world an unparalelled example of every virtue which should adorn the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019733_0010_0FACA6106945F2D0"/>
10, or distinguish the friend of humanity, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to posterity a fame which shall survive the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of time, and the revolutions of empire.</p>
            <p>THE generous flame is communicated, and pervades the continent. An ardor of public spirit, which Rome in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest period of her commonwealth, would have boasted, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused through every class of citizens, and a new trait of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is disclosed in the warm affections of whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to each other—affections which, it is devoutly to be wished, a just sense of social happiness and national safety may long continue to cherish and preserve, as the most certain means to secure domestic tranquility and foreign respect.</p>
            <p>THE nature of the contest now required, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of self preservation, sanctioned the operations of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive war.—The British troops in Boston were besieged,—and an army, led by the gallant Montgomery, marched into Canada—not to plunder and undistinguished slaughter—but to authorised invasion, and retaliation approved by the rules of war. Observant of humanity he spares the vanquished; and, moved alike by compassion and policy, he protects the unresisting. Victory, for a season, flatters the fond hopes of his admiring country; and fortune, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to his merit, attends the progress of his arms: But, alas! in the very moment, when success seemed to promise
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019733_0011_0FACA61122BCE220"/>
the completion of his reward, relentless fate arrests his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious career, and he is numbered with the illustrious dead. His faithful followers, deprived of their beloved leader, reduced in number, and exposed, without equipment, to the rigor of an inclement season, are obliged to abandon their hard-earned conquests; and, after sustaining, with unexampled firmness, every hardship attendant on war, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire reluctant from superior force.</p>
            <p>HERE, CARLETON, as the distinguished contrast of thy fellow-leaders, receive an acknowledgment from one, who, no longer an enemy, but an admirer, is happy in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic occasion of declaring thy conduct, whether dictated by prudence or humanity, to have been highly honorable and magnanimous.—It is the pride of gratitude to praise an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—it is the boast of human nature to merit the enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus traced out the leading features of war, we must beg leave to observe, that the limits assigned to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation admit not a <hi>particular</hi> recital of its varied progress. It is not permitted us to indulge in a minute review of the wisdom and firmness of those councils, which planned the happiness and freedom of America; or to contemplate in detail the conduct and gallantry of those heroes, who maintained the strenuous struggle, and established her claims to independence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:019733_0012_0FACA611E46006E8"/>
IT will be the pleasing province of history to render parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular justice to their merits, and the grateful voice of posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be employed to pronounce the panegyric of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues—The delighted muse shall dwell with rapture on the relation of their worth; and science, supported by truth, shall perpetuate the remembrance of their actions, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize their fame.</p>
            <p>BE it our humble endeavor, in a general and summary retrospect of <hi>that</hi> period, which will form the most splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did portion of history, to excite an emulation of the virtues, which then prevailed, and to restore the practice of them.</p>
            <p>WE have already remarked on the origin and progress of the contest, to the time when resistance succeeded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, and the rights of defence took place of petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—we have conducted our dignified commander in chief to the head of his armies, and we have noticed an unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attempt to accelerate the restoration of peace by an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Canada—Returning to a more important scene of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, we find that, in the blockade of Boston, the deficits of discipline and military skill are supplied by bravery and perseverance.—The veterans of Europe, compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their influence, seek safety in retreat, and quit indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant freedom's guarded shore.</p>

THE system of subjugation is changed, and calculating, with an arrogant confidence, on the facility, with which the weaker and less populous parts of the continent might be assailed, invasion directs her course to the westward,—and, strengthened by the mercenary bands of Brunswick and Hesse, the hopes of tyranny are raised to certain conquest, and unconditional submission. But failing to intimidate by a mere display of power, or the menace of immense ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maments, recourse is had to an insidious policy—insult is added to injury, in proclamations of proffered pardon to a people, against whom every outrage of hostility had been practised. Baffled in this base attempt to awe the timid, or to impose on the unwary, the resentments of disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition are kindled into rage—the sword is resumed, and the devastations of war are destined to effect what threats and cunning had failed to accomplish: But the fortitude of America is found every way correspondent with her claims to political justice—undismayed by disaster, as unelated by victory,—she sustains defeat without despondency, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports success with moderation—The one serves but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden—the other was never used to sanctify oppression.</p>
            <p>ACCOMMODATION being thus at an end, and the hopes of peace, on honorable terms, entirely removed—it deeply interested the safety and honor of America, to deliberate with temper, and to determine with firmness.</p>

SUCCEEDING ages shall admire with astonishment, while they review with veneration, the MAGNANIMOUS DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION of that EVENTFUL DAY, when an illustrious assembly of patriotic chiefs preferred an appeal to Heaven, and hurl'd defiance to a tyrants throne—when, devoted to the public weal, they rose superior to the threats of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hailed THEIR COUNTRY FREE!—And whether the CAUSE, the CIRCUMSTANCES, or the CONSEQUENCE of this stupendous act are considered, it will command to latest time the honor and the homage of a wondering world—Coercive in its cause, chequered in its circumstances, yet completely happy in its consequence—It is impossible to reconsider all its scenes, without the mingled emotions of indignant freedom, philosophic won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and religious gratitude.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the separation of an empire, whose extent of territory, and energy of power, vied with the strength and limits of imperial Rome.</p>
            <p>THUS freed from the fetters of dependence, and ranked among the powers of the earth, America presents a theatre of glory to the brave and the virtuous of all nations—and afford, to philosophy a new subject of contemplation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause—for, altho war, which has conquest for its object, must ever excite the regret and reprehension of the good
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019733_0015_0FACA61423D051D8"/>
and just—yet resistance, when consequent on oppression, will engage even the wish of religion in its behalf; and the prayer of the pious will be preferred for its success.</p>
            <p>A CONSONANCE with this sentiment distinguished the conduct of many friends of that very respectable persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which constitutes so large a part of our religious socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—Departing from the strictness of that opinion, which is opposed to all warfare, they considered themselves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorised, but called on, to protect their property and freedom, at every hazard—and to repel the invaders of their country by the interposition of human means—others, equally impressed with the value of the object, for which we contended, but swayed by the scruples of belief—though they declined the duties of the field, were not wanting in the exercise of every attention, which might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate the misfortunes of their country, or soothe the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of such as suffered in her cause.</p>
            <p>GLORY and spoil are the ordinary inducements to war—but here more powerful motives prevailed, and urged our citizens to arms. The hearth and the altar (to use the language of the ancients) were invaded, and it became the indispensible duty of all, who loved the one, or venerated the other, to defend them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:019733_0016_0FACA614E25C3FD8"/>
WITH such incentives to action, and such cause of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, was the contest renewed, and continued during the alternate success of seven years warfare.—The exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the state demanded the best exertions of its ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; and to their immortal honor will it be recorded, that those exertions were made with every sacrifice of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and convenience.</p>
            <p>THE summer and autumn of 1776 (if we except the glorious repulse of the British marine, at Sullivan's-island, by the gallant Moultrie, and some less advantages) were passed in an unsuccessful defence: For, notwithstanding the masterly movements, and skilful retreats of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Fabius, his force was insufficient to stem the torrent of success, and his resources unequal to maintain the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he had so ably chosen.</p>
            <p>As the winter approached the enlistments of the troops expired, and the strength of the army was impaired.</p>
            <p>THE gloom of adversity darkened, and the firmest friend of freedom felt its influence—But still there were those who despaired not of the commonwealth—and such were their noble efforts, as to restore the confidence of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the vigor of her arms.</p>
            <p>

WHILE the love of liberty shall continue to designate the generous and the just—or deeds of heroism to animate the brave—the victory of Trenton will be regarded as the rescue of freedom—and the surprirze at Princeton be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the master-piece of war. It was there the tide of conquest turned, and the low'r of invasion brightened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hope—it was there that freedom nerved the naked arm which struck oppression to the ground, and heroic virtue, in the garb of wretchedness, wrested the tyrant's standard from the hireling's hand—and it was there that Pennsylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia proclaimed, by deeds of worth, the deservings of her sons, and her sacred regard to that faith, which she had pledged to maintain the confederated empire.</p>
            <p>REJOICE, ye Pennsylvanians, in the rich reflection—and relate it to your children, as the most powerful incentive to virtue—bid them repeat it to their sons as the great eulogium of their ancestors, and the best boast of an illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious offspring.</p>
            <p>A JOYFUL confidence succeeds to hopeless amazement, and the grateful plaudit of America salutes the return of success—her fears are transferred to her invaders, whose cares are now confined to their own immediate safety, and whose anxieties are rather those of security than conquest—But, as the season advances, their alarm subsides—and, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving

the advantages of their naval superiority, they wage a war of plunder and predatory descent—defenceless villages become the objects of military exploit, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less marauders, conducted by a Dunmore, or a Tryon, are suffered to sacrifice the honors of humanity, and to disgrace the duties of civilization.</p>
            <p>A MORE important scheme of conquest is projected, and, assisted by a powerful marine, the hostile armies of Britain are wafted to the shores of the Chesapeak—thence, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their inroad, they advance to the Brandywine, where zeal and bravery are forced to yield to discipline and numbers—and the sword of injustice is, for a season, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prevail.</p>
            <p>As it was here that his career of glory commenced, my audience will indulge, with peculiar pleasure, the tribute of praise and grateful affection, which is due to that most excellent friend, citizen, and fellow-soldier, the Mrquis de la Fayette—to whose generous exertions and ardent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment America is indebted for numerous benefits, and whose ennobled mind is, at this moment, exercised in the practice of every virtue which may promote her happiness.</p>
            <p>RECEIVE, illustrious chief, the most sincere acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an obliged country, and be persuaded that, while
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019733_0019_0FACA61723D33BF0"/>
patriotism and private worth shall be held objects of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and applause, thy virtues will be venerated, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy merits be continued the delightful theme of distant posterity.</p>
            <p>MISGUIDED by a momentary belief, the British chiefs are led to imagine their purpose accomplished in the reduction of our capital—nor, until the din of arms disturbs the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, do they perceive that they have only changed their situation, and secured a winter's cantonment.</p>
            <p>THE hopes of America were now placed beyond the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of a battle, and her darings were no longer controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by defeat.—The defence of the Delaware will long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a monument of political firmness, and military intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity—and the relation of Germantown shall incite to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize and deeds of active valour—Nor is this scene of the war the only subject of her glory—a similar spirit actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the extremes of the continent, and the call of freedom is every where obeyed with zeal and alacrity.</p>
            <p>THE success of the British arms in Canada, had been followed by an irruption so formidable as to alarm the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and to threaten the most dangerous consequences to our cause—But, in this moment of discomfiture and defeat, when the silken slaves of luxury would have yielded to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019733_0020_0FACA617E2981058"/>
their fears, and sunk under the apprehensions of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the hardy sons of New-England crouded to the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of resistance—and, assisted by their gallant friends of the south, oppose, with success, an half armed yeomanry to the bravest legions of Europe. Their confidence is strengthened by difficulty—and, from supporting a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defence, they are enabled to direct the storm of war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their invaders—partial inroads are repelled, and plundering detachments captured—The cruel hatchet is turned upon its merciless master, and his more barbarous companions of the war—and, although heart-felt injuries gave a rage to resentment, which required all the powers of reason and reflection to compose, yet to the lasting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of humanity will it be remembered, that the deeply grieved American urged no retaliation—nor, when continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conflict and determined superiority, had reduced the brave Burgoyne and his army to surrender, did the generous Gates insist on a single condition, which a vanquished enemy might not receive with honor.—To enhance this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous conduct, be it also remembered, that in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, when the feelings of a foe were spared, the torch of vindictive fury was brandished by a British chief—and defenceless villages were reduced to ashes to sate his savage thirst of vengeance. <note n="*" place="bottom">General Vaughan, who burnt Esopus, and retired with the precipitation of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

IT was not my intention to have noticed the conduct of this incendiary—but to have passed him, as we must many others, in silent abhorrence—although, as the character of an individual, it stands contrasted by another, and the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of generous humanity are so far relieved.</p>
            <p>WE have now reached that period of the war, which gave sanction to our pretensions as a free people—and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, contributed to determine the avowed friendship of that monarch, the magnanimity and moderation of whose councils have rendered him the umpire of nations—for, it is most consistent with propriety to presume that, until we had, in a sufficient degree, discovered a disposition and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to support ourselves, justice to his kingdom forbad an alliance, which must involve a bloody and expensive war: but when it was announced that an army of ten thousand, the best appointed troops of Europe, led by the bravest and most experienced officers, had, after every effort of skill and bravery, been compelled to surrender prisoners of war, the gloom, which obscured our independence, was removed, and conviction of our worth, as a nation, was established throughout the world.</p>
            <p>HERE then let us render our acknowledgments, where they are so well deserved—and, if to gratulate the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gates in that hour of conquest, which dispelled the

darkest cloud of invasion—or, by anticipation, to sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thise with him in the moment of military uncertainty, which not even his talents could avert, shall incline to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and generous sentiment, let us indulge the delightful emotion, and do justice to the finest feelings of the soul.</p>
            <p>CONNECTED, on terms of entire equality, by a close and well observed alliance, America beheld her cause espoused by the most powerful potentate of Europe (Louis the Just) whose strict attention to his royal engagements became the guarantee of her independence—whose generous assistance abridged the term of her probation, and greatly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to secure the completion of her claims.</p>
            <p>ARMAMENTS arrive to our assistance, and the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous characters of France are solicitous to share in our dangers—her treasures are opened to our relief, and the bravest of her warriors bleed in our behalf.—GENEROUS and GALLANT NATION! long may the remembrance of thy friendship remain graven in the hearts of a grateful people—and bonds of endeared amity be strengthened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us!</p>
            <p>AN attempt was now made to detach us from our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust ally—and insidious negociation, on terms of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was proposed—but, as incompatible with our national

honor, it was nobly rejected; and war, with all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, was preferred to unjust and inglorious treaty.</p>
            <p>ALARMED for their safety, the British army abandon our metropolis, and are happy in regaining a station where, secured from sudden assault, they may mediate at leisure less honorable warfare, and execute the purposes of rapine with impunity.</p>
            <p>THE assertors of their country's liberty, led by their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious chief, march from the scene of their worth and sufferings at Valley-Forge, to watch over her safety—and, after an ardent endeavour to establish her tranquillity at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, they prepare to encounter farther trials of toil and danger in her cause.</p>
            <p>THE reserve of the enemy, which had changed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test from daring activity, to observation and a war of posts, did not relax the duties of the field—which, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of that firm friend and most excellent officer, the Baron de Steuben, were improved into exact discipline, and military perfection—distinguished proofs of which were soon afforded, in the reduction of two garrisons, where such instances of intrepidity, and skill were exhibited, as will ever endear the names of <note n="†" place="bottom">Stony-Point stormed by General Wayne—and Paules-Hook taken by Col.

            <p>THE southern states, during this period, although occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally oppressed by marine descent, and savage incursion, had not, since the attempt on Charleston, been threatened with serious invasion.</p>
            <p>BUT the restraints which were now imposed on the British army to the northward, induced a renewal of the war in that part of the continent, where, notwithstanding the advantages derived to the enemy, from their naval force, and a decided superiority of troops, such was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous temper of the people as to set every evil at defiance in the defence of their principles—indigence and exile were preferred to wealth and dependence—and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the field to inglorious safety.—The human charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has at no time shone with more resplendent lustre, than in the generous sacrifices, which were here made to the maintenance of public faith and private honor.</p>
            <p>THE reduction of their capital and the loss of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty served but to strengthen those engagements which bound the Georgian to his country—and the rigors of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity were endured without regret.

THE active operations of the war were now transferred to the south, and there continued to rage until its close.</p>
            <p>TO recover the possessions, which had been wrested from us, the most generous assistance was afforded by our allies—and the richest blood of France was shed to support our cause.</p>
            <p>WHILE gratitude is deemed a virtue, and heroism is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with applause, the brave D'Estaing, and his gallant companions will command the respect, and enjoy the warmest affections of our country.</p>
            <p>THE force of the British arms being now directed to the subjugation of the southern states—a powerful armament, conducted by their commander in chief, was destined to reduce the capital of South-Carolina, at this time regarded as the mart of that country—and the deposit of our military stores—Their sudden approach denied an opportunity of removing the magazines, or providing for the security of our marine—and in the event of a siege, which became the only alternative, the brave garrison, after a most distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished defence, were borne down by an irresistable superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority.</p>
            <p>The career of success was long uninterrupted, and the sufferings of the country grievous beyond description.</p>

IT was then that the martial GREENE arrived to rule the tide of war—Far from supposing a fatality in human affairs, he employs the virtues of conduct and resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the ills of adversity—and relies on no expectation for relief, but the resources of his genius, and the active exertions of his mind.</p>
            <p>NOBLY seconded by an army, whose ardor encreases with difficulty, and to whom danger is an object of choice, he becomes the sword of his country, and the keen aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of her wrongs—repulse does not remove the dread which he inspires, and he is alike formidable on the eve of defeat, as in the morn of conquest—The budding laurel of Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford blossomed at Eutaw.</p>
            <p>IT was in this hard fought field for fame and freedom, that the most brilliant seats of military prowess were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played—Equalled in valour, and surpassed in skill, the British chief beheld the talents of his antagonist with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and the firmness of his troops with alarm—conscious that his success had heretofore been supported by a first impression, he saw with sorrow that impression effaced—and a confidence created, which GREENE alone could inspire.</p>
            <p>ANTICIPATING the event of farther contest, he seeks to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019733_0027_0FACA61D229CDED0"/>
shun so formidable a foe—and, hastening to join his friends in Virginia, he leaves the country, which he had ravaged, to be recovered, and restored to tranquillity by the Camillus of America.</p>
            <p>THE Briton meets a second Opponent in the gallant la Fayette, whose skill and bravery requires his vigilance, and commands his respect—a superior army is awed into defence, and the country protected until that glorious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, which confirmed our freedom and closed the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of war.</p>
            <p>ARRIVED at the last scene of our military drama, we are now to contemplate the generous conduct of the allied ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies towards each other, and their brilliant behavior as brothers of the war.</p>
            <p>LED by the great CAPTAIN of his country, and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the powerful marine of France, they bend their course of conquest to the south; and, having reached the object of their emulation, they commence in concert the invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that army, whose reduction completes the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of war, and affixes the seal of certainty to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's peace.</p>
