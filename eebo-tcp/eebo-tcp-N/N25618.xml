            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON FREE MASONRY.</head>
            <p>AS you are no ſtranger, Madam, to my enthuſiaſtic opinion, that Morpheus is frequently accompanied by ſome ſupernat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural companion, in his midnight wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I flatter myſelf that you will indulge me with the peruſal of one of my moon light excurſions. The maſonic figures can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by your reſpectable companion, who, from principles of benevolence, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to gratify you; and perhaps, Madam, it may occaſion your becoming a convert to a good opinion of the ſublime art.</p>
            <p>The dreary ſeaſon, ill health, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſpirits which unfits me for ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034027_0003_0FFA2FCEFB244628"/>
occaſion my devoting a part of my time to dreaming. And what is life, but a dream? Half the world appears to moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage when aſleep; and I am one of that number.</p>
            <p>The Right Worſhipful Maſter, after pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the encloſed, (ſhould he confer upon me that honor) will, with his uſual pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry, I expect, aſk when I was initiated. I anſwer—At my birth. <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> preſided: <hi>Wiſdom, Strength</hi> and <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> refuſed to attend. And, with unuſual care and attention, my three godmothers, ere the dawn of reaſon expanded my ideas, laid the foundation of a maſonic ſtructure, Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Philanthropy, in my breaſt. Are there not Miltons at the plough, and Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the field? And why not Maſoneſſes at the toilet? If ſecrecy in charity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to oblige a neighbor or a friend, are pillars of the Craft, our ſex may vie with a Solomon, a Hiram, or the beſt ancient or modern maſter builders, in raiſing them.</p>
            <p>The ſublime inſtitution of Maſonry, I fancy, was ordained by the wiſe Architect of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034027_0004_0FFA2FD1F62F9118"/>
the univerſal Lodge, to <hi>level</hi> the maſculine character of the other ſex with the feminine ſoftneſs of ours; by <hi>tempering</hi> Courage, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Gravity, with Candor, Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Charity, and <hi>cementing</hi> them with Friendſhip, Senſibility and Affection. Were our ſex admitted into the ſociety, it would counteract the grand deſign, as we have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally too great a proportion of thoſe delicate feelings, in our compoſition, for our own happineſs. The ſcience of Maſonry, I view as a refined ſtudy of nature, entirely diveſted of thoſe inſidious arts, that (from their <hi>ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, order,</hi> and <hi>ſigns,</hi> by which the Brethren diſcover themſelves to each other) many ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſons, of both ſexes, have been led to believe they practiſe. It is a ſcience, that is both uſeful and inſtructive. It refines the underſtanding, ſoftens the manners, blends together every virtue of the human heart, and teaches us to diſtinguiſh between the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of fortune, and real merit. Maſonry has been ſtiled the "Daughter of Heaven, Patroneſs of the liberal arts, that poliſh and adorn the mind," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034027_0005_0FFA2FD9B68A14F8"/>As we naturally eſteem our companions, in proportion as they excel us in knowledge, Is it not happy for us, that Maſonry is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to man? Happy, thrice happy, would it have been for her deſcendants, if Madam Eve, inſtead of taſting the apple, had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely preſented it to her ſpouſe. This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was never rectified, till the eaſtern Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch was inſpired with the ideas of building a temple, founding a Lodge, and conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as ſacred forever from the old lady's female deſcendants. But we enjoy this pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſolation, that it has a tendency to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach them to our ſex—"Next to the Deity," ſays a Right Worſhipful Maſter, at the cloſe of a charge to his Lodge, "whom can I ſo properly addreſs myſelf to, as to the moſt beautiful part of the creation. The ſanction of the fair is our higheſt ambition; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it will be our greateſt care." And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though flattery may be termed a foible, (if the Honorable Fraternity will pardon the expreſſion) in ſome inſtances, in this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it appears a virtue. "Honey," ſays the proverb, "has caught more flies than
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034027_0006_0FFA2FDB853E7BC8"/>
vinegar;" and who is proof againſt the charm of adulation, when the alluring bait is ſo delicately gilt.</p>
            <p>To be ſerious. A good Maſon may be compared to a reſpectable Divine. The lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the former, and the precepts of the latter, are equally intereſting. One inſtructs us in the principles of morality; the other explains the myſteries of divinity: Both point to the ſame grand view—the temple of Virtue. The three ſteps of this noble edifice, Juſtice, Love and Mercy, it is in our power to aſcend; and were we clothed with Wiſdom, Strength and Beauty, and adorned with Faith and Charity, reclining on Hope, we might extend our proſpect, and, with the aid of three times three, be introduced into the <hi>Royal Arch</hi> of Safety, which would preſerve us from the dangerous ſhoals and quickſands of folly and diſſipation, upon which ſo many of the vain and thoughtleſs, of both ſexes, ſuffer ſhipwreck.</p>
            <p>A good Maſon muſt be a good man; and a good man is a Maſon. Upon the pillars of Juſtice, Benevolence, and Humility, he

               <p>IN conſequence of an invitation from one of the members of the Honorable Fraternity, the other evening, to viſit a Lodge, my thoughts were engaged with the ſubject of ſuch a viſit, and I fell into a moſt profound reverie.

ſake,</hi> to complete the order, ſat upon his right; the Senior and Junior Grand War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, agreeably to their ancient cuſtom, were placed in the Eaſt and Weſt; the tapers were eclipſed amidſt a blaze of jewels, which were excelled only by the bright luminary of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in meridian ſplendor. No eloquence can convey an idea of the <hi>beauty, order,</hi> and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which reigned. Like the glory of the apoſtle's third heaven, it could not be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They were ſuch, indeed, as the eye of the uninitiated hath not ſeen, nor hath it entered into the heart of a cowan to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.

               <p>After admiring their prudence in exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing females, (for it would be ſcarcely poſſible for the different ſexes to aſſemble and keep ſilence, even in heaven, for half an hour,) I

In a moment, as if by enchantment, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a beautiful fabric, whoſe baſe was Benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and whoſe ſtrength was Peace and Harmony.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE neglected to ſend you the incloſed copy of a Letter, (accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Maſonic Viſion) which I wrote to Mrs. *****, from the conjectures which aroſe in my mind, reſpecting the purpoſe it might anſwer. I, at length, indulge your requeſt, not to gratify my vanity, or ſound the trumpet of fame; but, perhaps, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you a little hilarity at high meridian.</p>
            <p>My connections with the maſonic order, naturally lead me to reverence it. I am the daughter, the ſiſter, and have been twice the beloved wife, of a Maſon; yet curioſity nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tempted me to aſk any queſtions upon the ſubject—ſenſible that the ſacred obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which they are bound to ſilence, are regiſtered in heaven—more ſacred than
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034027_0013_0FFA2FB864217F18"/>
the emblematic Roll—the ever blooming Sprig—the ſympathetic Tear—or the reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>"So mote it be."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sacred Volume, and the books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the ſanction of the Fraternity, contain all the knowledge in the ſublime art, neceſſary for my ſex. Jachin and Boaz, and the ſpurious writings of other Eveſdrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, are too trifling to merit either my cenſure or contempt—For,

                  <l>They're ſafely kept in Maſons' hearts,</l>
                  <l>And to the ancient Lodge belong.</l>
