            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

As I had no thoughts of any ſuch thing as the printing of the Sermon, when I prepared it for the Pulpit, I took very imperfect notes of only the doctrinal part; it cannot therefore be expected, that it now appears verbatim, as it was delivered. However, the thoughts are ſubſtantially the ſame, though, perhaps, ſometimes a little tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and in ſome parts a little enlargement of argument. Such thoughts as ſeemed to be properly new, i. e. did not occur in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I have chiefly thrown into marginal notes.— The reader will, indeed, find in this diſcourſe, neither novelty of thought to gratify his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, nor elegance of compoſition, to raiſe in him a kind of ſuperficial pleaſure. But let the vaſt importance of the ſubject, with reſpect to

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no uncommon thing for the men of this world to look upon the people of GOD as beſide themſelves. They account their fervency and ſpirituality in Religion enthuſiaſm. This impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Apoſtle obviates in the 13th verſe of our Context; and vindicates himſelf and brethren by conſidering the greatneſs of the object, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the matter of their exerciſe. If you reckon us beſides ourſelves, it is, (as tho' the Apoſtle had ſaid) to GOD, who is worthy of the warmeſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though, ſometimes, for your ſakes we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the emotion of our affections, that we may addreſs you with ſober ſolemn arguments.—It is impoſſible to have any proper ſenſe of the love of CHRIST, expreſſed by his dying for us, and not feel a mighty energy from it upon the heart. He died in order to deliver ſuch as were in a legal and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe dead, from their wretched and woful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010562_0005_0F80BC255911FFD0"/>
condition, and reſtore them to life.—A life devoted to his honour and ſervice.—He died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him who died for them, and roſe again.</p>
            <p>HENCE they are raiſed above the government of carnal principles, nor do they live according to the courſe of this world: they know no man after the fleſh, ſo as to accommodate themſelves to his carnal reliſh and principles. True Chriſtians live under the impreſſion of divine and ſpiritual truths, and tho' they know not CHRIST, nor converſe with him in that manner in which the Diſciples did in the days of his fleſh here below, yet they have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acquaintance and intercourſe with him. Their life muſt, therefore, be ſuch as the maxims and principles are, upon which it is formed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, very different from that courſe, in which the men of this world live. The illative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>therefore,</hi> ſhews that the words of my text are a native inference from the forementioned conſiderations. The words are an hypothetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in the antecedent of which, we have the ſtate and condition of true Chriſtians expreſſed. They are in CHRIST. That is, they are united to him by faith, have an intereſt in his perſon, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the benefits of his purchaſe, and have his Spirit dwelling in them.—The conſequent gives us their character. They are new creatures. If any man be in CHRIST, he is a new creature. The word might be rendered a new creation. It ſignifies that bleſſed change wrought in the hearts of ſinners by the Holy Spirit, whereby they become dead to ſin, and alive to GOD thro' CHRIST JESUS. Thus the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010562_0006_0F80BC26344BC1A0"/>
Apoſtle adds by way of explication, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.— What I intend from this paſſage, at preſent, is, <list>
                  <item>I. To explain the nature of this change, here called the new creature, or new creation.</item>
                  <item>II. To ſhew that this is the certain character of all thoſe, who are in CHRIST JESUS.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I RETURN to the firſt propoſed, viz. To explain the nature of this change here, called the new creature.</p>
            <p>IT conſiſts in a new temper and diſpoſition of the ſoul towards GOD and divine things, formed by the Holy Spirit's infuſing a principle of ſpiritual life, whereby the heart of a ſinner is turned from the love and ſervice of ſin to GOD and holineſs; the neceſſary conſequence of which, is an happy change in the prevailing courſe of his practice.</p>
            <p>IN this deſcription, you may obſerve, 1ſt. that the author of this change, or the agent by whom it is effected, is the Holy Spirit. It is expreſsly aſcribed to him by the Apoſtle, Tit. iii. 5. Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by waſhing of regeneration, and <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and attentive conſideration of the ſcripture-account of man's fallen ſtate, will plainly ſhew, that none, leſs than ſuch a divine Almighty Agent, can bring a creature, ſo entirely revolted from GOD, to a right temper towards him.—He is dead in treſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, Epheſ. ii. 1. his carnal mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt GOD, for it is not ſubject to the law of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010562_0007_0F80BC26C05649D8"/>
GOD, neither indeed can be. Rom. viii. 7. From theſe repreſentations it appears, that there is not any power or principle in a ſinner, while in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, in the leaſt degree, tending to a return to GOD. <note n="*" place="bottom">Where there is no love to GOD, there is, certainly, no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life, no tendency to chooſe and cleave to GOD. For love is the fulfilling of the law. Upon the love of GOD and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hang all the Law and the Prophets. Mat. xxii. 40. Now where enmity againſt GOD reigns, there love to him is altogether wanting.—To ſuppoſe, therefore, an unregenerate perſon may love GOD and holineſs, would be, to ſuppoſe him poſſeſſed of a principle of ſpiritual life, and that love and enmity are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, but quite conſiſtent, which is abſurd.</note> But on the contrary, principles of ſtrongeſt oppoſition to any ſuch change govern him. He is under the power of ſin and in love with it. His reliſhes and inclinations are all earthly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and enmity denotes the moſt fixed unyeilding oppoſition of the will to GOD; the greateſt diſguſt and averſion. This temper, therefore, muſt be broken and removed, before the ſoul can ſubmit to the divine government. The metaphors made uſe of, in the ſacred Scripture, to repreſent this change, give us the ſame idea of the matter, viz. a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or paſſing from death to life. Eph. v. 14. John v. 24. a new birth; John iii. 3. and a new creation, as in the text, and Eph ii. 10. all which, denote the utter abſence of any principle or power, whereby the ſinner can diſpoſe, or determine his own heart to turn to GOD. Nor can any meer moral ſuaſion prevail with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. The effect produced, by the agency of the holy Spirit, is a principle of ſpiritual life. You hath he quickened (ſays the Apoſtle) who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Eph. ii. 1. The implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this divine principle, in which the ſoul is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010562_0008_0F80BC27BA9AEA18"/>
paſſive, is what is ſtrictly called <hi>Regeneration;</hi> and the exerciſe thereof, in ſinners actually turning from the power of ſin to GOD, is what divines mean by <hi>Converſion.</hi>—This principle of life, perhaps, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſpiritual knowledge of GOD and divine things, whereby their nature and excellency are truly apprehended, in ſome meaſure, as they are.— Such knowledge as gives a proper impreſſion and reliſh of things to the heart. The nature of true grace ſeems to be thus expreſſed, Jer. xxxi. 34.— They ſhall all <hi>know me,</hi> from the leaſt to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. <hi>vide</hi> 1 John ii. 20.—27. The ſpread of true Religion in the world, is ſignified by the prevalence of knowledge; the earth ſhall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the ſea. Iſa. xi. 9. And the encreaſe of true Religion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, by the metaphor of encreaſing light. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the light of the moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun, and the light of the ſun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the light of ſeven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound. Iſa. xxx. 26.</p>
            <p>THE reality, and true nature of this divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life, can only be known to us by its effects. Theſe are briefly pointed out in the latter part of my text; old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.—Theſe words are not to be taken in an abſolute ſenſe, as though the work of grace was compleat and perfect in degree and no remainders of corruption were left in that heart, in which this bleſſed change is wrought. This would be contrary to both ſcripture and experience. The ſaints, in ſcripture, bitterly complain of indwelling corruption. Says holy David. Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010562_0009_0F80BC285B604D00"/>
his errors? Pſalm xix. 12. He laments, that his iniquities were gone over his head, as an heavy burden, they were too heavy for him. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his tranſgreſſions, and his ſin was ever before him. Pſa. xxxviii. 4. and li. 3. The Apoſtle bewails his carnality; that he did what he allowed not, what he hated; that when he would do good, evil was preſent with him; that indwelling ſin, as a law in his members, warred againſt the law of his mind; and cries out, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom. vii. 14. and <hi>ſeq.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">To ſuppoſe, as ſome do, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of his unconverted ſtate, is very abſurd. For that is to ſuppoſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſon to delight in the law of GOD after the inward man; to have a law in his mind different from, and oppoſite to the law of ſin in his members, ſo that he can truly ſay, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me; to long for deliverance from ſin, and rejoice in the proſpect of it through CHRIST JESUS his Lord; and, with his mind, he ſerves the law of GOD. And that is to ſuppoſe the moſt flat contradictions. Such a ſuppoſition deſtroys all diſtinctions between a regenerate and an unregenerate ſtate.</note>—If in regeneration, no indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin, no remainders of corruption were left in the heart, then the true Chriſtian would love GOD with the utmoſt intenſeneſs his nature would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and that, without the leaſt abatement or intermiſſion, any moment of his life. For coldneſs of love to GOD, or not to love him to the higheſt degree we are, in the nature of things, capable of, is corruption; and ſome ſinful diſtemper in the heart, muſt be the reaſon why we love him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now, how arrogant would that man be, who would ſay, that he loved GOD in ſo high a degree, and with ſo much intenſeneſs, that he could not wiſh to love him better, or more conſtantly than he does! would any one look upon ſuch a perſon to be a true Chriſtian, or, to know any thing about true love to GOD at all?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010562_0010_0F80BC290908CE20"/>UPON this ſuppoſition too, there would, at no time, be any motion of ſin in the heart of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; nor any the leaſt tendency to evil. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he would be perfect as ſoon as regenerated, and could never commit any ſin in his practice.— It will not avail any thing here, to ſay that a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may be drawn into ſin by external temptation, as Adam was, when he eat the forbidden fruit. For external temptation can never entangle a perſon in ſin, but by firſt defiling the heart. While that is untainted, he is proof againſt temptation. Thus, it firſt gained Adam's heart, and then he committed the outward tranſgreſſion, and ſo apoſtatized from GOD.—In like manner, according to this notion, when a Chriſtian is by temptation drawn into ſin, his heart is defiled, and then he has corruption dwelling in him. Conſequently, he apoſtatizes from his regenerate ſtate, and relapſes into his former natural condition, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>IT is plain, therefore, that the language of my text is not to be taken in an abſolute, but a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſenſe. Yet, it certainly denotes a very great change in the whole man. The whole temper of the heart, and ſtate of things are quite altered, ſo that the man is not in a moral ſenſe the ſame ſort of a creature that he was. He is, indeed, phyſically the ſame, yet morally a new creature. In whom there is a perfection of parts, though not of degrees. <hi>i. e.</hi> The whole man is renewed, though he be but in part renewed. This matter, I would endeavour more fully to illuſtrate in the few following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.—This happy change,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. SUPPOSES the removal of the ſinner's old ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010562_0011_0F80BC29EF826638"/>
His natural ſtate is repreſented, in the word of GOD, by the metaphors of ſleep and death, which denote great inſenſibility. He is the vaſſal of ſatan; who works in the children of diſobedience. Eph. ii. 2. And while ſatan, as a ſtrong man armed, keeps the houſe, his goods are in peace.—The ſinner's heart is compared to fallow ground, which lies ſtill, ſpontaneouſly yeilding weeds and thorns, and not broke up, to prepare it for ſeed, in order to a crop. The firſt work of the Holy Spirit, in order to bring about this change, is to arouſe the ſinner out of this deep ſecurity. This he does, by the application of the divine law to the conſcience. Perhaps, the threatening of the law for ſome particular tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, firſt alarms the ſinner, and brings him to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration. Brings him to think what he has been doing all his life. Upon this he finds he has been living in careleſs neglect of GOD, and his own eternal intereſt. He begins to ſee this courſe will never do, there is a neceſſity of turning to GOD. But alas! he finds an indiſpoſed diſinclined heart. The Holy Spirit opens, by light let into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſpirituality and ſtrictneſs of the law, and thereby diſcovers the exceeding corruption and wickedneſs of the heart. When the commandment comes with power, corruption is irritated, and riſes up in oppoſition. Sin, taking occaſion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, works in him all manner of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.—His ſins revive, and he dies. Rom. vii. 8, 9. Hence, the conſcience is impreſſed with a ſenſe of divine wrath. The poor ſinner becomes deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his miſery, and exceeding anxious about a way of eſcape. All his attempts to relieve himſelf, and mend his own heart, only diſcover more and more, his exceeding ſinfulneſs and wretchedneſs.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010562_0012_0F80BC2A847D3F08"/>
He now ſees his abſolute neceſſity of mercy, and the grace of GOD to change his heart; without which, he muſt be undone forever. This conviction of ſin and miſery is not, indeed, an ingredient in the change itſelf, of which my text ſpeaks, but only diſcovers the neceſſity of it, and awakens the ſinner to ſeek after it. Many are deeply convinced, who never become new creatures. But, ſuch as the Holy Spirit has never awakened out of a deep ſleep of carnal ſecurity, have, certainly, never been the ſubjects of his gracious operations. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHEN the ſaving change takes place, the old darkneſs and blindneſs of the mind paſſes away, and the underſtanding is divinely enlightened. He, who was ſometimes darkneſs, is made light in the LORD. Eph. v. 8. The ſinner is, in his natural ſtate, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from the life of GOD through the ignorance that is in him, becauſe of the blindneſs of his heart. Eph. iv. 18. The mind is, by nature, ſo greatly eſtranged from GOD and divine things, that it is called darkneſs in the abſtract. But the Spirit of GOD diſpels this darkneſs, and enlightens the mind in the knowledge of CHRIST, and the ſcheme of ſalvation through him, as revealed in the goſpel. GOD who commanded the light, in creating the natural world, to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhines in the heart; to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST. 11 Cor. iv. 6. JEHOVAH appears tranſcendently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. The law of GOD appears then to be, indeed, ſpiritual, and holy, and juſt, and good. The mind beholds the beauty and excellency of ſpiritual things; and of that internal purity and holineſs, which the law of GOD requires. Now, the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010562_0013_0F80BC2B43CAA848"/>
vileneſs of ſin is clearly apprehended. In a word, all things appear in a new and very different point of light. The underſtanding beholds them in their true nature. Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE perſon's old eſtimate of things paſſes away. By nature, he was filled with a high eſteem of the world, ſin, and ſenſual pleaſures. This world, in one point of view or another, he accounted his chief good. He accounted it pleaſure, to riot in the day time. 11 Pet. ii. 13. He thought the ſervice of ſin pleaſant, and judged it liberty, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.—He accounted the ſervice of GOD a grieveous burden, and the law of GOD, eſpecially as it reſpected the inward man, a diſagreeable reſtraint. He exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſreliſhed the ſovereignty, and freeneſs of the grace of GOD.—He could not think of renouncing all his own righteouſneſs as filthy rags, and coming poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked to the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, as his only refuge.—But now, how changed his judgement of matters! He accounts all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST his Lord, for whom he ſuffers the loſs of all things, and counts them but dung, that he may win CHRIST. Phil. iii. 8. JESUS CHRIST is altogether lovely and precious; and he highly prizes, and greatly admires the grace of GOD. He eſteems the favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD his life. He exceedingly values the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law, and ſees the beauty of holineſs.—He apprehends the emptineſs, and vanity of this world. He looks upon ſin as very vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and groans under it, as a heavy load.—In conſequence of all this,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:010562_0014_0F80BC2C050172C8"/>4. THE choice and inclination of the will is quite changed. In the ſinner's natural ſtate, his will freely chooſes, fully conſents to ſin.—It is in ſuch a ſtate of fixed oppoſition to GOD, that it is enmity againſt him; for it is not ſubject to the law of GOD, neither, indeed, can be. Rom. viii. 7. It does not ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, or the ſcheme of ſalvation exhibited in the goſpel.— But upon ſuch a new view of things as has been ſuggeſted, this enmity and oppoſition is ſubdued. A rational creature cannot chuſe evil as evil, and therefore, the will muſt needs follow this practical judgement of the underſtanding.—It chearfully chooſes the righteouſneſs of CHRIST, and ſubmits to the terms of reconciliation with GOD, which the goſpel propoſes. It ſweetly reſts in GOD as a chief good, ſubmits to him as a moſt rightful Sovereign, and eſteems it as a great priviledge to be under his government. Holineſs is choſen with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; and the ways of ſin are rejected with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. Thy people ſhall <hi>be willing</hi> in the day of thy power. Pſa. cx. 3. See alſo Pſa. cxix. 30,—127, 128.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE affections take a new courſe. Their old current was earthly and carnal. They were impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and overbearing in their tendency towards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden objects, or inordinate towards ſuch as are, in themſelves, lawful. They had the government, and led the poor ſoul captive: they blinded the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, perverted the judgement, ſtupified the conſcience, and entangled the will; and thus, things were in diſorder and confuſion.—But now, divine light having repreſented things in their true nature and importance to the underſtanding, rectified the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010562_0015_0F80BC2CD6AC9890"/>
judgement, and gained the will; the affections na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follow and become ſubject. In reſpect of their objects and exerciſe, they are, indeed, new. They terminate on ſpiritual objects, and ſo become ſpiritual. Now love, deſire, delight, joy, zeal, hope, embrace GOD and ſpiritual communications from him, which the heart before diſreliſhed; and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſorrow and hatred have ſin (in which the ſoul was wont to delight) for their object.</p>
            <p>AS this alteration does not reſpect the paſſions or affections only, but takes place, primarily, in the underſtanding, judgement and will, it will, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not be a tranſient flaſh, or ſhort lived zeal, like the ſtony ground hearers; but is habitual and fixed. The graces of the Holy Spirit are not always in exerciſe, but there is always ſuch a ſenſe of things as makes the ſoul reſtleſs and uneaſy in ſuch a caſe. There is always a diſpoſition to ſeek the lively exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace, a tendency towards it. This ſhews, that a principle of life abides in the ſoul; which, from time to time, is drawn forth into ſome ſenſible exerciſe. From ſuch a change in the ſoul's temper and ſenſe of things, it follows,</p>
            <p n="6">6. THAT the old courſe of practice is changed. Old courſes of ſin are forſaken and abandoned. The duties of religion, formerly neglected, are now performed with conſcientious ſtrictneſs. The ſubject of this happy change, immediately, withdraws from the company of the looſe and ungodly; and chooſes the ſociety of God's people. But it is not only in the openly vicious and irreligious, that a change of conduct appears. Such as have ſupported an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally regular and religious character, upon this new
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010562_0016_0F80BC2D78EF1A90"/>
view and ſenſe of things, behave in a very different manner. By the influences of the Holy Spirit, they are, frequently, enabled to perform holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with much ſolemnity and ſpiritual life: nor can they reſt eaſy with a cold formality in the ſervice of GOD. They ſeek communion with him. They hear the word of GOD with another kind of attention. They often hang upon the lips of the preacher.— Their converſation often ſavours of Heaven, and things divine. They cannot make light of ſin, and indulge indwelling corruption as heretofore. They are jealous of their own hearts, and watch againſt the motions of ſin there. They mourn over, and maintain a prevailing oppoſition to it. They that are CHRIST'S have crucified the fleſh, with its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts. Gal. v. 24. Through the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the body, and ſo live. Rom. vii. 13. Hence their conflict and ſpiritual warfare: for the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other. Gal. v. 17.</p>
            <p>BUT it is time to proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew, that it is the certain character of thoſe, who are in CHRIST JESUS, that they are new creatures.</p>
            <p>AS I have already exceeded the limits I deſigned, I ſhall not enlarge here; and ſhall only very briefly ſuggeſt two conſiderations, whereby this truth will appear.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010562_0017_0F80BC2E3B2B8D70"/>1ſt. IT was the great end of our bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's mediatory undertaking, to deliver his people, in due time, from the whole ruin of their fallen ſtate. Now a principal part of this ruin conſiſts in their ſpiritual death, and bondage to ſin: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, his deſign is to reſtore them to life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and to make them free indeed. John viii. 36. This deſign, therefore, he carries into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the agency of the Holy Spirit. He ſaves, not only from the guilt, but alſo from the power of ſin. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> called JESUS, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins. Mat. i. 21.—For this purpoſe was the SON of GOD manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil. 1 John iii. 8. In accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this purpoſe, they who are his, are born of GOD, and do not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in them, and they cannot ſin, for they are born of GOD. ver. 9. <hi>i e.</hi> they do not commit ſin, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin habitually, with free conſent, and delight: and ſo, do not continue in the practice of any known ſin. In any other ſenſe, the Apoſtle would contradict himſelf. For he tells us, if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive ourſelves, and the truth is not in us. 1 John i. 8. And in this ſenſe, his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ſufficient to ſhew, that ſuch are new creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY who are in CHRIST, have his Spirit dwelling in them. If any man have not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9.— Now the indwelling of the Spirit muſt denote his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, grace, and influence in the heart, as a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier. He is a holy Spirit, and cannot endure the power and dominion of ſin where he dwells. They who are joined to the LORD are one ſpirit. 1 Cor. vi. 17. Hence, they are temples of the HOLY GHOST; and made holy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010562_0018_0F80BC2F01F2A070"/>IT remains now to make ſome Reflections upon this ſubject by way of Improvement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflection</hi> I. WHAT has been ſaid ſerves to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a fatal miſtake of thoſe who imagine, they do not ſtand in need of ſuch a change as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, becauſe they have been born in the viſible church; have been early devoted to GOD in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; have had a religious education; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when their lives are externally religious and regular. They acknowledge, that heathens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, or the groſsly wicked and profligate muſt be regenerated, and become new creatures. But as for them, they have been brought up in a religious manner, and therefore, it cannot be neceſſary they ſhould experience ſo great and remarkable a change. Thus Paul once thought, he was circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Phariſee (the ſtricteſt ſect among the Jews) concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church; touching the righteouſneſs of the law blameleſs. Theſe things he counted his gain. Phil. iii. 5, 6, 7. He imagined, he was in a fair way to heaven. He was alive in his own apprehenſion, until the commandment came, and then ſin revived, and he died. Rom. vii. 8, 9.—But alas! all mankind are born the ſubjects of ſpiritual death, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of principles of ſpiritual life and holineſs. By our firſt apoſtacy from GOD, we have all loſt his moral image, and have a carnal mind, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt GOD. Hence how orthodox ſoever our profeſſion may be, and how ſtrict ſoever our practice, yet all will be dead and ſpiritleſs, while that inward ſtate of the mind continues. All our
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010562_0019_0F80BC32D4C2D1C0"/>
religious ſervices will be but dead works, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acceptable in the ſight of GOD. There will be no ſenſe or reliſh of the beauty and excellency of GOD, and divine things. And ſuch a life, cannot be ſaid to be truly holy. The heart is ſuch as its governing principles are. It is, therefore, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly neceſſary, that the ſoul be delivered from the governing power of carnal principles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life, in order to ſerve GOD in a ſpiritual manner. But ſuch a change of governing principles, will infer a very great alteration in the ſtate and temper of the heart; as great, as the difference between life and death. Such a perſon will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, feel a very different frame of mind, and ſenſe of things; and be engaged in the ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in a very different manner: and with a very different zeal and integrity of heart. He is not the ſame ſort of perſon as he was, he becomes indeed a new creature. He ſerves GOD upon principles truly ſpiritual, and his practice of religious duties partakes of the ſpirituality of theſe principles. Such a change as this, all muſt experience, or periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflection</hi> II. SEEING all mankind are, by nature, in ſuch a ſtate, as that they muſt become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and experience ſo great a change as I have repreſented, in order to their becoming capable of truly ſerving GOD, and happineſs in the enjoyment of him; it is of the laſt importance, my hearers, that you examine whether you are the ſubjects of ſuch a change. Recollect the particulars included in it, which I have mentioned in this diſcourſe, compare yourſelves with them, and ſee whether they are deſcriptive of your caſe. As to ſuch of you as are ſtrangers to any thing like ſuch a change,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010562_0020_0F80BC3436CBAA08"/>
as I have been endeavouring to explain to you; who live in the neglect of GOD and Religion, and indulge yourſelves in the practice of ſin; you may conclude, without any further debate upon the matter, that you are yet in your natural ſtate, a ſtate of death and ruin.— But with reſpect to ſuch of you as have experienced ſomething like ſuch a change, there is need of cloſer ſcrutiny. You have need to examine the matter, with much ſeriouſneſs and impartiality, and to ſeek the aid of the Holy Spirit in the ſearch. For there are common opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, as well as ſpecial; common grace, as well as ſaving: <hi>i. e.</hi> There are operations of the Spirit, whereby ſolemn impreſſions of the word of GOD are made upon the heart, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alteration is effected, which, yet, come ſhort of a ſaving change: or, in other words, they do not make the ſubject of them truly holy. Hence, deep convictions, illumination of the mind, and great emotions of the affections. This, our LORD teaches by the Parable of the ſtony ground hearers. Luke viii. 13. The Apoſtle ſuppoſes perſons to be enlightened, to taſte of the heavenly gift, be made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, to taſte the good word of GOD, and the powers of the world to come, who yet may fall away ſo, as that it is impoſſible to renew them to repentance. Heb. vi. 4, 5. Hence, great external reformation, and zeal in the practice of religious duties for a ſeaſon; like Herod, who heard John the Baptiſt gladly, and did many things. Mark vi. 20. Here are effects reſembling true grace, yet come ſhort of it. Many too who have had (as the event at laſt ſhews) only common grace, have high confidences, and (as they apprehend) ſtrong aſſurance of their juſtified, converted ſtate;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010562_0021_0F80BC34CCA89DA8"/>
ſtronger confidence, than many exerciſed ſince Chriſtians.—That you have been the ſubjects of very deep impreſſions of the word of GOD, and have experienced a great alteration, you can not doubt; but whether they have gone further than common grace; whether it is a thorough and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing change, is the queſtion. Nor will your ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence of your gracious ſtate, of itſelf, prove the matter to be ſo, unleſs it is founded on ſcriptural evidence of a work of ſaving grace in the heart, anſwering to the characters of grace in the word of GOD, it is a ſign of preſumption rather than grace.—The reality and truth of grace is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſelf-evident, but muſt be diſcerned by comparing the experiences of the heart, and their influence on the life, with the unerring rule of God's Word—indeed, when the ſoul embraces CHRIST by faith, from the very nature of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, it will have ſome ſweet ſenſe of the mercy and grace of GOD appearing in that way of ſalvation, ſuch as will introduce a refreſhing calm and peace into the diſtreſſed conſcience: and that, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtrength of faith, and the clearneſs of its views.—I would not ſay that there may not be a real ſaving cloſure with CHRIST, when yet there may be ſuch obſcurity in faith's views, and ſo much weakneſs in its exerciſe, as not to afford ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible comfort, but only relieve the ſoul from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the ſoul cannot reſt there. I believe, there are inſtances of this. But for the moſt part, I apprehend, at the ſoul's cloſure with CHRIST, ſuch aſtoniſhing ſcenes of mercy and grace open to view, and ſuch diſcoveries of the glory of GOD, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of divine things, as make the ſoul exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to rejoice, with joy unſpeakable and full of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010562_0022_0F80BC34F844C518"/>
glory. While the believer is taken up with theſe views, and feels his ſoul reſting upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of CHRIST, he cannot but have a lively hope of the mercy of GOD, yea, for the preſent, does not doubt of it. But this is very different from a fixed aſſurance of his gracious ſtate. For when theſe views are abated, the divine preſence is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and corruptions (which the Chriſtian was ready to flatter himſelf, he ſhould never feel any more) are again felt in the heart, it is natural to ſuppoſe, that the young Chriſtian (who had very different expectations) will call all in queſtion again. Renewed light, and exerciſes of faith again relieve him: yet ſucceeding darkneſs temptation and exerciſe with the indwelling corruptions of his heart may from time to time fill him with fear and jealouſies of himſelf. I make no doubt, but there are inſtances of ſuch, who, at their firſt cloſure with CHRIST, are favoured with a ſcriptural fixed aſſurance of their gracious ſtate. But this is not a common caſe. Such aſſurance is, uſually, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a courſe of experience, after many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and repeated ſelf-examination. <note n="‡" place="bottom">To ſuppoſe that the very eſſence or nature of regeneration, and the very firſt act of faith includes a full aſſurance, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate witneſs of the Spirit, teſtifying the perſon's juſtification, and gracious ſtate as ſome do, is to ſuppoſe, that faith and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration cannot exiſt without this aſſurance; that without this immediate witneſs of the Spirit, faith and grace are not. And that is to ſuppoſe, that regeneration is before it is. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtified is the perſon's renegeration, which pre-ſuppoſes its exiſtence, and that it is ſomething diſtinct from this witneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. And yet, according to this notion, it is not previous to this witneſs, nor diſtinct from it; which is a contradiction. It is alſo to ſuppoſe, that in aſſuring Chriſtians, the Holy Spirit does not witneſs <hi>together with their ſpirits,</hi> as the Scriptures declare, Rom. viii. 16. but by an immediate witneſs, independent on any witneſs of their own ſpirit. For the witneſs of their ſpirit conſiſts in a conſciouſneſs of what they have experienced, and muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the thing witneſſed, to be before this witneſs about it, in the order of time as well as the order of nature. And if ſo, how long, or how ſhort the time may be, before the Holy Spirit adds his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the witneſs of their own ſpirits. I think, none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</note> Many exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed chriſtians, too, have their attention ſo taken up with the corruptions and wickedneſs of their hearts, and ſo diſtreſſed, with a ſenſe thereof, as to overlook their oppoſition, and the principles of that oppoſition. And this is a great ſource of their doubts and fears; from which, a careful examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010562_0023_0F80BC3A97209010"/>
of the reaſons of their diſtreſs, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and manner of their oppoſition would tend to relieve them. Now from all theſe conſiderations, it appears, how highly neceſſary a very ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of yourſelves is, upon this intereſting matter; on the one hand, to prevent your ſettling upon a falſe foundation; on the other, in order to diſcover the evidence of true grace where it does exiſt, and ſo remove groundleſs fears of ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>THAT you may examine this matter with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it will be neceſſary, that you attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the dictinction between common and ſaving grace.—For your aſſiſtance herein, I would juſt ſuggeſt, 1ſt. that whatever light may be let into the mind by the common influence of the ſpirit, its only effects ſeem to be the commotion of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſome temporary reformation, and zeal in the external practice of Religion. But the will is not ſweetly bowed, and brought to ſubmit to the Goſpel. The ſinner does not come out of himſelf to CHRIST'S righteouſneſs, as his only refuge: he does not renounce his own righteouſneſs as filthy rags. If he ſeems to truſt in CHRIST, his primary encouragement is from ſome apprehended goodneſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010562_0024_0F80BC3C0E86D388"/>
in himſelf, or ſome good affection, and not alone from a view of the glorious fulneſs in CHRIST, and the freeneſs of the grace of GOD in him, to the moſt wretched and unworthy of ſinners. Hence, there is no truly ſpiritual temper and diſpoſition formed in the heart.—2. The effects of common grace are tranſient, and the zeal and engagedneſs in religion, thence ariſing, ſoon paſſes away. It may continue for a while, but in time of temptation, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fall away; for they have no root in themſelves. Luke viii. 13. They have no abiding principle of life. Their religion ſubſides into a lifeleſs form. Their hearts return to their former habitual cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and carnality. They have no ſuch habitual tendency towards GOD, ſuch frequent breathings and pantings after him, ſuch reſtleſs uneaſineſs in his abſence; ſuch oppoſition to, and victory over temptation and ſin; ſuch frequent exerciſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and quickening of grace into life and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as true Chriſtians have.—Bring theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cloſe home to yourſelves, I pray you; ſearch and ſee how the caſe ſtands with you. A miſtake here is highly dangerous, and will be fatal, unleſs GOD, of his tender mercy, diſcover it.</p>

               <hi>Reflection</hi> III. SUCH of you, as, upon impartial examination, have reaſon to hope, you have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced this gracious change: (and conſcience bears you witneſs, you are afraid of deceiving yourſelves) you, I ſay, are under peculiar obligations to ſtand diſtinguiſhed from the men of this world, by the ſtrictneſs, ſpirituality, and holineſs of your lives. Let it appear, by a prevailing heavenlineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that you are indeed new creatures. Ye are the ſalt of the earth, and light of the world.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010562_0025_0F80BC3C8AEB8070"/>
Math. v. 13, 14. Theſe are arguments, by which, our LORD urges holineſs upon his people. If we live in the ſpirit, let us alſo walk in the ſpirit. Gal. v. 25. And herein is your Heavenly Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that ye bear much fruit; and ſo ſhall you be, <hi>i. e.</hi> appear to be CHRIST'S diſciples. Nothing ſo much diſhonours GOD, and wounds the credit of Religion, as the backſliding and untender walk of ſuch, as have made an eminent profeſſion. How baſe and unbecoming is it to ſee ſuch acting beneath their character. O ſirs, ſeek to be perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of GOD: to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Let your converſation be as it becometh the goſpel of CHRIST. Phil. i. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflection</hi> IV. How importunate ſhould ſuch be, who are awakened to any ſolemn ſenſe of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable degenerate ſtate, in ſeeking the grace of GOD, to effect a ſaving change in them! If there are any ſuch in my audience, let me beſeech you to conſider, how impoſſible it is, you ſhould ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into heaven with ſuch hearts as you find, by ſad experience, you have. Without a new temper and reliſh of things, you can never enjoy the bleſſed GOD as your happineſs. How dreadful is the thought, that ye ſhould fall aſleep again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come careleſs in ſo exceedingly dangerous and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a condition!—Here, permit me, to offer you a few directions. 1. Cheriſh your convictions, and beware of ſtifling them. We naturally love eaſe, and are fond of relief from diſtreſs. Your hearts are deceitful, and apt to ſnatch at comfort at any rate. You are ſurrounded with various allurements and ſnares from the world. And the devil will employ his ſophiſtical arts to lull you aſleep, or ſettle on
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010562_0026_0F80BC3D79092688"/>
ſome falſe foundation. You are, therefore, in a critical dangerous ſituation. O conſider the danger of your miſcarrying; and how awful it will be to ſettle on your lees again.—2. Labour to get as clear apprehenſions as ye can, from the word of GOD, of the nature of that change ye are to ſeek. It is very true, experience only can give you a thorough clear idea of it, yet ye can, at leaſt, ſo far take up the repreſentation of the matter in the word of GOD, as to learn from it, that it muſt be a very great change in the whole man, and that a temper, directly contrary to that, which you now feel, muſt obtain in you.—For want of attending to this, many take up with ſuperficial appearances, apparent good deſires, flaſhes of affections, and ſome external reformation as evidences of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, tho' they have no univerſal change in the whole ſoul, nor any abiding new principles and temper.—Others again imagine, that if ever this bleſſed change ſhall take place in them, they will have ſome extraordinary witneſs of the Holy Spirit, aſſuring them of their juſtification and regeneration; and that faith contains an aſſurance of a perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in CHRIST, in its very nature. Hence, they are altogether taken up in deſiring and praying for this, and neglect every other conſideration.—But this is not the firſt thing to be obtained. Such aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is the fruit of faith, and the reſult of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.—The firſt thing you are to ſeek for, is to be ſo inlightened in the knowledge of the all ſufficient fulneſs of CHRIST'S righteouſneſs, and the glory of that way of ſalvation, as that your wills may be perſuaded to acquieſce in it with ſweet complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and to yield yourſelves to GOD. That ye may be brought to chooſe GOD himſelf as your portion;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010562_0027_0F80BC3E43F2B248"/>
to delight in holineſs and hate ſin.—3. At the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of ſovereign grace. Reſolve to continue crying to GOD, and ceaſe not till you obtain. Wicked and corrupt as you are, and though you are unable to change your own hearts, yet GOD, who created the natural world, can create your depraved ſouls a-new. And he is infinitely gracious; he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on whom he will have compaſſion, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy; ſo that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that ſheweth mercy. Rom. ix. 15, 16.—But while you cry unto GOD, conſider yourſelves as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of meer mercy and grace, who are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any favour. Nor can you do any to merit the divine grace. If he viſit you with mercy, it will be according to the good pleaſure of his own will. Yet it is in the uſe of means that GOD is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meet with ſinners: he has made it your duty to wait upon him, and has told you, that for this will he be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them. Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflection</hi> V. THIS ſubject loudly calls upon care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners to awake out of their carnal ſecurity, and lay to heart their great danger, and abſolute neceſſity of a ſupernatural work of divine grace, to make them new creatures in CHRIST JESUS.— Without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the LORD. Heb. xii. 14. The happineſs of rational creatures depends upon the favours and friendſhip of GOD. The enjoyment of GOD muſt be by way of friendly intercourſe and communion. Now all friendſhip is mutual between the parties, and ariſes from a conformity or agreeableneſs of the parties each to the other. But ſinners, in their natural ſtate, are
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010562_0028_0F80BC3EBADA40F0"/>
altogether oppoſed to GOD and holineſs. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes and pleaſures are earthly and carnal. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their hearts, their inclinations are to ſin; their delight is in it, in one way or other, and that continually. And conſequently, they have a fixed averſion to the divine government, and enmity againſt GOD. Therefore, they muſt be equally the objects of the divine averſion and abhorrence. Hence it follows, that the nature of one or the other of the parties muſt be changed, before they can come together, or have any fellowſhip. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this change muſt take place in ſinners, and the moral image of GOD, to which they are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, quite oppoſed, muſt be reſtored; or, they muſt be cut off from his gracious preſence, and fall under his dread reſentments forever.—Poor ſinners, is it fit you ſhould be eaſy and at reſt in ſuch a caſe as this? Muſt you not be forever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and undone, if you die in your preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Do but obſerve the prevailing temper and pleaſures of your own hearts; the courſe of your practice, and tendency of your lives. Can you perſwade yourſelves, that you are ſpiritual, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the things of GOD? and that the frame and temper of your hearts ſuits the ſtate and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven? Are you not earthly, and ſuch as mind the things of the fleſh? therefore, you are poſting, as faſt as time can carry you, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruin. I beſeech you, to enter upon ſome ſerious ſolemn conſideration of your caſe.—Do not harden your hearts, by giving looſe reins to your luſts and ſinful practices. Do not give yourſelves up to diſſipation and ſenſual pleaſures. Keep at a diſtance from temptations to ſin. One cannot take fire into his boſom, and not be burned. Whoſoever will
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010562_0029_0F80BC3F9A6917D8"/>
throw himſelf into the way of temptation, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be entangled. Avoid the preſent public ſnare in this city, I mean the entertainments of the Theatre. Whatever pretenſions to the expoſing of vice are alledged in its favour, yet, ſurely, the vicious characters are, in the firſt place, acted. When, by theſe exhibitions, the vicious paſſions of the corrupt heart are enflamed, the alledged mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is either not at all obſerved, or, if it is ſet in view, it has not any influence. GOD has not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ſtage as a mean of the reformation of mankind, and therefore, we have no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his bleſſing upon it, without which nothing will be effectual for that purpoſe: nor is it attended upon with any ſuch view. Yea, it has been the complaint of every age, that it has promoted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality and impiety. And certainly, facts muſt expoſe the vanity of every ſpecious pretence to the contrary. Many, by attending the ſtage, have learned arts of intrigue, and methods of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing wicked deſigns, which, otherwiſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, they would never have known. What though it may have fared ill with the perſon, whoſe vicious character is acted? Will this deter a ſinner, unawed by the divine threatenings, from purſuing the ſame courſe? No; he hopes it will ſucceed better with him; and thus, prompted by luſt enflamed, he ruſhes into an imitation, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he has a proper opportunity. I would ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warn you not to run the riſk of ſuch dangerous conſequences. <note n="§" place="bottom">I will not undertake to determine, whether a public ſtage might be ſo contrived and regulated, as to render it, at leaſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, <hi>i. e.</hi> not dangerous to the morals, or in ſome reſpects even uſeful. But, I believe, ſuch a ſtage would not anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of our comedians. He, who appears as an advocate for the theatre, ſhould conſider it as in fact it is; and not attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the public, by plauſible ſuppoſitions of a well regulated Stage, without ſettling the idea of it, and which, the writer knows, does not any where exiſt.—He muſt alſo know, that our comedians ſeem greatly afraid of any ſuch effects, as are moſt plauſibly alledged, in favour of the ſtage's uſefulneſs, and very careful to prevent them. Therefore, leaſt tragedy ſhould too deeply affect, a force muſt ſucceed, in order, if poſſible, to eraze every ſerious impreſſion.</note> O ſirs, I pray you, attend the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010562_0030_0F80BC403B302150"/>
means of grace with conſcientious diligence, ſtudy carefully, and with application to yourſelves, the important doctrines of religion, conſider your lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, commune with your own hearts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whither you are tending; be much in earneſt prayer to GOD: O proſtrate yourſelves at the throne of grace.—Though there be no certain neceſſary connection between all this, and your obtaining the ſpecial grace of GOD. (For GOD is a ſovereign in the diſpenſation of his mercy to ſinners, and can never be brought under obligations to any) yet, none ever obtained grace in a ſtate of carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In this way of earneſtly ſeeking GOD, all who ever have obtained mercy, found it. Without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly engaged in ſuch a courſe, as I have here hinted at, you cannot be ſaid to wait upon GOD, or to be ſeeking ſalvation. Yea, by your careleſs neglect, you are juſtly chargeable with chooſing your own death.—Surely, you cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally imagine, that your preſent courſe tends to eternal life. For can you think, a carnal mind is life and peace?—Your precious immortal ſouls are or greater value than the whole world: and will you be content to looſe them for trifles, and a thing of nought? What will it profit a man, if he ſhould gain the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul, or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul? Mat. xvi. 26. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation; to-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. Time is poſting
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010562_0031_0F80BC416E5E6C20"/>
on, and when it ſhall come to a cloſe with you, all opportunity of obtaining grace will be over forever. What profit will ye then have of your ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſinful indulgences, and carnal ſecurity, of which you will indeed be aſhamed? Take no reſt, I pray you, in your preſent condition. Seek ye the LORD, while he may be found, call upon him, while he is near. For which purpoſe, may GOD, of infinite mercy, give you his HOLY SPIRIT, for CHRIST'S ſake. Amen.</p>
