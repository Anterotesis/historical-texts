            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Occaſion of the Enſuing Dialogue it accounted for in the Introduction.</p>
            <p>IT's the Fruit of a few Hours pains; being begun after Noon on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and finiſhed before Noon next Day, without One tho't of it's ever being thus Expoſed to the publick view.</p>

            <p>I deſign'd to have poliſh'd it as well as I cou'd before I let it appear abroad; and (having other Buſineſs in hand) I deſerv'd the Tranſcribing it, one Week after another, hoping for a more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſon ſtill, to ſee about it.

                     <hi>Well, N.</hi> I'm thankful, and rejoyce greathy, if I can give you content; for <hi>that</hi>'s my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; hearty Deſire; and ſince you ask it of me, I'll tell you how you may Range your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to make them look moſt <hi>Formidable</hi> and fit for buſineſs. Thoſe that I've heard of, (tho' no doubt ſome of you <hi>A. R. S.</hi> that have ſuch an <hi>incomparable talent</hi> at raiſing <hi>Objections</hi> againſt <hi>Mathematical Demonſtrations,</hi> may have many more in ſtore, againſt the Day of Battel) but thoſe they've been pleas'd to favour us with the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of,</hi> are reducible to <hi>Three</hi> Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some againſt the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> which you'r pleas'd to call a <hi>New Way</hi> of Singing, and the <hi>Conſequents</hi> of it. And they are theſe <hi>Seven.</hi> (1) That it is a <hi>New Way,</hi> an <hi>Unknown Tongue.</hi> (2) That it is not ſo <hi>Melodicus</hi> as the <hi>Uſual Way.</hi> (3) That there are ſo <hi>many Tunes,</hi> we ſhall never have done lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. (4) That the Practice of it <hi>gives Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;</hi> Roils &amp; Exaſperates men's Spirits; grieves ſundry good People, and cauſes them to behave themſelves indecently &amp; diſorderly. (5) That is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002481_0015_0FDB63A7D52928F8"/>
                     <hi>Quakeriſh &amp; Popiſh,</hi> and introductive of <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Muſick. (6) That the <hi>Names</hi> given to the Notes are <hi>Baudy,</hi> yea <hi>Blaſphemous.</hi> (7) That it is a <hi>Needleſs way,</hi> ſince their <hi>good Fathers</hi> that were ſtrangers to it, are got to Heaven without it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some are againſt the <hi>Perſons,</hi> that are the Promoters, Admirers &amp; Practitioners of this way. And they are Three. (1) It's ſaid to be a <hi>Comrivance</hi> to get <hi>Money.</hi> (2) They ſpend <hi>too much time</hi> about learning; they tarry out a Nights Diſorderly, and Family-Religion is neglected by the means. (3) They'r a Company of <hi>Young Upſtarts</hi> that fall in with this way and ſet it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and ſome of them are <hi>Lewd &amp; Looſe Perſons. Thirdly,</hi> The other Objections are againſt the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>bringing</hi> Regular Singing <hi>into the Church:</hi> And theſe are peculiarly level'd againſt my ſelf. Theſe are your <hi>Principal</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; a'nt they, <hi>Nei'bor?</hi>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>As for this Objection, <hi>N.</hi> you may ſee it ſolidly anſwer'd in a little <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> Entitul'd, <hi>The Reaſonableneſs of Singing by Note;</hi> which Book was well approv'd of by very good judges of Books. I adviſe you, if you can, to get that Treatiſe, and read it, with humble Supplication to the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> that He wou'd open your Eyes to ſee the Truth there held forth unto you: And if you can't otherwiſe procure it, I'll furniſh you with it. — Now beſides that you find it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002481_0017_0FDB63AD8AE0ED68"/>there truly aſſerted, That this you call a <hi>New Way,</hi> was ſtudy'd, known and approv'd of in our <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> from the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of it; <hi>(and tho' for ſome Years of later time it was unhappily neglected, yet (bleſſed be God) it is again reviven, &amp; hope will be ever continued in that School of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>) And beſides, that it is <hi>there</hi> obſerv'd that the <hi>Notes</hi> of the Tunes were plac'd in our <hi>New-England Pſalm Books</hi> from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> with general <hi>Directions</hi> for Singing by <hi>Note;</hi> and that there are many of the <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of the firſt Setlers of <hi>New-England,</hi> who are now living, that well <hi>remember</hi> their <hi>enceſters</hi> Singing by <hi>Note;</hi> I ſay, beſides all this, It's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Singing by Note is no Novelty, ſince
<q>Muſick is one of the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> (or, (as <hi>Alsted</hi> terms it) a Mathematical Science ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate to Arithmetick,</q> and may be call'd a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Arithmetick,) has been ſo accounted in all Ages, and amongſt all learned Nations; and was doubtleſs Coaeval to, if not more ancient than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick; of which <hi>Jubal</hi> was the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tell us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover,</hi> the very Tunes prick'd in <hi>our Pſalm Books,</hi> are with little or no variation in Mr. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſereſts</hi> Pſalm-Book, printed above a <hi>Hundred</hi> Years ago; in One of which, there's an account of the Gentlemens Names, that made our Tunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Furthermore,</hi> (as is evident from a Pſalm-Book of Elder <hi>Chipman</hi>'s, now in my hands) The Church of <hi>Plymouth</hi> (which was the <hi>Firſt</hi> Church in <hi>New-England</hi>) made uſe of <hi>Ainſworth</hi>'s verſion of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002481_0018_0FDB63B0102FCC80"/>Pſalms till the Year 1692. For altho' our <hi>New-England Verſion</hi> of the Pſalms was compoſed by ſundry Hands, and compleated by Preſident <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
                     <note n="(1)" place="margin">Magnal. <hi>B.</hi> 3 <hi>p.</hi> 100.</note> about the Year 1640; yet that Church did not uſe it, it ſeems, till about Two &amp; Fifty Years after, but ſtuck to <hi>Ainſworth;</hi> and till about 1682. their <hi>excellent</hi> Cuſtom was to Sing <hi>without</hi> Reading the Line. Now, in <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Pſalm-book, there are about 44 Tunes, and but 4 of them that I ever ſaw (to my knowledge) any where, ſave in <hi>that</hi> Pſalm-book: And there the Tune is pricked as in <hi>Ravenſcroſis</hi> &amp; <hi>Playford</hi>'s at the beginning of the Pſalm, or you there find a <hi>Reference</hi> to the Tune the Pſalm is to be ſung in, ſo that all the <hi>Chief Maſician</hi> or <hi>Choriſter</hi> had to do, was to give the <hi>Pitch</hi> and lead the Tune, and all were to ſing according to the Notes in the Pſalm Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Briefly,</hi> all that know any thing to purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Singing by Note, know as certainly, as they can any thing, that what is now call'd the <hi>Uſual Way,</hi> in oppoſition to Singing by Note, is but a <hi>Defective Imitation</hi> of the Regular Way. And in ſome Places, they've kept nearer to the Rule, and in others, they've varied more from it. And wherever they differ any thing conſiderable, their Singing, as to the external part of it, is ſo far Defective and Irregular. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally,</hi> Singing Skilfully or by Note is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; by juſt conſequence requir'd in the <hi>Word of GOD;</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33, 3. &amp; 47.7. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>M.</hi> As to this Objection alſo; you may find it ſufficiently anſwer'd in the Book I before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to. And not to enlarge here, I'll honeſtly confeſs to you that before I was pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Rules of Singing, I rather <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd</hi> the <hi>Uſual,</hi> than the Regular way: But my <hi>Judgment</hi> ſatisfy'd me the Regular muſt be beſt. And I know, one reaſon why my Fancy for the preſent was moſt gratify'd with my ſinging the Uſual way, was, becauſe I was uſed to <hi>that,</hi> and not Maſter of <hi>the other.</hi> And hence it is, that <hi>Home is Home, be it never ſo Homely.</hi> And even ſo the miſerable <hi>Hottentots</hi> (pardon the Compariſon!) who think to adorn themſelves with the <hi>Gats of Beaſts,</hi> with all the Garbage in them; prefer theſe Guts to a <hi>Chain of Gold,</hi> becauſe it's what they'r uſed to, and it pleaſes their Fancies. But ſurely if they'd exerciſe <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Ornaments us'd by other People, are more beautiful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming; or elſe all the Civiliz'd &amp; Polite part of the World are deceiv'd and thoſe Dregs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are in the Right of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore.</hi> I've ſaid to ſome of my Hearers, that if any of you <hi>A. R. S</hi>'s would take the pains to <hi>acquaint your ſelves</hi> with the <hi>Rules</hi> of Singing, ſo as to be able to Sing 6 or 7 Tunes tolerably by Art, <hi>If they did not then ſay as I do,</hi> that ſinging by Note is Unſpeakably preferrible to ſinging the Uſual way; <hi>I'd give up the Cauſe as to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides,</hi> There are <hi>few</hi> of you <hi>A. R. S</hi>'s, that ever heard Singing in the ſeveral parts of Muſick; and ſome of you don't know the <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002481_0022_0FDB63B9CFC61DD0"/>the Treble &amp; Baſs. Hence I heard one, (that your Fraternity ſet much by) ſay, that <hi>the Treble &amp; Baſs muſt be ſung with the ſame Voice!</hi> And another was pleas'd to ſay in my Hearing, That one Sabbath-day in a certain Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe, there was <hi>Four ſorts</hi> of Singing! for ſome ſung <hi>Rowly Way;</hi> and ſome ſung the <hi>Uſual Way;</hi> and ſome ſung the <hi>New Way;</hi> and ſome ſung <hi>Baſs.</hi> Whence I learnt that the Uſual Way at one Town, and the Uſual Way at another, were very <hi>Different: Fas eſt</hi> —. Now there is no man can judge aright of the Melody of Singing by Note; that has not heard Tunes ſung in the ſeveral parts, or in Conſort; and that not by <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> only, but by <hi>ideptiſts,</hi> or at leaſt perſons <hi>well skill'd</hi> in the Science of Muſick; any more, than a man can judge of <hi>Reading,</hi> by Hearing one Read that <hi>juſt begins</hi> to put his <hi>Syllables</hi> together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Conſider <hi>N.</hi> that the <hi>Beauty</hi> and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Singing conſiſts very much in a juſt <hi>Timing &amp; Turning</hi> the Notes: every Singer keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exact <hi>Pitch</hi> the Tune is ſet in, according to the part he Sings. Now you in the <hi>Uſual</hi> Way, are very <hi>faulty</hi> on this account. Hence you may remember, that in our Congregation we us'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have ſome People Singing a Note or Two, <hi>after the reſt</hi> had done.

                  <hi>Once more,</hi> I put it to your Conſcience <hi>N.</hi> who are the <hi>Beſt Judges</hi> of Melody, Such as can Sing <hi>both</hi> the Uſual Way and by Note; or they that can Sing <hi>neither;</hi> or only the <hi>Uſual Way?</hi> Why truly <hi>N.</hi> the man deſerves to be more ſeverely ſtigmatiz'd, than ſome can well bear, that won't readily ſay, the <hi>Former:</hi> And if ſo, we're ſure the Caſe will be decided in our favour. For the <hi>Chief Muſicians</hi> in our Country &amp; Nation, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Regular Way, as Unſpeakably moſt Melodious; and our Reaſon and Senſe tell us ſo likewiſe: Whereas it is only an Ungovern'd Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy tells you the contrary. This ſeveral amongſt us, declare upon Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> ſuppoſe your way is after all, by you eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt Melodious; yet ſurely the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of People's learning to Sing by Rule, ſhould prevail with all that love God, to deny their own Fancy, rather than in the leaſt diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch a Method of Singing For, I truſt we'r all agreed that Singing the Praiſes of GOD is a Duty incumbent on us Chriſtians. And if it be a Duty to Sing, it is a Duty to uſe our endeavours to learn to Sing. For we don't come <hi>Singing,</hi> but <hi>Crying</hi> into the World. And tho' ſome have a more Muſical Genius than others, yet Men don't Sing as <hi>naturally,</hi> as <hi>Pigs Squeak,</hi> or Children Cry; but their Genius muſt be <hi>Cultivated,</hi> e're they can Sing with skill &amp; underſtanding. Now if we are to learn any Art we ſhall ſurely take the <hi>E firſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Speedy</hi> way to learn it; and this generally ſpeaking is by acquainting our
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002481_0024_0FDB63BC06C8C548"/>ſelves with the <hi>Rudiments &amp; Rules</hi> of that Art. If we would teach our Children <hi>to Read,</hi> we don't ſet them firſt into <hi>Chronicles,</hi> but to their <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi> or Primmer. And ſo if we would learn to Sing, we muſt firſt learn to <hi>raiſe our Notes.</hi>— And I profeſs were I to learn the <hi>Uſual</hi> way for my life, I'd firſt learn to Sing by <hi>Note.</hi> And I'll engage, every Maſter of Song among us will ſay with me. And this we know, that there are Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, can learn to Sing no <hi>other way,</hi> that can learn <hi>by Rule.</hi> And will you ſhut out ſo great a part of Mankind from joyning in the Worſhip of GOD, for a <hi>meer</hi> Fancy, and a <hi>Groundleſs</hi> one? When if you turn the Tables, all that can learn the Uſual way eaſily, can if they will learn the other.—I might here (by the way) ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a <hi>Silly Objection,</hi> Iv'e heard, that it can't be right to Sing by Note; becauſe it's ſo <hi>eaſy to learn it.</hi> Surely no man need go Seven years to <hi>College</hi> to know how to anſwer this! Won't you ſuffer your Children to learn to <hi>Read,</hi> or <hi>Write,</hi> or <hi>Cypher,</hi> becauſe ſome, yea the generality of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Trung Men,</hi> learn all theſe things with a great deal of <hi>Facility;</hi> whilſt ſuch as did not learn them when Young, can never learn them, without the greateſt <hi>Difficulties,</hi> if at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides,</hi> ſometimes you object. It's ſo <hi>Difficult</hi> to learn to Sing by Rule, that it's more <hi>pains</hi> than <hi>profit:</hi> more coſt than worſhip. Thus do your Objections <hi>Militate</hi> with one another; and I'll leave you to reconcile 'em; or e'n let 'em fight it out! So then your <hi>Uſual Way</hi> of Singing,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002481_0025_0FDB63BF0EBEA880"/>(wherein you Sing commonly the Treble only, not keeping your Pitch, not keeping Time; or turning your Notes alike) is as much leſs Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious (to a Muſical Ear &amp; proper Judge of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) than our Singing a Tune in the ſeveral parts of Muſick with great Exactneſs, as a Tune play'd by an <hi>Unskilful</hi> Hand, or an <hi>Untun'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> is leſs Melodious than the ſame Tune play'd on a <hi>Well-tun'd</hi> Inſtrument, with great Accuracy, by a <hi>Skilful Muſician.</hi> And this I think you may Conceive of, or you'r neighty dull of Apprehenſion.</p>

               <p>However, To <hi>gratify</hi> you <hi>N.</hi> I'll ſay in a few words!
