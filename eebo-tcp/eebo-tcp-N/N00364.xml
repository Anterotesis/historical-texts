            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> The Love of God is a Grace rather to be <hi>felt</hi> than desin'd, so that I can do no more than rudely describe it: It is the general Inclination and Tendency of the whole man, of all his heart, and soul, and strength; of all his powers and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and of the utmost <hi>strength</hi> of them all to GOD, as his Chief, and only and perfect, and infinite Good.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Catechism having in the entrance of it presented to our Choice the Happiness of a Chrstian, does throughout all the remaining parts of it instruct us in the Duties of a Christian, by which that Happiness is to be attain'd, which are all summ'd up in the <hi>Love of God,</hi> which is here most methodically taught. <note place="margin">

it, the former is taught in the Vow of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the latter in the Creed.</p>
            <p>When divine Love is once produc'd, my next care is to put it in practice, and that is by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruits, or effects of Love, which are all contained in the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>When the Love of God is produc'd in my heart, and is set on work, my last concern is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and ensure, and quicken it: It is preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Prayer, the pattern of which is the <hi>Lord's Prayer:</hi> It is ensured to us by the Sacraments which are the Pledges of Love; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is quickened by the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which is the <hi>Feast of Love:</hi> So that the plain order of the Catechisme teacheth me the rise, the progress, and the perfection of Divine Love, which God of His great mercy give me Grace to follow!</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, In God the</hi> SON, <hi>who hath Redeemed me and all man-kind,</hi>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Method of the Creed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Creed teaches me to believe in God, and to believe in His Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How in God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It teaches me to believe in God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to His Unity, and then to the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in that Unity, Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How does it teach you to believe the Church:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It teaches me to believe the Church, with regard to its two different states, either Militant below, or Triumphant above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How are the Articles of the Creed Motives of Love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Every Article includes a Blessing as well as a Mystery, and is as proper to excite our <hi>Love,</hi> as to engage our Faith.</p>

            <p>THe Chatechism truly teaches all Christians that they are <hi>not able of themselves to do those things</hi> they have vowed in their Baptism to do, namely, <hi>To walk in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to serve Him, without His Special Grace,</hi> or favourable Assistance, and this <hi>they are to learn at all times to call upon God for, by diligent Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How good and seasonable this advice is, you will all see, if you consider what helpless and needy Creatures the very <hi>best</hi> of men are. Alas! our weakness is very great, our wants are very many, our Dependance on God for all things all our lives long, is entire, and absolute, and necessary, and there is no way in the world to gain Help and Supplies from God, but by Prayer; so that it is as easie. and as possible to preserve a natural Life without daily Bread, as a Christian Life without daily Prayer.</p>
            <p>It was for this Reason that our Saviour Himself took a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care, to teach His Disciples to pray <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lue.</hi> 11. 1.</note>: and it is for the same Reason, and in imitation of our Heavenly Master, that I have joyned these <hi>Directions for Prayer</hi> to the Catechism.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, the Zeal I ought to have for your Salvation, can suggest to me nothing more Conducing to the Good of your Souls, than to Exhort and Beseech you all, of either Sex,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000445_0110_0FA5AD8B9CF8F248"/>
to learn how to Pray.</p>
            <p>This is the first general Request I shall make to you, and I am the more earnest in it, because my own sad Experience has taught me, how strangely ignorant common people usually are of this Duty; insomuch that some never pray at all, pretending they were never taught, or that their memories are bad, or that they are not Book-learn't, or that they want mony to buy a Book; and by this means they live and dye rather like Beasts than Men; nay, their Condition is much worse than that of Beasts, for the misery of a Beast doth end at death, but the Misery of a wicked man does then begin, and will endure to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>To prevent then as much as lies in me the Damnation of those souls which God has committed to my Care, and to cure that lamentable Ignorance and Forgetfulness of GOD, which is the cause of the Damnation of so very many, I do not only incessantly pray for you my self, but I beg of you all to pray for your selves, and I beseech you to read the following Instructions; or if you cannot read your selves, to get some honest charitable Neighbours to read them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> often to you, that you may remember them, and God of His Great Mercy reward the Charity of such Neighbours.</p>
            <p>If any of you, either by your own Negligence, or by the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of your parents, or for want of Catechising in your Parish, are wholly ignorant of your Duty: tho it be a most shameful and dangerous thing, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> who calls himself a Christian, to know nothing of Christ or Christianity; yet if you are willing to learn, and beg pardon of God for your wilful ignorance hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and will sincerely do your endeavour to get saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and heartily pray to God to assist you, you shall find, that the very <hi>Entrance of God's Word giveth light, that it giveth Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing unto the Simple</hi>

            <p>I must warn you before hand, that corrupt Nature will be very busie in hindering the learning of your Duty and Thoughts will arise in your mind that the Task will be too hard and too tedious for you to undertake; but I faithfully promise you, to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:000445_0111_0FA5AD8C6FE94628"/>
impose no hard or tedious Task on you, but such as you your selves shall confess to be very complying with your Infirmities; for our most compassionate Saviour teaches me to say no more to you than <hi>you can bear</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 11.</note>.</p>
            <p>All I shall exhort you to, is, to learn your Catechism, which you may do by degrees; if you learn but a line or two in a day, you will by God's Blessing, in a very short time learn it all over, and you will rejoice, and thank God, for the sudden and happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress you have made.</p>
            <p>God forbid you should ever think your selves too old to learn to serve GOD, and to be Saved, both which are taught in the Catechism, and therefore the Catechism is of necessity to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for how can you go to heaven if you never learn'd the way thither? How can you be saved if you do not know your Saviour?</p>
            <p>'Tis a great Error, to think that the Catechism was made for Children only, for all Christians are equally concern'd in those saving Truths which are there taught; and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine delivered in the Catechism, is as proper for the Study, and as necessary for the Salvation of a great Doctor, as of a weak Christian or a young Child.</p>
            <p>But you will be the more encouraged to learn your Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, when you see how excellent a help it will be to prayer, for it will at the same time further your Knowledge and your Devotion, both together; and the prayers I intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, are chiefly the very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Answers in the Catechism, which being daily repeated, will be the better fix't in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and you cannot imagine any advice for Prayer can be more easie, and Familiar, than that which directs you to turn your very <hi>Catechism</hi> into prayers.</p>
            <p>You are by this time (I hope) satisfied, that the Duty to which I exhort you, is no hard task; and yet I will endeavour, by God's Assistance, to make it more easie, by putting you into an easie Method to attain it.</p>
            <p>If you are wholly ignorant of your Catechism, let it be your first care to learn such Ejaculations, such short prayers as these, and say them often and heartily.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Such short Prayers as these you may easily get by heart, and the method in which I advise you to proceed, is, that in which <hi>Children</hi> are commonly taught, in regard I am now to look on you as a Child: for there are two sorts of Children; there are Children in Age, and Children in <hi>Understanding</hi>
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20.</note>, and in this latter respect you are Children, and the same method, for the most part, is proper for you, which is proper for those that are Children in age.</p>
            <p>I must therefore feed you <hi>with Milk,</hi> before you can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>strong meat</hi>
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13.</note>, and I must look on you as <hi>Lambs</hi> of my Flock, which I am to use tenderly, and these following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which I give to parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the training up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Piety, I do equally design for the training up of you. God of His infinite Goodness, bless them to you both.</p>
            <p>I exhort all you who are parents, to instil good things into your Children, as soon as ever they begin to speak; let the first words they utter, if possible, be these, <hi>Glory be to God.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom them to repeat these words on their knees, as soon as they Rise, and when they go to bed, and oft times in the day; and let them not eat or drink, without saying, <hi>Glory be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As their Speech grows more plain and easie to them, Teach them who Made, and Redeem'd, and Sanctified them, and for what End, Namely, to Glorifie and to Love GOD; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, teach them some of the shortest Ejaculations you can, such as these;</p>

            <p>Within a little time you may teach them the Lord's Prayer, and hear them say it every day, Morning and Evening, on their knees, with some one or more of the fore-going Ejaculations; and by degrees as they grow up, they will learn the Creed, and the whole Catechism.</p>
            <p>Be sure to teach your Children with all the sweetness and gentleness you can, lest if you should be severe, or should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>task them, Religion should seem to them, rather a Burden than a Blessing.</p>
            <p>As their Knowledge encreases, so let their Prayers encrease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and teach them as they go to turn their Catechism into Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, after the manner which I shall shew you, and to Confirm and improve their Knowledge, bring them duly to the Church to be Catechised by the parish Priest, that by his familiar and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Explications of the Catechism, they may learn to understand it, and may be capable of Reading the Exposition on it, and other Books of Piety.</p>
            <p>Take conscientious Care to Season your Children as early as you can, with the Love of GOD, which is <hi>the first and great Commandment</hi>
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">

Instead of these two last Prayers, you may sometimes say the Ten Commandments, which you may turn into a very good prayer, by saying after every one,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me, and encline my heart to keep this Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where you not only beg pardon for the sins you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against each Commandment, but you also beg Grace to keep it.</p>
                  <p>At the end of them you may say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me, and write all these thy Laws in my heart, I beseech Thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so conlude with the <hi>Lord's Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not think that this practice of Prayer will be too hard, or too long for young persons, or for labouring people; for if you cannot say them all, say as much as you can; or if you are at day-Labour, and have not Time or Convenience to say them, offer up to God two or three hearty Ejaculations in their place. But if you can get time &amp; convenience, say them all: And I dare assure you, that all the three Forms of Prayer which I commend to you, will not in all take up a Quarter of an hour: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that person has very little sense of his Duty, very little concern for his immortal soul, very little Honour for God, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for Heaven, who will not spend one quarter of an hour in the space of four and twenty hours, in the Service of God, and the Salvation of his own soul.</p>
                  <p>I do by all means exhort you, to give your Servants a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes leisure at noon, to pray after your Example, and to use your Children to do the same, for they will soon be able to say the Lord's Prayer, and two or three Ejaculations, and teach them to say these at Noon, as well as at morning &amp; at night, and 'tis incredible to think, how much good this practice will do them, and what great comfort you your selves will reap from the early Devotion of your Children.</p>
                  <p>To further this Devotion in your Children, instead of idle Tales, and Songs, which pollute their souls, and when they come
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000445_0120_0FA5AD99D1931D70"/>
to be serious, will cost them great pains to unlearn. You must teach them short Psalms by heart, which will excercise their Memories and Piety, both together; and as you teach the Psalms to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I exhort you to learn them <hi>your selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You cannot imagine the great benefit of learning Psalms by heart, for when you are under any Temptation, or are in any Affliction, or when you lye waking in the Night, or when you are sick, these Psalms will come into your mind, and the devout Repeating them will yield you most seasonable Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                  <p>The very Common People, in the first and purest Ages of the Church, were so sensible of the spiritual Advantages of learning Psalms, that they learn'd the whole Psalter by heart, and sang or said the Psalms in their Shops and at the plow, insomuch that St. <hi>James</hi> makes it the proper Expression of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Mirth <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam</hi> 5. 13.</note>, <hi>If any be merry, let him sing Psalms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the way to store your own and your Childrens minds with Ejaculations, or short Prayers for all Occasions, which I advise both Old and Young to accustom themselves to, because it is the true way of Praying without ceasing, and it is a kind of Prayer most easie, and may be used at any time of the day, or in any place, and is one of the most efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means in the world to keep us in Gods Favour, which is of all things most desirable.</p>
