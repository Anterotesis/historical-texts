            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Armies of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were now gathered together in the Coaſt of <hi>Dammim,</hi> and pitched between <hi>Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choh</hi> and <hi>Azekah,</hi> a Place belonging to <hi>Judah</hi>: And, in order to oppoſe them, SAUL and the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered together alſo and pitched by the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Elah</hi> and had ſet the Battle in Array againſt them: The former Army ſtood on a Mountain on one ſide; and the latter ſtood on a Mountain on the other; ſo that there was only a Valley between them.</p>
            <p>Behold now a <hi>Champion marches out of the Camp of the</hi> Philiſtines, named GOLIATH, who was of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Size and formidable Appearance: He comes in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004389_0005_100D4D7459768630"/>
warlike Armor complete, and with a <hi>Spear</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as much exceeding common ones, as his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exceeded the common Stature of Mankind: He <hi>advances to defy the Armies of</hi> Iſrael, and challenges them to produce a Man that would be ſo hardy as to encounter him.</p>
            <p>SAUL, the unhappy King whom <hi>GOD gave in His Anger</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was preſent to behold the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the Diſorder and Confuſion of his enervated People: And all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were overwhelmed with the fearful Expectation of ignominious and cruel Slavery: <hi>Terror itſelf</hi> had chilled the Hearts of the whole <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elitiſh</hi> Hoſt and cauſed the Faces of the moſt Brave among them to be covered with Diſtreſs and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>View</hi> of ſuch a tremendous Adverſary, and at the <hi>Hearing his mighty Voice, his daring Challenges and his fierce,</hi> tho' too early <hi>Boaſts and Threatnings,</hi> their <hi>fainting Souls were upon the Wing and the Shades of the Night were juſt ruſhing over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, when there was not a Man of the whole <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Army, that had the Heart to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for them, to eſpouſe their Cauſe and revenge their Wrongs; Almighty GOD of His ineffable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſpoſed and excited a brave Soldier to accept the Challenge of the haughty GOLIATH: 'Twas DAVID the great, the good, the generous, who with his gallant, but gentle, Voice revives the Hopes of diſheartned <hi>Iſrael</hi> and recals their departing Spirits.</p>
            <p>The intimidated <hi>Iſraelitiſh Monarch</hi> indeed could not at firſt believe and hope, that DAVID by Reaſon of his tender Youth was <hi>equal to the vaſt Encounter,</hi> and therefore endeavours to diſſwade him from the Tho'ts of it.</p>
            <p>But the young Hero, inſtead of being diſcouraged and turned aſide by the Speech of his King, grows rather more courageous and more reſolved for the Combate: For he was <hi>ſtrong in the LORD and in the Power of his Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004389_0006_100D4D76F08FF220"/>Being therefore Divinely fortified in his Mind, he hence ſays to his terrified Prince, <hi>Thy Servant will go and fight with this</hi> Philiſtine, <hi>ſeeing he has defied the Armies of the living GOD</hi>; Q. D. Tho' you, my Sovereign, have endeavoured to put me off from my propoſed Encounter, you have only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in my valorous Purpoſe. 'Tis true GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIATH is a Warrior, an old and experienced War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and I allow that I am but a <hi>Learner in the Art of War</hi>: But in the preſent Caſe I have <hi>an unſhaken Reliance,</hi> not on my own Power and Skill, but on the Recruits and Aids of Divine Power and Grace: The audacious, godleſs Giant has reproached our GOD, who therefore muſt be his Enemy: And, when this our GOD is my Friend I have no Doubt but that HE will be <hi>my potent Auxiliary and crown me with Victory and Triumph:</hi> It muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he places great Dependance on the Strength of his Body, the Force of his Valor and the Glory of his Arms: But yet I have much the Advantage of him: For the <hi>Divine Majeſty is my Strength: He is my Deliverer and my Shield; and in Him do I put my Truſt to ſubdue</hi> this Gigantic Mortal <hi>under me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſpake the brave DAVID: And the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Speech was, that King SAUL was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by it to let him engage with their Enemy: Accordingly, that he might be equip'd for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we read, in <hi>Verſe twenty ninth</hi> of the preceeding Context, that <hi>SAUL armed DAVID with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Some Expoſitors have hence abſurdly enow ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that SAUL put <hi>his own diſproportioned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable Armor</hi> upon him: I ſaid, They have <hi>abſurdly ſuppoſed</hi> it: For it is altogether unlikely and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that SAUL ſhould put the Arms deſign'd and made for his own <hi>Majeſtically tall Body,</hi> which over-top'd all <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Head, upon the ſmall Body of DAVID. But others have with more Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004389_0007_100D4D78795A5F80"/>
determined, that <hi>this Armor is called</hi> SAUL<hi>'s, becauſe it was taken out of his Magazine or Armory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DAVID then, being thus clad and accoutred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the King's Mind, finds that his Arms, inſtead of being a Service, would be an Injury to Him and an Impediment to his Victory: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determines to lay them aſide. <hi>And DAVID ſaid unto SAUL, I cannot go with Theſe: For I have not proved them.</hi> Q. D. My Prince and Sovereign, <hi>I am going to fight</hi> with that proud and vain GOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATH: <hi>Tis fit and requiſite, that I have ſuitable Arms</hi> with which to go againſt him: And, as I <hi>have not by proving Theſe found them to be ſo, I ought not to go with Them,</hi> but <hi>ſhould proceed to the Engagement with ſuch Arms as are moſt proper</hi> for me and which are moſt likely to be uſed well and ſucceſsfully by me.</p>
            <p>By the Words therefore, in this Exhibition of them before us, we are fairly led to endeavour theſe three Things, namely,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, <hi>To juſtify the Lawfulneſs of going to War:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then, To conſider Arms as requiſite</hi> for them that go to War: And</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>To ſhew, that Men cannot well, nor ſhould, go to War but with ſuch Arms as are proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, <hi>The Lawfulneſs of going to War is to be juſtified</hi> by us.</p>
            <p>And here we ſhall readily grant, that <hi>War is a very grievous Calamity and Judgment:</hi> For <hi>It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi> for the moſt part from wild <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs</hi> or <hi>inordinate Anger</hi> or ſome other irregular

Frame of Mind: And, if it ſhould be ever ſo <hi>juſt and righteous as its Cauſes</hi>; it is however ſo <hi>pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hateful a Thing</hi> as that no good Man can be well pleaſed with it.</p>
            <p>For not to mention <hi>the Men</hi> generally improved by States and Princes for carrying it on, who, tho' They be ſtyled <hi>Regular Forces,</hi> are yet for the moſt Part <hi>faithleſs,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For it is certainly <hi>agreeable to the Law of Nature,</hi> and ſo it has unanſwerably bin proved to be over and over again by learned Civilians, that <hi>a People, as ſuch, have their juſt Rights and Claims,</hi> that <hi>They may and ſhould aſſert and maintain Theſe,</hi> and, in ſo doing, <hi>repel the Violence uſed againſt Them</hi> with their beſt Forces.</p>
            <p>And, altho' the peaceable Men juſt mentioned have taken the Liberty to quote ſome Paſſages from the Writings of the old and new Covenant, and form'd ſome ſpecious Arguments from them againſt going to War; yet it can eaſily be prov'd, as that the <hi>Texts</hi> produc'd are <hi>not well underſtood</hi> by them, and conſequently <hi>the Arguments collected</hi> from them cannot be good; ſo that <hi>the Paſſages in Scripture, which are in Favor of going to War, are many and very conſiderable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That GOD in the Law, which He gave to the <hi>Hebrews, directed them with reſpect to the Way and Manner wherein They ſhould proclaim, begin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Wars,</hi> This cannot reaſonably be denied: But now <hi>ſuch Things as are Evil are rather to be diſallowed and forbidden</hi> than <hi>permitted</hi> and even <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended</hi> with ſuitable Statutes and Laws.</p>
            <p>It is ſuggeſted indeed by the Enemies to War aforeſaid, as if Teſtimonies from the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> could not be of great Validity in this Caſe; becauſe there are many Things to be found in That, which ought not to be imitated by us.</p>
            <p>But the Reply to This is eaſy, which is, that, altho' it be true, it is nothing to the preſent Purpoſe: For the Things written in the Law of MOSES con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>War</hi> refer to <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> which is

perpetual: It being eternally right and juſt, that the Innocent ſhould be protected and the Evil and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive repreſs'd.</p>
            <p>And beſides, We read, in the Eleventh to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> concerning DAVID and other ancient Worthies, that <hi>by Faith they ſubdued Kingdoms, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valiant in War and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens:</hi> But, if they did theſe Things <hi>in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith,</hi> they <hi>were not then to blame for their thus Warring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in our Scriptural Proofs of the Lawfulneſs of going to War, we are <hi>not confined to the Law and the Prophets:</hi> We have <hi>other Teſtimonies,</hi> beſides Theſe, to be taken <hi>from the Books of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>

And it is doubted by ſome, who have made it their Buſineſs to enquire into ſuch Things, whether it be ſo old: For about the Year <hi>fifteen hundred and ſixty</hi> ſome Muſkets and but a very few of them were mix'd with <hi>Harquebuſſes:</hi> So that, according to this, it muſt have bin <hi>forty Years</hi> before the <hi>Hand-Gun</hi> had learned to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Hand-Guns</hi> or <hi>Muſkets</hi> have from the Time of their firſt Invention bin of various Lengths and Bores: But it is proper to obſerve here, that it is always fit <hi>the Muſkets of one Army and of one State or Kingdom ſhould be exactly of but one Bore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Muſkets,</hi> there are now <hi>other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for the Foot,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Touks, Shables, two handed Swords, Hangmen's Swords, Javelins, Morning Stars, Rapiers</hi>; moſt of which are rather for <hi>the Defence of Batteries, Forts and Towns</hi> than for the Field. As for the <hi>light-arm'd Foot,</hi> They for the moſt Part are now arm'd with <hi>Muſket and Sword</hi> or <hi>Rapier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Cavalry</hi> or Horſe, They have now their peculiar Weapons; as <hi>the Piſtol,</hi> which was invented by CAMILLO VITELLI an <hi>Italian,</hi> in the Time of HENRY <hi>the Eighth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Harquebuſs,</hi> which is of older Date, and the <hi>Carabine.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabine</hi> is uſually <hi>carried about the Soldier's Neck</hi> in a Bandileer of Leather, which is a far eaſier Way of carrying them than the former one of <hi>hanging them at their Saddles.</hi> Some, inſtead of theſe <hi>Carabines,</hi> carry <hi>Blunderbuſſes,</hi> which are <hi>ſhort Hand-Guns</hi> of a great Bore. <hi>Broad Swords</hi> were conſtantly uſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> As for the <hi>Rapier,</hi> that is not above forty Years old; altho' <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Nor may we omit to mention here <hi>great Guns,</hi> which by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are accurately divided into the <hi>Cannon,</hi> the <hi>Culverin,</hi> the <hi>Pierior</hi> and the <hi>Mortar.</hi> Each of which are ſub-divided into ſeveral Sorts
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004389_0018_100D4D8F5E36E0E8"/>
according to their various Bores: The <hi>three former</hi> are generally made of <hi>Iron Braſs and Copper:</hi> The <hi>latter,</hi> I think, is generally of <hi>Iron:</hi> And, under the <hi>Mortar,</hi> may be comprehended <hi>Pot-Pieces, Square Murtherers, Tortles and Petards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mortars</hi> are of vaſt Uſe in <hi>Sieges</hi> both to <hi>the Defendants and the Aſſailants:</hi> For, while the <hi>Former</hi> uſe them againſt the Batteries and Approaches of their Enemies to deſtroy their Men, to burn their Ammunition and ruin their Works; the <hi>Latter</hi> uſe them to terrify and annoy the Beſieged, to burn their Houſes and Magazines with Granadoes, or break them down with ponderous Stones.</p>
            <p>Thus I have curſorily <hi>called over the moſt uſed and approv'd Arms</hi> of both the Ancients and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, and <hi>rank'd them in the beſt Order I could.</hi> And, altho' what I have thus done might appear very ſtrangely on any other Occaſion; yet, in ſuch an Auditory as This, there cannot, I think, be any ſufficient Reaſon to blame me for it.</p>
            <p>It might now perhaps be expected, that I ſhould enter into ſome Enquiry, <hi>which Arms are in going to War to be prefer'd, The Ancient or the Modern:</hi> But, as the Learned are divided on this Head, I ſhall not venture to give Judgment upon it: Only thus far I will take leave to ſay, that <hi>We Moderns are frequently partial and commonly judge in our own Favor</hi>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004389_0019_100D4D90E7D15C00"/>As <hi>Uſe and Exerciſe</hi> is the End of <hi>other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; ſo the <hi>ſame</hi> is <hi>the End of all warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in particular: And, without <hi>the Uſe and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Proof of Them, their deſigned End is not attain'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if any <hi>pretend to appear in Arms,</hi> which They <hi>know not how to uſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>They never exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and proved</hi> Them, They <hi>deſerve to be condemned for their Folly and Raſhneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Chriſtian and Apoſtolical Hero the bleſſed PAUL acquaints us, that after the Manner of Men <hi>He fought with Beaſts at</hi> Epheſus, in 1 Cor. XV. 22. And, without Doubt, in that Encounter He <hi>ſkilfully and ſucceſsfully uſed the Weapons commonly improved</hi> againſt Beaſts in the <hi>Amphitheater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if any ſhould <hi>go to War either with Beaſts or Men with Weapons which they have not exercis'd and prov'd,</hi> inſtead of <hi>fighting after the Manner of Men,</hi> They would only <hi>fight after the Manner of Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>perhaps not in ſo ſkilful a Manner</hi> as they.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that in thoſe Times and Places, when and where <hi>Men have not known the uſe of warlike Inſtruments,</hi> and have bin <hi>unacquainted with Military Order</hi>; the <hi>ſtrongeſt Party has generally,</hi> if not always, <hi>prov'd victorious and triumphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſince <hi>Men have learned the Art of War, the ſkilful Uſe of Military Weapons and the ſuitable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Soldiers</hi> in Rank and File; this <hi>Military Science</hi> is of <hi>equal Conſequence with Strength,</hi> or rather <hi>ſuperior</hi> to it. It has to be ſure a direct <hi>Tendency to make Men courageous:</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, <hi>a Multitude without Skill</hi> in Arms and <hi>ignorant of Order</hi> are uſually <hi>daſtardly</hi> and mean-ſpirited, and <hi>eaſily ſubdued</hi> by an inferior Number who are vers'd in the Military Art.</p>
            <p>We may well conclude then from theſe Things, that <hi>the Proof of Arms and Military Diſcipline is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether convenient and neceſſary</hi> among every Nation and People.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004389_0020_100D4D927A4AAB20"/>This <hi>Military Science and Skill</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's knowing how to proceed and fight</hi> on Horſe or a Foot <hi>with Order, Regularity and Readineſs:</hi> And This is to be acquir'd <hi>in the Way of Drilling or Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that <hi>Men in this Way may be form'd for complete Soldiers,</hi> They ſhould, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, <hi>be taught their Poſtures</hi>; that is to ſay, They ſhould be <hi>inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how to handle and manage their Arms with Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and Vigor, Readineſs and Beauty</hi>: And then; They ſhould <hi>be made in a Body to perform their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Evolutions,</hi> or to <hi>move in ſuch an Order and caſt themſelves into ſuch a Figure</hi> as ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here be ſo minute as to ſay any Thing concerning <hi>the particular Exerciſes of the Horſe and Foot,</hi> leſt I ſhould be tireſome to Thoſe of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory who are acquainted already with theſe Things: But I would only obſerve, that <hi>the Words of Command both for Horſe and Foot in their Motions are the very ſame</hi>; tho' <hi>the Diſtances</hi> requir'd of Them are <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>

his Journey and while he winter'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> he ſo far improv'd himſelf in <hi>the Art of War by conſulting the Hiſtories</hi> he had formerly read, that, after ſeveral Battles and Sieges, MITHRIDATES pronounc'd him to be the moſt expert and able Commander next to ALEXANDER commonly called <hi>the Great</hi> that he had known or read of in Hiſtory: but he is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and extraordinary Inſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavor'd the Illuſtration and Proof of the Points offer'd to our Conſideration: And, if after all that has bin offer'd any ſhould think, either that <hi>War is not lawful</hi> in the Caſes which have bin mention'd, or that <hi>Arms are not requiſite and neceſſary for carrying it on,</hi> or that <hi>Men may go to War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Skill in Arms from the Proof and Exerciſe</hi> of them; I muſt ingenuouſly own, that I deſpair of convincing and ſatisfying them to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Improvement</hi> of what has bin offered now remains: And it ſhall be made in a threefold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, <hi>To the ancient and honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> who have done me the Honor of an unanimous Choice to this Service; then, <hi>To the Government over us</hi>; and, in fine, <hi>To this whole Militant Aſſembly.</hi>

For it would be of dangerous and very bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be <hi>obliged to learn Military Skill, when the immediate Exerciſe of it is wanted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>where is Military Skill to be learned but in the proper School of it?</hi> Such, Sirs, is your Company: It was <hi>founded for this End by</hi> the Government: And, as it has bin <hi>of great Uſe and Advantage</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for obtaining this End; ſo we cannot but <hi>deſire and hope, that it will be yet more and more ſucceſsful</hi> towards it.</p>
            <p>The Generality of our People, I fear, <hi>look upon Training as an uſeleſs Exerciſe or only a trifling Piece of Recreation:</hi> For, at our <hi>annual Trainings, the Practice of many of our common Soldiers is ſportful</hi> and ludicrous: But this is a <hi>vaſt Indecency:</hi> And yet it is a much greater Piece of Indecorum and an higher Fault, if any of <hi>the Officers can wink or ſmile</hi> at any ſuch Irregularities.</p>
            <p>We may well expect of You, Sirs, who are our <hi>Maſters in the Art of War,</hi> that <hi>our Trainings and Martial Exerciſes be gravely perform'd</hi> and that our <hi>Skill in Military Diſcipline grow and encreaſe</hi> by a diligent Proof of it, that <hi>our Men,</hi> while <hi>under Arms,</hi> be ſo ſedate and quiet as that no Voice be heard but their Commander's, and that, <hi>after they are diſmiſſed,</hi> they do <hi>not grow boiſterous and unruly, but modeſtly retire with their Arms.</hi>

            <p>And what if, in particular, <hi>a Military Watch</hi> of a competent Number <hi>were kept every Night</hi> in this Town, ſome of which might always be either <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſtanding Centinels</hi>; while others, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Duty, might be <hi>lying down on Beds of Planks</hi> to brace up their looſned Frames and enure them to ſalutiferous Hardſhips.</p>
            <p>It <hi>has not bin tedious unto Me, but for you and your People I have judg'd it ſafe, to mention theſe Things in your Audience:</hi> And I cannot but hope, that I have not given juſt Ground of Offence in the Liberty which I have taken on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>But I proceed, in the <hi>Third</hi> and Laſt Place, to <hi>addreſs this whole Militant Aſſembly:</hi> For now <hi>Res ad Triarios rediit:</hi> And, as the <hi>Triarii</hi> among the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were <hi>in the Rere</hi> and were the <hi>moſt completely diſciplin'd Soldiers</hi> that they had; we have now alſo <hi>in the Rere</hi> of our Diſcourſe <hi>to do with an higher Order of Soldiers,</hi> even ſuch as are <hi>Chriſtian and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Soldiers:</hi> Such indeed either are or ſhould be this whole Aſſembly.</p>

            <p>But here, that ſo we may be <hi>acquainted with the whole Armor of GOD and put it on</hi>; I ſhall fetch it out from <hi>the Tower of the Son of</hi> DAVID, eſpecially from <hi>that Apartment</hi> of it the <hi>Sixth</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>

XI. 5. <hi>Faithfulneſs ſhall be</hi> the <hi>Girdle of his Reins.</hi> This <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Integrity</hi> then, as our <hi>Military Belt,</hi> is <hi>to be girded</hi> about us <hi>to keep us erect and ſteady in our ſpiritual Exerciſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, <hi>Fellow Soldiers,</hi> is a <hi>Divine Breaſt-plate</hi> for us: 'Tis <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> Which may denote <hi>an univerſal and impartial Obedience to the Divine Laws:</hi> For <hi>This will defend and guard our Hearts</hi> againſt the Detractions and Calumnies of a baſe and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous World: And, in <hi>wearing this Piece of Armor,</hi> we ſhall appear like our ſupreme Officer: For of Him it is written in Iſa. LIX. 17. <hi>He put on Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a Breaſt-Plate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>next</hi> Place; If we want <hi>Armor for our Feet,</hi> here it is for us: And we are <hi>to be ſhod with this Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi> As it was uſual in ancient Times to <hi>fix ſhort Stakes and caſt Gall-Traps</hi> in the Way of the Enemy to hurt their Feet and make them fall; and for this Cauſe the Soldiers had a <hi>Sort of Boot</hi> for their <hi>Feet and Legs</hi> to accommodate and arm them againſt the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to which they were expoſed: Even ſuch is the Caſe now: For <hi>in our Way to Victory and Triumph, we ſhall meet with Diſtreſſes, Lets and Impediments.</hi> But, to <hi>keep us from many Wounds and Injuries,</hi> we have <hi>the Goſpel</hi>; which is called <hi>the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> becauſe <hi>it reveals, propoſes and eſtabliſhes a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and Man: This Goſpel</hi> then let us take, with its Directions and Comforts: And <hi>This</hi> will be a <hi>wondrous Preparation againſt the Evils,</hi> the worſt of <hi>Evils,</hi> to be encountred.</p>
            <p>And then; Becauſe <hi>we cannot fight ſecurely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shield,</hi> here is one for us: The Name of it is <hi>the Shield of Faith</hi>; and it is <hi>equal to quenching all the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004389_0030_100D4DA6A25F83C8"/>
fiery Darts of the Wicked.</hi> Like the poiſonous <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Darts,</hi> which in flying caught on Fire and inflam'd the Bodies which they pierc'd, are <hi>the Darts ſhot againſt our Souls</hi> by Satan to enflame them: But, as the ancient Warriors had <hi>Shields of raw Neats Leather to quench the Power and Venom of theſe Darts</hi>; ſo we are now <hi>provided with Armor to quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked:</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Shield of Faith; that Faith,</hi> which is <hi>the Subſtance of Things hoped for and the Evidence of Things not ſeen</hi>; and <hi>that Faith in our Prince and Saviour,</hi> which covers all the Defects of our Obedience and <hi>is imputed unto us for Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are not yet fully provided <hi>with our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Armor:</hi> We muſt have <hi>ſome for our Head:</hi> Here then <hi>is an Helmet</hi> for us: It is <hi>the Helmet of Salvation</hi>; or what is elſewhere called, <hi>the Hope of Salvation.</hi> Our Divine Commander has <hi>put this Helmet on His Head,</hi> as we may ſee in Iſa. LIX. 17. We are then to have a <hi>firm Expectation of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the New Covenant,</hi> and <hi>a lively, ſtedfaſt Hope of the Accompliſhment of all the Divine Promiſes</hi> to us: <hi>This will guard our Heads againſt all hard Thoughts of GOD in the moſt terrifying Encounters and keep us from ſhrinking at the Aſſaults of our fierceſt Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have now <hi>Armor ſufficient for our Defence:</hi> But, that ſo we may be able not only <hi>to ſtand,</hi> but to <hi>reſiſt and oppoſe the Enemies of our Souls,</hi> we ſhould <hi>have ſome offenſive Arms:</hi> Well Sirs: And here is <hi>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of GOD,</hi> for us: Concerning this Weapon we may ſay, as DAVID concerning <hi>the Sword of the ſlain GOLIATH, There is none like it:</hi> With <hi>This</hi> our great LORD conquered His and our Adverſary; paſſing <hi>it is written</hi> at him to his Foiling and ſhameful Retreat: And the ſame ſhould we <hi>brandiſh

and puſh againſt our aſſaulting, ſpiritual Foe,</hi> who ſeeks our Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Nor yet are we provided with <hi>all our Armor:</hi> But, moreover, we are to <hi>pray always with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with Perſeverance:</hi> When <hi>the Devil, the Fleſh and the World</hi> come forth againſt us and are furious in their Onſets, we muſt, like JEHOSHAPHAT in his Diſtreſ and the Emperor THEODOSIUS in his Extremities, <hi>cry to GOD with Fervor, Conſtancy and Importunity:</hi> And, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Military Rule or Order, we muſt <hi>continue upon our Watch,</hi> until we are <hi>reliev'd</hi> and even until we are <hi>diſcharg'd from our Warfare</hi> by Death, like <hi>truſty Centinels upon Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are we now entirely <hi>furniſh'd with fit Armor for us,</hi> not only <hi>to defend and guard</hi> us, but alſo <hi>for reſiſting and vanquiſhing our ſpiritual Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now, that we ſhould <hi>prove this our Armor:</hi> Let us then be <hi>daily and conſtantly in the Exerciſe of it:</hi> For <hi>Uſe will make us perfect</hi> in the Exerciſe: So we ſhall be <hi>prepar'd for the Battle</hi> continually, tho' the Enemy ſhould have the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to rally ever ſo often againſt us: And ſo we ſhall come off <hi>Conquerors and more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,</hi> even conſiderable Gainers <note n="(z)" place="bottom">
