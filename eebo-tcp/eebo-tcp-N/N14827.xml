            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE have thought it proper to inform the Reader, that we wrote to our former Brethren ſome time paſt, informing them of the following Addreſs, and that it was nearly ready for the preſs, giving them an invitation to read it before it was printed, with a view, that if they could diſcover, and manifeſt to us any errors that it contained, we ſhould be glad to correct them; and if we could have been ſo happy as to have convinced them of ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes we think they have made in the preſent caſe in controverſy, we ſhould not have had occaſion, ſo publickly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have expoſed them; but they having had ſufficient time to conſider the matter ſince we wrote, and we not having received any anſwer, conclude they do not intend to give any; we therefore think they will have no juſt cauſe to complain of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to print the following Piece without making any farther application to them.</p>

            <head>An ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE concern which our former Brethren have expreſſed, on ſeveral occaſions, and at ſeveral times, for the peace and harmony of the the Church, is worthy of attention: But whether they conſider their incorporate Body, or Church, to be ſo, in diſtinction from all others, they have not in this Controverſy, clearly told us. If they mean by the true Church, all thoſe who are <hi>born again from above by the incorruptible Seed and Word of God, that liveth and abideth forever;</hi> and that theſe are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to their own Church, but are to be found in every other Chriſtian Society all over the World, we freely and fully acquieſce in this ſentiment— That this is the ſincere belief of the Society in general we cannot doubt, or call in queſtion; But remark, with concern, that the line of conduct which thoſe have purſued, who were immediately concerned in diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us is not favourable to ſuch an opinion, which we truſt will be fully evinced before we cloſe this Addreſs. Whether our idea of the true Church, in every reſpect, coincides with theirs muſt, for the preſent, remain undetermined; but that in what is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> we are not, in every reſpect, agreed, is very clear from the different meaſures we have purſued for that purpoſe — We have thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to preſerve, but to reſtore that peace and unity that hath been diſturbed in the Society
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018802_0004_0FA8156133A16070"/>
by the preſent controverſy, to inveſtigate the whole of their conduct, as well as ours, in that caſe, that it might, if poſſible, appear who were the faulty cauſe of it, which they have conſtantly declined ſince Timothy Davis was diſowned about which the uneaſineſs on our part, aroſe—how far they laboured to ſuppreſs any thing of that nature before, will, we truſt, in the following lines be manifeſted.</p>
            <p>They alledge that every Church hath an indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right to judge of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of their members to be continued as ſuch.</p>
            <p>No one, we apprehend, will diſpute this; but then it ought to be conſidered that it is poſſible that a Church may miſuſe their members and abuſe this right. —This is what we complain of—how juſtly we hope alſo to make appear to the ſatisfaction of the unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced reader.</p>
            <p>They ſay, that the conſtitution of their Church is ſuch that it affords ſufficient opportunity for us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to vindicate their ſeveral cauſes while they are under-dealing, by appeals from leſſer to ſuperior meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without thoſe meetings being called upon after they have fully heard, conſidered, determined and ſettled a matter.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That the Church in general gives this liberty is not the matter in queſtion; but whether that right, in the preſent caſe, hath been ſuffered fully and freely to operate without any interruption, is the matter now in queſtion, and what we wiſh to have fairly held up to light, that it may be made manifeſt whether their proceedings againſt us, or ours in our own defence was dictated and influenced by the Light or not? It is an unhappineſs with ſome, that they are ſo prejudiced in favour of their own deeds, they are
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018802_0005_0FA815621090B518"/>
very averſe to having them brought to the impartial examination of the Light, leſt they ſhould be <hi>reproved:</hi> How far this will apply to our oppoſers, in the preſent caſe, we ſubmit to the unprejudiced part of ſuch who are acquainted with the preſent controverſy.</p>
            <p>We think it not unſeaſonable here to take notice of what they ſay in a Letter ſuperſcribed to Joſeph Taber, and thoſe in whoſe behalf he ſigned a Letter, dated at Dartmouth 14th 7 mo. 1783. which is as followeth, viz.
<q>It ſeems — you have ſeen fit to attempt a Proſecution by way of Indictment, a matter of ſuch a nature, as we apprehend, was never before heard of from any profeſſing themſelves to be the People called Quakers, and which we think the truly thoughtful among you cannot approve.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer. That it appears inconteſtably true, that Friends have frequently had recourſe to the civil Powers for redreſs, when under oppreſſion or perſecution; this would have been nothing more had we been concerned in it — That there was a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is very true, that happened at Rocheſter; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by one Jonathan Macy's publicly oppoſing Benjamin Bumpus in his publick miniſtry in Friends Meeting-houſe there, to a very great majority of ſuch Friends who favoured our cauſe: That, under this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch oppoſition was not only very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, but a very unlawful diſturbance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they might have a right in the Meeting-houſe, yet being a very ſmall minority they could have no juſt pretenſions of a right to diſturb ſo large a majority as there was preſent at that time, no leſs intereſted in the Meeting houſe than they. But Macy, with his attendance, it ſeems, by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Letter, were ſent to preſerve <hi>Peace</hi> and good
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018802_0006_0FA815639AABCDF8"/>
               <hi>Order;</hi> but unhappy for them, they either forgot their errand, or thoſe from whom they received it did not underſtand the nature of ſuch an errand. If ſuch diſturbances as this be the effects of ſuch friendly attention, as they mention in their letter to us, we ſhould be glad that ſuch marks of it might not be often repeated, otherwiſe their exhortation to patient ſuffering may want their example to give it weight and energy — Macy did not pretend to object to what he had heard, but was ſo inconſiderate as to alledge that he had no right to appear in the Miniſtry there, being diſowned. To this right, which is pretended to be forfeited by being diſowned by them we ſhall ſpeak more particularly hereafter.</p>
            <p>But with reſpect to the beforementioned Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, although it is ſtrongly urged againſt us, we know not of any one of our Member being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, either leſs or more, directly or indirectly; yet, with gratitude, we acknowlege the kindneſs of ſuch others who juſtly pitied and felt a ſympathy for us under our oppreſſion, and thought it quite time to endeavour a ſuppreſſion of ſuch diſorder. It is a little ſurpriſing that the Authors of this Letter ſhould have ſuffered themſelves to have been ſo impoſed on —Men in ſuch high eſteem in the Society for their ſagacity, penetration, judgment and diſcerning, one would have thought would have ſifted a Caſe with a little more accuracy, wherein their Reputation would neceſſarily ſuffer, they might know, if this inſinuation ſhould fail: But it is an unhappineſs with ſome people that they too eaſily yield their aſſent to that, which they wiſh to be true of ſuch as they diſaffect, often to the wounding of their own Reputation at leaſt. We think however, that even this miſtake, as great as it is,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018802_0007_0FA815645C2DE9B8"/>
is capable of being improved to their, and our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by affording them ſuch a leſſon of inſtruction as they might not have had, or that they might have overlooked, by leading them to conſider that however great their religious experience hath been, they are yet liable to miſtakes, and to be impoſed on by wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and that too from among themſelves— being convinced of this, they may be led to turn their thoughts towards their former conduct, and ſee if they cannot find ſomething out of the line of Truth there, which we think will not be very difficult, if they are diſpoſed to indulge a little impartial enquiry— We doubt not but that we ſhall be able, before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, to manifeſt ſomething in the line of conduct they have purſued, that will hardly bear the light unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without entering very minutely into every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their proceedings againſt us, and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay little of the manner in which the Meeting for Sufferings treated the ſubject when they firſt took it up; they were however the firſt that diſcovered to us any uneaſineſs in the caſe.</p>
            <p>But with reſpect to the before-mentioned Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuppoſe we had been concerned in it, altho' we were not, yet we think it would have been much more eligible than ſuch meaſures as have been adopted by Friends formerly, in taking ſuch by the ſhoulders as they did not approve as Miniſters, and ſuch who have attempted to ſit in their meetings of Church Diſcipline, whom they did not approve as Members, and leading or forcing them out of a meeting-houſe, ſometimes with much difficulty and not a little confuſion, without any authority from any civil Magiſtrate, but done alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an arbitrary and forcible manner. If we had approved, and adopted, ſuch a mode of Conduct we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018802_0008_0FA81564DD3887A0"/>
might eaſily have diſpoſſeſſed ſuch who have given us diſturbance where we are a majority; but if ever ſuch are diſpoſſeſſed, where we have the rule in any Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, it will be, we think by ſuch authority as is Divinely inſtituted for the <hi>puniſhment of evil-doers and the praiſe of them that do well,</hi> mentioned by the great Apoſtle to the Gentiles in the 13th chap. of his Epiſtle to the Romans, where he aſſerts, not only that the inſtitution of Magiſtracy is Divine, but alſo the power of the civil Magiſtrate under that inſtitution, which we tenderly recommend to their conſideration, and obſerve in the words of the ſame Apoſtle that when civil Rulers are in their proper places, they are not a "terror to good works, but to the evil:" Not a terror to thoſe who meet together peaceably to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their Maker in the way that they are perſuaded he requireth of them, but to thoſe who unreaſonably diſturb them while they are performing this important duty. "Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good and thou ſhall have praiſe of the ſame." Let us then not aſſume that Authority with which we have no right to intermeddle, never having been legally introduced: But as ſuch kind of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances come under the cognizance of civil Juriſdiction, we ought to ſubmit them to their deciſion, if we cannot in a mild amicable manner ſettle them between ourſelves, and not indulge that ſelfiſh dictatorial diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſeeks to be judge in its own cauſe.</p>
            <p>It is not from an inclination to expoſe them as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society, that we expoſe their proceedings againſt us to public view, but from a neceſſity of vindicating ourſelves againſt their charges and inſinuations. We have waited long, and ſuffered much from them unjuſtly in our religious characters in the Society, while we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018802_0009_0FA81565A43A94F8"/>
wiſhed thoſe of it who were immediately concerned in diſowning us to ſee and acknowledge their miſtakes in their proceedings againſt us, that the Society may in general be undeceived, who have accuſtomed themſelves, too much, to the following of the voices of ſuch as they take for their leaders, without examining for themſelves; which is quite repugnant to that Doctrine that inforceth the neceſſity of every one's knowing the Lord for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Where this is experienced, they not only know him but know him to be their Teacher, which removes the occaſion of that ſervile dependence, many have on their Miniſters and ſome other active and aſſuming Members.</p>
            <p>As they, by their aforeſaid Letter, render all hope or encouragement of their being diſpoſed to recede from their errors in this caſe, we think we ſhall be excuſable, at leaſt, in giving a juſt account of ſome of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt us; but as ſome part thereof is unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to revive, the undertaking will be diſagreable; yet as there appears a deſire, in ſome well-diſpoſed perſons in the Society, to be informed how the matter was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, and they alſo being under the influence of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, we feel a willingneſs to oblige them.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved, that the Meeting for Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was the firſt that manifeſted, to us, any uneaſineſs with Timothy Davis's Piece on Taxation, who have found means to extend their influence through moſt of the proceedings of the Society againſt him, which proved to be a circumſtance not favourable to his cauſe.</p>
            <p>It was, after this, introduced into the Monthly Meeting of Sandwich, and as far as they acted upon it at that time, they proceeded, in general, agreeable to the Rules of the Society, and reſtored him to his former ſtation in the Church, and for that time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed

the ſubject; where it might finally have termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, had it not been for a few diſaffected members, who, it is probable, with a view to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other members of influence, in other parts of the Country, under the ſame prejudices, by ſome means or other conveyed it back to the Meeting for Sufferings, where the uneaſineſs originated, under a pretenſion, that the aforeſaid Monthly Meeting had been miſled: But allowing, for the preſent, that it had been miſled, which was far from being the caſe, this was not the way to ſet it right unleſs they thought to mend one error by committing another—According to the Rules eſtabliſhed in the Society, it ought to have been carried from the Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, by a complaint againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Monthly Meeting in that caſe; where he would have had a hearing, if they had allowed him the liberty provided in ſuch caſes, and the Monthly Meeting would have had a right to have vindicated their proceedings in the caſe; but we ſhall ſee, before we conclude, how that Meeting was treated, and how tamely they ſubmitted to it, as unreaſonable as the demand upon them was.</p>
            <p>If it be aſked why they neglected to carry this caſe in the uſual channel to the Quarterly and Yearly Meeting, and why they carried it to the Meeting for Sufferings.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, It is hard to ſay, from the circumſtances of their proceedings, whether they acted from a want of underſtanding their own Rules, or whether they were apprehenſive, that if he was allowed to defend his own cauſe, it would render their ſucceſs againſt him too precatious. However, be that as it may, the Meeting for Sufferings, when they received it, ought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018802_0011_0FA8156720502010"/>
immediately to have diſmiſſed it, with directions to the Monthly Meeting, that if any of her members remained diſſatisfied, the way was open to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and Yearly Meeting, for redreſs.</p>
            <p>How thoſe diſaffected members came to meet with ſuch unjuſt countenance from the Meeting for Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is hard to reconcile with that juſtice and chriſtian decorum that it ought to be poſſeſſed of; for, it ſeems, they thought themſelves ſufficiently qualified by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ex parte, to carry the matter forward to the Yearly Meeting: And they as inſenſible of their <hi>duty</hi> and his <hi>right,</hi> proceeded to act upon it ex parte alſo.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid they acted no further upon it than to give their advice.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, Admitting they proceeded no further, yet, when we ſee how important they conſider their advice, and would have others, we ſhall find that it falls little ſhort of a final judgment, eſpecially in this caſe; and that the ſubordinate Meetings are little more than their executioners in ſuch caſes.

            <p>Here we think none can heſitate how important they conſider their advice, and would have their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their non-compliance with it or labouring to obſtruct its force ſubjects them to a being dealt with, the conſequence of which is, if they will not comply, they muſt be diſowned: Witneſs the caſe of Ebenezer Gaſkil, whoſe diſownment originated in his neglecting a compliance with the advice of the Elders where he lives, concerning his publick appearance in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, where no doctrinal errors were ever alledged againſt him, as we have ever heard of—As the advice of the yearly Meeting is held in this point of view, and Timothy Davis's caſe not only treated accordingly, but he not having opportunity to vindicate his cauſe after their taking it up the ſecond time, he was virtually judged and condemned unheard.</p>
            <p>But it is objected on the contrary, that the yearly Meeting treated the matter with ſo much tenderneſs, that they ſent a Committee to treat with him on the ſubject in diſpute.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, that a moderate examination will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſt this to be a miſtake. If there was a Committee appointed by the yearly Meeting for that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018802_0013_0FA81568A75C1C60"/>
purpoſe, they failed in it, for there never was any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from them, in that caſe, that viſited him by a particular appointment, and if there had been one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed particularly in that caſe, yet if they were only authorized to adviſe and admoniſh him, and not to hear and determine the matter in diſpute, he was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs condemned without a hearing. There was a committee appointed by the yearly Meeting to viſit the monthly or quarterly Meeting of Sandwich, who made it in their way to viſit Timothy, who told them that he could freely receive them in their private capacities, but not as a committee, legally appointed in that ſervice, for that matter was never legally before that Meeting, and conſequently they could not be a legal committee, therefore he could not confer with them as ſuch, which to do, would be to countenance ſuch irregularity as ought to be diſcountenanced by every judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious perſon.</p>
            <p>As partial and irregular as their proceedings were, the Monthly Meeting, who had before reſtored him to his former ſtation, were reduced to a compliance with the direction of the yearly Meeting, and reaſſumed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and accordingly ſoon <hi>diſowned</hi> him; who, if they had refuſed, were liable to have been diſowned, or to have had their Meeting taken from them, or diſſolved. This Meeting alſo appointed a Committee of admonition to treat with him, but he did not acknowledge their authority, for the reaſons before-mentioned, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the yearly Meeting Committee, he being tender of the religious rights and liberties of his chriſtian Brethren. Nor was there the remoteſt proſpect of his having a free and impartial hearing at this Meeting, circumſtanced as it was, under awe of the yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Indeed the whole conduct of that Meeting in this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018802_0014_0FA81569CB7EC790"/>
caſe, very clearly manifeſted that they intended to carry their point; this we were fully convinced of when they firſt took the matter out of its proper channel, after it had been ſettled by the Monthly Meeting, and therefore thought it would anſwer no good purpoſe to follow them in their various, and uncertain windings and turnings from one thing to another, to anſwer their partial views.</p>
            <p>As the Monthly Meeting had at firſt fully gone into the ſubject, and had all the advantage of hearing of it fairly ſtated and explained, it was no leſs than calling upon that Meeting to give judgment twice in one caſe or to execute the judgment of the Yearly Meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own. Which conduct, to uſe an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theirs, is not very <hi>ſavory,</hi> nor can we think, that in their preſent ſtate, they are very good judges of what is truly ſo, in a religious ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The right of defending one's ſelf before any judges whatever, either civil or religious, is held very ſacred by all judicious, conſcientious people, and ought never to be given up, or infringed by any Society whatever. The Apoſtle Paul ſeems to have had a very clear ſenſe of that liberty when making his defence before King Agrippa, and expreſſeth himſelf on that occaſion, as followeth,
<q>I think myſelf happy, King Agrippa, becauſe I ſhall anſwer for myſelf this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accuſed of the Jews.</q>
We cannot but doubt that the Yearly Meeting, when they had this matter under conſideration were inſenſible of ſuch tender ſentiments and feelings, or they would have called upon him to have anſwered for himſelf, touching all the things whereof he was accuſed, not by the Jews, or Phariſees, but by a Spirit which, we fear, too generally preſided among them—
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018802_0015_0FA8156A46ECF6E8"/>
Perhaps they were apprehenſive, that if he was allowed that liberty, it might be a means of ſtrengthening, if not increaſing his friends, and they could not then be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but that they might be too powerful for ſuch who wiſhed to prevail againſt him.</p>
            <p>If there remains any true ſenſe of feeling with thoſe who were ſo active and buſily employed againſt him, it muſt, we think, lay very heavy upon them.</p>
            <p>However loſt to this tender religious right any of that Society may be at preſent, it appears that they, formerly, had a very clear ſenſe of, and regard for if, by their making ſuch large proviſion for it by appeals from leſſer to ſuperior Meetings: Firſt from Monthly to Quarterly, and finally to the Yearly Meeting.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, this practice is ſtill continued.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, the name of it is; but not the uſe and deſign of ſuch appeals, they being ſuperceded, at leaſt in the preſent caſe, by a partial application being made to the Yearly Meeting for advice. The carrying of it by way of the Meeting for Sufferings to the Yearly Meeting for advice, naturally forecloſeth, and rendereth futile all attempts to appeal to that Meeting.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if this chriſtian proviſion and care was attended to as it ought, it would very clearly manifeſt the impropriety, and abſurdity, of calling upon the ſame Meeting to give a counter judgment in the ſame caſe, or to reverſe their former judgment. To make up a judgment in a caſe, no further than to give advice, only by a partial hearing, where a caſe is liable to come by appeal, betrays very great weakneſs, as well as inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and what one would hope no man of candour would be active in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018802_0016_0FA8156ADFEF5E88"/>It is nevertheleſs urged by ſome, that he might have appealed from the judgment of the Monthly Meeting, who diſowned him, and have had a hearing.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, that we are very ſenſible of that, and as clearly ſenſible, that they took care to fortify themſelves againſt any appeal that he could make, unleſs to him who judgeth righteouſly, who never <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in counſel nor varied in judgment. Timothy not having had opportunity to vindicate his cauſe, gave his oppoſers all the opportunity they could wiſh, to ſpread their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through the Society, that there was no kind of reaſon to hope for ſucceſs by appealing to a Quatterly, or Yearly Meeting, from the judgment of a Monthly Meeting, by whoſe direction, and under whoſe influence they acted in diſowning him. The idea of appealing from one, to another, by whoſe judgment, and under whoſe influence the firſt acted, muſt be conſidered as one of the greateſt abſurdities, and an appeal in that caſe a mere empty name.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that where Monthly Meetings are weak, there have been frequent inſtances of application being made to ſuperior Meetings for advice, which when they have had, they have conformed to, without making any uneaſineſs in the Society.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: It is not improbable this may have been the caſe; the queſtion is not how eaſily they may have impoſed on their Members in time part, but whether ſuch impoſition is capable of defence upon chriſtian principles. Unleſs the Church hath always been infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in judgment, which they do not pretend, poſitively, to aſſert, it will not be ſafe to follow her advice impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly—no doubt it can be made very clear, that ſhe, and the members under her juriſdiction, have made many ſuch miſtakes—The thing to be conſidered is whether
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018802_0017_0FA8157010FC3888"/>
in thoſe caſes the intereſt, ſpiritual or temporal, or the reputation of any one or more of her members was concerned, and whether they were liable to be brought by appeals to ſuch meeting as had given their advice already? If not, the caſe is clear they had a right to apply there for advice. But if they were liable to be brought to ſuch meeting, where ſuch advice originated, and either <hi>intereſt,</hi> or <hi>reputation</hi> was liable to be affected, they are in danger of ſuffering in conſequence of ſuch meeting being prejudiced in favour of their former advice, when they give judgment. It is generally very hard for ſuch meetings to recede from their former advice, leſt it ſhould incur the odium of inſtability; eſpecially as they have ſaid ſo much of an infallible judgment in the Church; but their frequent miſtakes very clearly manifeſt that they do not always make uſe of it, which we think is a pity, it they are really poſſeſſed of it—It appears, we think, very clear, that ſuch meetings ought to have ſo tender a regard to the rights of their members, as not, ſo far to prejudge any caſe, at leaſt, that is liable to come before them by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, as to give their partial advice in it, but wait to have it regularly brought before them and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as clear of prepoſſeſſion as poſſible.</p>
            <p>That the weakneſs of a meeting may indeed operate againſt the right of the aggrieved, we have a ſorrowful inſtance in the preſent Caſe, for want of diſcretion or a will in Timothy Davis's Judges to do him juſtice; but where this is the caſe it is not likely to mend the matter by applying to a ſuperior Meeting for advice, where it is liable to come by appeal.</p>
            <p>As it appears that every diſputable caſe in a Monthly Meeting, is liable to have its final iſſue at the Yearly Meeting, we cannot ſee what juſt advantage can
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018802_0018_0FA815704DEDEEE8"/>
be propoſed, by firſt applying there for advice, unleſs by the conſent of both ſides of the queſtion: An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage no doubt may be gained, but not a juſt one. If the Caſe is ſo circumſtanced, that the advice of a Yearly Meeting is rendered really neceſſary by the weakneſs of a Monthly Meeting or otherwiſe, we can think of no more juſt and equitable way of proceeding, than to let it have its regular courſe there by appeal, where, if they have not already given their advice or judgment in the caſe, there will be ſome proſpect of having juſtice done; each party having a right to be heard; and where that right, in time paſt, hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been allowed.</p>
            <p>Some have urged, that he had full liberty to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his cauſe at the Monthly Meeting, when they firſt took the matter under conſideration.</p>
            <p>To this we anſwer, it is very true that he had that liberty, and the conſequence of it was, he was reſtored to his former ſtation in the Church by a Committee of ſeven Friends, all of their own chuſing, and it is not improbable, that he would have been favoured with the like ſucceſs, if he had had an opportunity to have defended his caſe through the whole proceſs.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper here to obſerve, that he had no other voice in the choice of the Committee who reſtored him to his former ſtation, that a negative one, which he made uſe of ſo far as to object to ſuch as he thought diſqualified for that ſervice; which is by no means equal to a mutual choice; for tho' ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee may conſiſt of ſuch, as one may have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objection to, yet there may not be any one of them ſuch a one would have any reaſon to make choice of. However, as ſcanty as this liberty is, it is objected to, as being much too large: Larger they ſay than
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018802_0019_0FA8157178D210F8"/>
what is conſiſtent with their Diſcipline; and that his being even preſent when the aforeſaid Committee was appointed, was an intruſion; but we muſt confeſs it that is the caſe, both we and Timothy remain ſtill inſenſible of it.—It hath generally been the practice within the compaſs of this Yearly-Meeting, to allow a negative voice to the perſon under dealing; how arbitrary they may be in other Yearly or General Meetings we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to ſay, but if it be true, that they do not admit even a negative voice in ſimilar caſes, they ought to be conſidered as being indeed very arbitrary, much more ſo than can be ſupported by civil or Chriſtian principles.</p>
            <p>Among ſuch objections we find one in a Letter from a Member of another Yearly Meeting to Timothy Davis, but from a tender regard to the character of the Author and his brethren, we ſhall conceal his name, but as his letter is a little extraordinary, we ſhall take the liberty to tranſcribe a paſſage from it, which is as followeth, viz.
<q>As far as I have underſtood, thou will hardly allow thy ſelf to be properly diſowned, becauſe thy Caſe was left to a Committee, choſen by the Monthly Meeting, and that Committee brought it in little or no offence (as I have underſtood) but why ſo, becauſe thou was willing from thy teeth out to condemn the publiſhing that Piece, which had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to undermine and lay waſte the judgment of the ſenſible part of the Body, but not to condemn the contents of it. Why ſurely this was a very weak Committee (perhaps thy choice was alſo in it) which appears to have had too little regard to the ſincerity of a member, in condemning his miſconduct. It may be thou waſt preſent when the Committee was choſen in that monthly meeting, ſo I was informed, and did
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018802_0020_0FA81571B54D89D0"/>
object to ſuch as would not ſuit thy turn, if ſo, well might thy Friends judge thy bewildered ſtate, and that thy acknowledgment, in that part, was no more than from the teeth out; in this caſe, according to the good Rules amongſt us, thou waſt a diſorderly perſon to intrude thy ſelf in the Monthly Meeting of buſineſs, after thy matter was brought there. Truly it was high time for Friends, of the neighbouring meetings, to aſſiſt that weak meeting over which by thy great influence, thou had almoſt over powered. And how can thou blame Friends for endeavouring to maintain the good Rules eſtabliſhed among them, let all reaſonable men judge in this matter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If by good rules he means thoſe by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted this matter, his making his appeal to reaſonable men, we think, will rather operate againſt him, if the matter was to be judged by ſuch: Men of a different character would be much likelier to favour his cauſe. We think it will hardly be for the reputation of the Society, or thoſe rules be refers to, to have them brought under the examination of Reaſon. His charge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity is very injurious as well as unjuſt. If his meaning can be collected from what he ſaith, we think it muſt be this, viz. Timothy's acknowledgment muſt be inſincere, or to uſe his own words, from the teeth out, becauſe he only condemned the publication or rather the manner of it, and not the matter contained in the Piece. It is not hard to ſee that this concluſion is very unnatural and injudicious, for the matter of a performance may be very good, when the manner by which it is effected may be very much amiſs: It needs no great penetration to ſee this—The truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſtrictly this: They have a Rule that requires their members, when any of them propoſe to publiſh any
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018802_0021_0FA815726FD43F58"/>
thing, by means of the Preſs, that they lay it before the Meeting for Sufferings, which Timothy not only neglected to do, but proceeded to publiſh a piece when he had received their advice to the contrary, they having by ſome means got intelligence of the Piece he had wrote. This is thought to be a very great Trangreſſion; but there are ſome circumſtances attending this matter, that are a very great alleviation, viz. when he firſt received the advice from them reſpecting the not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his piece, he expected that the leading part of the Society were that quiet, peaceable People which they have ever profeſſed themſelves to be, and that as a body they would not, at leaſt, intereſt themſelves in the diſpute between Great-Britain and the Colonies, but when he, afterward, met with ſeveral of their publications, eſpecially from Philadelphia, he was obliged, to his great grief, to change his ſentiments concerning them in that reſpect; from thoſe publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it appeared very clear that they intereſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very deeply in the ſaid public diſpute, which was alſo farther manifeſted by many of them refuſing to pay Taxes to the American Government; all which he conſidered as inconſiſtent with their former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practice, and might involve them in much unneceſſary Sufferings; to prevent which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to publiſh the aforeſaid Piece on Taxation, not expecting, under theſe circumſtances. to meet with any encouragement from the Meeting for Sufferings: But however, when he came fully to conſider the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of publiſhing his Piece without firſt laying it before the Meeting for Sufferings, for their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could do no leſs than conſider it as a miſtep; for let the Society be as much out of the way as they might, he conſidered that it did not licence him to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018802_0022_0FA8157335BC1698"/>
commit one error to mend another, and therefore told them that he was ſorry he had not paid more attention to the beforementioned Rule, and laid his Piece before them, before he publiſhed it, or words to that purpoſe, which they were ſo far ſatisfied with, that they gave him no more trouble about tranſgreſſing the aforeſaid Rule, but then took in hand the matter contained in the Piece, and becauſe he would not condemn that, they diſowned him; altho' it does not appear that it contains any matter inconſiſtent with the ancient, and approved practice of the Society, from their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as ſuch until very lately.</p>
            <p>There appeared at that time, very different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both with reſpect to paying Taxes, and the preſent Revolution; but many that were in favour of the Revolution, when they began to feel the weight of increaſing Taxes, began to exclaim againſt it, and continue to find much fault with the preſent Government. There remains, however, a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as well as reſpectable number who continue to juſtify their ancient and approved practice of paying general mixed Taxes under every change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are apprehenſive that they, on the other hand, by diſclaiming the practice of paying ſuch Taxes, are, to uſe the expreſſions of the beforementioned Letter writer, labouring to <hi>undermine and lay waſte</hi> Friends Teſtimony in that caſe, which muſt involve them in much Suffering, that, to conſiderate people, appears very unneceſſary, to the grief and ſorrow of many of their moſt ſenſible experienced members, who were deſirous of continuing and ſupporting a practice that ſo nearly concerned the <hi>Peace</hi> of Society, both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:018802_0023_0FA81573EC739F98"/>When this matter was firſt taken under conſideration by the Monthly Meeting, it appeared that the refuſing to pay Taxes was making its way into Society with too much ſucceſs, by ſuch who embraced that ſentiment of refuſing to pay taxes, &amp;c. who ſoon became very active and aſſuming, and according to what hath been obſerved, laboured to bear down every thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in favour of Timothy Davis's cauſe; and took the freedom to complain of intruſion, tho' without cauſe, yet, with as much aſſurance as if their novel opinions had been received as articles of faith from their firſt appearance as a religious Society.</p>
            <p>We do not blame them for the ſentiment of refuſing to pay Taxes, merely becauſe it is new, but becauſe we think it an error; but ſuppoſe it were true, it is very imprudent to preſs it ſo hard, ſeeing it is new, as to diſown any one for publicly oppoſing of it. It would be much more Chriſtian like to exerciſe a little patience until it is more generally received and eſtabliſhed. A Sentiment's being either new or old, ought never to be a reaſon for either receiving or rejecting it; but its being old, and generally received, demands a very cloſe examination and clear conviction before we part with it. A thing's being true or falſe, ought to be the only reaſons for which we either receive or reject it, but we doubt it is an unhappineſs with many, that they believe, or reject, according to the ſentiments of thoſe with whom they wiſh to continue in favour, whether it be the Church or particular perſons.</p>
            <p>Timothy was ſo far from indulging an inclination to intrude himſelf where he had no right, or where his right might even be ſuſpected, although without any reaſon, that he addreſſed himſelf to the meeting, who where about to appoint a Committee to hear his caſe,

in the following manner.
<q>Friends, if my being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at the appointment of this Committee, is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable I will withdraw, as I have no inclination to give uneaſineſs to any.</q>
And received for anſwer, that they <hi>had no objection to his being preſent,</hi> or words to that purpoſe, and he was ſenſible, they could have no reaſonable objection: That this Letter writer's charge againſt him, as being an intruder, and a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perſon for being preſent at the Meeting after his caſe was brought there where the aforeſaid Committee was appointed, is very indecent and even abuſive.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. After he was diſowned, it became a queſtion of importance with many judicious well-diſpoſed members, that, as he appeared to be illegally diſowned, whether in that caſe it ought to affect his right in Society? Many of whom were determined in the negative; partly in conſideration of that juſt maxim which the Society formerly, when under ſuffering, were very willing to take the advantage of, viz. That which is not legally done is not done; and partly from a conſideration that their proceedings againſt him were without any juſt cauſe, after he had acknowledged his fault in publiſhing his Piece without the conſent of the Meeting for Sufferings. They were alſo ſoon brought under Dealing for joining him in Prayer, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a breach of their Rules to join with one in that duty not a member of their Church: Many of them notwithſtanding continued to join him for ſometime, who were at length terrified into a compliance with their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, out of fear of being diſowned, and ſome after they had been diſowned on that account and continued to join him for ſome time, went back and made them ſatisfaction—There were a large number diſowned for joining him, as above, in the duties of external worſhip,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018802_0025_0FA815756EA139B0"/>
of which there ſtill remain with him a very hopeful number, among whom is Benjamin Bumpus, a man of a fair character as a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The greateſt reaſon, they confeſs, that inclined them to join Timothy Davis and Benjamin Bumpus in their public devotion, was, that they thought themſelves fully convinced that they were divinely favoured in it, and therefore thought it not only ſafe, but an indiſpenſible duty to join with them or any others favoured in like manner. It is a duty, that we ſhould think every one muſt acknowledge, to join with thoſe that we are convinced our great Lord and Maſter joins with by his ſacred influence; nor durſt many of them refuſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the terror of being diſowned was often held up to them for their diſcouragement; thinking that ſuch rules as required ſuch a compliance, as lays its members under a neceſſity of acting contrary to the will of Him who only hath a right to all our obedience, ought not to be conſidered as binding. Many, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, were, at firſt, frightned into a compliance, from inſinuations, cloſely urged by ſome, that could much eaſier terrify weak minds than convince the wiſe, that whatſoever the Church bound on Earth was bound in Heaven: Not conſidering that That which is acted even by the Church, if it is not conſiſtent with the will of Heaven, will never be ratified there, and that there is ſome room to think that her conduct, in the preſent caſe, is not very conſiſtent with the Divine Will, we think is very clear.</p>
            <p>It hath been objected by ſome, that to join in prayer with ſuch who are diſowned, is an encouragement to them to continue in a ſtate of ſeparation, which they wiſh to diſcourage by an example of diſapprobation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:018802_0026_0FA8157633F78720"/>Anſwer: To us this appears extreamly weak, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever plauſibly expreſſed.—Do they think their example of ſuch importance, that it will over-balance that <hi>Divine approbation</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> we receive from the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>tender influence</hi> of our great Lord and Maſter: Can they not ſee the <hi>abſurdity?</hi>—They will not ſay, ſurely, that His aiding and aſſiſting in Prayer; or Preaching, is no <hi>encouragement</hi> to thoſe duties. But ſome of them ſay, He may poſſibly aſſiſt them for a while, in order to bring them off from it, that they may come and be reconciled to Friends.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: It appears to us a little odd that a perſon ſhould be encouraged in a thing to bring him off from it. If they had ſaid that He ſometimes witholdeth his ſenſible influence to let us ſee, and feel, our dependence on him, it would have been talking like experienced Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Some indeed do not care to ſay that they think thoſe who are diſowned, ever are aſſiſted in Prayer, until they are reconciled to Friends.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: We ſuppoſe ſome are doubtful in this reſpect, which to us diſcovers a very great want of true religious experience, which would furniſh with ſuch Chriſtian charity as diſpoſeth us to think humbly of ourſelves, and to be charitable in our thoughts of others. Do they think that a being a member of their Church is ſo abſolutely neceſſary a qualification in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a Duty of that obligation, that a perſon can, by no means pray acceptably without it, and that the Almighty doth ſo ſtrictly adhere to their orders in that caſe, as not to influence any unleſs that qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be added?— Do they think He hath as much partiality for them, as they have for themſelves? This <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> idea that this ſentiment, in this caſe, very naturally
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018802_0027_0FA81576E95A0770"/>
ſuggeſts, tho' we are far from inſinuating that it is a general received opinion among them. Such as favour the opinion of not joining in prayer with ſuch who are diſowned, we ſuppoſe ground it chiefly on the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages of Scripture: The firſt is thus expreſſed as above, viz. Whatſoever ye bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, &amp;c. If what they, either bind or looſe on Earth, is not done in the Counſel of God, it never will meet his approbation.—</p>
            <p>The ſecond contains theſe words, viz. "If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembereſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee; leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift." This we think is not very pertinently urged in this caſe when compared with their idea of the Goſpel Miniſtry, for they very juſtly obſerve, that no man ought to take this gift, or honour, to himſelf, except he is called of God as was Aaron; or in other words of the Apoſtle, viz. "A neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe is me if I preach not the Goſpel!" What will they do with this neceſſity? Is it in their power to diſmiſs it when they pleaſe?</p>
            <p>We think that, tho' a brother may alledge any thing againſt a Miniſter, if it is not a juſt charge, it cannot juſtly be ſuppoſed that he will be leſs ſenſible of his neceſſity to improve his gift, which cannot juſtly be ſuppoſed to be ſo pliant as to conform to an unjuſt charge of a brother, or the partial deciſion of a Church; and therefore this Text will not very well apply in this caſe, unleſs they adopt the ſentiment of preaching by <hi>notes,</hi> and conſider <hi>them</hi> as the <hi>gift</hi> alluded to by our Saviour: This, we confeſs, may be left at the Altar, or any where elſe, at the diſcretion of the Preacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:018802_0028_0FA81578A6E22D88"/>
If one perſon chargeth another with any thing that is not true, it cannot properly be ſaid he hath any thing againſt him, or if it be true, if it be not a fault it is the ſame caſe.—That their charge againſt Timothy Davis cannot juſtly be called a fault, we think appears very clear, and will, we truſt, be further manifeſted.</p>
            <p>It may further be conſidered, that it is no leſs a <hi>breach</hi> of their <hi>rules</hi> to refuſe to <hi>join</hi> with one who is a <hi>member,</hi> than it is to join with one who is not; therefore as it appears that we, according to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, are not legally diſowned, ſuch diſownment ought not to affect our liberty, or right in the Church, they therefore by refuſing to join him in prayer, have counteracted their own rules, and according to them they ought to be dealt with, and if they refuſe to make ſuitable ſatisfaction, they ought to be diſowned, if the matter could operate conſiſtently.</p>
            <p>It is the general ſentiment of ſuch who are diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the diſpute, and who are acquainted with the circumſtances of their conduct and ſentiments with reſpect to the preſent revolution, that they were too much ſharpened by political diſaffection, which giveth the greateſt uneaſineſs and diſſatisfaction of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtance attending the preſent controverſy to us whom they have diſowned, and will remain a powerful obſtacle in the way of a reconciliation, until they, properly and effectually, remove it, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their error in diſowning of us by virtue of ſuch influence. If it be aſked how this appears? We anſwer, from what many of the moſt active and ſevere againſt us have, with much freedom, expreſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on the ſubject of the controverſy between Great Britain and America, as well as from ſeveral of their publications, eſpecially that which they call their <hi>Antient Teſtimony,</hi> &amp;c. before alluded to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:018802_0029_0FA8157974A29430"/>There is ſomething in their proceedings in this caſe, under ſuch influence, that ſo very plainly and clearly diſcovers an aſpect of inſincerity and diſingenuity, when coloured over with religious pretenſions, that it renders a reconciliation, at leaſt, very difficult, if not imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable upon chriſtian principles, unleſs they retract their proceedings againſt us.—We, however, ſincerely wiſh them well in every ſenſe of the word; but cannot be free to unite with them in their preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We do not mention this from any perſonal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to any of them; but could not well ſuppreſs what we earneſtly wiſh them to conſider; and are led to think, that if they truly ponder the matter in that Wiſdom which is from above, "which is firſt pure, then peaceable; then gentle and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, and without partiality or hypocriſy," they will clearly ſee that the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diviſion originated in their political diſaffection, as what Timothy Davis wrote by no means called for ſuch uſage from them, nor was it by any means incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the long approved practice of the Society; we therefore think that it naturally, and juſtly, lieth with them, who have miſuſed us, to make way for a reconciliation, if ever ſuch a thing is rightly effected.</p>
            <p>Some of them ſay, that they ſee no leſs an attachment, in the Piece he wrote on Taxation, to the Americans.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: Suppoſing that to be the caſe, which we cannot fully grant, they were not the proper perſons to deal with him until they had firſt taken the <hi>Beam</hi> out of their own <hi>eyes.</hi> It appears, we confeſs, from that Piece, that he was ſo far a friend to the American Government, as to urge the lawfulneſs of paying Taxes to it as Friends have done to the paying them under every other change of Government, and why not to the preſent?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018802_0030_0FA81579F4B61848"/>It is objected, That if he, as well as they, was at ſome times actuated by political influence, why doth he fault them? Where is the difference between them in that caſe?</p>
            <p>Anſwer: We have not yet granted that he was in that, or any other publick performance, actuated by political influence: But ſuppoſe he was, and had been equally faulty; the beſt thing we can think of, would have been for them equally to have extended their charity and forbearance towards each other. In this reſpect there was a very wide difference between them, for it doth not appear by any means, that he had even the remoteſt thought of withdrawing his charity from them, merely on account of their political ſentiments, nor did he wiſh them to be brought under church dealing in conſequence of them: But they would by no means indulge his.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that they would not have taken any notice of his if he had not publiſhed them, which were exceedingly diſagreeable to Friends.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: So did they, which were no leſs diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him and his Friends. He publiſhed his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no farther than to ſhew the reaſonableneſs and expediency of paying Taxes to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſtent with their univerſal practice in time paſt, with a view to prevail with them to keep up a uniformity of conduct in that reſpect. But if he had manifeſted himſelf to be as partially in favour of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica as they were in favour of Great Britain, it would have been but juſt to have let one caſe have been a balance for the other, with reſpect to any church demands. But this, it ſeems, would not very well conſiſt with that ſpirit of Domination that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſo very anxious for in the church. Can it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018802_0031_0FA8157B02D37320"/>
be thought that they wiſhed to ſuppreſs his Publication, that their's might be the more ſucceſsful? If this was really the caſe it was indeed very ungenerous, which there is but too much reaſon to ſuſpect, by the line of conduct they have purſued againſt him; in which there is ſome things ſo dark and obſcure, that it is hard, if not impoſſible, to reconcile them with that candour and generoſity of ſentiment that ought ever to characteriſe every profeſſor of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>It remains a diſpute with ſome, whether Timothy was diſowned for the matter contained in the Piece in diſpute, or for ſome circumſtances attending the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; it hath generally been thought that he was diſowned for both, until we received the Teſtimony they gave forth againſt him, which puts the matter out of diſpute, by which it appears he was diſowned for the matter contained in the piece only, which is as followeth, viz.</p>

What their Teſtimony had got to be, at the time he wrote, was a ſubject of his inquiry for no other reaſon, than to labour to convince ſuch of their error who refuſed to pay ſuch Taxes; and more eſpecially as there was too much reaſon to fear that ſuch refuſal, with many, originated in <hi>political diſaffection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Letter writer tells us of ſcruples of that kind ſome had about twenty five years ago. We are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acquainted with the hiſtory of that matter; from which it appears that they were far from meeting the general approbation of the Society, eſpecially in Great Britain, which appears by a Letter from a Meeting for Sufferings in London to John Hunt and Chriſtopher Wilſon, not far diſtant from the time he mentions. They in that Letter very clearly ſhew their diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their ſingularity in being ſcrupulous about paying ſuch Taxes.

            <p>We wiſh not, however, to bear hard upon any who are tenderly ſcrupulous about paying ſuch Taxes under any Government whatever, whoſe ſcruples do not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in political diſaffection, but cannot be of their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this reſpect, but are apprehenſive that their ſcruples ariſe from a want of a well informed judgment.

            <p>What their ancient, and long approved, Teſtimony was with reſpect to the paying Taxes may be ſeen in the before mentioned Addreſs, and alſo in their ancient and moſt approved Authors, many of whom are quoted in the ſaid Addreſs, particularly George Fox, whoſe authority with them, in general, hath been as great, at leaſt, as any one of their Authors. See his Book of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018802_0034_0FA8157DCA8DEB68"/>
Epiſtles, p. 137,
<q>
                  <hi>All Friends every where,</hi> who are dead to all carnal weapons, and have beaten them to pieces, ſtand in that which takes away the occaſion of Wars, which ſaves mens lives and deſtroys none, nor would have others;—and as for the Rulers that are to keep <hi>Peace</hi> for <hi>Peace ſake</hi> and for the advantage of <hi>Truth,</hi> give them their <hi>Tribute,</hi> but to bear and carry weapons to fight with the men of Peace (who live in that which takes away the occaſion of Wars) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act in ſuch things <hi>under the ſeveral Powers,</hi> but have paid their <hi>Tribute,</hi> which they may do ſtill for <hi>Peace ſake,</hi> and not hold back the earth, but go over it, and in ſo doing Friends may better claim their Liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He here gives two very powerful reaſons for the paying of <hi>Tribute.</hi> The firſt is, that it be done for the preſervation of Peace for Peace ſake: The ſecond is, that in ſo doing Friends may better claim their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. We cannot ſee with what confidence any can expect their Liberty preſerved, who will not pay their Taxes to enable the Magiſtrate to defend it from the hands of violence. Theſe are reaſons, one would think, that none would be weak enough to oppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſons no doubt, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles had in view when they encouraged, and enjoined, the paying of Tribute or Taxes, and alſo becauſe it was Ceſar's due, but for no other reaſon than for his ſervice done, or to be done, to his Subjects; the ſame reaſons for which Tribute or Taxes becomes due to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we live under, or any other civil Government.</p>
            <p>If Friends will grant that it is the duty of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to preſerve Peace for Peace ſake, they muſt alſo neceſſarily grant that it is his duty to ſuppreſs violence, otherwiſe Peace will not be likely to take place.—
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018802_0035_0FA8157E58703DA8"/>
How far the Magiſtrate may act in the ſuppreſſion of violence for Peace ſake, perhaps is the matter in diſpute. George Fox, and many other Friends who have wrote ſince, have thought, that they might go ſo far in the ſuppreſſing of violence, as to pay their Taxes for the Peace ſake, and leave it with the Magiſtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in any lawful way that he ſhould think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and moſt for the benefit of the ſubject—The Magiſtrates have thought, that to anſwer ſo good and ſalutary a purpoſe as the preſerving Peace for Peace ſake, they ought to do all that is reaſonably in their power to ſuppreſs all kind of violence and intruſion on the Perſons, Properties and Liberties of the ſubjects, whether committed by any of them, or by foreigners that ſhould intrude themſelve</p>
            <p>There is, perhaps, not any of their Writers more clear in this point than Iſaac Pennington; nor was there ſcarcely ever an Author better approved among them in general, who, in anſwer to what he calls a weighty Queſtion, as indeed it was, concerning the Magiſtrates protection of the innocent; in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of his Writings expreſſeth himſelf thus, Vol. 1. p. 444.
<q>Whether the Magiſtrate in righteouſneſs and equity is engaged to defend ſuch who (by the peaceableneſs and love which God hath wrought in their ſpirits and by that Law of Life, mercy, good will and forgiveneſs which God, by his own finger hath written in their hearts) and taken off from fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cannot uſe a weapon deſtructive to any creature?</q>
Here followeth his anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Magiſtracy was intended by God for the defence of the people; not only of thoſe who have ability and can fight for them, but of ſuch alſo who cannot, or are forbid by the love and law of God written in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018802_0036_0FA815815FC919A8"/>
their hearts ſo to do. Thus Women, children, ſick perſons, aged perſons, and alſo Prieſts in Nations (who have ability to fight, but are exempt by their function, which is not equal to the exemption which God makes by the Law of his Spirit in the heart) have the benefit of the Law, and of the Magiſtrates protection, without fighting for the defence of either.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here followeth a few very pertinent obſervations by the Author of the before-mentioned Addreſs, viz. <hi>Now, if Magiſtrates be appointed by God, and it be the Magiſtrates duty to defend ſuch, who, either are not able or cannot for conſcience ſake defend themſelves, is it poſſible any can be right who lay waſte this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or ſpeak of ſuch defence as ſinful? If any man be appointed by God to defend my life, is it poſſible that God can authoriſe me to call him a ſinner, for doing his duty? Or is it poſſible that I can, conſiſtent with my duty, refuſe him that Tribute which is abſolutely neceſſary to enable him thus to defend me? But had I much greater abilities to ſpeak to this ſubject than I am conſcious of no reaſoning of mine could be of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Author above quoted; hear him therefore again, p</hi> 448, <hi>where treating on this peaceable principle profeſſed by the Society, he ſays,</hi>

            <p>That this Quotation contained the general ſentiment of the Society at the time of its publication cannot with reaſon be diſputed, for if it had not, it is not likely they would have publiſhed it with a collection of his Works after his death. A further evidence of its general approbations, is the large number of Teſtimonies of ſome of the moſt approved Friends in the Society printed at the beginning of the collection in favour, not only of the Author, but of the Piece. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with no leſs certainty that it hath continued to be the received ſentiment of the Society of Friends in America, by their cauſing of it to be reprinted a few years ago by ſubſcription, from almoſt every part of the Country where there are any Friends. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not appear to be either his or our particular ſentiment, but that of the Society in general, both in Europe and America.—How thoſe who encouraged that Publication by their ſubſcriptions, could encourage the diſowning Timothy Davis is very unaccountable, as there is nothing in his Piece that can, with any colour of Juſtice, be conſtrued to be any ways equally in favour of War with that Quotation, and Timothy, as well as we, think ourſelves to be as much called from the deſtructive uſe of the Sword as they: But we have quoted that paſſage from Iſaac Pennington, that they may, if poſſible, be <hi>convinced</hi> of their <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>—What we mean to encourage is mutual charity and forbearance to all Societies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:018802_0038_0FA81582E9805FD8"/>Now, for ſuch who are called from the uſe of the ſword it would no doubt be a very great ſin for them to make a deſtructive uſe of it; who are, no doubt, deſigned to be lights in the World, and to hold out the Olive branch to the Nations until it ſhall pleaſe infinite Wiſdom to call the reſt of mankind in like manner from the uſe of the ſword, when every one ſhall ſit quietly "under their own vine, and under their own fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid. Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, and Judah ſhall not vex Ephraim;" for theſe will have fully entered into Peace and Righteouſneſs, the Glory and Perfection of the Goſpel Diſpenſation: But till then it hath pleaſed God to provide for the peace and ſafety of mankind by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Magiſtracy for the puniſhment of evil-doers, while violence and oppreſſion remain in the earth, and the keeping peace for peace ſake is ſo abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>However ſhocking ſome circumſtances which may attend the ſuppreſſion of violence and injuſtice may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to tender minds, yet they ought to conſider, that they are wiſely ordered by the diſpoſer of all events to prevent much more alarming and dreadful conſequences that await a ſtate of Anarchy: We therefore can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that any are ſo imprudent as to wiſh the World to be without Law or Government, if it is not at all times, and at all places, quite as they would have it, however zealouſly they may contend againſt the uſe of the ſword in the ſuppreſſing of violence.</p>
            <p>If they are in favour of continuing Magiſtracy for the ſuppreſſing of violence, would they not be willing to give ſo much aſſiſtance toward it, as to pay their Taxes, without which Magiſtracy cannot be ſuppoſed to be upheld, whoſe buſineſs it is to hold up the ſword only a terror to evil-doers; when it becomes a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018802_0039_0FA81583B26EA500"/>
terror to others, it is time to take it out of their hands, and place it where it may anſwer the deſign of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, viz. that the Magiſtrate may not only be a terror to evil-doers but a praiſe to them that do well.</p>
            <p>But ſome can hardly reconcile it with infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Juſtice, to prohibit that in one, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves in another. This objection will eaſily be removed if we properly advert to the reaſons there are for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and variety in the Divine Oeconomy. It appears perhaps no where more convincing than in the diverſity of Gifts mentioned by the Apoſtle Paul, and his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to every one to attend to their own proper gifts, otherwiſe they might prejudice the cauſe they were engaged in, and the ſame reaſons hold good ſtill, and even in temporal matters: And altho' ſome may not be qualified or gifted to bear rule in the Church, yet they may be well qualified for Magiſtrates to rule the World, if they are moral men: And it is evident from the ſame Apoſtle that we ought to be ſubject, and that for conſcience ſake, not only to thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of our own Society, but to thoſe who do not even profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians; and theſe too he calls the Miniſters of God to the ſubject for good; for they were then under the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who did not profeſs Chriſtianity: Not that we would encourage the introducing ſuch into authority, where it can be avoided, who do not at leaſt profeſs the Chriſtian name.</p>
            <p>But with reſpect to diverſity: Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>in my Father's Houſe are many Manſions</hi>—But why? Becauſe doubtleſs there are many kinds of ſervices, whether we conſider thoſe Manſions to reſpect his Church militant on earth, or triumphant in Heaven, and it is therefore neceſſary that there ſhould be many
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018802_0040_0FA815849757FF78"/>
Rooms or Manſions, that theſe various ſervices or employments may be properly attended to, that they might not interfere to the prejudice of each other. Would it not be ridiculous to aſk why he refuſed one the uſe of one of theſe Rooms, while he granted it to another, and even compelled him to labour in it, and required the other to return to his own Manſion, where his proper buſineſs was.—As there are diverſities of gifts, ſo there are diverſities of employments, and therefore every one ought to attend to his own proper buſineſs to prevent diſtraction; and alſo for this one inconteſtible reaſon, that God is a God of order and not of confuſion.</p>
            <p>The conſiſtency of this we ſhould think could hardly be miſtaken. The like reaſoning, we think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may very well be admitted with reſpect to the power of the civil Magiſtrate, eſpecially if he be conſidered as a Miniſter of God whom we ought to obey in every thing lawful for conſcience ſake. The reaſonableneſs of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and the different departments will further, very clearly, appear, if we wiſely conſider the different degrees of growth there are in religion: We are told not only of Fathers and Mothers in Iſrael, but of young Men and new born Babes; and as that of not defending ones ſelf is conſidered by Robert Barclay, and no doubt by others, as one of the higheſt Chriſtian attainments, it can hardly be expected from a new born Babe and therefore if they will have none in their Church but ſuch who have arrived to that degree of chriſtian experience as not to defend themſelves, they muſt not admit any new born Babes who deſire the ſincere milk of the word that they may grow up thereby, but all muſt be born into the Church in the full grown ſtatute of Men and Women: Whereas it is abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018802_0041_0FA815862DDE4388"/>
that the Members of Chriſt's Church ſhould be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and born again as infants; that it appears to us, there ſhould be ſomewhere in the Church or houſe of God, in which light the Church is ſometimes conſidered, ſuch an apartment as a nurſery: And would it then conſiſt very well with the tender character of a nurſing Mother, or Church, to turn her infant into the world to ſhift for itſelf, becauſe it was not born into the Church a perfect Man or Woman, i. e. that could not ſee it to be unlawful to defend itſelf? We hope that ſuch thoughts as theſe may awaken ſuch chriſtian tender feelings in ſome, as they, either have not indulged, or have not known.</p>
            <p>Wars were not even lawful under the Moſaical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but when they acted in them according to the counſel of God, and if the ſame counſel hath now made the ſword neceſſary to aſſiſt Magiſtracy which He hath inſtituted, it cannot be unlawful for ſuch Magiſtrates to make uſe of it who are to ſerve him in that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until he ſhall call them to ſome other.</p>
            <p>This the aforeſaid Apoſtle ſeems to have been very ſenſible of, notwithſtanding he was under the Goſpel diſpenſation and influence, when he ſaid "For this cauſe pay you Tribute: For they are God's Miniſters attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually on this very thing."—To uſe the words of the aforeſaid Letter-writer, "Truly ſuch muſt have a very high opinion of their own judgment," that would ſet them over the judgment and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as well as their Brethren in general, from their firſt appearance as a Religious Society until the late revolution. This we think hath a tendency to undermine and lay waſte the ancient Teſtimony of Friends in that caſe, founded on the example and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience as above, and is very afflicting to the ſenſible, conſiderate part of the Society: To prevent which was the deſire, we make no doubt, of the Author of the Piece in diſpute.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:018802_0042_0FA81586E0D7C6A0"/>We cannot, however, think ſo ſtrange of many of their novel opinions, which appear to be increaſing among them, when we conſider the weakneſs of the human mind, as well as the animal machine each one of the human race bears about with him, which is ſo often controuled by the almoſt invincible force and power of an over heated and gloomy Imagination, which is often the cauſe of the weakneſs of our minds and the errors in our judgment, and frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with doubting, ſinking, diſcouraging thoughts; And as it is generally attended with ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it will ſometimes riſe into very high tranſports and elevations; but let them incline to which extream they may, they are generally fixed and determined in their conceits until a different habit of body alters their minds; and cannot be prevailed on to think, but that they are realities; and often as much, or more ſelfiſhly opinionated than any others—It is a pity that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under theſe weakneſſes ſhould be much together, for they do but ſtrengthen and increaſe each others weakneſſes and infirmities of this nature. People of ſuch gloomy imaginations are almoſt inceſſantly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating and revolving their imaginary difficulties— Reaſon and argument, and even advice under the beſt influence, are generally loſt upon them, as there is none harder to be wrought upon — When the objects of their doubts and ſcruples are religious ſubjects they ought however to be treated with tenderneſs, eſpecially when they do not labour to impoſe their ſcruples on others, which when they are perſons of influence in the Church, they often do—Scruples often of little or no conſequence, and yet ſometimes would be very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious if they were received by a Church: Inſtances of this nature have been ſo frequent that it is needleſs

to mention particulars. There have been, every one knows, frequent inſtances of perſons giving way ſo far to the influence of ſuch gloomy thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as to be led into a ſtate of deſperation, and ſometimes to do violence to their own lives. This is of a quite different nature from that godly ſorrow that worketh true repentance to ſalvation, not to be repented of: However, if perſons labouring under the preſſure of ſuch gloomy imaginations are real lovers of God they will find this, as well as every other thing, will work together for their good, as they ſtrive againſt it in <hi>patience</hi> and true <hi>reſignation</hi> to Him who is able to make all things new in them, in his own time and in his own way, which we ought to ſtrive to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to.

This ſort of people, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are as ſuperſtitiouſly attached to the idols of imagination as any other, if not more ſo, and by no means eaſier to be reclaimed than they, and none more ready to turn again and rend one; and ſeem to have little other idea of Humility, than an external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of affected ſingularity and ſubjection to their

Church, where they would willingly be regarded as leaders, which is too often the caſe—This temper and diſpoſition of mind is perhaps no way eaſier diſcovered than by its impatience of diſſent, which we have never ſeen more apparently verified in any caſe than in the preſent controverſy between Timothy Davis and his former Friends, notwithſtanding the novelty of their ſentiments about paying Taxes, which was the ground of the controverſy, and yet they pretend a very great regard for their Anceſtors and their ſentiments, but can very eaſily part with any of them that do not coincide with their new ones, at the expence of many of their ſober uſeful Members, who from an inward ſenſibility of the rectitude of the ſentiments of our, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, reſpecting paying Taxes, are led publickly to defend them. This is ſomething ſo inconſiſtent with that Chriſtian Liberty, which the Spirit of the Goſpel every where breathes, that, indeed, we cannot but think they are very much in the dark: We therefore affectionately wiſh them deeply to conſider, both the nature and neceſſity of that Humility recommended by our dear Lord and Saviour; Mat. ch. 18. v. 3.4.5. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility here recommended, doth not lead the mind into rambling fluctuating Opinions, nor into a fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Bigotry, nor into a conceitedneſs of our having diſcovered more than our Predeceſſors, nor yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that which is true becauſe not embraced by them,

In this ſtate of Reſignation our minds are brought to be quiet and contented to paſs under the cloſeſt ſcrutiny by the Light of Chriſt, however it may eclipſe our <hi>reputation</hi> as being encouragers, or promoters, of any popular opinions in any Society, civil or religious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that true Reformation conſiſts not in a mere ſpeculative notion of Religion, but in the ſanctification and renovation of Heart, repreſented by our Saviour under the metaphor of cleanſing the <hi>inſide</hi> of the <hi>cup</hi> and <hi>platter,</hi> which he recommends firſt to be done, that the outſide may be clean alſo: Then, oh! the quietneſs the mind enjoys, being retired from religious partial ſtrife about opinion, zeal and victory; and can ſay feelingly, <hi>O Lord, altho' thou ſtay me, yet will I truſt in thee; enable me and I will follow thee in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation unto Life everlaſting!</hi> When we are brought into this humble ſtate, we are not diſpoſed without very great cauſe to be very ſevere in our cenſures of others, but concerned that nothing in ourſelves paſs without the cloſeſt examination.

            <p>There is one thing in the Piece in diſpute that hath been objected to by ſome, which if not mentioned, may be thought to be too great an omiſſion, which is as followeth, viz.
<q>By all that I have been able to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018802_0046_0FA81589A9516868"/>
diſcover, our Society in England have ever made a Point of being careful and exact in paying all Taxes, legally aſſeſſed, except the Prieſts Rates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is thought to be a very great blunder: Whether it is or not, may be eaſily ſeen, by even a moderate attention to the manner of his treating the ſubject. It may be obſerved that he doth not poſitively aſſert they <hi>had payed all ſuch Taxes,</hi> but makes this <hi>reſerve,</hi> viz. <hi>by all that he had been able to diſcover.</hi> Now, ſuppoſe there had been two or three Taxes, that he had not diſcovered, in the firſt Century after they appeared as a ſeparate Society, that were calculated merely to defray the charges of War, and we queſtion where more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can be produced, that Friends refuſed to pay; is it not very diſingenuous and unfriendly to labour that to his diſadvantage—The ſubject he was upon was general mixed Taxes, and could not well have been underſtood otherwiſe, if proper attention had been paid to the ſcope of his arguments, notwithſtanding the word, <hi>general</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> were omitted; that, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be thought he had any deſign to impoſe on his reader; therefore we cannot ſee what purpoſe the above objection was intended to ſerve, unleſs to ſupply the want of ſomething more to their purpoſe — It is indeed matter of ſome conſolation that they could find nothing greater to lay to his charge: If they ever have, they have concealed it, both from him and us. In their Teſtimony againſt him, they appear very cautious of mentioning particulars, and only ſay that his Piece contained matter <hi>altogether diſſatisfactory to Friends;</hi> not a word to let us know what that matter is. The reaſon of this reſervedneſs perhaps they did not think for their reputation to diſcloſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:018802_0047_0FA8158A6B1B33B8"/>Some, when they have failed in every other attempt againſt him, alledge a want of ſpiritual mindedneſs in him.—How far this is true he ſubmits to the candour of thoſe who are the beſt acquainted with his life and converſation, and are the leaſt prejudiced in the caſe, either for or againſt him. But thoſe who make this objection pretend to a more certain way of knowing the ſtate of his mind, by a ſpirit of diſcerning; but unhappy for them their ſpirit of diſcerning hath ſometimes failed them.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of ſpiritual mindedneſs, or a being led by the Spirit, is notwithſtanding, ſo eſſential both to the being and well being of a Chriſtian, that it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of deep ſorrow that its Profeſſors are not more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led by it, or that any who profeſs to be ſo led ſhould ſtrain their pretenſions to it beyond what the moſt extenſive Charity can lead one to think, by their lives and converſation, they ever have experienced. We ſhall however leave them <hi>to their own Maſter before whom they ſhall ſtand or fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is ſuch a thing as having a ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of our own ſtates in ſome degree we fully believe, and have ſome experience of; and that there are ſome who pretend to much more than what is real, cannot with reaſon be diſputed. What we would therefore adviſe againſt is a being impoſed on, or impoſing on others.</p>
            <p>Although he is charged with a want of ſpiritual-mindedneſs, we hope it is not expected that he will attempt by argument to prove himſelf poſſeſſed of it. We expect, if he is poſſeſſed of common modeſty, he will not, let his experience, in that reſpect, be as great as it may: We therefore think it quite out of character to charge him with that which he is not at liberty to defend himſelf in, unleſs by his life and converſation.</p>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:018802_0048_0FA8158B2CF37DF8"/>That ſome have had a gift of ſpiritual diſcerning ſo far, as at ſome times, to ſee the ſtates of others we fully believe; and that ſome, in this reſpect, have pretended to ſee the ſtates of others who did not ſee their own, we as fully believe. As there are ſo many inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this pretenſions to ſpiritual diſcerning hath failed, and perſons who have pretended to it have oppoſed each other, it appears indiſputably neceſſary to examine ſuch pretenſions well before they are admitted, or before we receive ſuch kind of revelations when ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to us, or in any way give way to their dictates. The old ſerpent, or transformer, hath no doubt as eaſy acceſs to our feelings, in theſe caſes, as many others wherein he deceiveth poor weak man. And we are not without our doubts that in their conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe in diſpute, they were impoſed on in that manner; and felt a little too much for their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with a Political Party; and likely were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that it might ſuffer, if they treated the matter with leſs ſeverity. Such kind of prejudice is not likely to help to a very dear underſtanding of religious matters, eſpecially to judge of the ſpirits of others: Like the Night, it often repreſents objects to be very different from what they are: Like the want of Faith, which rendereth us very incapable of judging of, or profiting by the bed inſtructions. This no doubt an inſpired Apoſtle was very ſenſible of, when he ſaid, "the word preached did not profit, not being mixed with faith in thoſe who heard it." We are notwithſtanding ſo much in favour of ſpiritual diſcerning, or Religious Feelings, that we think them to be as really neceſſary to the being and well being of a Chriſtian, as feeling and diſcerning is to the life of the body. All that we reject concerning them, is, what every thoughtful Chriſtian ought to reject, viz. falſe pretenſions.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:018802_0049_0FA8158BE223F998"/>That Friends have been a reſpectable body of Chriſtians is not doubted by us, which perhaps might have been with more propriety affirmed of them in time paſt than at preſent: But however, as reſpectable as they may have been, or now are, we hardly think it ſafe to follow them implicitly. A Chriſtian Body or Church, however large or reſpectable, doth by no means intitle it to implicit faith or blind obedience.— That we ought to liſten with attention to the voice of the Church is not diſputed but to follow it without proper examination betrays very great weakneſs, if not very great bigotry. If we are always to follow her voice, it muſt be becauſe we are convinced ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways infallible, which we cannot very willingly aſſent to; and if ſhe is not, it may be difficult to know when ſhe is or will be infallible. If it be ſaid by ſtanding in that Light which only, and truly, makes manifeſt. We anſwer, this is very true, and the only way that a true and ſaving knowledge is obtained, but it appears by innumerable facts as well as experience, that neither the Church nor individual members are at all times ſo under the influence of the unerring Spirit as to make up Judgments wholly from its dictates, who may therefore at ſome times, with great propriety, ſay that it is <hi>I and not the Lord that ſpeaks,</hi> who often give their judgment as men. And further, if individuals are favoured with the Light as well as the Church, they, in that reſpect, ſtand upon the ſame ground ſhe doth, ſeeing alſo the Church is only a collection of individuals that afford her all the Light ſhe can have from enlightened members, all of which are liable to be miſled, as well in a collective, as in an individual capacity, and therefore each one hath a right to determine for himſelf according to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence received, whether human or Divine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:018802_0050_0FA8158D67E491F8"/>That there never was a Church, altogether infallible cannot with reaſon be diſputed, for ſuch a one would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be ſo ſtill; for that which is infallible cannot at any time fail, and conſequently muſt forever remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. But all Proteſtants are agreed that the primitive churches, however well founded, have failed in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances— If we are to follow the voice of the Church at this day implicitly, it muſt be becauſe ſhe is now infallible and that they were not, which we hardly think any will affirm. But to do juſtice to the Society we muſt ſay they do not ſay that the Church, as ſuch, is infallible, but that there is an infallible Spirit in it; no doubt this is ſo far true, that at certain times it hath preſided in their Church, and that is the moſt that can be truly ſaid, either of their Church or any other, and what all Chriſtians are agreed in, and we fully believe that if all Churches were truly and humbly to ſeek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently wait for the guidance and direction of that Spirit they would be much more largely favoured with it than they now are; remembring that encouraging pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, viz <hi>The humble, God will teach of his ways, and the meek be will guide in Judgment,</hi> but that <hi>he beholds the proud afar off;</hi> and they will forever remain at a diſtance from him, while in that ſituation of mind.</p>
            <p>That uncertainty, more or leſs, attends all Churches in a militant ſtate we think cannot reaſonably be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; therefore the members of the primitive Churches did well in keeping their eyes open to the principles and practice of them and to take the liberty to judge for themſelves concerning their rectitude, or they would not have been likely to have diſcovered their errors, which were complained of in very early days. John the Divine as well as others of the Apoſtles take very particular notice of many things among them
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:018802_0051_0FA8158ECB11CD20"/>
very far from being the reſult of an infallible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It appears therefore highly neceſſary, that the members of any church have their attention engaged towards her ſentiments and conduct, even in her beſt ſtate, otherwiſe they may not diſcover when ſhe begins to decline; for want of ſuch attention ſhe may deviate ſo far from her firſt rectitude as to be paſt recovery; nor is her confidence of her own good ſtate always a very clear evidence of it. It is perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Churches as with ſome individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are never more impatient of diſſent than when there is the greateſt reaſon to diſſent from them.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations it very naturally followeth, that no church ought to diſcourage the free exerciſe of private judgment, nor think hard of her Members if their ſuſpicions are ſometimes awakened, eſpecially if they are alarmed by her adopting new ſentiments, contrary to what ſhe hath always firmly adhered to; altho' it is poſſible ſuch new ſentiments may be true, yet it is as poſſible they may not, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the duty of the Church to wait on ſuch diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied members with patience, perhaps they may be bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a means to ſet her right if ſhe hath erred, and if not ſhe may be a bleſſing to ſuch diſſatisfied members in ſitting them right; they may however be a mutual bleſſing to each other if they truly ſeek that wiſdom which is from above; for the promiſe to them that ſeek is, <hi>that they ſhall find:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">To the ſame purpoſe, ſee Phillip, ch. 3.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> Remembring, as hath been obſerved, that her exiſtence as a Church, is only as a collection of individuals, and that therefore ſhe is no longer a Church than while thoſe individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which conſtitute her, remain united; whoſe duty it is, while thus united, by all lawful means, to preſerve
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018802_0052_0FA8158F09A49120"/>
that unity, that the Church may edify itſelf in love, either by exhorting, reproving, or encouraging, where neceſſary This Chriſtian Freedom, in the Spirit of Love, manifeſted in goſpel tenderneſs and care for each other, is the moſt likely means to preſerve true unity and fellowſhip in a Church—Severity ought never to be extended but in wilful obſtinate caſes, where the peace of the church is manifeſtly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by them, and perhaps there hath ſeldom been more diſtreſſing inſtances of that nature than where reformation hath been pretended. The multiplying ſeverities in a Church hath ſeldom been found to be of real ſervice: It may indeed ſometimes procure a ſuperficial and ſervile obedience, and thereby increaſe her hypocrites, but will hardly effect her reformation.</p>
            <p>As we are accountable to One before whom each one muſt anſwer for himſelf and not another, it is highly reaſonable that we ought to think, judge and digeſt religious matters for ourſelves, without being confined to the voice of a Church; and it is at leaſt equally reaſonable that ſhe be not confined to the voice or judgment of an individual, let his authority in the Church be as great as it may: Conviction on either ſide ought to be the only reaſon for aſſent.</p>
            <p>Every Church hath an undoubted right to ſettle the Terms of its own Communion, provided nevertheleſs, that they do not interfere with the civil or religious rights of members, or of any one elſe—Whenever they interfere with ſuch rights, it becomes the duty of the civil Magiſtrate to interfere. Every Member hath an undoubted right to diſſent from the Church when he ſees reaſon, yet he ought not to uſe this liberty to his own, or the Church's diſadvantage, in ſuffering ſmall things, or things of mere indifference, to be magnified
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018802_0053_0FA8158FAAC3E428"/>
into matters of ſeparation; but whether the matters of offence are great or ſmall, the Church as well as her members have each their undoubted right of determination; and cannot well walk togther without chriſtian condeſcenſion—But the idea that there is always an infallible judgment in the Church, which ſome have embraced, and that ſhe is always led by it, hath been a great hindrance to the exerciſe of private judgment and free enquiry, and fixed ſome ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably in a ſtate of bigotry that they receive all from the Church, without indulging a thought of ſeeking any further for information, that if it even comes from Heaven they durſt not believe it unleſs the Church ſays it came from thence.—We ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that a being immediately led by the Spirit of God, and a being only implicitly led by the Church, are very different things. The Primitive Chriſtians were not required to follow even the Apoſtles any farther than they followed Chriſt.</p>
            <p>One objection that hath been very ſtrongly urged againſt us is, that we have applied to the Earthly Powers for the recovery of what we think to be our civil right in the Society who diſowned us, which they refuſe to give up, which we think if properly attended to the reaſons for objection, in that caſe, will ceaſe. And therefore let it be conſidered that we made them propoſals of ſettlement of thoſe matters of property in diſpute between us and them to no purpoſe, they neglecting or refuſing to comply with them, or to treat with us on the ſubject, and ſince have wholly refuſed, even to ſubmit the matter to Reference, leſt it ſhould embarraſs the Society in endleſs Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we ſaw no way for redreſs but the Law: And to have it remain in that unſettled ſituation was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018802_0054_0FA81592DF9232F8"/>
likely to produce, as well as continue very diſagreeable effects, while each party claimed what the other thought they had no right to; therefore to prevent ſuch effects, by Juſtice taking place, we thought it adviſeable to take the moſt eaſy way for a ſettlement both to them and us, which appeared to us would be to apply to the General Court. This being alſo conſiſtent with their own Diſcipline, one would have thought they would readily have complied.—They have conſtantly urged it as a Rule among them, that Friends <hi>do not attempt to try titles of land in diſpute, but that it be referred to the Law for ſettlement.</hi> This was the way by which we wiſhed it to have been ſettled, not with reſpect to the land only, but the Meeting-houſes in the ſame diſputable ſituation; where they would have been cited in to have made their defence: But the General Court thought it more properly came under the conſideration of the Judicial Department, firſt advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to a Reference, which we have urged them to, but they, as hath been obſerved, refuſe to comply with it.</p>
            <p>It is objected that a Petition of that nature, is to them intirely new and unprecedented, and a compliance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and therefore unreaſonable; and the more ſo, as it hath been an eſtabliſhed Rule in the Society that ſuch as are at any time diſowned, do not only looſe their rights as Members, but alſo their right to any property they may have had in the Society.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That impoſſibilities are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nor expected: But will it follow, that becauſe length of time, or any other circumſtance, hath render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it impoſſible to do ſome people ſtrict juſtice, that they are juſtifiable in refuſing it to others in like caſes where it is practicable? If they have always neglected to do juſtice to their diſowned members until it is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018802_0055_0FA8159463F9DAA8"/>
impoſſible to do ſome of them ſtrict juſtice, will it follow that they are excuſable where it is in their power to do it? It is not a very good argument to ſay, that becauſe in ſome caſes we never have done our duty, therefore, in ſimilar caſes we never ought to. Their alledging the continued practice of the Church in this caſe will not help them in point of Juſtice, nor add to the reputation of their Church Conſtitution, when juſtly conſidered, however it may have been indulged by the Law, which we hope it will be before we conclude.</p>
            <p>They did not argue as they have done here in the caſe of the poor inſlaved Negroes: They have very clearly manifeſted the abſurdity of ſuch a kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in that caſe; therefore, in confuting that kind of reaſoning in that caſe; they have neceſſarily confuted it in all ſimilar caſes. They did not think the countenance that iniquitous practice met with from civil Authority, nor the indulgence and encouragement it met with from the Society in time paſt, by any means a ſufficient reaſon to perſiſt in it. The iniquity of refuſing that unhappy People Juſtice in ſo tender a point as their Liberty, is perhaps, by thoſe poſſeſſed of them, more eaſily ſeen than complied with, and it is not unlikely it may be the caſe in the preſent controverſy, which altho' not attended with circumſtances equally moving, yet equally intitled to Juſtice, and therefore demands a very cloſe attention.</p>
            <p>A ſuppoſition that we have <hi>forfeited any part of our property to them, in conſequence of our being diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them,</hi> to us appears extremely abſurd; and more eſpecially as the diſownment of us, all originated in Timothy Davis's being diſowned, who never had a hearing in that caſe—We wiſh them to look at it.—
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018802_0056_0FA81595EE53B5F0"/>
That we have properly in thoſe Meeting-houſes and Lands appertaining to them where we claim it, is what they diſpute with as little reaſon as they might do any property we poſſeſs—What we have contributed to the purchaſing ſuch Houſes and Lands hath intitled as to a property in them; with as much reaſon as they can aſſign for any property they claim in them, or any other property they poſſeſs; for the like contributions by them is all the reaſon they can properly aſſign for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty they have in them: That while we were together, our rights to ſuch property were equal; this we think they will not diſpute. The queſtion then wholly turns upon our being diſowned by them. Then it will be neceſſary to conſider whether any Conſtitution, either civil or religious, can be conſidered as juſt and righteous that conſiders the Property of its ſubjects, or members, ſo far at its own diſpoſal, as that for any diſſention merely Religious they ſhall take from them any part of their Property without their conſent. If the civil Authority hath not ſuch a right, which it is clear they have not, then it is as clear they cannot confer any ſuch Right no not even on memberſhip, for they ſay that
<q>The common right or priviledge of our Meeting Houſes, &amp;c is a right annexed to Memberſhip only.</q>
We would willingly know who annexed it; was it the civil Power that had no right to do it? If it was it cannot be a very conſcientious right that Memberſhip is in poſſeſſion of, that belongeth to other people.</p>
            <p>If he aforeſaid Society have not received this pretended right to confiſcate to their own uſe, or the uſe of Memberſhip, from Civil Government, who had no juſt right to beſtow it on them, from whence did they derive it? Surely they do not claim that power of confiſcation as a Divine Right, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hope
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018802_0057_0FA815966C9D5F18"/>
Civil Authority will nor defend any pretenſions to a Power over other peoples Property which they had no right to give, or the others to claim. That it therefore very clearly appears that the pretenſions of thoſe who have diſowned us to any part of our property in conſequence of our being diſowned by them, is built on a foundation that Reaſon, Revelation Religion and Civil Government diſclaim.</p>
            <p>That our being diſowned by them ſhould forfeit to their uſe any part of our property, hath ſomething in it ſo ſelfiſh and unchriſtian that we are inclined to hope that the moderate and conſcientious among them will relinquiſh all ſuch pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Some have been weak enough to urge that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to ſuch religious uſes doth not intitle to a right in it, but that it is to be conſidered as a free donation; becauſe, ſay they, any one hath an indubitable right to contribute to any lawful uſe he pleaſeth, without any hope or proſpect of reward, or being by any means benefited thereby; yea he may lend or give hoping never to receive again. This they ſay is the caſe in contributing to ſuch religious purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: No one can reaſonably diſpute againſt the right every one hath to contribute to religious purpoſes, either with, or without a proſpect of being benefited thereby. But if we properly advert to the nature of the Controverſy in contributing in ſuch caſes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, we ſhall ſee that it naturally and unavoidably ſuggeſts the idea of being benefited by them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſuch who have not contributed any thing, unleſs it be ſuch Members on whom the Society have beſtowed thoſe priviledges in conſequence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming members; and if they detain all the property thoſe have in the Society whom they diſown, they may afford to beſtow a little on thoſe who are not able
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018802_0058_0FA8159741AAC200"/>
to aſſiſt by their contributions. They, as a religious body, as well as other Societies, bold Meeting Houſes as well as the Lands appertaining to them as their own property, which do one elſe hath any right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with This is very eaſily diſcovered when they think themſelves intruded on, which they are as ſenſible of as any other people— But why is it their property?— Becauſe, ſay they, we have purchaſed it by contributions, or received it as a donation for that purpoſe, and conſequently we are the proprietors.</p>
            <p>It is objected by ſome, that as do temporal reward is required when a perſon is received into memberſhip it would be very unreaſonable that they ſhould make any demands on the Society when they are diſowned.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: This objection is very foreign from the Point No one of a common underſtanding ſuppoſeth that a member can juſtly have any demands on that Church that hath not been benefited by him, unleſs they have admitted him as a proprietor in conſideration of his being a member only, if this be the caſe, they can no more be conſidered as having forfeited their rights to ſuch property than thoſe who have contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the purchaſing of it. In a word, if a perſon be juſtly intitled to the property of the Church, or any part of it, no act of theirs can juſtly deprive him of it without his conſent. Whenever an intereſt is collected, whether by the Church, or any other collective Body, thoſe who contributed to the collecting of it are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly intereſted in it, according to the aſſiſtance they gave in collecting of it, unleſs they have beſtowed it on that Body as a free donation: If they have, every one knoweth that they have no right of demand on that Body: But if they have not, they have a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable right to the intereſt they have aſſiſted in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, and never ought to be deprived of it but by their own conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:018802_0059_0FA81597E61A16E0"/>If they who have contributed to the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned religious purpoſes, do not expect to be benefited in preference to thoſe who are by do means intereſted in it, in burying their dead, and attending meetings for Worſhip and Diſcipline, there might be ſomething ſaid in favour of their objection, but as this is not the caſe, it is in vain to pretend that they do not conſider ſuch intereſt as their Property, and theirs only.</p>
            <p>It hath been urged, we apprehend, for want of ſomething more to their purpoſe, that one perſon hath no more right to ſuch property than another, becauſe any ſober perſon who never contributed a farthing, and who is not even a member in Society is allowed full liberty to attend meetings of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: This is very true, and what every Chriſtian Society approves of. But who are they that indulge them in this liberty? Is it they that have no property in ſuch intereſt? It is ſaid that thoſe who contribute to ſuch religious purpoſes have no more property in them than thoſe who have not: That if they have ſuch liberty it muſt be from ſuch who have no right to grant it; for it is a clear caſe that thoſe who have no property in ſuch intereſt, have no right to grant any liberty concerning it. And if there is none to grant it, there is none who can juſtly take it away: Then we who have been diſowned ſtand upon equal ground with them in that reſpect, which is all we urge. But they, when they are moleſted, can always find ſome body that hath property in ſuch Meetings Houſes without much difficulty, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſay we have forfeited our right to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and conſider themſelves to be the perſons to whom it is forfeited. If we have forfeited it, we muſt have had it, and indeed are intitled to it ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any thing they have ſaid or done to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:018802_0060_0FA81598D1033980"/>Some indeed are ſo ingenuous as to confeſs that they do not think we have forfeited our right to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in queſtion, but do not ſee that a juſt ſettlement can be had without letting in, and giving an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to others who have been juſtly diſowned, to bring in their claims in like manner— This free confeſſion naturally ſuppoſeth us to have been unjuſtly diſowned—Let them fully reverſe that act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ownment, and acknowledge their miſtake, and the matter concerning Property will eaſily ſettle. But why doth a perſon's being properly and juſtly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly diſowned forfeit his right to property, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who diſowned him? This is opening a door to what is called <hi>pious fraud</hi>—We will ſuppoſe that Avaro and Tirannus were leading active members in a Society that was very rich, who conſidered the property thoſe had in Society who were diſowned by it to be forfeited to it in conſequence of their being diſowned by it: Avaro and Tirannus viewed this large intereſt with ſelfiſh eyes, and ſoon began to be very zealous inſpectors into the conduct of its members, and urged that it was quite time that the Church was purged of its droſs and filth; and taking advantage of the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>credulity</hi> of their fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, began to caſt out of the Church, <hi>both men and women,</hi> and under ſome pretenſions or other of faults in the Members, never gave over until the Church was ſo far diſſolved, that they two only were left; and finding themſelves in this happy ſituation, as they thought, conſidered that now the right of <hi>Memberſhip</hi> and conſequently the right to the property of the Church concentered in them, and therefore ſold it and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inriched themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:018802_0061_0FA8159974866558"/>Thoſe who have made the foregoing acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our right to the Property in queſtion, but do not ſee how it can be had without letting into ſuch claims thoſe who have been juſtly diſowned, ſhould conſider, that even a being juſtly diſowned ought not to affect Property. If they can make appear that they have property to the Society it ought not to be withheld. No act of the Church ought, ſo far, to affect Property as to ingroſs it themſelves; therefore let any one who claimeth property be called upon if the caſe be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to make appear that he hath been a Member of that Society, which, if he hath, will not be hard to do by their records, and if it can be made appear he hath been intereſted in the property of the Society, his claim ought to be acknowledged to be good: And if any one is contented with improving his right by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Meetings, and improving the lands, or any other intereſt in common with the Church, there need be no difficulty in that caſe. But, if any are uneaſy with attending their Meetings, and have a mind to meet by themſelves, when a minority, let them have liberty of the Houſe when the majority do not occupy it: But if they are a majority they ought to have the rule and direction of ſaid Houſe, &amp;c. allowing the others the like liberty. This appears to us to be no more than what Chriſtian condeſcenſion will very clearly juſtify if not demand.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let it be conſidered, that while that Property, which any one contributeth to ſuch religious uſes, remains in his own hands, it is wholly in his own power, and at his own diſpoſal; he may therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the whole, or part thereof, or put it juſt as far out of his power as he pleaſeth. Now, in contributing to the before mentioned purpoſes he only gives up his
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018802_0062_0FA8159A2C6A4CE0"/>
right to order and diſpoſe of ſuch property, or the uſe of it, to the Church while he remains a member of it, in expectation that in conſideration of his becoming, or being a member of ſaid Church he ſhall be let into the general property thereof, with every other priviledge or appurtenance belonging thereto, in like manner as the reſt of the members: In ordering and directing of which, he only expects to have a voice with the reſt of his Brethren. As every Member becomes thus inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in, and dependent on the property of each other, ſo that no one part of the Church can ſay that the other hath no right in it, the Property of each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Member being circumſtanced alike, the being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned ought not to alienate ſuch Property, neither in juſtice can it, and therefore when any one is deprived by the Society of that benefit, in conſequence of which he was induced to contribute, it ought to revert to him again; and more eſpecially, when we conſider that the conſtitution of their Church is ſuch, that if any one of their Members is reduced to want, the Church holdeth itſelf under obligation to contribute to his relief as long as he remains a member, and no longer; when he is diſowned they conſider themſelves releaſed from ſuch particular obligation, and he is no longer benefited by what he hath contributed to the general ſtock, but is obliged to go out empty-handed, however large his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution may have been, if it be even to the whole of his ſubſtance, be it leſs or more.</p>
            <p>But they ſay that they hold themſelves equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to contribute to the relief of thoſe who never have contributed a farthing, as thoſe who have contributed the moſt largely, without any diſcrimination.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, that their care in relieving their poor does them very great honour: It is an example well worthy the imitation of every Chriſtian ſociety. But
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018802_0063_0FA8159B10E54970"/>
do they think to make themſelves amends by detaining the property of thoſe they have diſowned? is it juſt to take from thoſe who have property to give to thoſe who have not? Such conduct as this will inevitably caſt a ſhade over the faireſt characters.—</p>
            <p>We will ſuppoſe that ſome years paſt, William was ſo well pleaſed with being admitted a member of their Church, that he contributed ſo largely to it that he had but little left; William is now convinced of his miſtake; the wants of an encreaſing family are ſenſibly felt, and he would willingly leave the Society, but has ſtrong ſuſpicions that he ſhall need their aſſiſtance, and Memberſhip will ingroſs all that he hath put into the hands of the Church by his large contributions to their intereſts, and his Family will ſuffer for want of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore William ſtill remains a member.</p>
            <p>Avaro is exceedingly well pleaſed with this part of the conſtitution of the Church, that hath annexed all its property to Memberſhip, that provided ſo well for her intereſt; is in hopes in time ſhe will grow rich: And thinks it may be a means too of preſerving her members from leaving of her, and highly commends her prudence.</p>
            <p>But Chriſtianus is as much diſpleaſed with it, and it is matter of heſitation with him whether he had beſt leave the Society or not: His greateſt uneaſineſs at preſent is, that Avaro is ſo much in favour with the Church and this ſentiment of her detaining the property of her diſowned Members. He thinks indeed it may be a means of preſerving her numbers, but not her virtue, innocence or reputation with truly Chriſtian people.</p>
            <p>It is objected that we are grown ſower and bitter againſt them, and in that bitter ſpirit are collecting all their weakneſſes we can think of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:018802_0064_0FA8159BC494BAC0"/>We anſwer, That this charge, we hope, is in general without any juſt foundation. We think they have given cauſe for this and much more to have been ſaid without juſtly incurring the cenſure of bitterneſs. But perhaps in ſome times of weakneſs, ſomething like this charge may have been diſcovered, which may not ſeem very ſtrange if we allow what King Solomon remarks to have any weight, viz. that <hi>oppreſſion will make a wiſe man mad.</hi> It may then be thought leſs ſtrange if ſome of us get a little out of the way in that reſpect. It is however what we wiſh not to indulge—It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſay what is really neceſſary in one's vindication againſt oppreſſion, either verbally or by writing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being thought too fevere, or even bitter or acrid, eſpecially by thoſe whoſe conduct we expoſe—They are frequently cautioning us againſt being too ſevere and bitter againſt them, and we wiſh it to have a good effect, but they ſeem not to be under any apprehenſion of erring in that reſpect themſelves: We ſhould be glad to be convinced that they do not: We ſhall however leave their conduct to manifeſt what tempers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions they have indulged towards us in time paſt, and hope they will be better in future, and hope alſo to preſerve that diſpoſition towards them that can render good for evil, and wiſh well to all men, and have no reaſon to think but that it is the ſentiment and wiſh of thoſe among of whom they have diſowned.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of the beforementioned Letter ſigned by Iſaac Lawton, &amp;c. they expreſs themſelves thus, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And there having been heretofore, as well as of late, happy inſtances of a return from your ſituation, we may expreſs, on this occaſion, our deſire that you may feel their example to be worthy your ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and imitation; which we truſt will be the caſe of all ſuch as truly ſeek their own, and the Church's, Peace.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:018802_0065_0FA8159D55580128"/>From this it very clearly appears how high an opinion they have of their Church, ſo high, that they inſinuate that by being ſeparated from it, we are rendered incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſeeking either our own, or the Church's, Peace, until we return to her again. In this we muſt take the liberty to diſſent from them, and think that all ſuch who truly ſeek the peace of that univerſal Church which Chriſt hath gathered by his holy Spirit, neceſſarily ſeek their own Peace; which we hope is at leaſt the caſe with ſome of us. What examples they may be able to exhibit of any returns to them that is worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we do not pretend to ſay; but think that ſuch a partial fondneſs for, and attachment to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, is much more to be lamented than imitated.—What ſolid ſatisfaction any one, who is truly humble, can expect to hate from a People ſo full of themſelves, we muſt leave, and that can ſo eaſily lay aſide, or overlook the example of our Saviour and the Apoſtles, as well as their Predeceſſors, in the inſtance of paying taxes, a thing ſo neceſſary for the upholding Civil Government, divinely inſtituted by the Author of our being and well-being: To which examples we ſhall take the liberty to give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, however we may be cenſured by our former Friends, or thoſe who have returned to them; and therefore can, by no means, with peace and ſafety to our own minds, give ſo much encouragement to a contrary practice and ſentiment, as to diſapprove that publick encouragement any of us have heretofore given to the paying taxes. Had it only been the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Predeceſſors that they had diſregarded, or miſconſtrued, much might have been ſaid in excuſe for them; but that they ſhould neglect the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and recommend, with ſo

much earneſtneſs, the example of ſuch, who not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſuitable attention to the before-mentioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, have returned to them again, who were labouring to propagate a contrary practice, and to lay waſte the before-mentioned example, is very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and what we would wiſh them carefully to conſider. What renders the matter ſtill peculiarly diſcouraging is, than thoſe who refuſe to pay ſuch taxes are generally the moſt active and diſtinguiſhed in the Society, which, when they become differently minded, we ſhall, it is probable, look towards with a much more encouraging proſpect.</p>
            <p>They could have ſcarcely ſuggeſted any thing more injurious and prejudicial to our religious Characters in the Society than that we are not in a ſituation to ſeek our own, or the Church's, Peace; nor could they eaſily have diſcovered more partiality for themſelves; which indeed hath been remarkably manifeſt through the moſt of their proceedings againſt us, as is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what hath been already ſaid; who have been very induſtrious in labouring to forecloſe and prevent us, as much as poſſible, from rendering any public, religious ſervice to any of our former Brethren; many of whom appeared as ready and willing to attend our meetings for public Worſhip as ever they were, but appear to be afraid of being brought under Church dealing in conſequence of it, and ſharing the fate of many of their Brethren who have been diſowned, for no other cauſe than joining with us in the external acts of public Worſhip—We have reaſon to think the more ſtrange of their conduct in this Caſe when we reflect that they might have been convinced of the impropriety of ſuch a procedure by a ſimilar weakneſs that, at a certain time, diſcovered itſelf among the

Diſciples of Chriſt, Mark 9.38, 39, 40. <hi>And John anſwered him, ſaying, Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy Name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not us. But Jeſus ſaid, Forbid him not: For there is no man which ſhall do a Miracle in my Name, that can lightly ſpeak evil of me. For he that is not againſt us is on our part.</hi> What we particularly remark as being more eſpecially perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our caſe are theſe words, viz. <hi>and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not us</hi>—Our former Brethren have virtually forbid us, not to caſt out devils in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous way, but to appear in public Prayer to Him, who, through Chriſt, hath taught us to pray without ceaſing.—If any aſk how this appears? We anſwer, by their frequently refuſing to join us in that public duty as hath been obſerved, which is conſidered as an act of diſapprobation, and is far, very far, from this ſalutary doctrine taught by our Saviour, as above; which we think ought to have more weight in their minds than they give it—We are however but little concerned about our Reputation with them in this caſe, however they may attempt to injure it, unleſs becauſe it renders us incapable of being of much religious ſervice to them. It is our greateſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that we are under the tender care of a kind Providence, to whoſe <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> we commit, for <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>protection,</hi> not only our <hi>Reputation,</hi> but <hi>every thing elſe</hi> that appertains to us; nothing doubting but that He, whoſe watchful eye is over all ſuch who put their <hi>truſt in Him, will graciouſly plead our cauſe.</hi>
