            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Excellency of the chriſtian Religion is very apparent from it's natural Tendency to promote the Welfare and Happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. An univerſal Conformity to the moral Precepts thereof, wou'd make this now miſerable Earth, a very Heaven
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005706_0004_1026C8D491E25A98"/>for Pleaſure and Delight. All its Leſſons are grand and noble, infinitely ſuperiour to the moſt refined Maxims of an <hi>Epictetus</hi> or a <hi>Seneca.</hi> So yonder Sun outvies the leſſer Stars, and when it ſends forth it's more radiant Beams, they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Numberleſs admirable Rules for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of our Conduct in the World, ſo as to be Ornaments to Society, and Bleſſings to our Fellow-Creatures, are ſcattered in the ſacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Among them all, none more worthy of our Notice than thoſe which plead for and enjoin a Spirit of Generoſity and Diſintereſtedneſs. Thus God by the Apoſtle commands, Phil. 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>In Lowlineſs of Mind, let each eſteem other better than themſelves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man on the Things of others. Let this Mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> When that divine Redeemer cloathed himſelf with humane Fleſh, Angels proclaim'd the joyful News in that ſurpriſing Language, <hi>Unto you,</hi> for you, <hi>is born this Day, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>the Saviour, who is the Chriſt, the Lord.</hi> Jeſus was born <hi>for us.</hi> His very Birth was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for <hi>our</hi> Benefit. 'Tis alſo true, no Man comes into the World for himſelf. We are born for God, for the Laws, for our Neighbours, for our Country. No One of us is independant. No One of us has an abſolute and ſovereign Right over himſelf. When we are born, the Laws, the Common-Wealth, our Friends may ſay, <hi>To us, for us,</hi> he is born. This is a Truth plainly taught by the Light of Nature. Accordingly, ancient Hiſtory informs us of whole Nations who were
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005706_0005_1026C8D769858058"/>inſtructed from their Infancy to look upon the Welfare of their Country as the grand Deſign of their Life, and the End of all their Labours; nor did their Tutors fail to teach them, that in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe there were exalted Seats for thoſe, who had contributed to the Glory and Grandeur of their Country. Train'd up in ſuch noble Sentiments, many a brave Soul carried this Virtue of Love to their Country to a ſublime Pitch, and thus have immortaliz'd their Names among Mankind. While Time and Days ſhall endure, the generous and the heroic Part of our Race, will revere the Names of a <hi>Codrus,</hi> a <hi>Camillus,</hi> a <hi>Regulus,</hi> and many others, who greatly ſacrific'd their Lives for the Good of their Country.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the divine Being, Chriſtianity is not deſtitute of Heroes. The ſacred Oracles furniſh us with <hi>Inſtances</hi> of true Bravery, after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us what true Bravery is. There we meet with a <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe flaming Love to his Country, carried him thro' innumerable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and has made his Name renowned in the Church of Chriſt thro' all Generations. This <hi>Moſes</hi> is the Hero, whoſe Character we are now to lay before you, and in him give you an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a noble Patriot, a true Friend to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Whatever can aggrandiſe humane Nature, whatever can add a charming Luſtre to One in a publick Station, is to be found in <hi>Moſes.</hi> This we ſhall now briefly lay before you for your Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to draw forth your Praiſes to God who raiſes up many, many a <hi>Moſes,</hi> even in theſe ſinful Days.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005706_0006_1026C8DA6023E3D8"/>1. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of ſtrict <hi>Devotion.</hi> His Prayers, oh how frequent, how fervent, how ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious! Take this One Inſtance of his prevalent Applications to the God of all Grace. When he ſees that the Lord is angry with his People, and juſt going to ſtrike the fatal Blow, his Love to his Country ſets him upon praying, and he prays with ſuch a flaming Zeal, that God repents him of the Evil which he tho't to do unto them. See the Account in our Context, <hi>v.</hi> 7,—12. What did <hi>Abraham</hi> for that City, which ſerved as a Place of Refuge for Part of his Family, when God threatens them with utter Deſtruction? His Zeal ſets him a praying, and he addreſſes God in that forcible Language, Gen. 18. <hi>Wilt thou, Lord, deſtroy the Righteous with the Wicked? Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there ſhall be found in the City, fifty, forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, yea, ten righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wilt thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t ſpare the Place for their Sakes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Devotion we ſee a good Patriot. All our Concerns, all our Undertakings, muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Bleſſing of Heaven, by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayer. Far, far from us be the impious Thought, that we have no need of the Aſſiſtance of Heaven in our warlike Engagements, and that our Armies and Fleets are ſufficient of themſelves for gaining the Victory. 'Tis falſe Heroiſm, nay, 'tis Madneſs, to truſt in our own Bow, and to ſay, that our own Sword ſhall ſave us: Negligent of the moſt High, careleſs of engaging his Favour upon our Knees—Never call him a Friend to his Country, who is not a Man of Prayer, and who delights not in pouring out his Supplications
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005706_0007_1026C8DD2ED11F68"/>to the Governour of the Univerſe for Succeſs in every lawful Enterprize. Thy Walls, O <hi>Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> ſhall ſtand to the lateſt Generations [may they ſtand the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation] an ungainſayable Proof, that the watchful Eye of God's Providence is over the Righteous, and his Ear attentive to their ardent Cries. Infidelity ſhall ſtop it's Mouth, or humbly acknowledge, that there is a God in the Heavens who hears Prayer, and thro' Jeſus, the only Mediator, will anſwer the Requeſts of his Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man ſet for <hi>Reformation</hi> To a flaming Devotion, he join'd a Spirit of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When he once went forth to viſit his Brethren, and ſaw two <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſinfully ſtriving together, he ſaid to him that did the Wrong, <hi>Wherefore ſmiteſt thou thy Follow?</hi> Exod. 2.13. He would fain rectify whatever was amiſs among his Countrymen. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> found the Crimes of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to exceed their Miſeries, he immediately ſtrives to bring about a Reformation. He baniſhed from the Land, griping Uſury, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Oppreſſion, Prophanation of the Sabbath, and mixt Marriages with the idolatrous Heathen; and by his own Example taught them Charity and Generoſity towards the Poor. What ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to rend the Heaven with our Cries for Mercy and Help, if we will hold faſt our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Has not the God of Truth ſpoken in his Vengeance, ſaying, <hi>When ye ſpread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, your Hands
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005706_0008_1026C8E01049E818"/>are full of Blood,</hi> Iſai. 1.15. What ſigniſies it to raiſe Armies and ſit out Fleets, if they conſiſt of none but the Vile, Men who are perpetually vomiting out their Blaſphemies againſt Heaven, and waging open War with the Lord of Hoſts. What ſignify Laws of Policy, if the Laws of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are trampled under Feet; if God's Sabbaths are violated, if his Name is profaned, if his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is flouted at? What ſignifies it to enter into Alliances with earthly Princes, if we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the God of Heaven? In a Word, What ſignify good Politicks if we are bad Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, or Engliſh Bravery in our Breaſts, if our Hearts are uncircumcis'd to fear the Lord of Hoſts? The Soldier ſhould, like <hi>David,</hi> be a Man of God, as well as a Man of War! Soldiers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for Death by an anticipated Repentance, will fight with Courage, and meet Dangers with Intrepidity: But, alas, when Soldiers carry about with them a guilty Conſcience, when by the Blaze of Cannon they view the eternal Flames of Hell, and ſee the Horrors of Damnation ſucceeding the Horrors of an Engagement, they uſually fight with Reluctance, and ſtrive to ſkreen themſelves from future Miſery by flying from preſent Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of great <hi>Mortification.</hi> The Severities of Faſting he was well acquainted with. When God cammanded him to ſanctify the People for the giving forth the Law to them, we read, that he ſanctify'd them for three Days together, that is, by a ſolemn Faſt, and an entire Abſtinence even from the lawful Pleaſures of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005706_0009_1026C8E19552D4F0"/>Life; for, he ſuffered not an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to come near his Conſort during the three Days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.14, 15. When <hi>Eſther</hi> was reſolved to ſacrifice her All, for the Deliverance of her beloved Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhe gives that Commiſſion to <hi>Mordecai, Go, gather together all the Jews that are preſent in</hi> Shuſhan, <hi>and faſt ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three Days, Night nor Day: I alſo and my Maidens will faſt likewiſe, and ſo will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law; and if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> Eſth. 4.16. Far be it from us to abandon our ſelves to Mirth and Jollity, when the Liberties of our Country are in a totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, and the State is threatned with the Blows of Heaven. Woe, Woe, ten thouſand Woes to him, that is not grieved at the Afflictions of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that can meditate on the dying Groans of the brave Soldier, expiring in the Cauſe of Liberty and Virtue, without the Emotions of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion! The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall reſent the Injury, and puniſh the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal with a Vengeance. Attend to his own Words, in Iſai. 22.12. <hi>In that Day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to Weeping and to Mourning, and to Baldneſs, and to girding with Sackeloth: And behold, Joy and Gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Fleſh and drinking Wine; and ye ſaid, Let us eat and drink, for To-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of Hoſts, Surely this Iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till ye die, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> The Zeal of a good Patriot will incline him to join with the ſolemn Aſſemblies of <hi>Zion,</hi> when the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005706_0010_1026C8E4D22C7F10"/>Trumpet is blown, a Faſt ſanctified, and the Prieſts of the Lord addreſs him, weeping, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach, that the Heathen ſhould rule over them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of profound <hi>Prudence.</hi> When he was informed by God, that he muſt go to the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and demand a Permiſſion for the Iſraelitiſh Nation to depart his Land, he modeſtly declines the Service, from a Fear that he was not equal to it. <hi>Oh my Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſend I pray thee by the Hand of him, whom thou wilt ſend;</hi> that is, by ſome Perſon more fit for the Buſineſs than I am, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.13. And in all his Meſſages to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> you ſee a Spirit of Prudence and Caution accompanying his whole Carriage: But eſpecially, what admirable Prudence, as well as Faith, does he diſcover, when to ſays to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> upon Notice given him that <hi>Amalek</hi> was come forth to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as in Exod. 17.9. <hi>Chuſe us out Men, and go out, fight with</hi> Amalek: <hi>Tomorrow I will ſtand upon the Top of the Hill with the Rod of God in my Hand.</hi> The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prudence you obſerve in that excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when his Nation was in great Diſtreſs. No Language can equal his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his wiſe Conduct. <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.12, 13, 15, 16. I aroſe <hi>in the Night,</hi> I and ſome few Men with me, neither told I any Man what God had put in my Heart to do at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And I went out <hi>by Night,</hi> by the Gate of the Valley, and view'd the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which were broken down,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005706_0011_1026C8E8B10BFFF0"/>and the Gates thereof which were conſumed by Fire. Then I went up <hi>in the Night</hi> by the Brook and viewed the Wall, and turned back and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Gate of the Valley, and ſo returned. And the Rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did. Such Governours, ſuch Officers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Good-Wiſhes and the Thanks of the whole Commonwealth. They are a rich Preſent from Heaven. When they are taken away, and Men of an oppoſite Character are put in their Room, 'tis a Token of God's Indignation againſt a People. Sad was the Condition, when God ſaid, as in Iſai. 3.12. <hi>As for my People, Children are their Oppreſſors, and Women rule over them: Oh my People, they which lead ye cauſe ye to err, and deſtroy the Way of thy Paths.</hi> Wiſdom was the firſt Favour which <hi>Solomon</hi> requeſted of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he aſcended the Throne, and Wiſdom is that Virtue, whoſe Praiſes he has ſung in that inimitable Strain, Prov. 8.15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> One Way, whereby ancient <hi>Rome</hi> roſe to its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Glory was this: They kept at the utmoſt Diſtance from falſe Heroiſm, inſomuch that they equally abhorr'd a raſh Commander as a cowardly One; and they had an inſurmountable Averſion for military Deceit and Trickiſhneſs, ſo that when One of their Generals <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of admirable <hi>Watchfulneſs.</hi> By means of his wakeful Temper, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably well fitted for a publick Station. When he was commanded of God to deliver his Meſſages to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> reſpecting the Safety of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Ruin of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Nation, we find that he roſe up <hi>early in the Morning</hi> to do as the Lord had commanded him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. An idle, indolent, unactive Man is altogether unfit for a Poſt, either in the Magiſtracy or the Miniſtry, the Fleet or the Army. It was an excellent Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that renowned Monarch <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> That an Emperor ought to die <hi>ſtanding.</hi> His whole Life was a charming Coment on this Text, and <hi>Rome</hi> was more indebted to him for his Vigilance, than to any other of her Generals. An Officer ſhould be perpetually upon the Look-Out. The common Rules of Oeconomy muſt ſometimes be leap'd over by him. Thoſe trifling Regularities, thoſe Hours appointed for Sleep, for Meals, for innocent Recreations; he muſt ſometimes diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them. Order it ſelf does ſometimes require that a Man ſhould keep no Order. We ſee it in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> When his Country lay deſolate and expoſed, he was indefatigable in his Endeavours for its Welfare. The Drought conſum'd him by Day, and the Cold by Night, and his Sleep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his Eyes. He goes from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Babylon:</hi> From

               <hi>Shuſhan</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan.</hi> He paſſes whole Days and Nights on Horſeback, ever watchful; conſtantly devoted to the Welfare of his Country. What a Diſgrace to a Commander, and what a Miſchief to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when an Enemy enter their Trenches, or invade their Camp, while they are buried in Sleep and Wine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of ſteady <hi>Courage.</hi> When he appears in the Character of the General of an Army, or in the Character of a Meſſenger of God, he gives remarkable Proofs of his Reſolution and Valour. The firſt Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> witneſſes of him, that he was mighty in Words and in Deeds, that is to ſay, He was a fine Speaker, and a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Soldier, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.22. Never did a Mortal ſhew firmer Courage than <hi>Moſes</hi> in all the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which he delivered to that proud, haughty, cruel Monarch, who filled the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Throne in his Day. And as for his Courage in War, if we may believe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Army againſt the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> play'd the Man in the Field, defeated the Enemy, and obtain'd a glorious Conqueſt over them. Such an one alſo was <hi>David,</hi> who in the Day of Battle never fear'd the Face of a Foe; and who in the Court practic'd the heroic Reſolution which he took when he aſcended the Throne, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pſal. 101.5, 6. <hi>Whoſo privily ſlandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: Him that hath an high Look and a proud Heart will I not ſuffer. Mine Eyes ſhall be upon the Faithful of the Land,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005706_0014_1026C8F0097CA278"/>that he may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he ſhall ſerve me.</hi> Vain is Prudence, vain is Watchfulneſs, where Courage is wanting. By an undaunted Courage it was, that ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> compos'd of three Thouſand Inhabitants in the Beginning, puſh'd their Conqueſts to the Extremities of the known World, in leſs than ſix hundred Years. And ſhall the Diſciples of the Son of God, for whom he has merited eternal Honours in Heaven; ſhall they flinch, when Cannon roar, and Bullets fly? God forbid.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finally, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man of perfect <hi>Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs.</hi> His noble Soul ſcorn'd the trifling Pleaſures, Wealth and Dignities which baſe World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings breathe after and purſue inceſſantly. <hi>Moſes</hi> is the renowned Patriot concerning whom the Apoſtle witneſſes, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. that <hi>when he was come to Years, he refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon; eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures in</hi> Egypt. Nay, ſo open, ſo generous, ſo great was his Diſpoſition of Mind, that when the divine Being made him that Offer, <hi>I will make of Thee a great Nation, if thou wilt let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that I may conſume them;</hi>—when God try'd him with this Offer, he paſſes it over in Silence; but generouſly adds, <hi>Remember</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy Servants, to whom thou ſwareſt by thine own Self, and ſaidſt unto them, I will multiply
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005706_0015_1026C8F42873F118"/>your Seed as the Stars of Heaven; and all this Land that I have ſpoken of, will I give unto your Seed, and they ſhall inherit it for ever.</hi> 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a covetous, greedy Man ſhould be a great Man. A Man that has not a generous Soul, never can fill up any of the Relations of Life in a becoming Manner. What think you of a covetous Father, that is afraid to ſpend his Caſh in the Education of his Children? What think you of a covetous Son, that won't relieve his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Parents in their decrepid Years? What think you of a covetous Merchant, that will ſqueeze even to Cheating? What think you of a covetous Soldier, that can't be content with his Wages? And what think you of a covetous Officer, that will ſacrifice his Men of fill his own Pockets? A good Commonwealth's Man muſt have an open Soul. One Step by which the <hi>Perſians</hi> of Old roſe to that Degree of Splendor ſo renowned in Hiſtory, was their Generoſity; that Virtue which always inclined them to ſhew Favour to their conquer'd Enemies, and to leave them all the Marks of their ancient Grandeur. We now paſs to the IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p>Let us bleſs God who raiſes up ſo many worthy Patriots in this our <hi>New-Engliſh Iſrael,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtructed us in the Road to true Glory. Our Praiſes are due to the divine Being, who gives us more Light to know, and Strength to practice the Virtues which conſtitute real Greatneſs, than ever he granted to the ancient Monarchies
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005706_0016_1026C8F5AC035968"/>of the heathen World. Their Knowledge of them was but ſuperficial, mixt, confuſed; and as they err'd in Religion, they neceſſarily err'd in Politicks, many a Time. But thanks to the God of all our Mercies, he has plac'd at the Head of our Councils the moſt perfect Lawgiver that ever held the Reins of Government, even Jeſus, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords. This divine Legiſlator has carried the Ideas of every Virtue to the higheſt Pitch: That Generoſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies, that Contempt of Life, that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for noble Exploits, that Scorn of falſe Honour, that Devotedneſs to the publick Service, and thoſe other Virtues which render Antiquity venerable. Theſe Virtues we are as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with as any People on Earth; and, God be praiſed, we have ſeen our Land full of Men, who nobly dared to practice them, in the late Times of Danger and Diſtreſs. How forward have our gallant Country-Men been to ſerve the Publick! How prodigal of their Lives for the Intereſts of the Commonwealth! Not many Months are paſt, ſince we humbled our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, lay low at his Footſtool for our Crimes, and with utmoſt Earneſtneſs of Soul, begged his Favour and Protection. Kind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lent a favourable Ear to the Requeſts of his People, and has crowned their Fleet and Army with Victory and Succeſs. The Great and the Good, the Steady and the Brave, influenc'd by the God from whom deſcends every good and perfect Gift, leaped upon the Shore of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, drove them before them, and went on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005706_0017_102692B574B2D070"/>Wonders from Day to Day, 'till they obtained all that generous Engliſhmen could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Wherefore, let us go on to practice the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Virtues of the chriſtian Religion. Then will our Happineſs be as compleat, as an earthly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs may juſtly be expected. The great Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah has already manifeſted the Truth of this; he has proved it to a Demonſtration. The Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is, the Walls of <hi>Louiſbourg.</hi> 'Tis true, our Victory is a mingled Victory. In one Part of this Land we view an aged Father mourning over a valiant Son, ſlain in the Field of Battle: In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part, we view a tender Conſort, bewailing the Loſs of a gallant Huſband, that breath'd his Soul into the Arms of Angels in a Trench.— They died bravely.—But, ah me, a mingled Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory proves a mingled Righteouſneſs. Yet after all, the Victory is our's, the Conqueſt is our's: And, to you, our generous Hearers, we give Joy in the Reduction of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> while to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone belongs the Praiſe. To him is the Glory due, who led us on from Step to Step, 'till he crowned our brave Troops with Laurels ſuperior to thoſe of an <hi>Alexander</hi> or a <hi>Caeſar.</hi> To him is the Glory due, who wafted them in Safety over the boiſterous Seas. To him is the Glory due, who animated them with a Courage aſtoniſhing to the Beholder, and incredible to the Hearer. To him is the Glory due, who ſafeguarded them from Harms, when every Ear was deafned with the Noiſe of Cannon, and every Eye intent on Bombs blazing in the Air. To him is the Glory due, who led them victorious into the almoſt impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005706_0018_1026C8FCC4C5C958"/>Fortreſs of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> and has there lodg'd them ſafe from all Annoyance. Let then every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Heart rejoice in God our Saviour, and give thanks at the Remembrance of his miraculous Goodneſs. But, is it only the Calves of our Lips that we are to offer to our kind Benefactor? Shall we think it ſufficient, that our Tongue proclaim his Bounty? No, there is the Tribute of an holy Life due unto him; a Life devoted to his Honour; a Life ſpent in a ſtudious Conformity to his holy Will, and in the Promotion of his Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind. If ſuch a Life be not hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward found with us, the Walls of <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> ſhall teſtify againſt us, and proclaim our Ingratitude to all the Earth; Ingratitude, the baſeſt of Vices, the blackeſt of Crimes. Every Stone ſhall have a Voice, and cry aloud, ſaying, Did not the God hearing Prayer, lend a gracious Ear to all your Requeſts, and grant the Petitions which you were conſcious included nothing leſs than Miracles? And do you thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and unwiſe? Well then, from this Day, Righteouſneſs ſhall be practis'd by us, manly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhall adorn our Converſation, and every one merit the Character of a ſteady Patriot and a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Hero. Thus ſhall we go on cheerful in the Road which leads to the unfading Honours and the immortal Glories of the heavenly World; into which God grant us e'er long an open Admiſſion, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, to whom be aſcribed the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, henceforth and forevermore, <hi>Amen</hi> and</p>
