            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He then took it to his papa, and aſked him to be ſo good as to mend it for him; but it was ſo much broke, that his papa could not mend it. The little boy, when he found that he had quite

For thoſe who when they are young, will be croſs and naughty, ſeldom are good or kind when they are grown up: for this reaſon, all little boys and girls who wiſh to be happy and have their friends love them, ſhould take great pains to be good whilſt they are little, or elſe may be they will never be good as long as they live. <hi>Dolly Pink</hi> was wiſe enough to think ſo, and ſhe knew the only way to make her papa and mamma, and all her friends love her, was to be good, and do as ſhe was bid. So ſhe always
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021924_0013_0FB5FA11F723F398"/>tried to pleaſe them, and did not cauſe them to ſpeak to her more than once for the ſame thing.

Or if ſhe climbed up into the windows or chairs, and <figure/> they ſaid, Get down, <hi>Dolly,</hi> don't do ſo, my love; ſhe got down as faſt as ſhe could, and did not clamber any more. She never pouted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021924_0014_0FB5FA18798D6DD0"/>or looked croſs when ſhe was bid to do what ſhe did not like: for, like a wiſe and good child, ſhe thought her friends knew what was right better than ſhe did.

I am ſure I am much obliged to them for it, and I will try and do what they ſay is right, for they know much the beſt. In this way ſhe uſed to think and talk, and ſo every body loved her dearly, and tried all they could to pleaſe and make her happy. And when ſhe was a woman, ſhe was a very wiſe and good one, and knew how to teach and make her own little boys and girls good; and every body that ſaw her loved her, and would do any thing they could to pleaſe her.

He was very fond of fruit and cakes, (as moſt children are) but if any body ever gave him any, he would never eat one mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful till he had given ſome to all his ſiſters; and if they did not chuſe any when he was going to eat it, he ſaved ſome for them, till ſome time when they would like it better. He was very fond of dogs, and cats, and birds; horſes too he liked much; but he was too little to have an horſe, or ever to go into the ſtable, unleſs his papa took him in his arms.

               <p>TWO little birds once before they were ſtrong enough to fly, got upon the edge of the neſt, and tumbled from the top of an high tree down to the ground. A little boy who was walking with his mamma ſaw them fall, and aſked her if he might have them? Yes, my dear, ſaid ſhe, though I think it is croſs to rob a bird of her young ones, yet as theſe have fallen down, and cannot get into their neſt again, you may pick them up, and carry them home, and take great care of them. Little <hi>James,</hi> as ſoon as he had leave, ran to them and picked them both up very ſoftly, that he might not hurt them. When he got home, he put them into a cage, and fed them
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021924_0018_0FB5FA29DB6E4338"/>very often with bread, and rape, and hemp feeds. But I ſuppoſe they had not been uſed to ſuch food, and it made them ſick; (for nobody can feed young birds ſo well as their own mothers) and after three days one of them died. <hi>James</hi> was ſorry that it was dead, but he ſtill took great care of the other; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had had it two or three weeks, it began to feed itſelf; it was a goldfinch, and grew ſo tame, that it would ſet upon his finger and <figure/>

It eat out of his hand, and uſed to ſit upon his ſhoulder and the top of his head; indeed it never ſeemed to be ſo well pleaſed, as when ſtanding or ſitting upon little <hi>James:</hi> and he was ſo kind to it, that it had great reaſon to be fond of him. He uſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to leave the cage door open, that Dick might hop about the room when he pleaſed; and when he had been out as long as he liked, he flew into his cage again; and then <hi>James</hi> uſed to ſhut the door to keep him ſafe. But one day he went to play with ſome boys, and forgot to ſhut the door, and while he was gone, the cat got into the room where the cage hung; and the bird did not know the cat would hurt him, and flew out to the ground. But puſs did not let it long ſtay there, for ſhe ran to it as ſoon as ſhe ſaw it, and eat it up in a minute. When poor <hi>James</hi> came back from play, he went to give his bird ſome bread; and when he did not ſee it in the cage, he.looked all round the room for it, and called Dick! Dick! all the time. He was much ſurpriſed that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021924_0020_0FB5FA2CC5FA1338"/>Dick did not come to him when he called: at laſt under one of the chairs, he ſaw ſome of its feathers; ſo he ſtooped down to look <figure/> at them, and there he ſaw the cat licking her lips, and ſome feathers ſticking round her mouth; then he gueſſed what was become of his dear bird, and he could not help crying. He ran up ſtairs and told his mamma of his loſs. I am very ſorry, ſaid ſhe, for it was a

How could you be ſo careleſs as to leave the cage door open when you went out of the room? It is you that have been the cauſe of its death; for had you taken care and done as you ſhould do, it could not have got out, nor could the cat have killed it. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, he was very ſorry for what he had done, and at his being the cauſe of its death; but, ſaid he, I did not <hi>think</hi> about it.

               <p>THERE was a little boy, who was ſo ſilly as to be afraid of dogs; and if he met one as he was walking, he would run away, and ſcream as if he had been much hurt. One day he was taking a walk with his brother;

The dog thinking he was at play with him, ran after him, and caught hold of the flap of his coat, and ſhook it about, yelping and making that growling noiſe dogs do when they are at play. This frightened <hi>Joe</hi> ſo much, that he did not know what he was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021924_0023_0FB5FA3937C01840"/>about, or where he was going, but ſcreaming as loud as he could ſhriek, he ran, not ſeeing where he went, into a pond. His brother <hi>Charles,</hi> all the time he ran, called after him to ſtop. Pray <hi>Joe,</hi> ſaid he, ſtop! the dog won't hurt you! <hi>indeed</hi> he won't! he is only in play, pray ſtop till I can come to you! But <hi>Joe</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not hear, or would not mind, and ſo did not ſtop till he fell into the pond. When <hi>Charles</hi> ſaw him fall, he was as much diſtreſſed as <hi>Joe</hi> had been by the dog, and ran to him as faſt as he could, to try to get him out. But when he came to the pond, he found he could give him no help; for the water did not come up to the edge of the ground he ſtood upon, but was down a great way, ſo that he was quite out of <hi>Charles</hi>'s reach, and was almoſt ſunk out of ſight. Poor <hi>Charles</hi> did not know what to do. If he ſtaid with him, he could not help him, and if he went, he feared he would be drowned before he could fetch any body to him. At laſt he thought he would jump into the water, and try what he could do to get him out: and juſt as he had pulled off his coat
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021924_0024_0FB5FA3D939F9710"/>to go in, a man came by, and aſked him what he was going to do? O! ſaid he, (crying ſo the man could ſcarce make out what he ſaid) my brother! my brother <hi>Joe</hi> has fallen into the pond, and I am going to try to help him! Pough! ſaid the man, you cannot help him, child; you will both be drowned, you may be ſure, if you go in. I will fetch him out for you, ſo pray ſtand ſtill and let me try what I <figure/>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:021924_0025_0FB5FA3ECA9D1638"/>can do. He then very kindly jumped in, and ſoon brought him out in his arms, but he had been ſo long in the water, that he had loſt all his ſenſes, and was almoſt dead. The man took him to the houſe which <hi>Charles</hi> ſhewed him; who walked home by the ſide of him, crying all the way. When they got there, their father thanked the man a great many times for being ſo kind, and gave him ſome money for his trouble. <hi>Joe</hi> was put into a warm bed, and a doctor ſent for, who gave him ſomething to do him good. At laſt he moved, and came to himſelf again; but it was a long while before he was quite well. So he had cauſe to remember running from a dog that would not have hurt him if he had been quiet; or if it had bit him, it would not have done ſo much harm as his fright, and fall, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the water did: but dogs do not bite people if they do not hurt and teaze them. Children ſhould not teaze dogs; but it is very fooliſh to be afraid of them. They need not touch <hi>ſtrange</hi> dogs they meet in the ſtreets; but to run from them is very ſilly indeed.</p>

Her mamma hearing the noiſe, went out to ſee what was the matter, for ſhe thought one of the children muſt have been hurt very much, or ſhe would not have heard ſuch a ſcreaming; but when ſhe found what the truth was, ſhe was quite ſurpriſed, as ſhe did not think her little girl would have been ſo naughty as to cry, and be out of humour, becauſe while playing with her brother, the doll happened to be broken, without his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to let it fall out of his wheel-barrow. "I am quite aſhamed of you, ſaid her mamma, and ſhall take the doll away, and not let you play with it again; and if you do not leave off cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly, ſhall not let you ſtay in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to play with your brother any longer." "No, indeed, Ma'am, replied <hi>Charles,</hi> I did not intend to ſpoil my ſiſter's doll; and as ſhe was running as faſt as I was, I did not.know ſhe did not chuſe the coach ſhould go ſo faſt: beſides, ſhe ſaid her child liked to gallop along, and ſhe wiſhed we could make more haſte; but
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021924_0028_0FB5FA4C8A8D2C00"/>when the doll fell out, ſhe ſaid I went a great deal too faſt, and that I wanted to break her play-things. I am ſure I did not want to ſpoil any of her dolls, and am very ſorry this one is broken, for it was a very pretty one, and when I am a man and have money, I will buy her another; but I wiſh ſhe would come and play, and be merry again now." Little <hi>Sophy</hi> was ſtill ſo ſilly as to cry and be <hi>croſs</hi> becauſe her <figure/>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:021924_0029_0FB5FA4FACD24228"/>doll was broken, though it was as much her own fault as her brother's; ſo when her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma found ſhe would not be good-humoured, though her brother tried to perſuade her to play, ſhe would not let her play in the garden, but took her in doors, and put her with her face in the corner of the room, till ſhe left off crying, grew good-humoured, and told her brother ſhe was ſorry ſhe had been ſo unkind to him, and would never behave ſo again, if he would play with her. So they went to play again; but her mamma told her, ſhe muſt not expect to be treated as if ſhe had been good all day, and theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THERE were two little girls who once lived near each other, and uſed often to play together. They went to the ſame ſchool, and always came home at the ſame time. It <figure/> is rather ſtrange they were ſo fond of each other, for they were not at all alike in their tempers, or way of behaviour; for <hi>Polly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> was a ſad little idle girl, ſhe never minded
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021924_0031_0FB5FA53DE498A40"/>her work, or book, but liked nothing but play; ſhe was five years old, and could not read at all, ſhe could hardly ſpell a word of three let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without a book; nay, one day when ſhe <hi>had</hi> a book, ſhe called T, O, P, <hi>bob,</hi> and R, O, T, ſhe called <hi>rat,</hi> and ſo, many words ſhe called wrong, becauſe ſhe would take no pains to do better. Her mamma bought her many pretty books, to try to make her read them; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtriving to do that, ſhe only tore them to-pieces, and cut out the pictures, without caring what they were about. Her work too ſhe did ſadly, and made it ſo dirty it was not fit to be ſeen.

But her friend <hi>Mary True</hi> did all her work quite in another manner; ſhe ſtitched ſo clean and neat, that when ſhe had done her pocket, the ſilk looked as bright as when it firſt came out of the paper, there were ſome pinks and roſes upon it, and it was very pretty. <hi>Mary</hi> could hem and ſew as well aſ ſtitch, and ſhe was

O! ſhe was a charming girl! and loved by every body who
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021924_0033_0FB5FA5CCA22D170"/>knew her; ſhe always did as ſhe was bid at firſt, without crying or fretting, and went to-bed the moment ſhe was called, after having made a handſome curteſy and wiſhed every body good night. If ever ſhe fell down, or hurt herſelf, ſhe did not ſquall and ſcream as ſome boys and girls do. Every body took notice how good ſhe was, and admired and loved her.</p>
