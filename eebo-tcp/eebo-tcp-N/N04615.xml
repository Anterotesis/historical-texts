         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But not to be too <hi>general,</hi> I ſhall contract and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my Thoughts to one particular Branch of Divine <hi>Providence,</hi> plainly directed to in the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, GOD ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The heavenly <hi>Intelligencies</hi> have the Stile <hi>Mighty</hi> given them in the ſacred Oracles. The great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> declares, That <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will be revealed from Heaven with His Mighty Angels</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. 1: 7.</note>: And <hi>St. John</hi> in his <hi>Viſions,</hi> ſaw a <hi>mighty Angel</hi> make his Deſcent from the upper World<note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 1.</note>: But the <hi>Mighty,</hi> whom the ſacred Penman ſpeaks of, are, in the Context, charged with judging unjuſtly, and accepting Perſons, are exhorted to defend the Poor and Fatherleſs, and do Juſtice to the Afflicted and Needy; and tho' they are called Gods, yet were obliged to die like Men: Characters utterly incompatible to thoſe ſpotleſs and immortal Creatures who ſurround the Throne of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005737_0007_1026D44D065ED818"/>
It is evident then, That by the <hi>Mighty,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of whom GOD is ſaid to ſtand, we are to underſtand <hi>Men</hi> that are concerned in the Government of a People, thoſe that ſuſtain high Poſts, who have the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power in their Hands, who aſſemble and ſit to conſider, determine and reſolve upon what will be for the Relief and Good of particular Perſons, and Bodies and Societies of Men under their Juriſdiction; and the Defence, Peace and Happineſs of the People in general, committed to their Charge: Theſe are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I conceive, whom the Pſalmiſt means, when he ſays, <hi>GOD ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this great Congregation GOD ſtandeth: I ſuppoſe every one will eaſily conceive, that bodily Parts and Poſtures are by no means ſtrictly and properly to be aſcribed unto Him, who is an immenſe <hi>Spirit;</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Difficulty will ſee a <hi>Figure</hi> in the Word. Should we take it ſtrictly and literally it would be to debaſe the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and make Him ſuch an one as ourſelves<note n="h" place="bottom">

            <p>When there is a <hi>Number</hi> concern'd in <hi>Government,</hi> ſetting to deliberate and reſolve upon Meaſures proper to be taken for the Safety, Peace and Advantage of a People, or the Relief and Happineſs of particular Men; the Debates, in ſuch an Aſſembly, are productive of <hi>Light,</hi> which tends to prepare and ripen the Thoughts of <hi>Rulers</hi> for coming to a Determination upon the weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that call for their Conſideration.</p>

            <p n="3">(3.) The great GOD is <hi>preſent</hi> in the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Political Rulers by His <hi>pacifick</hi> Influences.</p>
            <p>When there is Peace among the Heads of a People it proceeds from Him: He is the GOD of Peace. He maketh Peace in the <hi>high Places</hi> of the Earth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it among Rulers: By an <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon the Souls of Men, He creates and upholds a <hi>Harmony</hi> among them. When Love and a good Agreement ſubſiſts among Rulers, in their Eſſays to promote the common Welfare, it is evident, GOD is with them in a gracious Manner. How favourable is He to them, and to thoſe who are under their Authority, when one Spirit and Soul appears to animate this Body of Men; and they are united in employing their <hi>Talents</hi> for the Honour of Him, from whom they have derived them, and the Good of the People, who are their Care and Charge? But on the other Hand, when there are Jars and a Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Rulers, GOD abſents Himſelf from them, as to His <hi>gracious</hi> Preſence; and it bodes ill to this Aſſembly, and has a dark Aſpect upon the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a People.

            <p>They have need of Patience and Reſignation: The Occaſions for the Exerciſe of theſe <hi>Vertues</hi> are many and various. The <hi>Labours and Fatigues</hi> of Government are very heavy, if it be faithfully attended: Sometimes the <hi>Schemes and Projections,</hi> which they form to promote the Publick Good, don't ſucceed according to their Hope and Expectation; the Smiles of Divine Providence don't accompany them, although they are moſt wiſely adapted to bring about the End they are deſign'd for: This Diſappointment calls for their Patience and Reſignation to the Will of GOD. Sometimes their <hi>Way</hi> is ſo dark, encumbered and embaraſſed that they can't proceed with <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind: And let them be never ſo diligent and faithful in ſerving the Publick, many will fault and reproach them: This is too often the Caſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Ruler of rare Accompliſhments, he was a wiſe Man, and learned in all the <hi>Learning of the Egyptians,</hi> and was eminently faithful in his Poſt; yet were there ſome that diſliked him, and were uneaſy under his <hi>Conduct;</hi> their diſcontented Spirits moved them to an Inſurrection againſt this excellent Servant of the LORD; there was a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy to throw off his <hi>Government:</hi> The great Cry was, that <hi>he took too much upon him;</hi> but GOD awfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked theſe bold and wicked <hi>Men.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Congregation of the Mighty</hi> is ſometimes expoſed to great Dangers. There are ſecret Plots and Devices, form'd againſt it by the Enemies of the <hi>Government,</hi> the Execution of which would be fatal and deſtructive to it. When GOD, who is knowing to all the Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and has the wicked Contrivances of Men and Devils under His Obſervation, brings to Light <hi>treaſonable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations</hi> againſt Government, He is <hi>graciouſly</hi> preſent with the Aſſembly of the Mighty: Thus was He <hi>preſent</hi> with the great Convention <hi>of our Nations,</hi> in the <hi>Reign of King</hi> JAMES <hi>the First;</hi> He wonderfully diſcovered the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> when it was ripe for Execution: In the <hi>Mount</hi> was GOD ſeen; the <hi>ſudden</hi> Deſign was in an aſtoniſhing Manner detected, and the wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of it were brought to condign Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Enemies of a <hi>Government</hi> ſeek its Ruin by <hi>open Violence,</hi> by helliſh <hi>Inſurrections</hi> and <hi>Rebellions:</hi> But the ſupreme Ruler of the World, who ſitteth in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> laugheth at their Attempts, maketh them as <hi>Chaff before the Wind; and His Angel chaſeth them.</hi>

This was the Caſe in our Nations, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1715.

And what Reaſon have we to bleſs the great Ruler of the World, for the <hi>Charter-Privileges</hi> which we enjoy?
