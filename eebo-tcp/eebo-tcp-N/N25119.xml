            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>AMELIA: OR THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</head>
                  <p>THE revolutions of government, and the ſubverſions of empire, which have ſwelled the theme of national hiſtorians, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in every age, furniſhed anecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveliſt. The objects of policy or ambition are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, indeed, accompliſhed at the expence of private eaſe and proſperity; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral feſtivity of a ſavage tribe, ſerves to announce ſome recent calamity — the waſte of property, or the fall of families.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the great events of the late war, which produced the ſeparation of the Britiſh empire, and eſtabliſhed the ſovereignty of America, were chequered with ſcenes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſorrow, and the ſucceſs of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of domeſtic life. The lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the widow and the orphan, mingled
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033290_0005_0FF6B77C030D3060"/>
with the ſong of victory; and the ſable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with which the hand of friendſhip cloathed the bier of the gallant MONTGOMERY, caſt a momentary gloom upon the trophies his valour had atchieved.</p>
                  <p>Though the following tale then, does not exhibit the terrible magnificence of warlike operations, or ſcrutinize the principles of national politics, it recites an epiſode that too frequently occurs in the military drama, and contains a hiſtory of female affliction, that claims, from its authenticity, at leaſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the feeling heart. It is the firſt of a ſeries of novels, drawn from the ſame ſource, and intended for public communication, but as the author's object is merely to glean thoſe circumſtances in the progreſs of the revolution, which the hiſtorian has neither leiſure nor diſpoſition to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to produce, from the annals of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, ſomething to entertain, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to improve his readers, the occaſion will yield little to hope from the applauſe of the public, and nothing to dread from its candor.</p>
                  <p>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a reſpectable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the ſtate of New-York. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had rewarded his induſtry in trade with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033290_0006_0FF6B75E95629430"/>
an ample fortune; and his mind, unconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by envy and ambition, freely indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the former character he ſuperintended the education of a ſon and a daughter, left to his ſole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and council were uniformly exerciſed for the relief of the diſtreſſed, and the information of the illiterate.</p>
                  <p>His mercantile intercourſe with Great Britain afforded an early opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the diſpoſition of that kingdom with reſpect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furniſhed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war. The texture of his mind, indeed, was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calm and paſſive, and the ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a life of ſixty years duration, had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eradicated all thoſe paſſions which rouſe men to oppoſition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the gauntlet was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the ſpirit of diſcord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from public clamour, to a ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered cottage, in the interior diſtrict of Long-Iſland; and conſecrating the youthful
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033290_0007_0FF6B780694AD4D0"/>
ardour of his ſon, Honorius, to the ſervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amelia had then attained her ſeventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uniſon with the mildneſs of her aſpect, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite harmony of her ſoul, was reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſymmetry of her perſon. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompliſhment that depends upon tuition; and it was the ſingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our ſex, and the favourite of her own. From ſuch a daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Horatio could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every ſolace of which his generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſuſceptible in a ſeaſon of national calamity; but the din of arms that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted the ſilence of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſts, and the diſaſtrous intelligence which his ſon occaſionally tranſmitted from the ſtandard of the union, ſuperceded the cheerful avocations of the day, and diſpelled the peaceful ſlumbers of the night.</p>
                  <p>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happineſs of Horatio's family, the ſound of artillery announced a battle, and the horſemen who were obſerved gallopping acroſs the grounds, proved that the ſcene of action could not be remote. As ſoon, therefore, as the tumult of hoſtility
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033290_0008_0FF6B7615535F268"/>
had ſubſided, Horatio advanced with his domeſtics, to adminiſter comfort and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the wounded, and to provide a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traverſing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, whoſe exhauſted ſtrength juſt ſerved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the preſervation of this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exertions might be crowned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful ſoldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a ſhort time, a ſtronger pulſe, and a freer reſpiration, afforded a flattering preſage of returning life.</p>
                  <p>Amelia, who had anxiouſly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed ſenſation of horror and pity, the ſpectacle which now accompanied him. She had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen the ſemblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwithſtanding the pallid countenance of the wounded gueſt, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed an elegance of perſon, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural operations of female ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, added ſomething perhaps, to her commiſeration for his misfortunes. When,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033290_0009_0FF6B782AF37A198"/>
however, theſe firſt impreſſions had paſſed away, the tenderneſs of her nature expreſſed itſelf in the moſt aſſiduous actions for his eaſe and accommodation, and the increaſing ſymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</p>
                  <p>The day ſucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had made an ineffectual ſearch for his body among the ſlain, arrived at the cottage, and diſcovered him to be <hi>Doliſcus,</hi> the only ſon and heir of a noble family in England.</p>
                  <p>When Doliſcus had recovered from the ſenſeleſs ſtate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effuſion of blood) the firſt exerciſe of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profeſſion of gratitude. To Horatio he ſpoke in terms of reverence and reſpect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus had been reared in the ſchool of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to conſider virtue only as an obſtacle to pleaſure, and beauty merely as an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the gratification of paſſion. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033290_0010_0FF6B7638A9B1680"/>
ſoon enabled him to diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſolicitude of the artleſs Amelia beyond the dictates of compaſſion and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality; and even before his wounds were cloſed, he conceived the infamous project of violating the purity and tranquility of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exiſtence, and the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of his health. From that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, however, which betrayed her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, while ſhe was herſelf ignorant of their ſource, he anticipated the extremeſt difficulty and danger. To improve the evident predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, required not, indeed, a very ſtrenuous diſplay of his talents and addreſs; but the ſacrifice of her honour (which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable antipathy to the matrimonial engagements made neceſſary to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his purpoſe) was a taſk that he juſtly foreſaw, could be only executed by the deteſtable agency of perfidy and fraud. With theſe views then he readily accepted the ſolicitations of his unſuſpecting hoſt, and even contrived to protract his cure, in order to furniſh a plea for his continuance at the cottage.</p>
                  <p>Amelia, when, at length, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his ſafety were removed, employed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033290_0011_0FF6B78461568FA8"/>
all the charms of muſic and converſation to diſſipate the languor, which his indiſpoſition had produced, and to prevent the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, with which retirement is apt to affect a diſpoſition accuſtomed to the gay and buſy tranſactions of the world. She experienced an unuſual pleaſure, indeed, in the diſcharge of theſe benevolent offices; for in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Doliſcus ſhe inſenſibly forgot the anxiety ſhe was wont to feel for the fate of her abſent brother; and the ſympathy which ſhe had hitherto extended to all the ſufferers of the war, was now monopolized by a ſingle object. Horatio's attachment to the ſolitude of his library, afforded frequent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for this infatuating intercourſe, which the deſigning Doliſcus gradually diverted from general to particular topics—from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon public manners and events, to inſinuations of perſonal eſteem and partiality. Amelia was incapable of deceit, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuſpicion. The energy, but, at the ſame time, the reſpect, with which Doliſcus addreſſed her, was, grateful to her feelings; his rank and fortune entitled him to conſideration, and the ineſtimable favours that had been conferred upon him, offered a ſpecious ſecurity for his truth and fidelity. The acknowledgment of reciprocal regard
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033290_0012_0FF6B76544826758"/>
was, therefore, an eaſy acquiſition, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcus triumphed in the modeſt, but expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit avowal, before Amelia was apprized of its importance and extent. From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, he aſſumed a penſive and dejected carriage. He occaſionally affected to ſtart from the terrors of a deep reverie; and the vivacity of his temper, which had never yielded to the anguiſh of his wounds, ſeemed ſuddenly to have expired under the weight of ſecret and intolerable affliction. Amelia, diſtreſſed and aſtoniſhed, implored an explanation of ſo myſterious a change in his deportment; but his reiterated ſighs, which were for a while, the only anſwers ſhe received, tended equally to encreaſe her curioſity and her ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>At length he undertook to diſcloſe the ſource of his pretended wretchedneſs; and, having prefaced the hypocritical tale with the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of his love and conſtancy, he told the trembling Amelia that, were it even poſſible to diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from an alliance which had been early contracted for him with a noble heireſs of London, ſtill the pride of family, and the ſpirit of loyalty, which governed his father's actions, would oppoſe a union unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the acclamations of dignity, and formed with one whoſe connections were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033290_0013_0FF6B78736F5D300"/>
zealous in the arduous reſiſtence to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Britain. "While he lives," added Doliſcus, "it is not in my power to chooſe the means of happineſs—and yet, as the time approaches when it will be inconſiſtent with the duty and honour of a ſoldier to enjoy any longer the ſociety of Amelia, how can I reflect upon my ſituation without anguiſh and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!" The delicate frame of Amelia was agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſenſations which this picture had excited; and, for the firſt time, ſhe became acquainted with the force of love, and the dread of ſeparation from its object. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcus traced the ſentiments of her heart in the ſilent, but certain indications of her countenance, and when tears had melted the violence of her firſt emotion into a ſoft and ſympathetic grief, the treacherous ſuitor thus proſecuted his ſcheme againſt her peace and innocence.</p>
                  <p>"But it is impoſſible to reſolve upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual miſery! One thing may yet be done to change the ſcene without incurring a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's reſentment and reproach:—can my Amelia conſent to ſacrifice a ſentiment of delicacy, to enſure a life of happineſs?" Her complexion brightened and her eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitively turned towards him. "The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of public marriage" he continued,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033290_0014_0FF6B768095413A8"/>
"neither adds ſtrength or energy to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: for, form is the ſuperfluous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of faſhion, not the reſult of reaſon. The poor peaſant whoſe nuptial contract is only witneſſed by the hallowed miniſter that pronounces it, is as bleſt as the prince who weds in all the oſtentation of a court, and furniſhes an additional feſtival to a giddy nation. My Amelia has ſurely no vanity to gratify with idle pageantry; and as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy of the marriage does not take from its ſanctity, I will venture to propoſe—nay, look not with ſeverity—at the neighbouring farm we may be met by the chaplain of my regiment, and love and honour ſhall record a union, which prudence fetters with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſecrecy."</p>
                  <p>Hope, fear, the ſenſe of decorum, and the incitements of a paſſion pure, but fervent, compleated the painful perturbation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's heart, and in this critical moment of her fate, deprived her of ſpeech and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>Any anxious interval of ſilence took place; but when, at length, the power of expreſſion returned, Amelia urged the duty which ſhe owed to a parent, the ſcandal which the world imputed to clandeſtine marriages, and the fatal conſequences that might ariſe from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033290_0015_0FF6B7896E59EBC8"/>
the obſcurity of the tranſaction. But Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ſteady to his purpoſe, again deprecated the folly of purſuing the ſhadow in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſubſtance, of preſerving fame at the expence of happineſs, and of relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bleſſings of connubial life, for the ſake of its formalities. He ſpoke of Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's inflexible integrity, which could not brook even the appearance of deception, and of his punctilious honour, which could not ſubmit even to the appearance of intruſion upon the domeſtic arrangements of another, as inſurmountable arguments for denying him the knowledge of their union. Finally, he deſcribed, in the warmeſt colouring of paſſion and fancy, the effects of Amelia's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal upon the future tenor of his life, and bathing her hand with his obedient tears, practiſed all the arts of flattery and frenzy. The influence of love ſupercedes every other obligation: Amelia acknowledged its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and yielded to the perſuaſion of the exulting Doliſcus. The marriage ceremony was privately repeated — but how will it excite the indignation of the virtuous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when he underſtands, that the ſacred character of the prieſt was perſonated by a ſoldier whom Doliſcus had ſuborned for this iniquitous occaſion! Ye ſpirits of ſeduction!
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033290_0016_0FF6B76A44542F50"/>
whoſe means are the proſtitution of faith, and whoſe end is the deſtruction of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,—tremble at impending judgment, for "there is no mercy in heaven for ſuch unheard of crimes as theſe!"</p>
                  <p>But a ſhort time had elapſed after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtep, when the mandate of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer obliged Doliſcus to prepare for joining his corps. A ſilent, but pungent ſenſe of indiſcretion, added to the anguiſh which Amelia felt in the hour of ſeparation; and not all his ſtrong aſſurances of inviolable truth and attachment, with the ſoothing proſpect of an honourable avowal of their union, could efface the melancholy impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her mind. The farmer at whoſe houſe the fictitious marriage had been rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was employed to manage their future correſpondence; and Doliſcus, finally, left the cottage with vows of love and gratitude at his lips; but ſchemes of fraud and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in his heart. The ſmall diſtance from New-York, where he was quartered, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it eaſy to maintain an epiſtolary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; which became, during its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the only employment, and the only gratification of Amelia's exiſtence. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, however, exceeded not a few weeks. Doliſcus ſoon aſſumed a formal and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033290_0017_0FF6B78B341DF310"/>
diſpaſſionate ſtyle, and the number of his letters gradually diminiſhed, and every allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that marriage, which was the laſt hope and conſolation of Amelia, he cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided.</p>
                  <p>But an event, that demanded the exerciſe of all her fortitude, now forced itſelf upon Amelia's thoughts. She was pregnant; yet could neither reſort for council and comfort to the father whom ſhe had deceived, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from the lover by whom ſhe had been ſeduced. In the tendereſt and moſt delicate terms ſhe communicated her ſituation to Doliſcus, emphatically called upon him to reſcue her reputation from obloquy, and ſolicitouſly courted his return to the cottage, or, at leaſt, that he would diſcloſe to Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio the ſecret of their union. To prevent any accident, the farmer was prevailed upon to be the bearer of the paper which contained theſe ſentiments, and, on his return pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the following epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>"Gracious God!" exclaimed Amelia, and fell ſenſeleſs to the ground. For a while, a convulſive motion ſhook her frame, but gradually ſubſiding, the flame of life ſeemed to be extinct, and all her terrors at an end. The poor farmer, petrified with horror and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033290_0019_0FF6B78DF3C5A980"/>
amazement, ſtood gazing on the ſcene: but the exertions of his homely ſpouſe, at length, reſtored Amelia to exiſtence and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>It has often been obſerved, that deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency begets boldneſs and enterprize; and the female heart, which is ſuſceptible of the gentleſt ſentiment, is, likewiſe, capable of the nobleſt fortitude. Amelia perceived all the baſeneſs of the deſertion meditated by Doliſcus; ſhe foreſaw all its ruinous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſhe bore; and wiping the uſeleſs tears from her cheek, ſhe reſolved publicly to vindicate her honour, and aſſert her rights. Animated then, with the important purpoſe, ſupported by the preſumption of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus in New-York, ſhe immediately repaired to that city — but alas! he was gone! This diſappointment, however, did not defeat, nor could any obſtacle retard the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her deſign; a ſhip that ſailed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day wafted her to Britain, friendleſs and forlorn.</p>
                  <p>Innumerable difficulties and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were encountered by the inexperienced traveller, but they vaniſhed before the object of her purſuit; and even her entrance into
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033290_0020_0FF6B76EAFC70888"/>
London, that chaos of clamour and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, produced no other ſenſations than thoſe which naturally aroſe from her approach to the dwelling of Doliſcus.</p>
                  <p>Amelia recollected that Doliſcus had often deſcribed the family reſidence to be ſituated in Groſvenor-place; and the ſtage, in which ſhe journeyed, ſtopping in the evening at a public houſe in Picadilly, ſhe determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome viſit. The embarraſſed and anxious manner with which ſhe inquired for his houſe, expoſed her to unjuſt ſurmiſe and ſenſeleſs ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of obſervation, and her purity was ſuperior to inſult.</p>
                  <p>Doliſcus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence, and fortune, which devolved upon him in conſequence of his father's death, had ſwelled his youthful vanity to exceſs, and ſupplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was liſtening in extacy to that ſervile crew, the victim of his arts; the deluded daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the preſervation of his life, ſtood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pauſe of ſome minutes, procured her admiſſion. Her memory recognized the features of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033290_0021_0FF6B6FA67F2BAF8"/>
ſervant that opened the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doliſcus at the cottage ſhe remembered not where or when ſhe had ſeen him.</p>
                  <p>After conſiderable ſolicitation, the porter conſented to call Doliſcus from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conducted Amelia into an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter ſucceeded the delivery of her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and the word <hi>aſſignation,</hi> which was repeated on all ſides, ſeemed to renovate the wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant hoſt, inflamed with champagne, was not diſpleaſed at the imputation; but obſerved, that as a lady was in the caſe, it was unneceſſary to apologize for a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of his friends and wine.</p>
                  <p>At the ſight of that lady, however, Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſtarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and haggard with fatigue and ſorrow; her perſon was oppreſſed with the burthen which ſhe now bore in its laſt ſtage, and her eye, fixed ſteadfaſtly upon him, as he entered the room, beſpoke the complicated anguiſh and indignation of her feelings. Her aſpect ſo changed, and her appearance ſo unexpected, added to the terrors of a guilty conſcience, for a moment, Doliſcus thought the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſupernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having inſpired her with courage, ſhe boldly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033290_0022_0FF6B7108AD358D8"/>
reproached him with his baſeneſs and perfidy, and demanded a public and unequivocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to ſooth and divert her from her purpoſe, in vain to perſuade her to ſilence and delay,—his arts had loſt their wonted influence, while the reſtoration of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured fame and honour abſorbed every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her mind.</p>
                  <p>At length he aſſumed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, "I am not to be thus duped or controuled. I have a ſenſe of pity, indeed, for your indiſcretion, but none for your paſſion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not ſubmit to your frenzy." "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe ſomething to a father's peace, I ſhould deſpiſe to call thee husband."—"<hi>Huſband</hi>" cried Doliſcus, with a ſneer, "Huſband! why truly, I remember a rural maſquerade, at which an honeſt ſoldier, now my humble porter, played the parſon, and you the bluſhing bride —but, pr'ythee, do not talk of huſband."—</p>
                  <p>This diſcovery only was wanting for the conſummation of Amelia's miſery. It was ſudden and fatal as the lightning's blaſt—ſhe funk beneath the ſtroke. A deadly ſtupor
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033290_0023_0FF6B70191683128"/>
ſeized upon her ſenſes, which was ſometimes interrupted with a boiſterous laugh, and ſometimes with a nervous ejaculation.</p>
                  <p>Doliſcus, unaffected by compaſſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, was ſolicitous only to employ this opportunity for Amelia's removal, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed her into a coach, a ſervant was directed to procure lodgings for her, in ſome obſcure quarter of the city. She ſpoke not a word during the tranſaction, but gazing with apparent indifference upon the objects that ſurrounded her, ſhe ſubmitted to be tranſported whither ſoever they pleaſed to conduct her. After winding through a dreary and dirty paſſage in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's, the carriage ſtopped at a hovel which belonged to a relation of the ſervant that accompanied her, and, he having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in a ſhort whiſper the object of his viſit, an old and decrepid beldame led Amelia into a damp and narrow room, whoſe ſcant and tattered furniture proved the wretchedneſs of its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>A premature birth was the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the conflict which had raged in Amelia's mind. She had entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a few moments, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that event gave a turn to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and called her drooping faculties once more into action. Without comfort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033290_0024_0FF6B770E81FC638"/>
aſſiſtance, in the hour of extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs (ſave the officious ſervices of her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated hoſt) ſhe was delivered of a ſon; but the fond ſenſibility of the mother obtained an inſtantaneous ſuperiority over every other conſideration. Though, alas! this ſolitary gratification too, continued not long;—her infant expired after a languid exiſtence of three days, ſerving only to increaſe the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Amelia's portion.</p>
                  <p>Amelia caſt her eye towards heaven as the breath deſerted the body of her babe:—it was not a look of ſupplication, for what had ſhe to hope, or what to dread?—neither did it indicate diſſatisfaction or reproach, for ſhe had early learned the duty of reverence and reſignation— but it was an awful appeal to the throne of grace, for the vindication of the act by which ſhe had reſolved to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her woes. A phial of laudanum, left by a charitable apothecary, who had viſited her in her ſickneſs, preſented the means, and ſhe wanted not the fortitude to employ them. Deliberately, then, pouring the baneful draught into a glaſs, ſhe looked wiſtfully for a while upon the infant corpſe that lay extended on its bed, then bending on her knee, uttered, in a firm and ſolemn voice the melancholy effuſions of her ſoul,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033290_0025_0FF6B6ED22A0DA58"/>
—"Gracious Father! when thy juſtice ſhall pronounce upon the deed which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricates me from the calamities of the world, let thy mercy contemplate the cauſe that urged me to the perpetration. I have been deluded into error; but am free from guilt: I have been ſolicitous to preſerve my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and honour; but am expoſed to infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſhame. The treachery of him to whom I entruſted my fate, has reduced me to deſpair—the declining day of him from whom I received my being, has been cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my indiſcretions, and there is no cure left for the ſorrows that conſume me, but the dark and ſilent grave. Viſit me not then, in thy wrath, oh! Father, but let the exceſs of my ſufferings in this world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the crime which wafts me into the world to come—may thy mercy yield com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to Horatio's heart, and teach Doliſcus the virtue of repentance!"</p>
                  <p>She roſe and lifted the glaſs. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, a noiſe on the ſtairs attracted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a voice anxiouſly pronouncing —"It muſt be ſo!—nay, I will ſee her—" arreſted the dreadful potion in its paſſage to her lips. "It is my Amelia!" exclaimed Horatio, as he haſtily entered the room.</p>
                  <p>Amelia ſtarted, and looked for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033290_0026_0FF6B77322C0B2B0"/>
intently on her father, then ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms, and anxiouſly concealed the ſhame and agony of her countenance, in that boſom, from which alone ſhe now dreaded reproach, or hoped for conſolation. He, too, beheld with horror the ſcene that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his view: he preſſed his deluded, miſerable daughter, to his heart, while a ſtream of tears ran freely down his cheeks; till, at lenghth, his imagination, infected with the objects that ſurrounded him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the dreadful purpoſe of the draught, which had fallen from Amelia's hand, and anticipated a ſorrow, even beyond the extremity of his preſent feelings. When, however, he collected ſufficient courage to reſolve his fears, and it was aſcertained, that the meditated act had not been perpetrated, a momentary ſenſation of joy illuminated his mind, like the tranſient appearance of the moon, amidſt the gloomy horrors of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>When the firſt impreſſions of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interview had paſſed away, Horatio ſpoke comfort to his daughter. "Come my child, the hand of Heaven, that afflicted us with worldly cares, has been ſtretched out to guard you from everlaſting wretchedneſs: —that Providence which proves how vain
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033290_0027_0FF6B6FCA2747EE0"/>
are the purſuits of this life, has beſtowed upon us the means of ſeeking the permanent happineſs of that which is to come. Cheer up, my Amelia! The errors of our conduct may expoſe us to the ſcandal of the world, but it is guilt alone which can violate the inward tranquility of the mind." He then took her hand, and attempted to lead her to the door. "Let us withdraw from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſcene, my love!"—"Look there!" ſaid Amelia, pointing to the corpſe. "Look there!" "Ah!" ſaid Horatio, in a faultering accent-"but it is the will of Heaven!" "Then it is right," cried Amelia—"give the poor victim a little earth—ſir! is it not ſad to think of?—but I am reconciled." She now conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit the room, and was conveyed in a carriage to the inn, at which Horatio (who immediately returned to ſuperintend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of the child) had ſtopped on his arrival.</p>
                  <p>It is now proper to inform the reader, that after Amelia had left the Cottage, and the alarm of her elopement had ſpread around the neighbourhood, the Farmer haſtened to communicate to Horatio the tranſactions which he had witneſſed, and the ſuſpicions which his wife had conceived of Amelia's ſituation. The wretched father ſickened at the tale. But it was the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033290_0028_0FF6B774D0C0CD98"/>
of compaſſion, and not of reſentment, that oppreſſed his ſoul. There are men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo abject in their ſubjection to the opinion of the world, that they can ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice natural affection to artificial pride, and doom to perpetual infamy and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a child, who might be reclaimed from error by parental admonition, or raiſed from deſpair by the foſtering hand of friendſhip. Horatio, however, entertained a different ſenſe: he regarded not the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue as an object of accuſation, but liberally diſtinguiſhed between the crimes and the errors of mankind; and, when he could not alleviate the afflicted, or correct the vicious, he continued to lament, but he forebore to reprobate. "My poor Amelia! how baſely has her innocence been betrayed! —But I muſt follow her:—it may be her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries have diſtracted her, and ſhe has fled, ſhe knows not whither! Come! not a moment ſhall be loſt: I will overtake my child, wherever her ſorrows may lead her: for, if I cannot procure redreſs for her wrongs, I will, at leaſt, adminiſter comfort to her miſeries." Such was the language of Horatio, as ſoon as he could exerciſe the power of utterance. A few days enabled him to arrange his affairs, and having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033290_0029_0FF6B6EA63D9B430"/>
the route which Amelia had taken, he embarked in the firſt veſſel for England. The peculiar object of his voyage, and the nature of his misfortunes, determined him to conceal himſelf from the knowledge of his friends and correſpondents; and a lucky chance diſcovered the wretched abode of his Amelia, the very inſtant of his arrival in London.</p>
                  <p>"Can you tell me, my good hoſt, where Doliſcus the lord—, reſides?" ſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio as he entered the inn. "Marry, that I can," replied the landlord:" his ſervant is juſt now talking with my wife; and if you will ſtep into the next room, perhaps he will ſhow you the way to the houſe." Horatio ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the room door, and, upon looking through a glaſs pannel in the door, he beheld the identical ſervant that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Doliſcus at the Cottage, in eager converſation with the hoſteſs. He pauſed. "She is delivered; but the child is dead:" —ſaid the ſervant. Horatio ſtarted; his imagination eagerly interpreted theſe words to have been ſpoken of Amelia, and he could ſcarcely reſtrain the anguiſh of his feelings from loud exclamation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.—"My lord's conſcience grows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually troubleſome" continued the ſervant;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033290_0030_0FF6B777930DC6F0"/>
"he has ordered me again to inquire after her health, and to provide for the funeral of the child—would ſhe were ſafe in America! for, to be ſure, her father is the beſt old man that ever lived!" "It's well!" cried Horatio. "Did you call, ſir?" ſaid the hoſteſs, opening the door. The ſervant took this opportunity of withdrawing, and Horatio ſilently followed him, at a diſtance, till he arrived at the habitation of Amelia, in the critical moment which enabled him to ſave the life he had given, and to reſcue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded daughter from the deſperate ſin of ſuicide.</p>
                  <p>When Horatio returned to the inn, after diſcharging the laſt ſolemn duties to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted infant, the landlord preſented a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, which a ſervant had juſt left at the bar, and aſked if he was the perſon to whom it was addreſſed. As ſoon as Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio had caſt his eye upon the ſuperſcription, he exclaimed, "What myſtery is this?—A letter left for my ſon Honorius at an inn in London." He eagerly ſeized the paper, and retiring into an adjoining chamber, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed its contents with increaſed amazement and agitation.</p>

                  <p>The voice of Honorius, inquiring for the letter, rouſed Horatio from the reverie into which its contents had plunged him. The honour of his ſon, the villainy of his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, and Amelia's ſufferings, contending with the feelings of the father, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the chriſtian, at laſt prevailed with him to ſuffer the hoſtile interview to which Doliſcus had thus conſented. When therefore Honorius entered the room, and the natural expreſſions of tenderneſs and ſurprize were mutually exchanged, they freely diſcourſed of the lamentable hiſtory of Amelia, and warmly execrated that treachery which had accompliſhed the ruin of her peace and fame. Nor had Doliſcus confined his baſeneſs to this object. The chance of war had thrown Honorius into his power ſhortly after his departure from the cottage, and diſcovering his affinity to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033290_0032_0FF6B71A0E43A450"/>
the perſevering hypocrite artfully inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated to the commander in chief, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius meditated an eſcape, and obtained an order for his impriſonment on board a frigate, which ſailing ſuddenly for England, he was lodged upon his arrival, in the common gaol, appropriated for the confinement of American priſoners. Here it was, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he acquired the information of Amelia's elopement, and heard the cauſe to which it was imputed from the captured maſter of an American veſſel, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been employed in the ſervice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, and had received the communication from the lips of his antient patron, in the firſt moments of his grief. The fate which had unexpectedly led him to Britain, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius now regarded as the miniſter of his revenge. He frowned away the tear which ſtarted at the recital of his ſiſter's wrongs, as if aſhamed to pity 'till he had redreſſed them; and feeling, upon this occaſion, an additional motive for ſoliciting his freedom, he employed the intereſt of Horatio's name, which notwithſtanding the political feuds that prevailed, was ſufficient, at length, to procure his diſcharge upon parol. Having eaſily learned the abode of Doliſcus, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addreſſed that note to him which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033290_0033_0FF6B6F603017090"/>
produced the anſwer delivered to Horatio.</p>
                  <p>When Honorius was informed that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was, at that time, beneath the ſame roof, he expreſſed an eager deſire immediately to embrace his afflicted ſiſter; but Horatio ſtrongly repreſented the impropriety of an interview 'till the event of the aſſignation with Doliſcus was aſcertained, and it was, therefore, agreed for the preſent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his arrival from her knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Abſorbed in the melancholy of her thoughts, Amelia had not uttered a ſyllable ſince the removal from her dreary habitation, but ſuffered the bufy attentions of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the inn, with a liſtleſs-indifference. The agitation of her mind, indeed, had hitherto rendered her inſenſible to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her frame; but exhauſted nature, at length produced the ſymptoms of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fever, and compelled her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, to retire to her bed. When Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio entered the room, the fever had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed, he therefore requeſted the aſſiſtance of a neighbouring phyſician, who pronounced her ſituation to be criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dangerous. In the evening, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual vivacity of her eyes, the incoherence of her ſpeech, and repeated peals of loud and vacant laughter, proved the diſordered
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033290_0034_0FF6B71C43D2D9F0"/>
ſtate of her underſtanding, and increaſed the apprehenſions of her attendants. "A few hours will decide her fate," ſaid the Doctor, as he left the room. "My poor Amelia!" cried Horatio, raiſing her hand to his lips—ſhe looked ſternly at him for a moment, then relaxing the ſeverity of her features, ſhe again burſt into a boiſterous laugh, which terminated in a long and heavy ſigh, as if her ſpirits were exhauſted with the violence of her exertions.</p>
                  <p>The taſk which Horatio had now to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, was difficult indeed! The virtue and fortitude of his ſoul could hardly ſuſtain a conflict againſt the grief and paſſion that conſumed him; whilſt on the one hand, he beheld the diſtraction of his daughter, and, on the other, anticipated the danger of his ſon. He reſolved, however, to keep Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's indiſpoſition a ſecret from Honorius, with whom he arranged the dreadful buſineſs of the morning, and, having fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his bleſſing there, he returned to paſs the night in prayer and watching by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's ſide.</p>
                  <p>Honorius retired to his chamber, but not to reſt. It was not, however, the danger of the approaching combat, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a moment's anxiety or reflection; for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033290_0035_0FF6B720AF7C6EE0"/>
his courage was ſuperior to every conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſonal ſafety. But that courage had hitherto been regulated by a ſenſe of obligation conſiſtent with the precepts of religion he had often exerted it to deſerve the glorious meed of a ſoldier, but he ſcorned to employ it for the contemptible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a duelliſt; it had taught him to ſerve his country, but not to offend his God. "If there is a cauſe which can juſtify the act, is it not mine? 'Tis not a punctilious honour, a viſionary inſult, or a petulant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that influences my conduct:" ſaid Honorius, as he muſed upon the ſubject. "A ſiſter baſely tricked of her innocence and fame, a father ungratefully plundered of his peace and hopes, in the laſt ſtage of an honourable life, and myſelf (but that is little) treacherouſly tranſported to a remote and inhoſpitable land—theſe are my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and Heaven, Doliſcus, be the judge between us!"</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the dawn appeared, Honorius repaired to the place of appointment, where a few minutes before the hour, Doliſcus had likewiſe arrived. He was attended by a friend, but perceiving his antagoniſt alone, he requeſted his companion to withdraw to a diſtant ſpot, from which he might obſerve
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033290_0036_0FF6B722667A24B8"/>
the event, and afford aſſiſtance to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed party.</p>
                  <p>"Once more we meet, Sir," ſaid Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, "upon the buſineſs of death; but that fortune which failed you in your country's cauſe, may be more propitious in your own." "What pity it is," exclaimed Honorius,
<q>that thou ſhould'ſt be a villain, for thou art brave!</q>
"Nay, I come to offer a more ſubſtantial revenge for the wrongs I have committed, than merely ſubmitting to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſo groſs an epithet—take it, Sir,—it is my life." They inſtantly engaged. Doliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus for awhile defended himſelf with ſuperior addreſs, but laying himſelf ſuddenly open to the paſs of his antagoniſt, he received his ſword in the left breaſt, a little below the ſeat of the heart!</p>
                  <p>"Nobly done," cried Doliſcus as he fell, "it is the vengeance of Amelia; and oh! may it ſerve to expiate the crime of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer." His friend who had attentively viewed the ſcene, advanced, when he ſaw him on the ground: and aſſiſted by Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, bore him to a carriage which had been directed to attend within call. He was then conveyed to the houſe of an eminent ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who having ordered the neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, examined the wound, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033290_0037_0FF6B70C9F52B128"/>
pronounced it to be mortal." "Fly, ſir," ſaid Doliſcus, turning to Honorius, at this intelligence—"your country will afford you an aſylum, and protect you from the conſequences of my fate. I beſeech you embitter not my laſt moments with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of your danger—but bear with you to the injured Amelia, the ſtory of my repentance, and, if you dare, aſk her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me." The reſentments of Honorius were ſubdued; he preſented his hand to the dying Doliſcus, in whoſe eye a gleam of joy was kindled at the thought, but it was quickly ſuperceded by a cold and ſudden tremour; he attempted, but in vain, to ſpeak; he ſeized the offered hand; he preſſed it eagerly to his lips, and in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that expreſſive action, he expired.</p>
                  <p>Honorius now haſtened to inform Horatio of this fatal event, and to contrive the means of eſcape. But when he returned to the inn, confuſion and diſtreſs were pictured on every face; a wild, but harmonious, voice, occaſionally broke forth into melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtrains, and the name of Doliſcus was repeatedly pronounced in accents of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion.—"How is it my ſon?" cried Horatio eagerly. "Doliſcus is no more!" replied Honorius. "Would he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033290_0038_0FF6B6F18B405730"/>
had lived another day! I wiſhed not the ruin of his ſoul." "But he repented, ſir." "Ther heaven be merciful!" exclaimed Horatio.</p>
                  <p>Here their converſation was interrupted, by the melodious chauntings of Amelia.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>I'll have none of your flow'rs tho' ſo blooming and ſweet;</l>
                     <l>Their ſcent, it may poiſon, and falſe is their hue;</l>
                     <l>I tell you begone! for I ne'er ſhall forget,</l>
                     <l>That Doliſcus was lovely and treacherous too.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Honorius liſtened attentively to the ſong; it vibrated in his ear, and ſwelled the aching artery of his heart. "Come on!" ſaid Horatio leading him to Amelia's chamber. They found her ſitting on the bed, with a pillow before her, over which ſhe moved her fingers, as if playing on a harpſichord. Their entrance diſturbed her for a moment, but ſhe ſoon reſumed her employment.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>He ſaid and he ſwore he lov'd me true:—was it a lover's part,</l>
                     <l>To ruin good Horatio's peace and break Amelia's heart?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>A heavy ſigh followed theſe lines, which were articulated in a wiſtful and ſympathetic tone, and ſhe ſunk exhauſted on her bed. —In a few minutes, however, ſhe ſtarted
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033290_0039_0FF6B6EF56EB0CD8"/>
from this ſtill and ſilent ſtate, and having gazed with a wild and aching eye around the room, ſhe uttered a loud and piercing cry —it was the awful ſignal of her diſſolution —and her injured ſpirit took its everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flight.</p>
                  <p>The reader will excuſe a minute deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſucceeding ſcenes. The alarm raiſed by the death of Doliſcus compelled Honorius to quicken his departure, and he joined the ſtandard of America a few hours before the battle of Monmouth, in which, for the ſervice of his country, he ſacrificed a life that misfortune had then taught him to conſider of no other uſe or eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>As for the venerable Horatio—having carried with him to the cottage the remains of his darling child, in a melancholy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he conſumes the time; his only buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meditation and prayer; his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation a daily viſit to the monument, which he has raiſed in commemoration of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's fate; and all his conſolation reſting in this aſſurance, that whatever may be the ſufferings of virtue HERE, its portion muſt be happineſs HEREAFTER.</p>

                  <head>HISTORY OF AMELIA, OR MALEVOLENCE DEFEATED.</head>
                  <p>MRS. Winifrid Wormwood was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ruſtie merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, amaſſed an enormous fortune. His family conſiſted of three girls, and Winifrid was the eldeſt: Long before ſhe was twenty, ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with lovers, ſome probably attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſplendid proſpect of her expected portion, and others truly captivated by her perſonal graces; for her perſon was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vivacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an honeſt man; and he might deſerve, indeed, thoſe honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appellations, if it were not a profanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a ſelfiſh ſpirit. He indulged his daughters in many expenſive amuſements, becauſe it flattered his pride; but his heart was engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033290_0041_0FF6B6FED6BAF458"/>
by the proffits of his extenſive traffic: He turned, with the moſt repulſive aſperity, from every propoſal that could lead him to diminiſh his capital, and thought his daughters unreaſonable, if they wiſhed for any permanent ſatisfaction above that of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their father increaſe in opulence and ſplendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their diſeaſed mother a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delicacy of frame, languiſhed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to a ſevere diſappointment in her firſt affection. The more ſprightly Wini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid, whoſe heart was a perfect ſtranger to genuine love, ſurmounted the mortification of ſeeing many ſuitors diſcarded; and by the inſenſate avarice of her father, ſhe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally led into habits of artifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. Poſſeſſing an uncommon ſhare of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhrewd and piercing wit, with the moſt profound hypocriſy, ſhe contrived to pleaſe, and to blind, her plodding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the diſcretion of his daughter, and believed her a miracle of reſerve and prudence, at the very time when ſhe was ſuſpected of ſuch conduct as would have diſqualified her, had it ever been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the rank ſhe now holds in this eſſay.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033290_0042_0FF6B73447D343F0"/>
She was ſaid to have amuſed herſelf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the obſervation of her father; but of the many lovers who ſighed to her in ſecret, not one could tempt her into marriage, and, to the ſurpriſe of the public, the rich heireſs of Mr. Wormwood reached the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven, without changing her name. Juſt as ſhe arrived at this mature ſeaſon of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a buſy part, pleaſed with the idea of leaving a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as a monument of his induſtry, but wanting the ſuperior ſatisfaction, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy eſtabliſhment of a daughter. He gained, however, from the hypocriſy of Winifrid, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamented with a profuſion of tears. She diſtinguiſhed herſelf by diſplaying all the delicate gradations of filial ſorrow; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at a proper time, all the natural gaiety of her temper, which ſhe now had the full opportunity of indulging, being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of a magnificent manſion, within a mile of a populous town, and enabled to enliven it with all the arts of luxury, by inheriting ſuch accumulated wealth, as would ſafely
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033290_0043_0FF6B72527310520"/>
ſupport the utmoſt efforts of provincial ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Miſs Wormwood now expected to ſee every batchelor of figure and conſequence a ſuppliant at her feet; ſhe promiſed to herſelf no little entertainment in ſporting with their addreſſes, without the fear of ſuffering from a tyrannical huſband, as ſhe had learned cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from her father, and had privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to truſt any man with her money; a reſolution the more diſcreet, as ſhe had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from ſo dangerous a maſter! The good-natured town, in whoſe environs the rich Winifrid reſided, very kindly pointed out to her no leſs than twenty lively beaux for her choice; but, to the ſhame or the honour of thoſe gentlemen, they were too timid, or, too honeſt, to make any advances. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her youthful frolics, and the dread of her ſarcaſtic wit, had more power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than her perſon and her wealth had to attract. Paſſing her fiftieth year, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſerious name of miſtreſs, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a ſingle offer of marriage from the period in which ſhe became the poſſeſſor of ſo opulent a fortune.</p>
                  <p>Whether this mortifying diſappointment had given a peculiar aſperity to her temper
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033290_0044_0FF6B73702DC2D80"/>
or whether malevolence was the earlier cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry ſeaſon of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to amuſe herſelf with the moſt ſubtle devices of malicious ingenuity, and to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate every promiſing ſcheme of affection and delight, which ſhe diſcovered in the wide circle of her acquaintance. She ſeemed to be tormented with an inceſſant dread, that youth and beauty might ſecure to themſelves that happineſs, which ſhe found wit and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were unable to beſtow; hence ſhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the moſt piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often inſinuated herſelf into the confidence of many, that ſhe might penetrate all the ſecrets of their love, and privately blaſt its ſucceſs. She was enabled to render herſelf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent ſplendor in which ſhe lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, extraordinary; her mind was never poliſhed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Wormwood ſet little value on any books, excepting thoſe of his counting-houſe; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033290_0045_0FF6B7275B2320D8"/>
duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either leiſure or inclination for a voluntary attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to more improving ſtudies. She read very little, and was acquainted with no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but her own; yet a brilliant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and an uncommon portion of ready wit, ſupplied her with a more alluring fund of converſation, than learning could beſtow. She chiefly recommended herſelf to the young and inexperienced, by the inſinuating charm of the moſt lively ridicule, and by the art of ſeaſoning her diſcourſe with want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton inuendos of ſo ſubtle a nature, that gravity knew not how to object to them: She had the ſingular faculty of throwing ſuch a ſoft and dubious twilight over the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious images, that they captivated curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and attention, without exciting either fear or diſguſt. Her malevolence was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diſguiſed under the maſk of gaiety, and ſhe completely poſſeſſed that plauſibility of malice, ſo difficult to attain, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly recommended in the words of lady Macbeth:</p>
                  <l>"Bear welcome in your eye,</l>
                  <l>"Your hand, your tongue; look like the "innocent flower,</l>
                  <l>"But be the ſerpent under it!"</l>
                  <p>With what ſucceſs ſhe practiſed this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033290_0046_0FF6B739336FA9E0"/>
leſſon, the reader may learn from the following adventure.—</p>
                  <p>It was the cuſtom of Mrs. Wormwood to profeſs the moſt friendly ſolicitude for female youth, and the higheſt admiration of beauty; ſhe wiſhed to be conſidered as their patroneſs, becauſe ſuch an idea afforded her the faireſt opportunities of ſecretly mortifying their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable preſumption. With a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in malice, ſhe firſt encouraged, and afterwards defeated, thoſe amuſing matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial projects, which the young and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful are ſo apt to entertain. The higheſt gratification, which her ingenious malignity could deviſe, conſiſted in torturing ſome lovely inexperienced girl, by playing upon the tender paſſions of an open and unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart.</p>
                  <p>Accident threw within her reach a moſt tempting ſubject for ſuch fiend-like diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the perſon of Amelia Nevil, the daughter of a brave and accompliſhed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who, cloſing a laborious and honourable life in very indigent circumſtances, had left his unfortunate child to the care of his maiden ſiſter. The aunt of Amelia was ſuch an old maid as might alone ſuffice to reſcue the ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhood from ridicule and contempt. She had been attached, in her early days to a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033290_0047_0FF6B715784745B8"/>
gallant youth, who unhappily loſt his own life in preſerving that of his dear friend, her brother: ſhe devoted herſelf to his memory with the moſt tender, unaffected, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable attachment; refuſing ſeveral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous offers of marriage, though her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was ſo narrow, that neceſſity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, juſt before the calamitous event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which made her the only guardian of poor Amelia. This lovely, but unfortunate girl, was turned of fourteen on the death of her father. She found, in the houſe of his ſiſter, the moſt friendly aſylum, and a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe heart and mind made her moſt able and willing to form the character of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature, as ſhe was perſecuted by fortune. The beauty of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was ſo ſtriking, and the charms of her lively underſtanding began to diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo enchanting a manner, that her affectionate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: ſhe gave her the education of a gentlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope, that her various attractions muſt ſupply the abſolute want of fortune, and that ſhe ſhould enjoy the delight of ſeeing her dear Amelia happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033290_0048_0FF6B70ED97FC948"/>
ſettled in marriage, before her death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance.—Heaven diſpoſed it otherwiſe. This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a moſt affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died before Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently deſtitute of every reſource; and expoſed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the loſs of a moſt indulgent protector. A widow lady of her acquaintance very kindly afforded her a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the firſt moments of her diſtreſs, and propoſed to two of her opulent friends, that Amelia ſhould reſide with them by turns, dividing the year between them, and paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four months with each. As ſoon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as ſhe delighted in thoſe oſtentatious acts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent beneficence, which are falſely called charity, ſhe deſired to be admitted among the voluntary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propoſal all the parties aſſented, and it was ſettled, that Amelia ſhould paſs the laſt quarter of every year, as long as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood. This lovely orphan had a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of heart, which rendered her extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grateful for the protection ſhe received
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033290_0049_0FF6B6E6808F5B38"/>
but which made her ſeverely feel all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of dependance. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, preſuming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wounded her ingenuous pride. Her perſon, her mind, her manners were univerſally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife. "Amelia (they cried) is an enchanting creature; but who, in theſe times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, ſupported by charity?" Though this prudential queſtion was never uttered in the preſence of Amelia, ſhe began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its influence, and ſuffered a painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to thoſe friends, by whoſe generoſity ſhe ſubſiſted; ſhe wiſhed, a thouſand times, that her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate aunt, inſtead of cultivating her mind with ſuch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any ſtation of life, where ſhe might have maintained herſelf by her own manual labour: ſhe ſometimes entertained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of making ſome attempt for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſhe once thought of changing her name, and of trying to ſupport herſelf as an actreſs on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her honeſt pride had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033290_0050_0FF6B6F8345A5418"/>
was effectually ſuppreſſed by her modeſty; and ſhe continued to waſte the moſt precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetualy wiſhing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almoſt two years had now elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince the death of her aunt, and without any proſpect of marriage, ſhe was now in her ſecond period of reſidence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's underſtanding was by no means inferior to her other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſhe began to penetrate all the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſguiſe, and to gain a perfect and very painful inſight into the real character of her preſent hoſteſs. This lady had remarked, that when Miſs Nevil reſided with her, her houſe was much more frequented by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, than at any other ſeaſon. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that theſe viſitors often forgot to applaud the ſmart ſayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the ſweet countenance of Amelia; a circumſtance full ſufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the moſt bitter envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood deteſted her lovely gueſt with the moſt implacable virulence; but ſhe had the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular art of diſguiſing her deteſtation in the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033290_0051_0FF6B72992B7D6F0"/>
language of flattery: ſhe underſtood the truth of Pope's maxim,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>"He hurts me moſt who laviſhly commends."</hi> and ſhe therefore made uſe of laviſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, as an inſtrument of malevolence towards Amelia; ſhe inſulted the taſte, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared herſelf convinced, that he was a fool, becauſe he had not choſen that moſt lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman ſhe ſaid, you muſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Amelia; and, as few men chuſe to be driven into wedlock, ſome offers were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevented, by the treacherous vehem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her praiſe. Her malice, however, was not ſufficiently gratified by obſerving that Amelia had no proſpect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, ſhe reſolved to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe this unhappy girl with the hopes of ſuch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a ſudden, all theſe ſplendid hopes into mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deluſion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nelſon, as a perſon whoſe name ſhe might with the greateſt ſafety employ, as the inſtrument of her inſidious deſign, and with the greater chance of ſucceſs, as ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard. Mr. Nelſon was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, having met with very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033290_0052_0FF6B73AE59811B8"/>
events, had contracted a great, but very amiable ſingularity of character:—he was placed early in life, in a very lucrative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſituation, and was on the point of ſettling happily in marriage with a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young lady, when the houſe, in which ſhe reſided, was conſumed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the deſtined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in looſing the object of his ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by ſo ſudden a calamity, loſt for ſome time the uſe of his reaſon; and when his health and ſenſes returned, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the oppreſſion of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had loſt in ſo ſevere a manner, ſuggeſted to his fancy a ſingular plan of benevolence, in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which he recovered a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former ſpirits. This plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſearching for female objects of charity, whoſe diſtreſſes had been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted itſelf with the idea, that in theſe uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033290_0053_0FF6B72BE6033380"/>
of that lovely angel, whoſe mortal beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had periſhed in the flames. Mr. Nelſon frequently viſited a married ſiſter, who was ſettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood reſided. There was alſo, in the ſame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular eſteem. This lady, whoſe name was Melford, had been left in very ſcanty circumſtances on the death of her huſband, and reſided at that time in London, where ſhe had been involved in additional diſtreſs by that calamity, to which the attentive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Nelſon was forever directed: he more than repaired the loſs which ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by fire, and aſſiſted in ſettling her in the neighbourhood of his ſiſter. Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was ſtill the moſt valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent viſits, though ſhe never reſided under her roof. Mr. Nelſon had often ſeen Amelia at the houſe of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politeneſs, whenever he viſited Mrs. Wormwood; a circumſtance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project. She perfectly knew all the ſingular private hiſtory of Mr. Nelſon, and firmly believed, like all the reſt of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but ſhe thought
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033290_0054_0FF6B71349BD7820"/>
it poſſible to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his reſolution; and nothing ſhe ſuppoſed, could more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually mortify her gueſt, than to find herſelf derided for ſo vain an expectation.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to inſinuate, in the moſt artful manner, that Mr. Nelſon was very particular in his civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities to Amelia, magnified all his amiable qualities, and expreſſed the greateſt pleaſure in the proſpect of ſo delightful a match. Theſe petty artifices, however, had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the natural modeſty and diffidence of Amelia; ſhe ſaw nothing that authoriſed ſuch an idea in the uſual politeneſs of a well-bred man of thirty-ſeven; ſhe pitied the misfortune, ſhe admired the elegant and engaging, though ſerious manners, and ſhe revered the virtues of Mr. Nelſon; but, ſuppoſed his mind to be entirely engroſſed, as it really was, by his ſingularly charitable purſuits; ſhe entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous talent of forging any hand that ſhe pleaſed; and her paſſion for miſchief had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her much practice in this treacherous
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033290_0055_0FF6B71E75912E38"/>
art. Having previouſly and ſecretly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Mr. Nelſon to drink tea with her, ſhe wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the moſt perfect imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand. The billet ſaid, that he deſigned himſelf the pleaſure of paſſing that afternoon at the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood, and requeſted the favour of a private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Miſs Nevil in the courſe of the evening, intimating, in the moſt delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her huſband. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia ſhould not receive this billet till juſt before dinner-time, that ſhe might not ſhow it to her friend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect its fallacy before the hour of her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humiliation arrived.</p>
                  <p>Amelia bluſhed in reading the note, and, in the firſt ſurpriſe of unſuſpecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood; who burſt into vehement expreſſions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; congratulated her bluſhing gueſt on the full ſucceſs of her charms, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her own prophetic diſcernment. They ſat down to dinner, but poor Amelia could hardly ſwallow a morſel; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of pleaſure and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. The malicious impoſter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying her confuſion, allowed her no time
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033290_0056_0FF6B7083324F8C8"/>
to compoſe her hurried ſpirits in the ſolitude of her chamber. Some female viſitors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nelſon entered the room. Amelia trembled and bluſhed as he approached her; but ſhe was a little relieved from her embarraſſment by the buſineſs of the tea-table, over which ſhe preſided. Amelia was naturally graceful in every thing ſhe did, but the preſent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her mind gave a temporary awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to all her motions: ſhe committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politeneſs of Mr. Nelſon led him to ſay ſo many kind and graceful things to her on theſe petty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that, inſtead of encreaſing her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, they produced an oppoſite effect, and the tumult of her boſom gradually ſubſided into a calm and compoſed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nelſon, and thought them expreſſive of that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which promiſed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging miſery and dependance for comfort and honor, as the wife of ſo amiable a man, her heart expanded with the moſt innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and gave ſuch an exquiſite radiance to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033290_0057_0FF6B72E1AA165E8"/>
to all her features, that ſhe looked a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood ſaw this improvement of her charms, and, ſickening at the ſight, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce the ſplendor of ſuch inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable beauty, and haſtily terminate the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of her deluded gueſt. She began with a few malicious and ſarcaſtic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of an imaginary lover; but finding theſe remarks produced not the effect ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſhe took an opportunity of whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet ſhe had received was a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and a mere piece of pleaſantry. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia ſhuddered, and turned pale: ſurpriſe, diſappointment, and indignation, conſpired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmoſt power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her boſom was too violent to be diſguiſed. The tears, which ſhe vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuppreſs, burſt forth, and ſhe was obliged to quit the room in very viſible diſorder. Mr. Nelſon expreſſed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; but he was checked in his benevolent inquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who ſaid, on the occaſion, that Miſs Nevil
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033290_0058_0FF6B6F3C4449338"/>
was a very amiable girl, but ſhe had ſome peculiarities of temper, and was apt to put a wrong conſtruction on the innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry of her friends. Mr. Nelſon obſerving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might contribute to reſtore the interrupted harmony of the houſe, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of her ſucceſsful malignity. She found not the perſon whom ſhe was ſo eager to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her chamber, and paſſed there a very miſerable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and ſtill more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which ſhe condemned with that exceſs of ſeverity ſo natural to a delicate mind in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning itſelf. She would have flown for immediate conſolation to her friend, Mrs. Melford, but ſhe had reaſon to believe that lady engaged on a viſit, and ſhe therefore reſolved to take a ſolitary walk for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of compoſing her ſpirits; but neither ſolitude nor exerciſe could reſtore her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, ſhe haſtened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033290_0059_0FF6B7174DFA8D60"/>
confident was, indeed, in her little parlour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſtreſs; and the old lady, with her uſual tenderneſs, exclaimed, "Good heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becauſe," replied Amelia, in a broken voice, and burſting into a freſh ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of tears, "becauſe I am a fool?"—Mrs. Melford began to be moſt ſeriouſly alarmed, and, expreſſing her maternal ſolicitude in the kindeſt manner. Amelia produced the fatal paper—"There," ſays ſhe, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been ſuch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who in her firſt alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was herſelf greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in diſcovering the truth, and ſaid many kind things to conſole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, "that I am fooliſhly in love with Mr. Nelſon, though I think him the moſt pleaſing as well as the moſt excellent of men; and though I confeſs to you, that I ſhould certainly think it a bleſſed lot to find a refuge from the miſery of my preſent dependance, in the arms of ſo benevolent and ſo generous
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033290_0060_0FF6B7057291D8B8"/>
a protector."—"Thoſe arms are now open to receive you," ſaid a voice that was heard before the ſpeaker appeared. Amelia ſtarted at the ſound, and her ſurpriſe was not a little encreaſed in ſeeing Mr. Nelſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who entering the room from an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tranſport of tenderneſs and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine modeſty, was for ſome minutes more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtreſſed by this ſurpriſe, than ſhe had been by her paſt mortification: ſhe was ready to ſink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her ſecret to the man, from whom ſhe would have laboured moſt to conceal it. In the firſt tumult of this delicate confuſion, ſhe ſinks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nelſon with a mixture of reſpect and love, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of encreaſing her diſtreſs, ſeizes one of her hands, and continues to kiſs it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almoſt as much aſtoniſhed, but leſs painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſed than Amelia, beholds this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſcene with that kind of joy which is much more diſpoſed to weep than to ſpeak: —And, while this little party is thus abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſilence, let me haſten to relate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which produced their ſituation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033290_0061_0FF6B7304E646AF0"/>Mr. Nelſon had obſerved the ſarcaſtic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and, as ſoon as he had ended his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable viſit, he haſtened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her ſome little account of what had paſſed, and to concert with her ſome happier plan for the ſupport of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, inſulted orphan. "I am acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ſaid he, "with ſome brave and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy officers, who have ſerved with the father of Miſs Nevil, and often ſpeak of him with reſpect; I am ſure I can raiſe among them a ſubſcription for the maintenance of this tender unfortunate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that ſhall enable her to eſcape from ſuch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a ſervant." Mrs. Melford was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his generoſity; and, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amelia at ſome diſtance, through a bow window, which commanded the ſtreet in which ſhe lived, "thank Heaven," ſhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "here comes my poor child, to hear and bleſs you for the extent of your goodneſs." Nelſon, who delighted moſt in doing good by ſtealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promiſe of ſecrecy: it was the beſt part of his plan, that Amelia ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033290_0062_0FF6B70A6851EE10"/>
never know the perſons to whom ſhe was to owe her independence. "I am ſtiil afraid of you, my worthy old friend," ſaid Nelſon "your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Miſs Nevil ſees me here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night."—"Well," ſaid the delighted old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, "I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not ſtay with me ten min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes; you may amuſe yourſelf, for that time, in my ſpacious garden; I will not ſay you are here; and, as ſoon as the good girl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."— "Admirably ſettled," cried Nelſon; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led into a long ſlip of ground, embelliſhed with the ſweeteſt and leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amuſement to Mrs. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Nelſon, after taking a few turns in this diminutive garden, finding himſelf ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chilled by the air of the evening, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again into the little parlour he had paſſed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely ſlight, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the tender confeſſions of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irreſiſtible impulſe, in the manner already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:033290_0063_0FF6B703C4B3A0E8"/>Mrs. Melford was the firſt who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by their general ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; and ſhe enabled the tender pair, in the proſpect of whoſe union her warm heart exulted, to regain that eaſy and joyous poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their faculties, which they loſt for ſome little time in their embarraſſment. The applauſe of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, ſoon taught the diffident Amelia to think leſs ſeverely of herſelf. The warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Mrs. Melford declared that theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nelſon, "I am moſt willing to allow; but you muſt grant, that Heaven has produced our happineſs by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a ſpirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the torment of its poſſeſſor, I muſt beg, that ſhe may not return, even for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle night, to the houſe of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her ſenſe of paſt obligations, and wiſhed to take a peaceful leave of her patroneſs; but ſhe ſubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nelſon, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when ſhe was united to the man of her heart. Nelſon had the double delight of rewarding
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033290_0064_0FF6B6E44BA37A18"/>
the affection of an angel, and of puniſhing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in perſon to Mrs. Wormwood, his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when the treacherous Old Maid had amuſed herſelf with the hope of deriding her gueſt; whoſe return ſhe was eagerly expecting, in the very moment Nelſon arrived to ſay, that Amelia would return no more.</p>
                  <p>The ſurpriſe and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aroſe almoſt to frenzy; ſhe racked her malicious and inventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated a report for that purpoſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and deſpiſed. Amelia was not only married, but the moſt admired, the moſt beloved, and the happieſt of human beings; an event which preyed ſo inceſſantly on the ſpirit of Mrs. Wormwood, that ſhe fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her miſchievous and unhappy life, a memorable axample, that the moſt artful malignity may ſometimes procure for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its envy, that very happineſs which it labours to prevent!</p>
