            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THE council of England was divided in opinion about the measures to be taken with the queen of Scots. Some members proposed, that as her health was very infirm, her life might be shortened by close confinement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, to avoid any imputation of violence or cruelty, the earl of Leicester proposed that she should be dispatched by poison; but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority insisted on her being put to death by legal process. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a commission was issued for forty peers, with five judges, or the major part of them, to try and pass sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mary, daughter and heir of James the fifth, king of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, commonly called queen of Scots, and dowager of France.</p>
            <p>THIRTY-SIX of these commissioners arriving at the castle of Fotheringay, presented her with a letter from Elizabeth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her to submit to trial for her late conspiracy. Mary perused the letter with great composure; and as she had long foreseen the danger that hung over her, received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that she wondered the queen of England should command her as a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who was an independent sovereign, and a queen like her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. She would never, she said, stoop to any condescension which would lessen her dignity, or prejudice the claims of her posterity. The laws of England, she observed, were unknown to her; she was destitute of counsel; nor could she conceive who were to be her peers, as she had but one equal in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. She added, that instead of enjoying the protection of the laws of England, as she had hoped to obtain, she had been confined in prison ever since her arrival in the kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that she derived neither benefit nor security from them. When the commissioners pressed her to submit to the queen's pleasure</p>

Accordingly a commission was issued for forty peers, with five judges, or the major part of them, to try and pass sentence upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, daughter and heir of James the fifth, king of Scotland, commonly called queen of Scots, and dowager of France.</p>
            <p>THIRTY-SIX of these commissioners arriving at the castle of Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingay, presented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to submit to a trial for her late conspiracy. Mary perused the letter with great composure; and as she had long foreseen the danger that hung over her, received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that she wondered the queen of England should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her as a subject, who was an independent sovereign, and a queen like herself. She would never, she said, stoop to any condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which would lessen her dignity, or prejudice the claims of her posterity. The laws of England, she observed, were unknown to her; she was destitute of counsel; nor could she conceive who were to be her peers, as she had but one equal in the kingdom. She added, that instead of enjoying the protection of the laws of England, as she had hoped to obtain, she had been confined in prison ever since her arrival in the kingdom; so that she derived neither benefit nor securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from them. When the commissioners pressed her to submit to the queen's pleasure, otherwise they would proceed against her as contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, she declared she would rather suffer a thousand deaths, than own herself a subject to any prince on earth. That however she was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vindicate herself in a full and free parliament, as for aught she knew, this meeting of commissioners was devised against her life, on purpose to take it away with a pretext of justice. She exhorted them to consult their own consciences, and to remember that the theatre of the world was much more extensive than that of the kingdom of England. At length the vice-chamberlain Hatton vanquished her objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by representing that she injured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her innocence might be proved to the satisfaction of all mankind. This observation made such an impression upon her, that she agreed to plead, if they would admit and allow her protest, of disallowing all subjection. This, however, they refused; but they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her, by entering it upon record, and thus they proceeded to trial.</p>

            <p>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 3 Especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, know all the Jews, 5 Which knew me from the beginning (if they would testify) that after the most strai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I CANNOT pursue the subject—Rouse, rouse yourself, my Emma. For my sake, let all your fortitude be exerted. We are both young;—there is the same protecting Providence by water as by land; in the fields of War, as on the plains of Peace. The <hi>future</hi> is a wide space<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain within its circle a thousand blessings. Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle then against the storm bravely. Your infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are too gloomy: various opportunities will offer, doubt not, to speed our generous intercourse. The wide world of sentiment and sensation still opens upon us. By aid of this little friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, we may range through those paths which Ocean seems to separate. However remote, you should still learn to think it a superiour blessing, that in some part of animated Nature, there still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists the counter part of Emma—congenial, as dear; one, whom no circumstance can change, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
