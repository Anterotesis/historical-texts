            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY wiſe and excellent <hi>proverbs</hi> have been eſtabliſhed, by men of the moſt eminent worth and value, as uſeful and important. Among which, not any have a more juſt claim to preeminence, than thoſe of the wiſe and learned <hi>King</hi> of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Perhaps not one, among the great variety to be found in his writings, is more uſeful and excellent, than that which we have choſen for the <hi>theme</hi> of our diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>THIS, above all others, is verified in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It cannot be reaſonably expected, that it ſhould be ſtrictly confirmed in every particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; as there are but very few, if any, rules, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbs
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028362_0005_0FD8C6BC8576F8B8"/>
or maxims, but what admit of ſome few exceptions. In moſt of the inſtances where this <hi>proverb,</hi> contained in the <hi>text,</hi> is thought not to prove ſtrictly true, yet if they ſhould be carefully examined, there would be found ſome defect in not having ſtrictly attended to the <hi>proverb,</hi> rather than in the <hi>proverb</hi> itſelf, We may, therefore, ſafely receive this <hi>proverb,</hi> as one of the moſt general, uſeful and important proverbs or max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, any where known, either verbally among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or upon record.</p>
            <p>"TRAIN <hi>up a child in the way he ſhould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi>"</p>
            <p>As this <hi>proverb</hi> is ſo generally verified, ſo uſeful and important, a ſtrict attention to the <hi>exhortation</hi> contained in it, which is, <hi>"Train up a child in the way he ſhould go,"</hi> is of the <hi>higheſt moment:</hi> for in ſo doing, the happy conſequence, will, according to the <hi>proverb,</hi> naturally follow, which is, <hi>"And when he is old he will not depart from it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the <hi>Exordium,</hi> the <hi>queſtion</hi> which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter for the ſequel of the diſcourſe, naturally ariſeth, How or in what manner are CHILDREN to be trained up? Both reaſon and revelation, are ready to give an <hi>anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REASON <hi>anſwers,</hi> Train up CHILDREN in that way, in which they will make valuable members of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and in that way alſo, which will ſecure to them, <hi>joy, peace</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of mind as long as they continue to exiſt. REVELATION is ready to aid and confirm the voice of REASON, by ſaying, "<hi>And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the</hi> LORD."</p>
            <p>IF CHILDREN, according to the <hi>paſſage</hi> now cited, are trained up in the nurture &amp; admonition of the LORD, they will become uſeful ORNAMENTS of ſociety, happy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028362_0006_0FD8C6BC8837E1C0"/>
in their own minds, and will, beyond the ſhort ſpan of human life, be completely happy in the enjoyment of their CREATOR.</p>
            <p>THIS, in various places in the <hi>ſacred oracles,</hi> is evidently confirmed. Thoſe that are trained up in the way of true chriſtian virtue, will be adopted as the true <hi>children</hi> of God, ſuch being choſen through Chriſt, as heirs of a joyful immortality. Unto ſuch, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> aſſures us, <hi>all things,</hi> which God in his conſummate wiſdom and goodneſs, ſees will beſt tend to advance their everlaſting <hi>peace, joy</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly added.</p>
            <p>THIS is the language of the GOSPEL, "<hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of</hi> GOD, <hi>and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall he added unto you.</hi>"</p>
            <p>THAT this moſt happy <hi>conſequence,</hi> reſulting from training up <hi>children</hi> in the way they ſhould go, might take place, they muſt, while buding to bloom in youth, be properly educated.</p>
            <p>THE education of children, is an intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to all thoſe that are poſſeſſed of ſentiments of love and compaſſion for them; as alſo to all ſuch as have any regard for the well being of mankind, eſpecially of the inhabitants of the <hi>community,</hi> to which they belong.</p>
            <p>THE peace and happineſs of <hi>children</hi> in the future periods of their exiſtence, and likewiſe of their place of reſidence, as alſo of mankind in general, eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their being rightly educated.</p>
            <p>IF their education ſhould be neglected, they will ſtep forth upon the <hi>ſtage</hi> of action, ignorant, rude and barbarous, unfit rightly to ſerve and worſhip their CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATOR; and likewiſe unqualified for the company of the poliſhed and well informed part of mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028362_0007_0FD8C6C0A757AF90"/>SHOULD, therefore, the education of children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come generally neglected, ſuperſtition, miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, would inevitably be the awful conſequences. Intellectual pleaſures, or thoſe of a mind refined by ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial virtue, and illuminated by the emanating rays of divine love, could then never be experienced in all their purifying and pleaſurable effects. But few other joys and pleaſures, would be known, but thoſe which are ſenſual, proceeding from hearts defiled, like contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſtreams, iſſuing from impure fountains. Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and triumph, would conſiſt, as they now do among the <hi>ſavages of the wilderneſs;</hi> while the honor of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a victory over ther own paſſions would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and the joys of a happy triumph over the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs</hi> never poſſeſs their hearts. Their virtue and morality, would be none other, than that which was conformable, however ridiculous, to the place in which they had been trained up. Such are the deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequences of ignorance, every one will readily acknowledge, who has but ſuperficially examined the hiſtory of mankind; and but with indifference, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the great variety of practices and cuſtoms of ſome of the many ſtates, kingdoms and nations of the earth. By ſuch, it will be acknowledged, that thoſe <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>practices,</hi> which, in ſome places among the ignorant and unpoliſhed, are eſteemed as virtuous and honorable, are indeed ridiculous and impious; and which, among the truly virtuous and well informed, would be thus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed. According, therefore, as children are educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will be their <hi>notions, ideas</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> when they ſhall have come forth upon the theatre of time. Truly is the <hi>proverb</hi> contained in the <hi>text,</hi> verified,— <hi>"Train up a child in the way he ſhould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY contraſting <hi>ignorance</hi> with <hi>knowledge,</hi> it will ſtill be thought to have a more glaring and odious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Innumerable are the happy conſequences reſulting from a general diffuſion of uſeful knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:028362_0008_0FD8C6C1C68F8120"/>THOSE that have early had their minds refined by a good education, can riſe, upon the wings of ſcience, far above the ſordid pleaſures of the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed. With their aſpiring minds, they can ſoar on high, even from <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>heaven,</hi> and from <hi>pole</hi> to <hi>pole,</hi> contemplating with exquiſite delight, the majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic works of creation and the beauties of nature, which, with pleaſing aſtoniſhment, every where ſtrike the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened mind.</p>
            <p>LEARNING not only capacitates the mind for ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with pleaſure the works and beauties of creation: but renders it a fit recipient and a proper repoſitory of conſiſtent ideas of God, the great Creator and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of all things.</p>
            <p>THOSE minds, which remain deformed by <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> have very inconſiſtent ideas of God, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections natural and moral, and of his dealings with his intelligent creatures. To the truth of this aſſertion, both hiſtory and our own obſervations, will bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>KNOWLEDGE obtained from uſeful <hi>learning,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints on the mind many important ideas; prepares, if rightly improved, thoſe, whoſe minds are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, to act their parts right and well in the world; and to them, points out the <hi>way,</hi> that leads to the happy abodes of the bleſſed, where fountains of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, ſprings of peace, rivers of pleaſure and ſtreams of joy, in one inceſſant proſpect for ever riſe, making glad the hearts of the <hi>myriads</hi> of its <hi>elyſian</hi> inhabitants. It is knowledge, which teaches us to aſſert the ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty of our nature; and to aſſume that <hi>dignity</hi> in the ſcale of being, for which we were created.</p>
            <p>THOUSANDS of utilities, elegancies, joys and pleaſures, owe their birth and being to it, without which, exiſtence itſelf would be but an inſipid enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028362_0009_0FD8C6C888B22688"/>SUCH are the happy conſequences, privileges and advantages; which wholly depend upon the right <hi>education</hi> of children.</p>
            <p>THE real worth or ſuperiority of mankind, above the beaſts of the foreſt, appear only, by rightly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, repleniſhing and poliſhing their minds, with <hi>knowledge</hi> received from learning's ſource.</p>
            <p>LEARNING or education, does for the mind, the ſame that the poliſhing hand of the artiſt that works on rich and precious GEMS, does to ONE taken from the earth, as it there laid in its hidden receſſes.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>mind</hi> originally, as in children upon their entrance into the world, is deſtitute of all ideas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſuch as they immediately receive from ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE mind or underſtanding, ſeems not to have any original ideas imprinted on it, but appears rather to be deſtitute of the leaſt glimmering of all innate knowledge.</p>
            <p>"A CAREFUL examination of the minds of young children, <hi>ſays a learned and ingenious Writer,</hi> will ſufficiently convince us, that they bring not many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ideas into the world with them."</p>
            <p>IF there were any original ideas in the <hi>mind,</hi> which in its firſt being it receives, thoſe ideas moſt certainly would be univerſally known, and acknowledged by all mankind as inconteſtible truths; which we ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently know has never been the caſe, even with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the moſt ſelf evident propoſitions and neceſſary exiſtences.</p>
            <p>THIS, therefore, is ſufficient to convince us, that the <hi>mind</hi> originally is ſimilar to white paper, being void of all innate characters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028362_0010_0FD8C6C9E45AC728"/>AS God has neither made nor done any thing in vain, it would be impertinent to ſuppoſe that the <hi>mind</hi> had any ideas or characters engraven on it in its firſt exiſtence: for as we are endowed with ſuch noble powers and faculties by which we are capacitated, to obtain all the ideas neceſſary for us to have, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this, would be to ſuppoſe a ſuperfluous operation of the divine agency.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore, only by improvement, and that by degrees, that the mind comes to be ſtored with any <hi>fund</hi> of uſeful knowledge. At firſt, the ſenſes let into the mind, particular ideas, called the ideas of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After which, the mind, begins to exerciſe its own powers, by abſtracting and compounding the ideas it received from ſenſation; and by a certain progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, learns for each of its ideas both ſimple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, particular and general names with their uſe and deſign. The ideas received from the perception of the operations of the <hi>mind,</hi> are the ideas of reflection; which operations are the ſource, from which proceeds all our uſeful knowledge, reſpecting virtue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, in which is included our duty both towards God and man, as well as our joy, peace and happineſs. This is the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> in which the <hi>mind</hi> is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ideas and the uſe of language; and by which it is enabled to exerciſe its diſcurſive faculties. It, therefore, eminently depends upon the right edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children, reſpecting their future proſperity, knowledge and uſefulneſs in the world. It is educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which raiſes one above another in real worth and merit.</p>
            <p>THE divine portion of genius is diffuſed among the rich and the poor, the high and the low; and requires only the poliſhing hand of education, to make it ſhine <hi>in each</hi> with diſtinguiſhed luſtre.</p>
            <p>THE great diſparity among mankind, ariſes not ſo much from the want of gifts, as from the want of a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028362_0011_0FD8C6CE8E5841A8"/>
proper education. Among crouds of the untutored, real evidences of a bright genius, may often plainly be diſcovered. Many of thoſe, who traverſe America's deſerts, to whom no other joys and pleaſures are known, "but the chaſe and the pipe"—have as great if not greater natural abilities, than thoſe, who among the civilized, fill diſtinguiſhed ſtations of uſefulneſs and honor.</p>
            <p>"MAN, by nature, <hi>ſays</hi> ONE, is like a piece of marble juſt taken from the quarry; and 'tis education which gives the uſe, the form and the poliſh."</p>
            <p>MANY of thoſe, who have been raiſed to dignified ſtations of honor and uſefulneſs, have been taken from the moſt humble ſituations in the world, and advanced to them, by means of their education with great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reputation. A ſtriking inſtance of this, we have in the life of MOSES. Reflect a moment,—"How great the contraſt between <hi>Moſes</hi> in the marſhy weeds," and MOSES the Commander of the people and <hi>armies</hi> of the GOD of hoſts! Behold <hi>him</hi> at one time in an <hi>Ark</hi> of bulruſhes, floating upon the river Nile; and at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as a moſt noble Commander under the ſupreme KING of <hi>kings,</hi> ſtanding upon the banks of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> ſafely conducting the choſen of the Lord, through the paths of the watery element! Whence, therefore, may the queſtion be juſtly aſked, was this ſtrange ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing reverſe of fortune? Was it wholly owing to his being taken from the <hi>Ark</hi> of bulruſhes, upon the banks of a dangerous river? No! For notwithſtanding he was thus ſaved from the very jaws of death; yet his eminence and worth, are to be attributed to ſome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er CAUSE. It was his education, under the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending providence of God, which prepared him to be ſuch a pattern of meekneſs; ſuch a bleſſing to the choſen of the Lord; and to commence the performer of ſuch a ſcene of wonders, as "muſt aſtoniſh the world to the lateſt ages." Had it not been for his ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, his genius and latent ſeeds of meekneſs and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028362_0012_0FD8C6CFEAAFAC60"/>
virtue, together with his great uſefulneſs to generations gone, to the preſent and to thoſe that are yet to come, would, like a lump of unwrought gold, never have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared according to their true value; but would have been concealed by the impenetrable ſhades of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>PHARAOH'S daughter is worthy of a high eulogium, for her kind aſſiſtance to <hi>Moſes,</hi> a poor forſaken child; for ſnatching him from a watery grave; and for what is yet greater, providing him with the means of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "As ſoon as his age and capacity would admit, <hi>ſays a celebrated</hi> DIVINE, he was ſent to ſchool, where under the moſt improved inſtructors, he made uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proficiency in his ſtudies." "<hi>He was learned,</hi> ſaith an inſpired WRITER, <hi>in all the wiſdom of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</hi>"</p>
            <p>BY educating this child, O <note n="*" place="bottom">Called ſo by Joſephus.</note> Thermutis! thou didſt perform great ſervice to mankind; <hi>and didſt heap upon</hi> thyſelf exalted encomlums. This benevolent act, gave thee more joy, than all the gay pleaſures of a ſplendid life; added more charms to thy perſon than ſparkling eyes, bluſhing cheeks, and curling truſſes.</p>
            <p>THE ſupreme glory, ſhall be aſcribed to God, while blooming flowers ſhall be ſcatter'd in the paths, in which, O Thermutis! thou walkeſt with thy maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens down to the River, from which thou didſt draw <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the ſon of a ſlave.</p>
            <p>SINCE ſuch wonderous acts are performed, and ſuch great good accrues to mankind, by the means of education, it is of the utmoſt importance to cultivate by learning, thoſe latent ſparks of genius in the minds of children, that they may be rightly employed for their own advantage, and for the benefit of ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028362_0013_0FD8BD73521F8AA8"/>THE more that true knowledge is diffuſed, the more will true peace and happineſs be enjoyed; the more ſafe will be the rights and liberties of each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; and the more likely will be the holy religion of the bleſſed <hi>Redeemer</hi> to prevail and flouriſh.</p>
            <p>A GENERAL diffuſion of uſeful knowledge, will have a happy tendency to make the inhabitants of the world, as are the citizens of America enlightened and free; to prevent the ambitious and deſigning from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping either political or eccleſiaſtical tyranny; and to qualify a people to be happy ſubjects and virtuous rulers.</p>
            <p>"TYRANNY, bigotry and ſuperſtition, <hi>ſays</hi> ONE, are ſupported only by gloomy ignorance." "Theſe, whenever the divine ray of knowledge ſhall illume the benighted parts of the earth, will flee, like Satan," "with the ſhades of the night."</p>
            <p>IN this Country, where liberty is the baſis of its government, where birth and riches give no preem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence; "and where merit alone has the ſureſt claim" to diſtinction, there are but very few, who may not be ſo trained up or educated, as to be qualified to fill <hi>with reputation</hi> the higheſt places of honor and truſt; or at the leaſt, to make honeſt, uſeful and peaceable citizens. If therefore, CHILDREN are trained up in the way they ſhould go, when they ſhall have ariſen to years of maturity, they will not depart from it; but in it with pleaſure will delight to walk.</p>

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid upon this ſubject, we may infer, that it is the indiſpenſible duty of parents, to rightly train up or educate their children in <hi>that way,</hi> in which they ſhould go when they are old.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028362_0014_0FD8C6D671262F10"/>AS children come into the world deſtitute of ideas, as we have ſhown, they ought early to be furniſhed with the means of education, that their young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der minds, which can eaſily be moulded into any form, might be repleniſhed with ſuitable &amp; neceſſary knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. It is, therefore, dangerous to defer the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children till they ſhall have imbibed certain ſentiments, notions and ideas, which, however <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> they will never renounce.</p>
               <p>MANY parents really injure their children by not giving them a proper education for the calling, in which it is probable they will follow, at as early a period of life, as would have been conſiſtent with their capacities for learning and improvement.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING a very conſiderable knowledge of the arts and ſciences, may, at an advanced age of life be obtained; yet it has been remarked and that very juſtly, that moſt of ſuch perſons will be contracted in their views and ſentiments, practicably infallible and ſelf conceited, and illiberal and uncharitable in moſt of their proceedings. They are commonly deſtitute of all delicate impreſſions, their hearts being as hard as the adamantine rock. If ſuch perſons ſuſtain a religious character or act in a ſacred profeſſion, they will impute all their inconſiſtencies to the ſacred ſpirit of God, or perhaps for a conſcientious zeal for his glory. By their blind, abſurd and infatuated zeal, together with their pretended orthodoxy, they eſſentially injure the cauſe of true religion, which they have been endeavouring to ſupport. The opinions or ſentiments of ſuch, can by reaſon no more be altered, than thunder clouds can be turned, or the everlaſting hills be moved by the voice or ſtrength of man. Nothing but fear, ſhame and puniſhment, withhold them from imitating the deluded followers of the <hi>Eaſtern Impoſtor,</hi> in unſheathing the SWORD of JEHOVAH, and pointing it at the breaſts of thoſe, who fall not in with their fanatical notions
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028362_0015_0FD8C6D76CCF9690"/>
and perſecuting principles. Such, <hi>my friends,</hi> are the natural and dreadful conſequences, of neglecting the early and proper education of children.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me, therefore, ye PARENTS <hi>preſent,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a few words of <hi>addreſs</hi> to you, upon this important and intereſting concern.</p>
               <p>PERMIT <hi>one, my friends,</hi> who experimentally knows not the joys, fears and anxieties of a parent, to intreat you for your own honor, and for what is yet far greater, for the future proſperity of your children, to give to them as good an education as you can conſiſtently with your ſeveral abilities. The future characters and conduct of your children, yea, their everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in an eminent ſenſe, depend upon the education they ſhall receive from you. You can perform no greater kindneſs, and manifeſt no greater parental affection for <hi>them,</hi> than by giving <hi>them</hi> an opportunity to obtain a uſeful and valuable education. In this <hi>way,</hi> you will probably prevent their own miſery and ruin; and at the ſame time perform an eſſential ſervice to mankind. To thus aſſiſt them, is far more commendable, than it is to beſtow on them riches and hereditary honors. By ſo doing, you will prepare them for uſefulneſs in the world, for honor and happineſs, and for a proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of themſelves, when they ſhall appear upon the ſtage of action, to take a part in life's great DRAMA.</p>
               <p>MANY a bright genius, have ſpent their days in the low and humble walks of life, for the want of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their minds improved by education; and finally have gone down to the grave, without ever appearing to advantage in the world.

as involve in them ſuch palpable abſurdities, as neither <hi>Angels, Man</hi> nor <hi>Devils,</hi> can ever make to appear plauſible to a rational and unprejudiced mind.

               <p>BUT above all, you muſt ſeek to obtain the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of God; and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of Salvation through HIM, as it is revealed in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> To this END, you will faithfully attend to the inſtructions of pious PARENTS and TEACHERS. Heavenly knowledge, is highly recommended to your <hi>choice</hi> in repeated inſtances by the wiſe, virtuous and learned <hi>Preacher</hi> of Iſrael. This is his language:—</p>
               <p>"MY <hi>Son, hear the inſtruction of thy</hi> FATHER, <hi>and forſake not the law of thy</hi> MOTHER: <hi>For they ſhall be an</hi> ornament of grace <hi>unto thy head, and</hi> chains <hi>about</hi> thy neck." "<hi>Hear ye children the inſtruction of a father, and attend to know underſtanding. For I give you good doctrine, forſake ye not my law. For I was my</hi> FATHER'S <hi>ſon, tender and only beloved in the ſight of my</hi> MOTHER." My <hi>Father</hi> taught me, and my <hi>Mother</hi> frequently inſtructed me—<hi>"And ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, let thine heart retain my words; keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and live." "Take faſt hold of</hi> inſtruction; <hi>let</hi> her <hi>not go; keep</hi> her; <hi>for</hi> ſhe <hi>is thy life." "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my</hi> inſtruction, <hi>and not ſilver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For</hi> wiſdom <hi>is better than ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; and all the things that may be deſired are not to be compared to"</hi> her. Many more paſſages might be eaſily cited, <hi>were it neceſſary,</hi> in which wiſdom and inſtruction are highly recommended to the choice of Youth.</p>
               <p>AMONG the great variety you ſhall only once more be refered to the <hi>ſtory</hi> of the wiſe <hi>Preacher's</hi> choice, when God in the days of his youth, thus addreſſed <hi>him, "Aſk what I ſhall give thee."</hi> His choice, <hi>my

young friends,</hi> teaches <hi>you</hi> that wiſdom or a wiſe and underſtanding heart, is to be choſen and prefered as far more valuable than all earthly honors, riches and pleaſures. While <hi>health, riches</hi> and victory, were ſpreading their alluring charms before the <hi>young Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,</hi> recommending themſelves to his choice, when <hi>wiſdom</hi> appeared, it was with her alone, with which he was captivated. While it is an accepted time, be perſuaded to imitate <hi>Solomon</hi> in his choice; and like him, may you be wiſe to know the God of your fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to ſerve HIM with a perfect heart and willing mind. Your youthful days are fleeting faſt; and will ſoon be gone. Expiring time will ſoon ſcatter hoary hairs among the moſt beautiful locks; "draw furrows on the ſmootheſt brow; and blaſt the roſes on the fineſt cheek." Thoſe, therefore, who, AFTER <hi>their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vigorous</hi> days are paſt, would appear amiable and beautiful, muſt have their <hi>minds</hi> adorned with heavenly wiſdom, and their <hi>hearts</hi> repleniſhed with the graces of the divine SPIRIT. May you be continually abounding in true knowledge and wiſdom; in true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and virtue; and in every good word and work. When done with time, may you be admitted to the full fruition of the joys and pleaſures of heaven; where you will ever be increaſing in knowledge; flouriſhing in <hi>immortal youth;</hi> and glowing with crowns and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adems of dazling beauty, through the rolling and ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>ages</hi> of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN a word, to comprehend, "THE ONE THING NEEDFUL," which involves in it, <hi>knowledge</hi> the moſt important, as well as all riches, honors and pleaſures, is to have a <hi>ſpiritual knowledge</hi> of HIM, whom to know aright is <hi>Life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO conclude therefore; May we all both young and old, be trained up for everlaſting life; and when through <hi>death's</hi> dark <hi>vault</hi> we ſhall have paſſed, may we
