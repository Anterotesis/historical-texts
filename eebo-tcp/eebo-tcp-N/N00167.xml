         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of new Companies to them</hi> to Assist and strengthen them, and the unlikelihood of any coming to our help.

But abroad in the yard one <hi>Thomas Wilson</hi> of that Town being sent to fetch water for our help in further need, (that which we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spent in putting out the Fire) was shot by the Enemy in the <hi>upper Jaw,</hi> and in the neck, the anguish of which wound was such at the first that he cried out with a <hi>great noise,</hi> by Reason whereof the <hi>Indians</hi> hearing him <hi>rejoyced and triumphed at it</hi>; But his wound was healed in a short time, praised be God.</p>

            <p>The merciful Providence of God also appeared in preventing the danger that the <hi>Honoured Major</hi> and his <hi>Company</hi> might have been in, when they came near to us, for those <hi>Beastly men</hi> our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Skilful to destroy,</hi> Indeavoured to prevent any help from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Relief, and therefore sent down <hi>Sentinels,</hi> (some nearer and some further off) the furthest about <hi>two miles</hi> from us, who if they saw any coming from the <hi>Bay</hi> they might give notice by an <hi>Alarm.</hi> And there were about an <hi>hundred</hi> of them who for the most part kept at an house some little distance from us, by which if any help came from the said <hi>Bay,</hi> they must pass, and so they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (as we conceive) having notice by their <hi>Sentinels</hi> of their approach to <hi>way-lay them,</hi> and if they could, to <hi>cut them off</hi> before they came to the house where we kept.</p>
            <p>But as we propably guess, they were so intent and buisy in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Instruments (as abovesaid) for our destruction by Fire, that they were not at the house where they used to keep for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose aforesaid, and that they heard not their <hi>Sentinels</hi> when they <hi>shot</hi>; and so the <hi>Majors</hi> way was clear from danger till he came to our house. And that it was their purpose so to have fallen upon him, or any other coming to us at that house, is the more propable in that (as we have since had Intelligence from some of the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves) there were a party of them at <hi>another place</hi> who <hi>let him pass by them</hi> without the least hurt or Opposition, waiting for a <hi>blow to be given</hi> him at the said <hi>house,</hi> and then they themselves to fall upon them in the <hi>Reare,</hi> as they intended to have done with us at the <hi>Swamp,</hi> in Case we had <hi>fled back</hi> as is before expressed.

            <p>Accordingly the holy Prophet (very probably <hi>David</hi>) in this Psalm sets before us the Exercise of his grace in various Conditions which befell him: He tels us what he did in the time of great <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Distress</hi>; he prayed, <hi>He called upon the Name of the Lord: ver. 3, 4.</hi> and being delivered and helped what he did, and was resolved to do: <hi>He loved the Lord,</hi> and would <hi>walk before him in the Land of the Living</hi>; He was thankful, and would express his <hi>gratitude</hi> in his <hi>Conversation</hi>; yea, is Inquisitive, what further to do
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000226_0021_0FA36CA007EA4690"/>
therein; as in the Text, <hi>what shall I Render,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Psalm then is <hi>Eucharistical</hi>; or <hi>Gratulatory,</hi> wherein the <hi>Psalmist</hi> giveth praise to God for his <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> in a great <hi>Deliverance</hi> from a <hi>deadly danger</hi> and <hi>distress</hi>; and so suitable to the present occasion of our meeting at this time; If <hi>David</hi> were the Penman thereof, the Deliverance may be that mentioned, <hi>Psal. 18.</hi> Title: His preservation from <hi>Sauls furious</hi> and <hi>malicious Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the rage and violence of all his Adherents, and all others that sought his Ruine.</p>
            <p>The words read contein a <hi>Pathetical Exclamation</hi> and <hi>Enquiry; what shall I render,</hi> &amp;c. as if he should say; The Lord hath bestowed <hi>mercies,</hi> yea, many and great mercies upon me; He hath <hi>heard my prayer</hi> when the <hi>sorrows of death encompassed me, helped me</hi> when I was <hi>brought very low</hi>; something is to be returned to him, that even Reason suggests, yea, much is to be done; but what that is I am (as it were) at a Loss, I would do any thing to please and honour him, who hath done so much for me.</p>
            <p>In the words there are <hi>two parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>Inquisition</hi>; wherein we may Consider: 1. The <hi>Subject</hi> or matter enquired after: <hi>what shall I render</hi>: 2<hi>dly.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> or person concerning whom the Enquiry is made, and to whom the Return is to be made, and that is <hi>Jehovah</hi>; Not man but <hi>the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The Reason of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and that is the Consideration of <hi>all his Benefits</hi>; There was just occasion to be so sollicitous; <hi>Gods Benefits,</hi> set out, 1. <hi>By an Amplification</hi> All, <hi>All his Benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly, By an Application,</hi> towards me; All his Benefits <hi>towards me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this verse we have the <hi>Question,</hi> In the verses following we have the <hi>Resolution</hi>; He will <hi>take the Cup of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. and He will <hi>pay the Vows</hi> which he had made in his Trouble and Distress.</p>
            <p>For Explication of the Terms [<hi>Render</hi>] The word Imports a kind of <hi>Requital</hi>; It is attributed both to God and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in Relation to a good thing done, and signifies to reward, and to an Evil, and signifies to <hi>Revenge</hi>: Here it is Attributed to <hi>man in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God,</hi> but not as importing any possibility and satisfaction,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000226_0022_0FA36CA0C7BA5138"/>
but only a <hi>readiness</hi> and <hi>forwardness</hi> to do any thing that might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Benefits</hi>] The word in the <hi>Original</hi> is derived of that Verb which in the <hi>seventh verse</hi> is Translated [<hi>dealt bountifully</hi>] Gods Bounties: And these the Prophet stiles <hi>His Benefit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Verse then is a Description of the frame of heart of a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thanksgiver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In his <hi>Observation</hi> of Gods dispensation towards him, in the <hi>Benefits bestowed on him.</hi>

            <p>Hence this Doctrine may be raised.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>A person or people in a right thankful frame upon the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods Benifits, and Bountiful favours towards them, are very Sollicitous what to return to God for them.</hi> Or such <hi>as are after God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There be two parts in the Doctrine. 1. That a gracious Heart <hi>observes</hi> and takes notice of Gods goodness towards him. 2<hi>dly,</hi> He is thereupon <hi>Inquisitive</hi> what to <hi>Return</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Prophet takes notice of Gods goodness; His <hi>Inquisition</hi> what to return, for it argues his <hi>Observation</hi> of it; If he enquires <hi>what to Render,</hi> It argues his tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Reason 2. <hi>From the Thankfulness we owe to God</hi> for every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being <hi>unworthy of the least of them</hi>; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31 10. <hi>Jacob</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledgeth.

Hence that Expression in <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. Psal. 8.15.21., 31. <hi>Oh that men would praise the Lord</hi>; as if he should say: It's rather to be wished then expected, <hi>Luke 17.17, 18.</hi> There were Ten cried <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> but only <hi>one Returned to give Thanks</hi> to Jesus Christ when cured.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Doctrine. <hi>Gracious and Humble Hearts observing Gods goodness towards them, are studious and Sollicitous what to Return to him.</hi> So the Prophet here, <hi>what shall I Render to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. so 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.1. when God had brought him to Rest in his Kingdome after so many wandrings; he was studying how to advance the honour of God, who had done so great things for him; had so delivered him, so <hi>advanced him</hi> to <hi>honour and Renown,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>

3.9. what <hi>Thanks</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>can we Render.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Reasons hereof are,</p>
            <p>Reason 1. <hi>From the Consideration of the Nature of the Benefits,</hi> Gods people enjoy; The Prophet here may well say, <hi>what shall I Render,</hi> &amp;c. and so may every Child of God say; All that are in Covenant with him; <hi>what shall we Render</hi> for the Benefits we have received from our God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are great mercies</hi>; even very great; as the promises of good to be given are <hi>great Promises,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. so the good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and bestowed. They are <hi>great favours,</hi> especially in <hi>spiritual blessings.</hi> He gives great Deliverances; as <hi>Psal. 18.50.</hi> he doth great Things for his, as <hi>Psal. 71.19.</hi> and <hi>86.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> They are very many; There is an <hi>All</hi> of them, as in the Text; an <hi>All</hi> that is beyond Expression, <hi>Psal. 139.14. more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then the sand.</hi> There is a multitude of them: This was an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of <hi>Israels</hi> sin, that they <hi>remembred not the multitude of Gods mercies,</hi> Psal. 106.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly, They are Everlasting mercies,</hi> Psal. 136. In every verse <hi>thy mercy endures for ever</hi>; Gods people see and acknowledge <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting mercy,</hi> even in outward and temporal blessings; much more in spiritual and Eternal: Because though the mercies themselves do not <hi>Indure for ever,</hi> yet the Foundation of all to Gods people is <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting grace &amp; mercy</hi>; And besides even these do in some degree tend to further their <hi>Everlasting blessedness</hi>; helping them on in their way to their <hi>Fathers house</hi> in heaven; therefore there is Reason to study and be Sollicitous what to render to God for them.</p>
            <p>Reason 2. <hi>From the Consideration of the person</hi> from whom the Blessings and Deliverances come, and to whom the Return is to be made, and that is, <hi>the Lord,</hi> what shall I Render <hi>to the Lord</hi> for His Benefits.</p>

            <p>Reason 3. <hi>From the Consideration of the person</hi> that is to make the Return to God; <hi>what shall I Return</hi>; I that am so <hi>unworthy of the least mercy</hi>: I that have had so <hi>many mercies,</hi> so great <hi>Deliverances,</hi> I that am notable to Render any thing <hi>beseeming his Majesty</hi>; I that am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so many <hi>Bonds and Obligations</hi>; I that am so <hi>priviledged by God; what shall I Render,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
