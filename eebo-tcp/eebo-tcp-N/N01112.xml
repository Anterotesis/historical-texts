            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I do the more Rejoyce, in that whereas I did my ſelf Publiſh Two Sermons on this very Text, Preached in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Twelve Years ago, I ſee another, and One of my <hi>Academical Children</hi> Concurring in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.

                     <hi>For all theſe Youthful Vanities, God will call Young People to an Account.</hi> When God at firſt made man, He gave him a Law, to be the Rule of his Life; annexing Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings to that Holy, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; Good Law. And tho' by our Apoſtaſy, we have rendred our ſelves unable to keep the Law of God; yet, tis nevertheleſs bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; eſpecially to them who have it not only written on their Hearts, as even the Heathen are ſaid to have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 14, 15 but more fully, and leſs darkly in their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; with the addition of the Goſpel, by which the Law is Eſtabliſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. God hath not loſt His <hi>Right</hi> to our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe we have loſt our <hi>Power</hi> of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying: And being Rational Creatures, we muſt of neceſſity, be accountable to Him who is our Law-giver and Judge, Rom. 14.10.12. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt. So then every one of us ſhall give Account of himſelf to God</hi> Even that GOD <hi>who is ready to Judge the Quick and Dead;</hi> 1 Pet. 4, 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> All that ever have had, or ſhall have a being in the world, from the Firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Laſt Child that ſhall be Born. And as this Judgment ſhall be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001324_0011_0FB27ECFE76B0C98"/>
with reſpect to Perſons, <hi>viz</hi> Youth as well as Children &amp; Infants below them, and Middle, with Old Age above them; ſo it ſhall be Univerſal with reſpect to the Works done in the Body, Eccl. 12.14. <hi>For God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with every Secret thing, whether it be Good or Evil.</hi> And ſurely, Wanton, Proud, Malicious, and all Sinful words, are to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Works: Not ſo much as an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Word</hi> ſhall eſcape the Reckoning Day, <hi>Mat</hi> 12.36 Yea, God knows all the wicked &amp; <hi>Vain Thoughts</hi> of men, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. <hi>Pſal</hi> 94.11. And does moſt certainly keep an exact Account of them; and will call to a ſtrict Reckoning for them, on that Day, when <hi>the Small as well as the Great ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and the Books being Opened, they ſhall be Judged one of thoſe things that are written in the Books, according to their works,</hi> Rev. 20.12. Nor ſhould the diſtance of this Great Day make it leſs awful to any of us: For there will be a Day of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judgment, which ſhall unalterably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our Final &amp; Everlaſting Eſtate, as ſoon as our Souls are ſeparated from our Bodies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. Which may be the caſe of the Youngeſt of us all, within a very few Dayes or Hours; before the next Sabbath,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001324_0012_0FB27ED3453776E8"/>
yea, before we ſee the light of another Day. And truly the General Judgment may be nearer than we imagine. The Lord may come unlook'd for, &amp; ſurpriz Young Ones in the midſt of their Carnal Mirth &amp; Jollity, before they are aware, <hi>to cut them aſunder, and appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites, who ſhall for ever weep, wail, and gnaſh their teeth,</hi> Mat. 24 48, — And as Young Folks are wilful &amp; uncontroleable in their Wickedneſs; reſolved that the Lord ſhall not Rule over them: whom all the Commands, Promiſes &amp; Threatnings of the Law and Goſpel can nothing move; and with whom all the means &amp; methods that God is uſing, are altogether ineffectual for their reclaming: So it ſhall be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for them to uſe any Endeavours for an Eſcape from Gods Tribunal: Heb 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we Eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> As <hi>there is no darkneſs nor ſhadow of Death, where the workers of Iniquity may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> from the preſence of God <hi>Now, Job</hi> 34 22. ſo it ſhall be utterly in vain for them <hi>Then,</hi> to ſay to the <hi>Mountains &amp; Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of Him that ſits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</hi> when the Great Day of His intolerable Wrath is come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001324_0013_0FB27ED581000310"/>
Thus, becauſe Young Men will indulge themſelves in Sinful Pleaſures, GOD will call them to an Account for all their Youthful Vanities.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This is a Truth which GOD would have Young People to Know.</hi> Young Men <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their Youth,</hi> as if they were made for nothing but Merriment; and their <hi>Hearts Chear them in the Days of their Youth,</hi> juſt as if it were alwayes to be Spring-time with them. They can Read, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the former part of our Text with Delight. How pleaſing is the Counſel, in the ſenſe their wanton Hearts would have it taken in? Words could ſcarce fit them better. <hi>Walk in the ways of thine Heart, &amp; in the ſight of thine Eyes:</hi> This is what they would have! But God would have them to Read, and ſolemnly to Conſider the whole Verſe. They muſt take this ſtinging <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T</hi> with the reſt; <hi>Know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the further Illuſtration of this Third <hi>Propoſition,</hi> it may be Enquired, What it is for Young Men to Know this Truth? Why God would have them to know it And,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001324_0014_0FB27ED9107C0438"/>
Whence it is that they are ſo Unwilling to Know it?</p>
                  <p>Queſt I. <hi>What is it for Young Men to Know this Great Truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. In Gen.</hi> It is more than barely to Know that ſuch a Truth is written in their Bibles: It is to Realize the Truth of it, and to Think much upon it. Yea, it is to Know (as the word in Scripture, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies,) ſo as to be <hi>Affected</hi> with it &amp; to act accordingly. For Vain Youth to Know, that for all theſe things they muſt come to Judgment, in the ſenſe of our <hi>Text,</hi> is for them to Know it, not only Notionally, with a Speculative, Barren, Unpractical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but Feelingly, with a Knowledge that is Heart-affecting and Operative.</p>
                  <p>More Particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For Young Men to Know aright, is for them firmly to Believe the Truth of this. All-concerning Doctrine, of a Judgment to come.</hi> To Realize it to themſelves, that they muſt certainly, and may quickly Dye: For God often ſhortens the dayes of them who are <hi>Wicked Overmuch,</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh, Eccl</hi> 7.17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe who indulge themſelves in Youthful Luſts often Dye in Youth, <hi>Job</hi> 36.14. And <hi>after Death comes the Judgment,</hi> Heb 9.27. To Know aright, is to Believe all this; and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001324_0015_0FB27EDDC62420D8"/>
further, to Realize the Second Coming of Chriſt to Judgment; when <hi>He ſhall Deſcend from Heaven, with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God;</hi> whoſe Voice ſhall Raiſe the Dead, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4.16. And that when <hi>He comes with Clouds, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Eye ſhall ſee Him; and thoſe alſo who Pierced Him;</hi> — (Have not Young men done ſo by their Sins?) <hi>And all the Kindreds of the Earth ſhall wail becauſe of Him,</hi> Rev. 1.7 Neither ſhall ſo much as one Proud, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt, Diſobedient, or Vain Thought, Word or Action, eſcape Unaccounted for, in that Day of Reckoning. Thus to Know is mote than to Hear and Read theſe things; It is to Believe and Realize them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For Young Men to Know this Truth, as they ſhould, is for them with frequency and ſeriouſneſs of Soul, to Conſider of it.</hi> It's not enough to Believe, that, if we indulge our ſelves in Sin, God will Judge and Condemn us for our Sins; but we muſt take it into ſolemn Conſideration: If it be an Article of our <hi>Faith,</hi> it muſt be the Subject of our <hi>Meditation.</hi> We ſhould be often thinking of, and with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in our minds, this Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of our Souls. Hence we find Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Conſidering frequently joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001324_0016_0FB27EDF43B12508"/>
in Scripture; Thus, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.17: and Iſa. 1.3. <hi>Iſrael does not Know. My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not Conſider.</hi> Not to Conſider of this Truth, is not to Know it aright. Again, Iſa. 41.20. <hi>That they may See, and Know, &amp; Conſider.</hi> So that when God bids Young Men Know, what the Latter End of a Vain Life will be, He would have them to take it into moſt ſerious Conſideration: And it will be their wiſdom ſo to do, Deut. 32.29. <hi>O that they were Wiſe; that they <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this; that they would Conſider their Latter End!</hi> And not only to Conſider what it ſhall be; but withal to think how they ſhall be able to hold up their heads in that Day! What they ſhall have to ſay for themſelves! How they can bear to hear (and yet hear they muſt) that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Go ye Curſed into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And further, to conſider what it will be to lie in Hell among Devils, and Damned Men and Women for ever! And thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider would affect their Hearts; which alſo is included in Knowing aright. But this brings us to the Third Particular, under the Firſt Enquiry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>For Young Men to Know the Great Truth before us in the ſenſe of our Text, is for them
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001324_0017_0FB27EE0C1A07160"/>
to be deeply Affected with it, and Concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. To Know,</hi> is in this ſenſe alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken in Scripture: Thus, 1 King. 8.38 Job 13.23. <hi>Make me to Know my Tranſgreſſion and my Sin.</hi> And yet nearer to the preſent purpoſe, does that fervent Prayer of Holy <hi>David</hi> ſeem to be, Pſal. 39.4. <hi>Make me to Know mine End,</hi> i. e. ſo as to lay it to heart. It was an Affectionate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he there deſired. So Ezek 16 2. <hi>Cauſe Jeruſalem to Know her Abominations.</hi> God would have her to lay to Heart her Sins; to be deeply Affected with them, and Sorrowful for them, when he ſpeaks of her Knowing them. So that, <hi>Know thou, &amp;c.</hi> in our Text, is as much as if God had ſaid, And wilt thou indeed, Vain, Fooliſh Young Man? — Art thou reſolved to wallow in the mire of Sin? Then I would have thee to <hi>Know,</hi> by Believing and Conſidering, — Yea, let it ſink into thy Heart, and fill thy Soul with trembling, that I will moſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhortly too, call thee to a moſt ſtrict and ſolemn Account, for all thy <hi>Youthful Vanities;</hi> and thou ſhalt find them to be Dear bought Pleaſures: — And if Young Men did know this Great Truth thus <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately,</hi> they would ſoon come to know it <hi>Practically</hi> which is the Fourth &amp; Laſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001324_0018_0FB27EE24094B268"/>
Thing intended in this right Knowledge, of which we are ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>To Know this Truth aright is to Know it Practically.</hi> For <hi>Young Men to Know, that if they indulge themſelves in Sinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, God will call them to an Account for all their Youthful Vanities,</hi> is for them to act as men who do Realize the Truth hereof; as thoſe who have frequently taken it into ſerious Conſideration, laid it to Heart, and have been deeply Affected with it. This, in General, is to Know the Truth before us Practically, even to Practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch a Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>But, more Particularly.</p>
                  <p>This Practical Knowledge includes, or comprehends theſe Three things in it; viz <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To Know this Truth Practically, is to be driven thereby out of our ſelves, to JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST in the way of Faith.</hi> When the Young Man does conſider, that he has been a great Sinner; this or that groſs Sin his Conſcience charges him with; and he hears God calling, as it were from Heaven to him, and ſaying, O Vain Young Man! I will ſhortly reckon with thee for all thy Sinful Delights: I have them every one written down in my Book. Being deeply affected

herewithal (which we ſuppoſed under the Third Particular) he looks about him for a way of Eſcape; ſaying within-himſelf, How ſhall I avoid this terrible Account, with the dreadful Condemnation and Eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is Conſequent thereon? As the Jaylor, Act 16 30 <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi> And now, if the Lord in His Free Love &amp; Infinite Mercy ſave from flying to the ſtrong Hold of Self-Righteouſneſs for Safety, which is as natural and common, as it is dangerous and fatal I ſay, if it pleaſe God, by ſuch a word as that, Iſa. 64.6. <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags;</hi> to diſcover the Vanity hereof; and withal, to make diſcovery of JESUS CHRIST as the Only &amp; Alſufficient Saviour, Act. 4 12 <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is no other Name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be Saved.</hi> And as there <hi>Is</hi> no other Saviour, ſo there <hi>Needs</hi> no other: <hi>For He is Able to Save to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by Him; ſeeing He ever lives to make Interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Who came into the world to Ranſom loſt Souls from Sin and Wrath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Job.</hi> 6.38. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. Whoſe Arms are always open to receive all that come aright unto Him, how vile ſoever they have been.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001324_0020_0FB27EE9C45C60F8"/>
Who never did nor will He, <hi>in any wiſe caſt out ſuch as do come,</hi> Joh. 6 37 Then the Poor, Convinced, Trembling Sinner, is Enabled by the mighty Power of God (even the Exceeding Greatneſs of that Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19) to conſent that Chriſt ſhall be his Saviour, and to accept of Him on his own Terms: And this is true Faith, Joh. 1.12. <hi>Put to as many as Received Him, to them gave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                        </gap> that Believed on His Name.</hi> And this is Practically to Know the Great Truth contained in our Text; and when we come thus to Know it, we Know it as God would have us to do; whoſe very end in laying before us the danger of thoſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ways in which we have been walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to drive us to Chriſt, by whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we may Eſcape that danger. Thus to Believe in Chriſt, is Practically to Know the Truth in hand: which in the Firſt Thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Next thing included in a Practical Knowledge of the Truth before us, is Repentance.</hi> This Grace never fails to follow or rather to accompany Saving Faith But to imagine that Godly Sorrow for Sin goes before Faith, is the dangerous miſtake of many poor Souls, who think they muſt mourn for ſin
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001324_0021_0FB27EEB431F7040"/>
to fit them for Chriſt; and when they think they have ſo done, they hope Chriſt will accept of them; and to Him they go; (if it might be called going to Chriſt;) but with the Young Man in the Goſpel, <hi>too full of themſelves to have any room left for Jeſus Christ,</hi> Mat. 19.20. Its true, a Soul muſt be Humbled before it can Believe, but that Humiliation which goes before Faith, has not a drop of Godly Sorrow for Sin in it. No, it conſiſts rather in the ſenſe of an hard Heart, that can't mourn for Sin; yea, that is empty of all Good, and full of nothing but Sin; unworthy of the leaſt crumb of Mercy, ſo much as to be ſtayed from going down to the Pit for one ſingle Day. So that the Humbled Soul comes to acknowledge, (and how Evident is it?) that nothing but Free Grace can help it. Yea, after all its Sighs &amp; Groans, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Cries for Mercy, if God ſhould kick it away from His Footſtool (where it lies proſtrate, with its mouth in the Duſt) into the Bottomleſs Pit, yet God is Righteous! This is that Humiliation which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith: But brokenneſs of Heart for Sin follows after: To our ſenſe, feeling &amp; obſervation it does ſo; tho' it does really accompany faith, being infuſed with it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001324_0022_0FB27EECC036AC18"/>
into the Penitent Believing Soul. Thus tis a ſenſe of the Love of God in Chriſt to a moſt vile, wretched Sinner, that breaks the Heart, fills it with ſhame and ſorrow; yea quite melts it down into Penitential Tears, which now at the firſt diſcovery of the Everlaſting Love of GOD, the Father of Mercies, thro' a ſweet JESUS, do flow free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that newly Created Principle of Life in the Soul, as Waters from a Living Spring. Search the Scriptures, and ſee if it be not ſo? Ezek. 16 63. <hi>That thou mayeſt Remember and be Confounded, and never Open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Mark the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexion; <hi>Then aſhamed, when I am pacified.</hi> You know that without (or, which is all one, before) Faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, (<hi>Heb</hi> 11.6) by Repentance or any act of Obedience: But being United to Chriſt by Faith, the Soul derives Vertue &amp; Strength from the full Fountain of Life, to mourn for Sin, even all Sin, as the greateſt Evil; as againſt GOD and CHRIST. Oh, that ever I ſhould offend &amp; grieve a GOD ſo Good, whom I now ſee to be my Loving Friend &amp; Father in Chriſt! And He Loved me, while I was polluted in my Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001324_0023_0FB27EF579D4D710"/>
kicking againſt His Bowels, Ezek. 16 6, 8. <hi>And when I paſſed by thee, &amp; ſaw thee polluted in thine own Blood, I ſaid unto thee, Live: — And thy time was the time of Love.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>We Love Him becauſe He firſt Loved us.</hi> Ungrateful Wretch that I am! that ever I ſhould make the Lord of Angels, to ſtand and knock at the Door of my Heart, <hi>til His Head was filled with Deu &amp; His Locks with the Drops of the Night,</hi> Cant. 5.2. And all this after He had Loved me, and Dyed for me, that He might waſh me from my Sins in His own Blood! Thus the Soul melts, when Chriſt ſpeaks Peace, by the ſweet ſtill Voice of His Spirit. And this is true Repentance, taken in a more reſtrained ſenſe; for largely taken it includes New Obedience; and Faith alſo is neceſſarily implied in it: But we are ſpeaking of theſe Graces diſtinctly; and New Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the Third and Laſt thing compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Practical Knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Saving Faith, &amp; that Repentance which is unto Life, will be fruitful in Good Works.</hi> The Soul that has taſted the bitterneſs of Sin, cannot now drink in Iniquity like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as heretofore it has done. And who ever has had a ſight of Chriſt, by Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; taſted that the Lord is Gracious, will be

teſtifying his Thankfulneſs by Sincere, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Univerſal Obedience. He will not allow himſelf in the Omiſſion of any known Duty: his failings &amp; ſhort comings, backwardneſs to, and Spiritual Deadneſs in Duty, is a Burden which rather than any thing in the World, he would get rid of. And he is ſtill endeavouring to preſs forward. All that he has Done he thinks not worth looking on; he does as it were forget it, thro' the earneſt Deſire that he has to thoſe things which are before; even thoſe further Degrees of Obedience, which he preſſes after, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. And this is New Obedience; and this is Practically to Know the Great Truth before us; And thus would God have Young Men to Know it; Eccl. 12.13, 14. <hi>Fear God, and keep His Commandments, — For God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing; whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</hi> Seeing we look for Chriſts coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>what manner of Perſons ought we to be, in all Holy Converſation and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Thus much in Anſwer to the Firſt <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. II. <hi>Why would God have Young Men to Know that they muſt come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001324_0025_0FB27EF9AD031628"/>Anſw. 1. <hi>That ſo they may Live and be to His Glory.</hi> Vain Youths do nothing but Diſhonour God, before they come to the Knowledge, of which we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now, this Vain, Ungodly Life, is quite beſide, and contrary to the great End for which we are Made, Preſerved and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. But the thorough Knowledge of this Truth, would ſet us upon Glorifying God; and this is one great reaſon why God would have us to Know it. But they who are moſt concerned in this Text and Doctrine, cannot, as yet, feel the ſtrength of ſuch a Motive. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord Reſpects our own Everlaſting Good and Advantage herein.</hi> He looks down from Heaven and ſees the Generality of Young Men and Women merrily poſting along the Broad Way that leads to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Eternal Damnation, and out of Pity &amp; tender Compaſſion He calls after them to make a ſtop, and ſeriouſly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whither they are going, and what the End of this Courſe will be? Whether it would not be better for them to turn quite about, and to get in at the Strait Gate, &amp; walk on in the Narrow Way, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Difficult, ſince it leads to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and Glory? Mat. 7.12, 14.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001324_0026_0FB27EFB0AEA1528"/>
                     <hi>Enter ye in at the Strait Gate, for Wide is the Gate, and Broad is the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Becauſe Strait is the Gate, &amp; Narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Thus God Bleſſed for ever, who can no wiſe be profited by His Creatures, would have us Know this Truth for our own Good, Job 5.27. &amp; 22.2.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. III. <hi>Whence is it, that Young Men are ſo unwilling to Know, that they muſt come to Judgment; and their Hearts and Lives be Expoſed to Publick View then?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>It is partly thro' the Temptations of Satan, their Potent, Subtil and Malicious adverſary.</hi> This Roaring Lion makes it his buſineſs to devour Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Its partly alſo through the Evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Solicitations of wicked Companions.</hi> And how prevalent are Evil Examples! It is exceeding natural for us to be drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thereby: Why elſe is that Prohibition given, Exod. 23.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a Multitude to do Evil?</hi> Sad Experience aſſures us that it is too true with reſpect to the preſent Riſing Generation. Young Men do ſee, that, for the moſt part, thoſe who are Young like themſelves do take their ſwing in Youthful Vanities, and are little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about the Practical Knowledge of the Truth in hand, ſo as to Believe, Repent, and Obey the Goſpel. If ſome few are in good earneſt for Religion they are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Scorn, as too Preciſe, if not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Hypocrites. But this is not all; the Devils Children will Tempt one another; and draw by Solicitations as well as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

How hard is it for a Poor Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Young Man or Maiden, (tis of and to ſuch I am ſpeaking) to withſtand theſe pleaſing Solicitations! And how many are undone for ever by Evil Company! Yet others won't take warning. Thus, you ſee Satan is not the only Deſtroyer of men!

Conſider then, who &amp; what has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hindrance of your Converſion; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void thoſe Perſons, Things &amp; Practices, as you would ſave your Souls: If I gain not this Point, I loſe all my Labour; and you loſe your precious Souls for ever: Tis, as we uſe to ſay, a deſperate caſe! <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh &amp; Live;</hi> or if you keep them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>their way leads down to Hell.</hi> What ſhall I ſay to you in this caſe? Do this one thing; The next time thou art Enticed by Sinners, and as it were compelied to conſent; only ask them who thus act the part of Satan, Whether they will ſtand &amp; anſwer for themſelves and thee too at Chriſts Bar? And if they can give thee no Security in this matter, thou haſt a juſt Plea for thy Non-compliance with their Solicitations.</p>

Warn you of this Danger; For to think we are Converted when we are not, is the ready way never to be Converted.

And that not only the Deed, but the Will alſo is the work of His own Good Pleaſure: And when you have found your ſelves thus Spiritually Dead, and unable to think ſo much as one Good Thought, you have alſo found and felt the Eternal Father drawing you to Jeſus Chriſt, and enabling you to lie at His Feet for Mercy, acknowledging that it would be Juſt with Him to deny you the leaſt crumb or drop, to ſatisfy your Spiritual Hunger and Thirſt; yea, and to throw you into Everlaſting Burnings: And then, while you have been Crying for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or Groaning under Miſery, God has

But rather get alone, and begin with (the Practice of the Firſt Counſel) Conſideration: Realize it to you ſelves, when alone, that there is a Heaven of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable Glory above, and an Hell of unutterable Torment below; and think with your ſelf, In one of theſe places, I muſt be as long as the ETERNAL has a Being: and that according as I improve, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my time here, even that little inch of fleeting time, that God may yet indulge me withal.
