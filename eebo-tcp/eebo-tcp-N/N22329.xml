            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Heb. iii. 4.</bibl>
               <q>—<hi>He that built all things is God.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Greek word <hi>(Kataſkeuáſas)</hi> tranſlated <hi>built</hi> in our Bible, includes in its meaning the notion of <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing,</hi> and is here uſed by the apoſtle to aſſert the divinity of Chriſt, the Son of God. For if he <hi>built</hi> all things, and orders and governs them as the ſcriptures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, he muſt be our Creator—God emphatically—the object of our adoration and obedience.</p>
            <p>IT is not however my deſign to conſider the text pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in this view, but to draw your attention to the great Architect of univerſal nature, to the order, and beauty, and bleſſings of creation, and from thence to the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of adoration and obedience which we owe, and ought ever to pay to our Creator, Governor, and preſerver. For if we turn our mind to the contemplation of the world which we inhabit, and conſider it with due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is impoſſible not to ſuppoſe it to have been formed by ſome infinitely great, and intelligent being. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſtructure ſhews his power, the contrivance of its parts, his wiſdom. The diverſity that appears on its ſurface, champaign country and hills, affords fields for tillage, gives riſe to rivers and brooks, and by promoting the circulation and free courſe of the air, adds greatly to the ſalubrity of that grand ſupporter of animal life. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables with which its ſurface is covered give pleaſure to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029480_0005_0FE13BD68BFB90E0"/>
the eye by their pleaſing variety, and by their artleſs, yet perfect diſpoſition; and relieve it from fatigue by their refreſhing verdure. To the ſupport too of life they daily adminiſter by the natural and healthful ſupply of food for man and for beaſt which they afford. Materials for building, and for cloathing, for fuel we alſo derive from the vegetable world, by which the human body is ſecured from ſtorms, and heat, and cold—from all the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the weather.—All theſe things are for the uſe, and and conveniency of man.</p>
            <p>AND ſo are the innumerable animals ſupported on the earth, and in the ſea. They all conduce to his emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pleaſure. They ſerve him for food, for cloathing for tillage, for bearing burdens, for tranſporting him from place to place—in a variety of ways making his life more eaſy and delightful to him.</p>
            <p>BUT while we contemplate the earth, and find ourſelves bleſſed in its rich productions, can we avoid caſting our eyes on the Sun, the great inſtrument of light and heat, and of all their pleaſing and happy effects, the cauſer of night and day, the diverſifier of climes and ſeaſons, the meaſurer of time, the grand operator in all the productions of nature? The nightly regent of the ſky, the ſplended moon, with the glittering ſtars, and rolling planets, add to the grandeur of the celeſtial dome, and not only miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the uſe and conveniency of man, but to the ſtate and magnific<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ce of the great whole, and render fully effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual the united influence of all its varied parts.—<q>Theſe are thy works, parent of good—Almighty—thine this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal frame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to inanimate matter, and to animals, the power and goodneſs of God was not confined. To have built the world, and left it void of an intelligent being to behold, contemplate; and admire its beauties, to enjoy its bleſſings, and to adore its Almighty author, the ſource of being and of all good, would have ſhewn a deficiency of power or of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. So did not the Supreme Architect. Man created in his own image, he placed as the inhabitant and regent
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029480_0006_0FE13BDE3105BE60"/>
of his material creation. He gave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> faculties to enjoy its bleſſings; he endued him with reaſon, to admire and contemplate its beauty, and order; and to lead his mind and affections up to Him; that he might adore, and praiſe, and obey, the Almighty author of ALL, the ſource of happineſs to every being,</p>
            <p>BUT not only in this world does the creative power of God ſhew itſelf, nor is man his only intelligent creature, Worlds on worlds appear to hang in the immenſity of ſpace, and probably are inhabited by beings intelligent as well as we, and poſſibly in a far greater degree: And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels we know are the creatures of his hand, the miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits that fulfil his will by executing his commands. Their nature we know not; their office divine truth hath revealed to us.</p>
            <p>LOOK now at the grandeur, order, uſe of the various parts of the creation, eſpecially of this world which is moſt open to our obſervation, and ſay, Could it be the work of blind chance? Could it have been from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity and neceſſarily exiſted? Could it have made itſelf? Blind chance could never have produced regularity, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of deſign. The conſtant mutability of the parts and ſcenes of the world ſhew that it could not have been from eternity, for what is perpetually changing cannot be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It could not have made itſelf, for that ſuppoſes it to have acted before it had a being; its mutability alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the notion of its being neceſſarily exiſtent.</p>
            <p>IT remains then that the world is the production of an infinite, Almighty Being, intelligent, good, wiſe, and, in every point of view, amiable beyond conception. He made all things that exiſt, whether animate or inanimate, brute or rational, viſible or inviſible, material or ſpiritual. He built them all; be they thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, men, angels; his hand formed them; his will produced them; his word ſpoke them into being, <hi>He</hi> therefore <hi>who built all things is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS God is a being infinite, eternal, unchangeable, without body, parts or paſſions; the centre and fountain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029480_0007_0FE13BE2D4868FF8"/>
of all perfections; the great Architect of all nature, the Creator, the Builder, the Framer of every thing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts; whoſe word is power abſolute; whoſe will is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and juſtice, and goodneſs, and mercy, and truth infinite, and incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>THAT God who built all things—called every thing that exiſts from non-entity into being—ſhould preſerve and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the creatures of his hand, is the firſt dictate of nature. For what power leſs than that which created, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Univerſe? What power leſs than that which built, can direct the vaſt machine? Who preſerves the ſun, and moon, and ſtars ſteady and unwearied in their courſe? Who commands the certain return of the various ſeaſons of the year, or the ſweet viciſſitudes of day and night? Who diſpences cold and heat, clouds and ſunſhine rain and dew as the various exigencies of the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but that God who built all things, and every thing that is; and who preſerves and governs them all ſo as beſt to promote the benefit and happineſs of the whole.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to man principally was the text written. We ſee what ample proviſion the divine munificence hath made for the ſupport and pleaſure of man's body, and may we be ever thankful for it, ever praiſe the name of God moſt high for his goodneſs, ever uſe with temperance the good things he hath provided for our ſubſiſtance, to his glory and our own benefit.</p>
            <p>BUT remember, God who hath done all this for you, hath given you a rational, an immortal part, a ſoul as well as a body. He breathed into the noſtrils of the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, the <hi>breath of life,</hi> and man became a <hi>living ſoul.</hi> By the operation of this rational, intelligent ſoul, you can be made ſenſible of the being of your Creator, of his wiſdom, power, goodneſs, juſtice, truth, and of all his infinite perfections; and tho' you cannot comprehend them, you know that they muſt be in him—that he cannot be without them.</p>
            <p>THAT he loves you, appears from the bountiful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he hath made for the happineſs of your body. And can
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029480_0008_0FE13BEA1BA2CC70"/>
you immagine he would neglect your ſoul? that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part which muſt live forever? Would he take more care of a periſhing body, that <hi>that</hi> might be delighted for a time, than of the immortal ſoul, that <hi>that</hi> might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py forever? That love which brought you into being, which built the frame of your body, which covered your bones with fleſh and ſkin, which braced it with nerves and ſinews, which made the blood to circulate thro' the veſſels provided for it—that love framed alſo your ſoul accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the model of his own image—conſequently for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs divine with himſelf.</p>
            <p>AND that the love which brought man into being ſtill continues, appears from God's giving his only begotten Son to be his Redeemer, when he had fallen into a ſtate of infirmity and death thro' ſin; from the revelation of his will which He made thro' his Son by his prophets, and by his Son himſelf; from the laws and directions, and promiſes which that revelation contains, for the conduct of the life of man, both what he ought to believe and do to obtain the full favour of God; and from the bleſſed gift of his own moſt Holy Spirit, to do that in and for man which man cannot do for himſelf—to regenerate and renew his nature, and build it up in faith and holineſs, that he may become capable of that happineſs with his all gracious Creator for which he was originally deſigned.</p>
            <p>HE that hath done ſo much will aſſuredly do all things for the ſalvation of all men, that can comport with his own infinite juſtice and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT let it be remembered that man has a will of his own, and that every man is what his will makes him to be. Since the departure of human nature from God in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Adam, this will hath become perverſe, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ungovernable, impetuous, indiſpoſed to ſubmit to the will of God, in which every poſſible happineſs of a rational creature muſt forever conſiſt. And how far the power and juſtice of God can controul this will, unleſs by influences, motives, perſuations conſiſtently with its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, i. e. without deſtroying the nature of man, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029480_0009_0FE13BEF193E3FF0"/>
from him the freedom of choice, is hard to conceive. And if the freedom of choice be taken from him, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be a man and becomes a machine, and neither vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue nor vice, good nor evil can be attributed to him more than to an irrational animal; nor can he be the object of reward or puniſhment.</p>
            <p>TO direct this will to its true end, ſubmiſſion to God and dependence on him, is the deſign of all the laws and directions which God hath given to man, either by the light of reaſon, or the more explicit declarations of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; of all the threats and promiſes which God hath made to man; of all the diſpenſations of his providence; of all the motions and inſpirations of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>IN this ſenſe alſo is God the builder of all things; not only of the material world for the ſubſiſtance, comfort, and pleaſure of man, but of that ſtate of righteouſneſs, and peace, and holineſs, in which man's happineſs muſt conſiſt; on which only it can be built.</p>
            <p>IT becomes therefore neceſſary that he ſubmit to the will of God in all things, that he obey every thing which God commands, and refrain from every thing which God forbids. For God being the fountain of all goodneſs and happineſs, can command or forbid his creatures nothing but what is for their advantage—eſpecially nothing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in itſelf, or unneceſſary to the good of the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>ON this ground the right of private judgment is left o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and free to every one; for every one muſt determine for himſelf what the will of God is—what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded—what he hath forbidden. Only he muſt take care that he judge <hi>right;</hi> for if he judge <hi>wrong,</hi> he does ſo at his own peril—God expects he will judge according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth; and hath given him ability and direction ſufficient to form a true judgment.</p>
            <p>HOW far ignorance, and weakneſs, and prejudice will operate in favour of a man who errs in his judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029480_0010_0FE13BF74BAC0D68"/>
the will of God, muſt be left to him who knows the heart, and can diſcern the thoughts and intentions. He is merciful and juſt, and will judge righteous judgment. On his goodneſs we depend, that he will not impute the errors of the head, to the heart, nor condemn any one for thoſe miſtakes into which he was unavoidably led, thro' ignorance, weakneſs, or any other unſurmountable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>A SINCERE diſpoſition however to obey the will of God, will make us very careful, that we let no vicious affection of mind, no evil propenſity of heart, no undue attachment to party, no love of wealth or pleaſure, no ſiniſter purpoſe or diſpoſition of any kind, weaken, or blind, or pervert our judgment where the will of God is concerned. For theſe things nothing can be ſaid. He who judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment will condemn them; and we muſt endure the penalty of our own perverſeneſs.</p>
            <p>SINCE then God, the builder of all things, built the world—the univerſe—things viſible and inviſible—all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ranks of beings—that his glory might ſhine forth in the happineſs of his creatures—Since ſubmiſſion to his will, the being entirely and abſolutely what he wills us to be, is the only ſure foundation for perfect happineſs, let us remember that God who built all things hath built them in perfect order and juſt proportion, and be induced from that conſideration ever to conduct ourſelves according to the due order of our own nature, and in juſt proportion to the ſtate of our being.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD the order of the material creation, and thence take a leſſon of inſtruction. He who built all things in juſt order and proportion, to preſerve that order which he had eſtabliſhed, appointed the great law of gravitation, and by his Almighty <hi>ſiat</hi> it effectually anſwers his purpoſe to this very day. The word of the Supreme Architect, the grand maſter builder of the univerſe, is the word of power. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to the human eye contradictory are the motions of the heavenly bodies, and of the different parts of this globe which we inhabit. We ſee not how every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029480_0011_0FE13BFBE24B8E68"/>
ſuch progreſſive and retrograde-motions, preſerves its order and place, nor where the the apparently wild confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ends. By the law of gravitation, every motion is performed, every movement made without error, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury, from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies of enormous ſize, down to the nouriſhment of the meaneſt vegetable, and probably of the higheſt animal.</p>
            <p>WHAT attraction or gravitation is in the natural, that <hi>love</hi> is in the moral world. Both are appointed by the great author of nature; by him who built all things, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate and inanimate; and both would ſurely anſwer the end for which they were appointed, was it not for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the human will.</p>
            <p>THE material creation hath no will of its own, and therefore it obeys the will of its great builder, and anſwers the purpoſe for which it was intended. But God gave man an own will, and reaſon to direct it. <q>He made him upright, but they have ſought out many inventions;</q> and among their other experiments, the effort to ſecure happineſs to themſelves, by purſuing the dictates of their own will, independant on the will of their maker who built all things, hath aſſailed and beguiled them. Hence the ſame or ſimilar diſorders have ariſen among them, as would ariſe in the material world, ſhould the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation break the bounds and proportions ſet them by their creator, and run counter to his deſign in their formation.</p>
            <p>HAPPILY, he who built them ſuperintends them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns their motions, and gives them ability to perform his will; and ſtill they obediently fulfil his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT man hath forgotten the great law of his moral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the law of <hi>love;</hi> and by departing from the will of his maker in perſuit of his own inventions, hath filled the world with evils deſtructive of his happineſs, and almoſt of his preſent being—with war; and bloodſhed, and murder, and treachery, and backbiting, and ſlander, and defamation, and every evil work.</p>
            <p>TO be convinced that theſe things do deſtroy the peace
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029480_0012_0FE13C023A81E7C0"/>
and happineſs of man in the world, look at their effects—behold the miſchiefs they produce. Who can be ſecure where the tongue or pen of the ſlanderer prevails? where the beſt actions are converted into the fouleſt crimes, and aſcribed to the vileſt motives? who can reſt in peace where houſe breaking and robbery prevail? and would you know the horrible effects of war and civil diſſentions, look at the preſent diſtracted condition of Europe—look, and tremble at the horrible view—look, and rejoice, and bleſs God that your own country is at preſent exempt from thoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calamities—look, and pray earneſtly to him that he would graciouſly preſerve you in ſecurity, and diſpoſe the nations of the world to be at peace with you—look, and aſk yourſelves this one queſtion, from whence proceed the evils of ill neighbour-hood? the deſtructions wrought by deceitful and villainous men? the devaſtations of tyranny and war?—From the want of that <hi>love</hi> which God hath inſtituted to be the grand cement of the brother-hood of men.—the operating principle by which the whole human race were to have been kept in unity and concord, even as the law of gravitation pervades and keeps in order the whole material creation. And no other way can infatuated man return to the enjoyment of happineſs but by returning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently to ſubmiſſion to the will of the great Architect of all things, and living in love with his brethren. Peace is the happy fruit of love, &amp; quietneſs and ſecurity of peace.</p>
            <p>"FROM whence come wars and fightings"? aſks St. James, <q>Come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?</q> Men luſt after, and covet what does not belong to them; what is the property of others; and others will not quietly part with what is, or what they think is their own. War therefore is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I wiſh I was warranted to ſay, not always founded in injuſtice.</p>
            <p>AGAINST injuſtice of every kind, the utmoſt art of man can contrive no ſecurity equal to that which our holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath inſtituted—<q>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LOVE being the grand principle ordained by the author
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029480_0013_0FE13C078BDDEB08"/>
of nature to preſerve peace and order among men; being too the principle which pervades Chriſt's religion, and on which all its morality is founded, ſhews ſtrongly that Chriſt's religion came from the ſame ſource, from which ſorung the nature of man—from him who built all things.</p>
            <p>HUMAN laws reach only the outward actions of men. They can command only the hands and the feet, and god make them obey. But they take no hold of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The laws of God can alone reach that inward principle of right and wrong; for as he only knows the thoughts and deſigns, he only can command them. He gave to man the principle of benevolence and love, and that principle alone can regulate the conduct of man ſo as to make him a mild and placid being. Diveſt him of it, and he becomes ferocious in the extreme. Compared to him wolves and tygers are harmeleſs animals. The reaſon which his maker endued him to direct his conduct, and make his benevolent propenſities of the higheſt uſe, being perverted from its true object and preſſed into the ſervice of pride and malice, enables him to purſue their dictates with the cruelty and ferocity of demons—with the deſtructive violence of accurſed ſpirits.—Nothing which this world affords can illuſtrate its nature, or exemplify the horrid operations of its maleyolence. Single victims of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race are too ſmall to ſatiate its vengeance. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands multitudes, whole nations to glut its fury: and then laments the weakneſs of nature that could carry it no further in the horrid road of deſtruction and revenge than to kill the body.</p>
            <p>FROM this hateful object—the human heart filled with pride, inflamed by malice, and directed by reaſon and cunning—turn your attention to the ſame human heart bleſſed and ſoftened by the divine ſpirit of love and good will; directed by the ſame reaſon, only illuminated and refined by the gracious inſpirations of the Almighty, the bleſſed influence of the Holy Spirit who is love—infinite, unbounded love.</p>
            <p>IN the ſame proportion as any man is actuated by love,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029480_0014_0FE13C0F1D52D600"/>
he is rendered incapable of injuring his neighbour: For whoever willingly injured thoſe whom he loved? <q>If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the ſcripture, thou ſhall love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,</q> ſaid St. James <q>ye do well.</q> 
               <hi>That</hi> law forbids every thing by which our neighbour can be injured, and commands every thing by which he can be benefited. It ſays, <q>Do not commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultry;</q> It ſays alſo "Do not kill." It ſays alſo, <q>Do not ſteal, do not covet, do not bear falſe witneſs,</q> do not ſlander, do not injure thy neighbour in any matter.</p>
            <p>IN ſimilar terms St. Paul ſaith, <q>He that hath loved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, hath fulfilled the law.</q> For this law, <q>Thou ſhall not commit adultry;</q> and this law, <q>Thou ſhalt not kill;</q> and this law, "Thou ſhalt not ſteal" and this law, "Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs;" and this law, <q>Thou ſhalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfiling of the law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LET men be actuated by this love, which is an emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the all-glorious Architect of all nature—from him that built all things, and tell me where are wars, and tumults, and murder, and bloodſhed, and rapine, and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and violence, and ſlander—where is any evil work? They are fled; they are become as ſmoak; like cloud after rain they are paſſed, and gone, and vaniſhed away—no more to curſe the earth; no more to ſet neighbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt neighbour, nation againſt nation, and people againſt people.</p>
            <p>THIS happy ſtate, my friends, God intended for man even in this world, and therefore commanded every man to love his neighbour as himſelf.</p>
            <p>YOUR profeſſed deſign, Venerable brethren of the Maſonic Fraternity, to whom I have now the pleaſure of addreſſing myſelf, is to co-operate with the Almighty and infinitely gracious Architect of nature, according as your various
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029480_0015_0FE13C13B5F64908"/>
ſtations ſhall permit, to ſpread this divine principle of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and love thro' the world, and make it effectual to the grand purpoſe of human happineſs.</p>
            <p>THAT this principle proceeds from the author of nature, the author of order and peace, appears from the nature of the world which he made in juſt order &amp; exact proportion; from the nature of man whom he formed to live in the world when he had made it; from the nature of that holy religion by which man is redeemed from death and made partaker of the hope of a bleſſed reſurrection to eternal life. This religion, I truſt in God's goodneſs you all profeſs. By the principles of your holy religion; by the priciples of the order of Maſons, I conjure you to keep ever in mind the grand object you ought ever to have in view, the cultivation of love, and unity, and concord; and of courſe, of order and peace and good will among men. Endeavour therefore to baniſh all ſtrife, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and ill will from among men. Diſcountenance eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temper, every diſpoſition which tends to diſturb the peace and quiet of civil ſociety, or to make men leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant of the laws and regulations by which the peace and happineſs of our country is now ſecured, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that by cultivating order, and peace, and benevolent diſpoſitions among men; by checking every tendency to rapine, and war, and confuſion among them, you co-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate with the deſigns of the infinitely wiſe and good Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator who built all things; who made man, not to worry but to be mutually beneficial to each other; and that then we moſt reſemble him, when we moſt cultivate thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and diſpoſitions which peculiarly flow from him, the author and fountain of all that is good—To whom be glory forever.</p>
            <p>MATTERS which relate to war ought to be left to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and rulers of our country—To them they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly belong, to them the conſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath committed them: Their abilities are equal to the deciſion, and we have no reaſon to doubt their integrity.</p>
            <p>LET us then confine ourſelves to our own proper duty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029480_0016_0FE13C1AB8FD2450"/>
every one in his ſtation; remembering that as God hath built all things in due order, in juſt weight, and exact proportion, our duty requires that we have a regard to order, to the reaſon, nature, and proportions of things in all our conduct.—That love and good-will is the only principle that can ſupport this order, that comports with this reaſon, that reaches the nature or proportion of things among which we live:—That love is in the moral, what gravitation is in the natural world, the law of the creator and that it would as invariably produce its full effect in the moral, as gravitation does in the natural world, was it not counteracted by the corrupt and perveſe wills of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and obſtinate men.</p>
            <p>OUR duty requires that we counteract this perverſity of the human will; and as nothing can do this more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than the ſilent perſuaſion of a good example, let it be the earneſt care of every Maſon, to ſet that good example to others. "Let brotherly love continue", is the motto of their order, let it be alſo the governing principle of their conduct. Let them do nothing thro' ſtrife or ill will, but every thing in love and affection. So ſhall the God of love bleſs them.
