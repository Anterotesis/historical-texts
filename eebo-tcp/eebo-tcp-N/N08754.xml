            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>NOW there was in the reign of G***** the king, a mighty ſpirit of tribulation. And the great men of the land were laying upon the people bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of great weight, yea, heavier burthens than were home by their fathers, or their fathers farthers before them.

Now it came to paſs that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort time this good man did as he promiſed unto the people.

And behold, they were affronted thereat, and they were full of envy againſt this man, becauſe he had ſpoken well of the people. And when it was ſo that he had wrote even a forty-fifth letter unto them, that they took him out of the houſe of his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and put him into a faſt place, which place is called a tower even unto this day. And they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his dwelling, and ſearched for his papers, and all his ſecret workings, and they took them every one. And behold, when they had found theſe, that they took him from the faſt place, and baniſhed him afar off beyond the ſea. And he was left there, and commanded not to return; for behold it was ſeemly unto the elders that he ſhould be put away from amongſt them.</p>

In the beginning was a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and this favourite was B***, and B*** was with the K***. Many were the things wrought by him, and without him was not any evil done that was

done. In him was pride, and that pride was found to be the deſtruction of men Now there was a man returned from the land whereunto he was ſent, and alſo perſecuted, whoſe name was Wilkes, the ſame came back for a plague unto evil doers, And he abode within the gates of the city many days, and put his name among thoſe who were to be choſen elders of the land. But they caſt him from among them ſo that he was not one of the elect, and he went his way. Howbeit he had in another roll his name written (as is recorded in the Chronicles) and he was choſen. Now when B*** heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſaw what they had done amongſt them, he was very wroth, and wiſt not what to do, for this ſame man had ſtung him aforetime So he ſtirred up his fellows againſt him, to perſecute him, that he might not abide with them. And behold they grew exceeding powerful, inſomuch that they took him away from the people, and put him in a ſtrong hold. And the people grew very wroth, and was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereat. And they aſſembled in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by thouſands, and would not be at reſt, becauſe of the things which were done. And they made great noiſes together; and many got for themſelves chalk which was white for to make a mark on every man as he paſſed, thus, 45 And this mark was put upon the coverings of the heads and the backs of all who paſſed this way or that way in honour of their great idols, Wilkes and Liberty. Until the even of many days did they do theſe things.</p>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>And there ſhall come a fox from the north, yea, and a he-lion ſhall rouze himſelf in the ſouth, and they ſhall be at war, and ſhall not dwell at quiet. And there ſhall come diſtreſſes and tumults upon the land, even in this great city, and the oppreſſed ſhall riſe up by hundreds and by thouſands And in theſe days locuſts ſhall overſpread all the face of the earth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the words before us, the prophet ſeems clearly to indicate to us the troubleſome vexations and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing animoſities which muſt of neceſſity prevail, in ſome future time, amongſt a particular people. And he endeavours to point out the beginning of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in ſo very diſtinct a manner, as if he deſigned to give the inhabitants a timely warning of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cataſtrophe, that, by proper means, they might, in ſome meaſure, prevent its coming ſo ſevere upon them as utterly to deſtroy them in their ſins. He not only propheſies in <hi>general terms,</hi> but is alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly careful reſpecting the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> when and where theſe things ſhall come to paſs.</p>
            <p>A fox, ſays he, ſhall come from the NORTH— a lion from the SOUTH— and there ſhall come <hi>distreſſes</hi> in THIS great city—and in THESE days
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011191_0014_0F85CD63C7655F20"/>
locuſts ſhall overſpread the face of the land. So you find, my brethren, that when the fox is come from the <hi>north</hi> —and the he-lion has rouzed himſelf in the <hi>ſouth</hi>— diſtreſſes and tumults are to be expected in the city, and over the whole face of the land; and, that hundreds and thouſands of oppreſſed people ſhall riſe up together—and, when theſe things are ſo far accompliſhed, then, in THESE days, locuſts ſhall come in upon us and dwell on the land.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the words in general, as they ſtand before us, it may be neceſſary, for the further illuſtration of this paſſage, to conſider particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What we are to underſtand by <hi>A fox coming from the North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. How, and in what manner, <hi>a he-lion is to rouze himſelf in the ſouth,</hi> and why <hi>they ſhall be at war, and ſhall not dwell at quiet.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. Conſider what <hi>diſtreſſes and tumults ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the land,</hi> ſo that the <hi>oppreſſed ſhall riſe up by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and by thouſands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Give ſome deſcription of the locuſts which are to <hi>overſpread the face of the whole land.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conclude with ſome practical improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the whole. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What we are to underſtand by <hi>A fox co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the north.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may appear neceſſary, for the right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the text, now under our conſideration, that the book of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> was, originally, wrote in London; and therefore, when the prophet ſays, <hi>"even</hi> in this <hi>great city,"</hi> he muſt be underſtood to mean <hi>that</hi> place: and of courſe it follows, that the land ſpoken of is no other than that of <hi>South-Britain,</hi> on the north of which lieth that part which is called <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence our admired penman hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us the <hi>fox</hi> ſhould come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011191_0015_0F85CD646F7DC6A0"/>And, as it may not be altogether diſagreeable, or in the leaſt unworthy the notice of my hearers, I will firſt give a ſhort deſcription of theſe animals, and then proceed. In general, foxes are very remarkable for their deep cunning. They will, when purſued by hunters, make urine on their tails, and ſtrike them upon the faces of the dogs. When trapped by a gin, they have been known to bite of the part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and ſo eſcaped. And being hungry, they feign themſelves dead, on whom the fowls lighting, for prey, they riſe and devour them. But, as there are different kinds of foxes, ſo their artful inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as various. That kind of fox, mentioned by the prophet, the generality of commentators agree to be the BOOT-FOX, and deſcribe him with an extraordinary long head, ſmooth tongue, and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable long eyes. His legs are covered with a kind of mottled, woolly furr, though bare at the joints of his knees, and his feet to be cloven. This fox, my beloved, it is well known, has been amongſt us for ſome time, and did, originally, come from the north, anſwering every deſcription that is given of him by the Prophet in the former part of this chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the ſixteenth verſe: <hi>And the fox that ſhall appear in high places, and, by his cunning, get even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſes of the moſt high, ſhall be a favourite fox. He ſhall feed upon dainties, and he ſhall have influence over many foxes; yea, and lambs ſhall lie down before him and do reverence. But the lions of ſpirit, and the wolves, and their young ones, ſhall ſeek his deſtruction continually.</hi> From hence it is plain, that this ſame fox is now amongſt us, and has been ſeen COUR<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing it up and down in high foreſts, and, by his ſecret fawnings, and deteſtable undermining attempss, he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011191_0016_0F85CD68EE7791A0"/>
has got into good feed, and that, as it were, unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. We have, my brethren, too long borne with his ferriting ſcratches; we have already reaſon to curſe the time that ever ſuch an animal exiſted amongſt us. O my beloved, take care! be upon the watch! this hungry Reynard ſtill lives—ſtill acts— ſtill rules! and unleſs the other part of this prophecy had taken place, we had been utterly undone for ever. Having conſidering thus far, I ſhall proceed, in the next place, to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How, and what manner, <hi>a he-lion is to rouze himſelf in the ſouth,</hi> and why they <hi>ſhall be at war with each other,</hi> ſo as never to <hi>dwell at quiet.</hi> If our eyes my beloved, have been in the leaſt open, we ſurely muſt have perceived, that the words of the Prophet, in this point alſo, have been fully veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and brought to paſs.—<hi>Yea, and a he-lion ſhall rouze himſelf in the</hi> SOUTH; that is, A he-lion ſhall rouze himſelf in ENGLAND You cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, nay, you muſt be ſenſible, that, of all beaſts, the lion is the moſt courageous. The pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt the Prophet hath here drawn, by way of ſimile, cannot be ſufficiently admired. Than the fox and the lion nothing can be more directly appoſite; not only the figure and ſize, but nature and principle. The one, unuſed to ſlattery and deceit, timidity and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice; the other, a noted partaker of each. With principles thus contraſted, no wonder that each on each ſhould caſt ſo black an eye, and be at variance, and ſhould not <hi>dwell at quiet.</hi> We well know, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that when a lion is brought from abroad, in order to be brought under ſome reſtraint, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a priſon, wherein he may be kept from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing the quiet of thoſe foxes that are generally the moſt crafty, and are the moſt afraid of him. My
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011191_0017_0F85CD6904CCF160"/>
brethren, apply this particular to the times in which we live: behold and ſee if nothing of this kind hath yet come to paſs amongſt us. It was the way of the antients to write by way of fable, and our prophet hath thought proper to adopt that pleaſing method above all others. To explain this part of our text, it may not be amiſs, therefore, to remark here, what we are to underſtand by a HE-LION. This accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſe of the learned, can mean no other than the reſolute Patriot, who has ſo much exerted himſelf in the behalf of his country; who has ever kept a jealous eye on the deſigns and mean artifices of the favourite <hi>boot-fox,</hi> and gloriouſly brought to open light what fear and cowardice have been always aſhamed to reveal. It is the noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of this lion that hath ſo terrified the whole neſt of foxes. He has, like <hi>Samſon,</hi> knit them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tail to tail, with a firebrand between each two, from which diſtreſs and entanglement they know not how to extricate and deliver themſelves. By way of trial they have, however, caſt him into a den; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he ſtill continues to cauſe in them a dread, that eaſily they cannot conquer and overcome: ſo that <hi>they ſtill are at war with each other, and do not dwell at quiet.</hi>—Proceed we now to conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What diſtreſſes and tumults ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the land, ſo that <hi>the oppreſſed ſhall riſe up by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and by thouſands.</hi> And firſt, my brethren, I ſhall conſider the diſtreſſes—Thoſe who are any way acquainted with life and the world, muſt, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, perceive, how diſtreſs and miſery fill our ſtreets. For the want of a proper ſupply of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the common neceſſaries of life, how many of our poor have been ſnatched off in their prime! Others advanced to old age, grey-hair'd ſubjects,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011191_0018_0F85CD69E5FB86A8"/>
tender fathers, affectionatte mothers, loyal friends, and honeſt Britons, O! how have they been taken from amongſt us by the cruel uſage of Poverty and Want! When corn and proviſions have been plenty; when Providence hath crowned our harveſts with abundance; how have our poor been debarred from partaking thereof, while the owners have ſtored their barns, and kept it ſhamefully back from thoſe who were ſtarving with hunger. Not only were theſe practices, beloved, paſſed over and winked at by men in power, but at that time it was known to be carried abroad to enemies—open enemies—profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemies! and ſold cheaper to them, by far, than we could poſſibly purchaſe at home. Add to this, the large quantities of wheat continually being caſt into the waters, which by long ſtanding, had been ſpoilt, and rendered uſeleſs—even to the DESPISED POOR.</p>
            <p>Who then can wonder at the riſings of the people or be amazed at the tumults (not abroad, but) at home? Is there not reaſon—ſufficient reaſon for theſe murmurings and complaints among the lower claſs of the people? The Prophet might very well lay a particular emphaſis here—<hi>and the oppreſſed</hi> SHALL <hi>riſe up, &amp;c.</hi>—Never had people more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exert what little ſpirit they had left in their own cauſe, before they were utterly deſtroyed.— Thus things were going on in a very <hi>foul</hi> way for their deſtruction. They ſaw them, and were wiſe. Fair and humble means were at firſt tried; petitions were offered; ſupplications were made to men in power, and to UNFEELING miniſters whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual promiſes were, They WOULD aſſiſt;—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions SHOULD lowered in their prices, and they might rely upon their IMMEDIATE conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011191_0019_0F85CD6A73679F48"/>
on and diſpatch. Theſe promiſes, we are now ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, were made to appeaſe the noiſe of the VUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAR, as they are ſtiled, for never was any thing done in their behalf in conſequence of thoſe <hi>promiſes,</hi> and they were left to ſhift for themſelves, and to do as well as people in their ſituation were capable of doing, without THEIR aſſiſtance.—In this manner were they kept in ſuſpenſe, ſtarving and to ſtarve, till Neceſſity (the mother of invention) taught them how to riſe in large bodies together, no longer to pray, but to demand. Then came forth, <hi>even in this great city,</hi> multitudes of machanics, various in their profeſſions, and firm in their reſolutions, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in their own defence, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fall by the ſword, than be in the midſt of plenty dying for the want of proper ſuſtenance and nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly conſidered the <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> and <hi>tumults</hi> which have come to paſs, according to the prophecy of the Prophet. I come now to give ſome deſcription of the <hi>locuſts</hi> which are to overſpread the face of the whole land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in theſe days, &amp;c.</hi> As there are of foxes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals kinds, ſo of locuſts the ſame. But, in general, every ſpecies of this inſect are accounted vile. Their nature is to herd many together, therefore vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes are reſembled by them. In <hi>Arabia,</hi> as well as in <hi>England,</hi> the people are infeſted with them; but, in theſe times, they more particularly infeſt the latter. They generally come upon <hi>corn,</hi> when ripe, and what they do not <hi>eat,</hi> they infect with their <hi>touch.</hi> They die whole ſwarms together; and, after death, they poiſon the air, and cauſe a peſtilence.—How happy our prophetic writer appears in his expreſſions and ſimilies, I leave to the determination of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers!
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011191_0020_0F85CD6B32268BF8"/>
Nothing could have been more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in anſwering his deſign to paint to the people the events of futurity, in this reſpect, than that of the <hi>locuſt.</hi> According to the deſcription I have given of that inſect, how ſtriking a reſemblance does it bear with the ſwarm of vile locuſts which was daily found in the weſtern patt of our renouned city, where numbers have been ſeen to aſſemble together in companies and flights, to accompliſh their evil deſigns. In the twelfth chapter of the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> the Prophet takes notice of the time when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, and what events follow, from verſe 88 to verſe 92. <hi>Now after the locuſts ſhall have perplexed the people, and have been even in one place years two and five, they ſhall divide themſelves apart. And it ſhall come to paſs, that when the old locuſts ſhall die away, that there ſhall be great joy and feaſting among the people. But behold, they ſhall fear the coming of another ſwarm, for they ſhall not know what they ſhall do. And the people ſhall be divided amongſt themſelves what manner of ſwarm it ſhall be. But the beginning thereof ſhall be deſtructive unto many.</hi> I have my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, quoted thus much that ye be not miſguided: locuſts are amongſt you; they are even come with a great power: and, though the laſt ſwarm are ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and are gone; yet, take care, the beginning of theſe, you perceive, <hi>have</hi> already been deſtructive unto many.</p>
            <p>Having thus gone through the principal parts which I at firſt intended, I now proceed to ſome practical improvement upon the whole, and will have done. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Seeing that a fox is come from the north, let us be watchful, and extremely jealous, of every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may be made of his exertion. His cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011191_0021_0F85CD6BF5598438"/>
is deep; his attempts ſly; and deceit artful. He may be found to make urine of the ſtrongeſt taint upon his tail, and cloſe your eyes in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we cannot purſue him in his intrigues. He may feign dead or inactive, but at laſt rouze up and devour a multitude. It requires, therefore, the greateſt diligence and perſeverance to prevent his becoming our deteſtable and inveterate deſtroyer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are incouraged by the preſence of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ought not to be caſt down, grieve our ſpirits, and faint, as though no proſpect of help were nigh.— The lion is a furious beaſt; hardſhips and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which appear ſo to us, become as nothing to him; and we have already found, that his power ALONE hath defended us in our Houſes—in our Caſtles—in our Poſſeſſions. We ſhould therefore be thankful, and rejoice that there is one power provided againſt another, ſo that our attempts, for the liberty of our children, do not entirely become of non-effect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all times of public diſtreſs and tumultuous proceedings, we ſhould be particularly careful how we think and act, neither to be ſeen defending our own cauſe, or walking by the way-ſide <note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to that meritorious action in St. George's fields, namely, the fireing upon and killing ſeveral of his majeſty's ſubjects, as they were ſatisfying their curioſity thereabouts in ſeeing Mr. (now Alderman) Wilkes.</note>, leſt either by fire or ſword we be deſtroyed, and our lives taken away. In ſhort, my brethren, to be in favour with the GREAT, let your converſation be nought, lie down peaceably and be trod upon, reſiſting none who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon you, and then! * * * * and then! * * * * O then!</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011191_0022_0F85CD6D0A2CD7D8"/>4. Seeing that locuſts of a new kind are come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, let us behold them a while in their actions. If they oppreſs us, and, as the laſt ſwarm, blaſt every gleam of hope, that may appear favourable in our behalf, we may expect little good from them. if they direct themſelves by the NORTH wind, and are governed by that cold corner, it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect that we ſhall ſoon be in a ſtarving condition, ſince that wind carries with it a moſt omenous aſpect, of which we have been the too ſad and uncomfortable ſpectators.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Let every one be upon their guard. Whatever appears in the ſtrict eye of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to carry with it the impreſſion of Truth, a taſte of true Patriotiſm, and a love of Liberty and an univerſal Freedom, by all means let that be firſt embraced. And I truſt, my brethren, that theſe few hints, which I have juſt thrown together, will not be unworthy your notice. May this diſcourſe have its deſired effect upon you, and promote, in ſome degree, your fortitude and courage under every impoſition that may be lain upon you by a ſet of arbitrary ******* and ******. Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now unto all men be conſolation, friendſhip, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, from this time forth, and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
