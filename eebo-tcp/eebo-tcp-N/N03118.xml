            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>s preaching has not been <hi>in vain;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, it was not vain in the <hi>matter,</hi> we did not preach about vain, uſeleſs and unprofitable niceties and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, but our preaching was ſubſtantial, ſound and ſolid, ſuch as was moſt likely to profit our heaters.

BUT the expreſſion may more particularly point at theſe two things,
<list>
                  <item>(1) That the divine power accompany'd their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, and confirm'd them in the faith that heard it, and the gracious aſſiſtances vouchſafed to them, confirm'd them in the expectation of ſucceſs. And, then</item>
                  <item>(2) That their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were not diſappointed, but anſwered in the great ſucceſs given to their miniſtry; for the word <hi>vain</hi> when it is apply'd to the meſſages, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt bring, ſignifies the not accompliſhing the great ends for which they are ſent. It is us'd to this purpoſe, in Iſa. 55.11. <hi>The word that goeth out of my mouth ſhall not return to me</hi> in vain, <hi>but proſper,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>WE may hence learn that where Miniſters are regularly call'd to, and faithfully diſcharge their duty, their labours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended with more or leſs of ſooneſs, either ſooner, or later, for Converſion and Edification. They have the promiſe of Chriſt's gracious preſence with them, and if they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they ſhall have the preſence of his power to ſtrengthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them, and of his bleſſed ſpirit to ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>THOUGH ſometimes they may not have any great viſible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at preſent,; yet it may comfort ſuch, that there may be good done by their miniſtry notwithſtanding, and if they done reap the fruit of the ſeed they ſow, they who come after them may But if it ſhould be ſo, that neither they, nor their people reap fruit, their miniſtry ſhall not be in vain with reference to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> for they ſhall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be not gathered.</p>
            <p>IN the 2d <hi>v.</hi> the Apoſtle tells them of the great difficulties which he encounter'd at his firſt coming among them to preach the Goſpel, but yet theſe did not at all diſcourage him from preaching the Goſpel with conſtancy and reſolution. He was notwithſtanding <hi>bold in God to ſpeak unto them the Goſpel of God.</hi> He was inſpir'd with an holy boldneſs, and went on couragiouſly in his work, notwithſtanding any oppoſition that was made againſt him, or ill uſage he met withall, from any of theſe to whom he was ſent. It was a zealous boldneſs in the cauſe of GOD, and prov'd convincing unto many. It is one neceſſary and commendable qualification in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in order to the making their miniſtry ſucceſsful, that a wiſe, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, zealous and convincing boldneſs be found with them in their delivering the truths of GOD unto their People. <hi>We were</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>bold in our God, to ſpeak unto you the goſpel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003764_0005_1002584B5CA89028"/>
IN my <hi>Text,</hi> and the verſe immediately preceding it, he tells as ſomething of the manner of his preaching, that it was with <hi>great ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; for our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleaneſs, nor in guile; but as we were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God which tvieth our hearts.</hi> We may here Note, that the Apoſtle calls his preaching an <hi>Exhortation;</hi> doubtleſo becauſe a great part of his preaching was (as ours ought to be) applicarory and exhortatory, earneſtly and affectionately excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearers to cleave unto the truths, whether doctrinal or practical, delivered to them.</p>
            <p>HE declares to them, that it was the <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted Goſpel</hi> that he preach'd, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orted them to believe and obey. His deſign was not to ſet up a ſaction, to draw men over to a party, but to promote pure Religion, and undefied before GOD and the Father. The Goſpel he preach'd, was <hi>without deceit;</hi> it was not of enſnaring and ſeducing error, not ſuted to the corrupt opinions and wicked inclinations of Men, Nor was it of <hi>Uncleanoſs;</hi> his Goſpel was pure and holy, worthy of its holy Author, tending to diſcourage all manner of imperity: Nothing that he either preach'd or practis'd, did countenance or encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age men in the gratification of their luſts, as did the erroneous preaching of the falſe Apoſtles. And as the matter of his preaching was Pure, ſo the manner of his ſpeaking was without <hi>guile,</hi> i e. he did not ſeek himſelf under a pretence of acting for GOD and his glory, nor propound his own worldly advanarge as his ultimate end. He had not ſiniſters aims, but was in reality what he ſeem'd to be. The Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould not only preach the pure word of GOD, but preach is purely, in ſimplicity of heart, and with a ſingle eye at the glory of GOD, without looking at, or having any regard to baſe ſiniſter ends, or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpects.</p>
            <p>HE would aſſure them, that his main deſign was to approve himſelf to <hi>GOD,</hi> that he might have the divine approbation; not ſo much, or at all, regarding to <hi>pleaſe Men,</hi> but only in ſubordination to GOD. And in the words read, he gives us the reaſons or motives inducing him to it. <hi>(Firſt)</hi> He was <hi>put in truſt with the Goſpel, allowed of God to be ſo.</hi> GOD f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed him for this high and honorable truſt, and improv'd him therein; and he looked upon both as a favour and honour done him by the great GOD. The other motive was the conſideration of GOD's emniſcient and all-ſeeing eye upon him, as well knowing <hi>that the heart-ſearching</hi> GOD was a witneſs both of his Doctrine and Converſition acquained with his aims and ends, and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> he ſo preach'd <hi>not as pleaſing men, but God.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003764_0006_1002584DCE3F1458"/>
AND what is there that can, or ſhould more powerfully excite the Miniſters of Chriſt, to the faithful diſcharge of their duty, than the conſideration of the honour and weight of the great truſt repoſed in them, and the eye of an heart-ſearching GOD continually upon them!</p>
            <p>HE goes on in the two next verſes, to produce the evidences of his ſincerity; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that he did not uſe <hi>flattering words,</hi> to gratify the luſts and humours of men, to gain their favour or good opinion of him nor did he flatter them in their ſins. Flattery in any, is very odious; but more eſpecially is it ſo in the Miniſters of Chriſt. They ſhould be plain-he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed and faithful in their dealings with men, becauſe flattery about things of a ſpiritual nature is moſt pernicious and fatal. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He did not <hi>uſe a Cloak of Covetouſneſs;</hi> he had no covetous diſign in his Miniſtry; he did not propoſe to gain any outward or worldly advantage to himſelf. He ſolemnly appeals to GOD, who ſearches the heart, as a witneſs of the truth of this. He alſo declares, how free he was from all oſtentation and <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory:</hi> He did not ſeek or deſire applauſe from men, nor indeed ſo much as due reſpect in a fitting maintenance from them, tho' he does at the ſame time aſſure them, he did therein remit of his <hi>Right,</hi> ſeeing as an <hi>Apoſtle of Chriſt,</hi> he might be <hi>burthen-ſome,</hi> i. e. chargeable to them, by exacting a fit and honourable Support from them, which ſome might be too ready to think, would be too great a burden for them to bear. We may from hence Note, that tho' the Miniſters of Chriſt, may and ſhould have a due reſpect to their own honour and reputation, yet eagerly to ſeek after reſpect and eſteem, does ſavour too much of vanity and vain glory. We may alſo learn, that though the Miniſters of the Goſpel have an undoubted fight to an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Support, yet it may be a point of prudence in them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that right, for ſome ſpecial reaſons.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle proceeds in our Context, to give an account of his humble, holy, meek, courteous and affable behaviour among them, by all expreſſing his render Love and Affection to them, in which he has ſet an example for all Chriſts Miniſters to follow.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus open'd and paraphras'd upon the <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Context,</hi> I come to the DOCTRINE which I deſign for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inſtruction and Improvement, <hi>viz.</hi>

The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has inſtituted a ſtanding Goſpel-Miniſtry in his Church, to continue to the end of the World. It is his Sovereign Will and Pleaſure, that there ſhould be an Order of Men to repreſent his Perſon, publiſh his Laws, exhibit the promiſes &amp; adminiſter Seals and Cenſures; this is evident from the promiſe of Chriſt's preſence to be with his Miniſters to the end of the World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. and becauſe the reaſon of ſuch an inſtitution of Men to this ſervice will always continue. Now with theſe is the Goſpel intruſted; they are allow'd of GOD to be put in truſt with the Goſpel. It is GOD, who raiſes them up, who giſts and qualifies them for ſerving their Generation in the Goſpel of his Son, and inclines their hearts to engage therein.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Do they ſpeak to us in the Name of GOD, by his Authority? Do they repreſent the head of the Church, the bleſſed GOD incarnate and inthron'd in our Jeſus? Muſt it not then be very ſinful and dangerous to abuſe them!</p>
               <p>LET me warn all who hear me, to beware of this. Surely your Miniſters have Work and Buſineſs enough, lying upon their hearts and hands; you need not add more. And know it, their Lord and Maſter, will tenderly and highly reſent any indignities offered to his Embaſſadors. Abuſe of Embaſſadors, ſent by Earthly Kings, has ever by the Law of Nations been highly reſented; we read alſo in Scripture of its being ſo. Let us then be ever cautious and afraid of abuſing or injuring the Lord's Miniſters. Let us be always diſpoſed to cover their infirmities, and to make the moſt charitable conſtruction of any thing ſaid or done by them, that ſome may be diſpos'd to improve to their prejudice; and be always cautious how we report what we hear concerning them, which it may be is altogether groundleſs. Let us be very careful how we treat the Embaſſadors of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, USE IV. <hi>WITH what ſolemnity and reverence ſhould we attend to their Inſtructions.</hi> If they come to us in Chriſt's Name, how concern'd ſhould we be to give a due entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their meſſages, that are of infinite moment and concern to us all.</p>
               <p>USE V. AND laſtly here, <hi>Let us pray for the Lord's Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that GOD would qualify them for their Work, that he would aſſiſt and proſper them in it. That the hand of the Lord may be with them, that many may believe and turn unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BE thus asking the preſence and bleſſing of the Lord, with all his Servants in the Miniſtry: and let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this duty in a particular manner to <hi>This Church and Congregation</hi> of the Lord, with reſpect <hi>(Firſt)</hi> to your worthy and beloved <hi>Elder Paſtor;</hi> that GOD wou'd reſtore and confirm his health, and yet grant a door of <hi>utterance</hi> to him, that he may ſtill labour among you in the word and doctrine, and be continued a rich bleſſing to you, and that GOD would ſantify the awful ſwam in his being ſo taken off
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003764_0012_1002585A6F139AF0"/>from his work among you; and that thoſe divine ſupports and conſolations may be vouchſafed to him, which may delight and refreſh his Soul in the multitude of his thoughts within him: And then, let me in the next place recommend this duty, with reſpect unto him, who may be allowed of GOD this day, to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, and to whom the care of your precious Souls is to be committed. We truſt he is given to you this day in anſwer to your prayers; and you muſt now more than ever bear him upon your hearts in your humble and fervent ſupplications to GOD for him. He is this day devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to your ſervice, to be your Servant for Chriſt's ſake, to ſpent, and be ſpent for you. It is an awful Charge he is now going to receive from the Lord concerning you. He needs and he deſires your Prayers. I beſeech you then, <hi>Brethren,</hi> for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye ſtrive together with him in your prayers to GOD for him; that his Service in the Goſpel may be accepted of the Saints; that he may come to you with joy by the will of GOD, and be refreſhed; that he may come to you in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt; that he may be made faithful to Chriſt, and to your Souls; that he may <hi>ſpeak not as pleaſing Men,</hi> but GOD the ſearcher of hearts; that he may be a happy inſtrument in the hands of GOD, of turning many here from the error of their ways, that many may be awaken'd and quickned by his Miniſtry, and brought ſavingly home to GOD, and that the Saints and Children of GOD may be edify'd and built up on their holy faith; in ſhort, that he may have many Seals of his Miniſtry among you, who may be his joy, and crown of rejoycing in the Day of Chriſt's appearing. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your thus praying, let me tell you, your prayers for him may be greatly ſerviceable to the ſucceſs of his Miniſtry among you. O beg of GOD to give the increaſe, with whom alone it is, and to whom alone the praiſe muſt be aſcribed. Cry to GOD day and night for the ſucceſs of his labours among you, that he may not labour in vain and ſpend his ſtrength for nought, that the word diſpenſed by him may be a ſavour of life unto life, and not of death unto death unto any of you. In this way you may hope to have his Miniſtry made truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to your Souls, and if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to make it ſo, he can deſire no greater comfort or honour in this World.</p>

                  <item>4. <hi>and laſtly,</hi> Why we ſhou'd make it our great concern and endeavour, ſo to ſpeak, not as pleaſing Men, but GOD.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I am to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>WHAT may be imply'd in God's trying our hearts.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THIS certainly implys in general, <hi>that God is omniſcient.</hi> That all things are naked &amp; open before the eyes of that GOD, with whom we have to do, even the thoughts and intents of the Heart. That his eyes are as a flame of fire, running to and fro through the earth, beholding the evil and the good; that he may ſhew himſelf ſtrong on the behalf of thoſe whoſe hearts are upright with him. That he ſearches the hearts and the reins of the children of men, that he may give to every one according to their ways and the fruit of their doings. Hereby may be meant that the great GOD has a perfect knowledge of all perſons and things, and ſees them all, even that which is moſt hidden and ſecret: That there is not a word in our tongue, nor a thought in our heart, but he knows it altogether.</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. GOD's trying our hearts may imply and mean his critical inſpection and regard, <hi>as to the ends and deſigns we propoſe in undertaking the work of the Miniſtry.</hi> When we engage in the work of the Miniſtry, or any other buſineſs of importance, we have our ſeveral aims, ends and deſigns; and we are too prone to be led and carried on by corrupt and ſmiſter views and deſigns, and to have no ſincere aims at the advancement of the glory of GOD, or the good and benefit of others. But now, the omniſcient God critically regards the views and ends, which govern and influence us in the proſecution of our duty. And this may be meant by his trying our hearts, that the Lord does eſpecially and accurately look to the ends we propoſe and are govern'd by, in the undertaking and proſecuting the work and duty incumbent on us in our ſeveral places and ſtarion; and eſpecially in the awful ſtarion, of the Miniſtry.</p>

I proceed now to enquire</p>
               <p n="2">2. WHAT may be meant by <hi>cur ſpeaking not as pleaſing Men,</hi> Or, when we may be ſaid, <hi>to ſpeak not as pleaſing Men.</hi> Before I anſwer, I would briefly premiſe; that in ſome caſes, we ſhould and ought to pleaſe Men. We find that the Apoſtle himſelf in ſome caſes ſought to pleaſe Men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> X 33. But he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Men, nor ſhould we, when it ſtands in competition with pleaſing GOD. Otherwiſe the rule takes place with all, which we have given us in Rom. XV 2. <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour, for his good to edification.</hi> The Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel may and ſhould endeavour to chooſe our acceptable words, that may be pleaſing to their hearers. They may endeavour to pleaſe Men, in their ſpeaking, ſo they do but faithfully and plainly tell them their duty. And indeed this ſhould be pleaſing to Men; but alas it's too often very unpleaſing and ungrateful. But to proceed, by way of Anſwer,</p>

The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets told them of their faults, and warn'd them of their danger, and they could not bear that: they muſt ſpeak to them ſmooth things, muſt flatter them in their ſins, and ſay they did well, and there was no harm, no danger in the courſe of life they liv'd; let a thing be never ſo right and true, if it be not ſmooth, they will not hear it, but if it be agreable to the good opinion they have of themſelves, the' it be never ſo falſe, and never ſo great a cheat upon them, they would have it propheſy'd to them. They were for being let alone to do as they pleas'd, and therefore bid their faithful monitors to ſtand out of the way; but the faithful prophets of the Lord won't be diverted from uſing ſuch expreſſions as are proper to awaken ſinners, tho' they may perhaps be diſpleaſing enough to them; ſuch muſt be told, that GOD is holy, and they ſhall find him ſo, ſooner or later, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

               <p>BUT this may ſuffice for the firſt particular; the Miniſters of Chriſt ſpeak, <hi>not as pleaſing men,</hi> when they bear their faithful teſtimony againſt the vicious ways and courſes they indulge themſelves in and warn them of their danger of a damnation to be trembled at, if they die in their ſins.</p>

To be called on, to exerciſe ſuch mortification and ſelf-denyal, is not at all pleaſing to the corrupt and carnal hearts of men: They don't love to be urged to that which is ſo contrary to the natural bent and diſpoſition of their hearts.

               <p>BY thus dealing with the children of Men in the publick diſpenſation of GOD's holy word, we may be ſaid to <hi>ſpeak not as pleaſing men;</hi> when we thus reprove them for their wickedneſs, warn them of their danger, and urge them to reform, and do their duty, as they would avoid a moſt fearfully aggravated condemnation, which will elſe belong unto them.</p>

That they muſt receive him as their Lord and King, as well as Saviour; to have every ſin and luſt mortify'd and ſubdued in them. That they muſt make an intire ſincere ſurrender and dedication of themſelves to the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of their lives: And make his glory their governing deſign and aim, and the word of GOD their conſtant rule; and ſee to it, that they walk circumſpectly, humbly and prayerfully. When we thus ſpeak to our hearers, <hi>we ſpeak as pleaſing GOD,</hi> who has no pleaſure in the death of the ſinner, but had rather he would turn and live.

               <p>WE learn ſomething of our duty from what we have heard: And would to GOD, we might be enabled ſo to diſcharge it, that we may be able to ſay, as the Apoſtle does here with his Brethren, and as he ſays in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>GOD is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my Spirit in the Goſpel of his Son.</hi> It will be much for our comfort and honour, to have this teſtimony of our Conſciences for us. And this we ſhall have, if we are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and faithful in the diſcharge of our miniſtry. We know <hi>it is required in Stewards</hi> (and therefore of us) <hi>that a man be found faithful.</hi> Let us be ſo then in declaring the whole counſel of GOD, and giving to every one their portion in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>LET us often <hi>conſider the ſtate</hi> and circumſtances of our reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive flocks and charges, and <hi>accommodate</hi> our ſelves to them in our publick adminiſtrations, by way of reproof and warning, counſel and comfort, as we apprehend they may ſtand in need thereof. Let us always beware of any fear of Men, that may bring a ſnare. Let us not be afraid of the faces of men, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliver the meſſages and warnings of GOD to them, whether they will hear, or whether they wil forbear. And alas! How many are there ſtill, who are dſpos'd to ſay, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> hearers did, Jer.
