            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>WHO is he among the children of the earth, that repines at the power of the wicked? and who is he, that would change the lot of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?

                     <p>Solyman, the mighty and the wife, who, in the one hundred and ſecond
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021881_0005_0FB752F908E4E6B8"/>
year of the Hegyra, ſat upon the throne of Perſia, had two ſons, ALMORAN and HAMET, and they were twins. ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN was the firſt born, but Solyman divided his affection equally between them: they were both lodged in the ſame part of the ſeraglio, both were attended by the ſame ſervants, and both received inſtructions from the ſame teacher.</p>
                     <p>One of the firſt things that ALMORAN leart, was the prerogative of his birth; and he was taught very early to ſet a high value upon it, by the terms in which thoſe about him expreſſed their ſenſe of the power, the ſplendor and the delights of royalty. As his mind gradually open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he naturally conſidered theſe as the objects of univerſal deſire, and the means of ſupreme felicity: he was often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that the time was coming, when the ſole poſſeſſion of ſovereign power would enable him to fulfil all his wiſhes, to determine the fate of dependent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a nod, and diſpenſe life and death, and happineſs and miſery, at his will: he was flattered by thoſe who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to draw wealth and dignity from his favour; and intereſt prompted all who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021881_0006_0FB752FC0D9157C8"/>
approached him, to adminiſter to his pleaſures with a zeal and aſſiduity, which had the appearance of reverence to his merit, and affection to his perſon.</p>
                     <p>HAMET, on the contrary, ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible of a ſubordinate ſtation: he was not, indeed, neglected; but he was not much careſſed. When the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of HAMET came in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that of ALMORAN, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obliged to give it up, except when Solyman interpoſed: his mind was, therefore, naturally led to ſeek for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in objects very different from thoſe which had ſixed the attention of ALMORAN. As he knew not to how narrow a ſphere caprice or jealouſy might confine him, he conſidered what pleaſures were leaſt dependant upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal advantages; and as the firſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commotion which ſhould happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his brother's acceſſion to the throne, might probably coſt him his life, he was very inquiſitive about the ſtate into which his ſpirit would be diſmiſſed by the Angel of Death, and very diligent to do whatever might ſecure him a ſhare of the permanent and unchangeable fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021881_0007_0FB753019F43E030"/>
This difference in the ſituation of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN and HAMET, produced great diſſimilarity in their diſpoſitions, habits, and characters; to which, perhaps, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might alſo in ſome degree contribute. ALMORAN was haughty, vain, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous; HAMET was gentle, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and temperate: ALMORAN was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, impetuous, and iraſcible; HAMET was thoughtful, patient, and forbearing. Upon the heart of HAMET alſo were written the inſtructions of the Prophet; to his mind futurity was preſent by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual anticipation; his pleaſure, his pain, his hopes, and his fears, were perpetually referred to the Inviſible and Almighty Father of Life, by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of gratitude or reſignation, complacency or confidence; ſo that his devotion was not periodical but conſtant.</p>
                     <p>But the views of ALMORAN were terminated by nearer objects: his mind was perpetually buſied in the anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleaſures and honours, which he ſuppoſed to be neither uncertain nor remote; theſe excited his hopes, with a power ſufficient to fix his attention; he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021881_0008_0FB7530C634D9130"/>
did not look beyond them for other objects, nor enquired how enjoyments more diſtant were to be acquired; and as he ſuppoſed theſe to be already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to him by his birth, there was nothing he was ſolicitous to obtain as the reward of merit, nor any thing that he conſidered himſelf to poſſeſs as the bounty of Heaven. If the ſublime and diſintereſted rectitude that produces and rewards itſelf, dwells indeed with man, it dwelt not with ALMORAN: with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to God, therefore, he was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a ſenſe either of duty or dependence; he felt neither reverence nor love, gratitude nor reſignation: in abſtaining from evil, he was not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally good; he practiſed the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of morality without virtue, and performed the rituals of devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piety.</p>
                     <p>Such were ALMORAN and HAMET, when Solyman their father, full of days and full of honour, ſlept in peace the ſleep of death. With this event they were immediately acquainted. The emotions of ALMORAN were ſuch as it was impoſſible to conceal: the joy that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021881_0009_0FB7530FAEC5C140"/>
he felt in ſecret was ſo great, that the mere dread of diſappointment, for a moment ſuſpended his belief of what he heard: when his fears and his doubts gave way, his cheeks were ſuffuſed with ſudden bluſhes, and his eyes ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with exultation and impatience: he looked eagerly about him, as if in haſte to act; yet his looks were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed, and his geſtures irreſolute, becauſe he knew not what to do: he uttered ſome incoherent ſentences, which diſcovered at once the joy that he felt, and his ſenſe of its impropriety; and his whole deportment expreſſed the utmoſt tumult and perturbation of mind.</p>
                     <p>Upon HAMET, the death of his father produced a very different effect: as ſoon as he heard it, his lips trembled and his countenance grew pale; he ſtood mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs a moment, like a pilgrim trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed by lightning in the deſert; he then ſmote his breaſt, and looking upward, his eyes by degrees overflowed with tears, and they fell like dew diſtilling from the mountain, in a calm and ſilent ſhower. As his grief was thus mingled with devotion, his mind in a ſhort time
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021881_0010_0FB7531112F437F8"/>
recovered its tranquillity, though not its chearfulneſs, and he deſired to be conducted to his brother.</p>
                     <p>He found him ſurrounded by the lords of his court, his eyes ſtill reſtleſs and ardent, and his deportment elate and aſſuming. HAMET preſſed haſtily through the circle, and proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before him: ALMORAN received the homage with a tumultuous pleaſure; but at length raiſed him from the ground, and aſſured him of his protection, though without any expreſſions either of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or of ſorrow: <q>HAMET, ſays he, if I have no cauſe to complain of you as a ſubject, you ſhall have no cauſe to complain of me as a king.</q> HAMET, whoſe heart was again pierced by the cold and diſtant behaviour of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppreſſed the ſign that ſtruggled in his boſom, and ſecretly wiped away the tear that ſtarted to his eye: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his looks fixed upon the ground, to a remote corner of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and though his heart yearned to embrace his brother, his modeſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſtrained him from intruding upon the king.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:021881_0011_0FB7531526472220"/>
In this ſituation were ALMORAN and HAMET, when OMAR entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. OMAR, upon whoſe head the hand of time became heavy, had from his youth acquainted himſelf with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: to him nature had revealed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſilence of the night, when his lamp was burning alone, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> only were open: to him was known the power of the ſeal of Solomon; and to him the knowledge of things inviſible had been revealed. Nor was the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of OMAR inferior to his knowledge; his heart was a fountain of good, which though it flowed through innumerable ſtreams was never dry: yet was the virtue of OMAR cloathed with humility; and he was ſtill preſſing nearer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by a devotion which though elevated was rational, and though regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was warm. From the council of OMAR, Solyman had derived glory and ſtrength; and to him he had committed the education of his children.</p>
                     <p>When he entered the apartment, the croud, touched at once with reverence and love, drew back; every eye was caſt downward, and every tongue was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021881_0012_0FB7531CD9F687B8"/>
ſilent. The full of days approached the king, and kneeling before him, he put into his hand a ſealed paper: the king received it with impatience, ſeeing it ſuperſcribed with the hand of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and OMAR looked round, and perceiving HAMET, beckoned him to come forward. HAMET, whoſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to OMAR had been ſo long habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual that it was now almoſt ſpontaneous, inſtantly drew near, though with a ſlow and irreſolute pace; and ALMORAN, having broken the ſeal of the paper, began to read it to himſelf, with a look that expreſſed the utmoſt anxiety and impatience. OMAR kept his eye fixed upon him, and ſoon perceived that his countenance was disfigured by confuſion and trouble, and that he ſeemed prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to put up the paper in his boſom: he then produced another paper from under his robe, and gave it to HAMET: <q>This, ſays he, is a copy of the will of Solyman, your father; the original is in the hand of ALMORAN: read it, and you will find that he has bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his kingdom between you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:021881_0013_0FB7531DD4212320"/>
The eyes of all preſent were now turned upon HAMET, who ſtood ſilent and motionleſs with amazement, but was ſoon rouſed to attention by the homage that was paid him. In the mean time ALMORAN'S confuſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed every moment: his diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was aggravated by the ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of thoſe who were preſent to his brother; and his jealouſy made him think himſelf neglected, while thoſe acts of duty were performed to HAMET, which were now known to be his right, and which he had himſelf received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p>HAMET, however, regarded but little what ſo much excited the envy of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN; his mind was employed upon ſuperior objects, and agitated by nobler paſſions: the coldneſs of his brother's behaviour, though it had grieved had not quenched his affection; and as he was now no longer reſtrained by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference due from a ſubject to his king, he ran to him, and catching him to his breaſt attempted to ſpeak; but his heart was too full, and he cou'd expreſs his affection and joy only by his tears.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021881_0014_0FB7532528AEEEA8"/>
ALMORAN rather ſuffered than received the embrace; and after a few ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to which neither of them could much attend, they retired to ſeparate apartments.</p>

                     <p>WHEN ALMORAN was alone, he immediately locked the door; and throwing himſelf upon a ſofa in an agony of vexation and diſappointment, of which he was unwilling there ſhould be any witneſs, he revolved in his mind all the pleaſures and honours of ſupreme dominion which had now ſuddenly been ſnatched from him, with a degree of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and regret, not proportioned to their real, but their imaginary value. Of future good, that which we obtain is found to be leſs than our expectations; but that of which we are diſappointed, we ſuppoſe would have been more: thus do the children of hope extract evil, both from what they gain, and from what they loſe. But ALMORAN, after the firſt tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of his mind had ſubſided, began to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021881_0015_0FB753270646EB18"/>
conſider as well what was left him, as what had been taken away. He was ſtill without a ſuperior, though he had an equal; he was ſtill a king, though he did not govern alone: and with reſpect to every individual in his dominions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one, his will would now be a law; though with reſpect to the public, the concurrence of his brother would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give it force. <q>Let me then, ſays he, make the moſt of the power that is now put into my hand, and wait till ſome favourable opportunity ſhall offer to encreaſe it. Let me diſſemble my jealouſy and diſappointment, that I may not alarm ſuſpicion, or put the virtues of HAMET upon their guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and let me contrive to give our joint adminiſtration ſuch a form, as may beſt favour my deſign.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such were the reflections, with which ALMORAN ſoothed the anguiſh of his mind; while HAMET was buſied in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of a very different kind. If he was pleaſed at reflecting, that he was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from a ſubject to a prince; he was pleaſed ſtill more, when he conſidered his elevation as a teſt of his father's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021881_0016_0FB7532A74678700"/>
to his perſon, and approbation of his conduct: he was alſo delighted with the thought, that his brother was aſſociated with him in the arduous taſk which he was now called to perform. <q>If I had been appointed to govern alone, ſaid he, I ſhould have had no equal; and he who has no equal, tho' he may have faithful ſervants, can have no friend: there cannot be that union of intereſt, that equal participation of good, that unreſtrained intercourſe of mind, and that mutual dependence, which conſtitutes the pure and exalted happineſs of friendſhip. With AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, I ſhall ſhare the ſupreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of wreſting the innocent and the helpleſs from the iron hand of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; of animating merit by reward, and reſtraining the unworthy by fear: I ſhall ſhare, with ALMORAN, the pleaſures of governing a numerous, a powerful, and a happy people; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which, however great, are, like all others, increaſed by participation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>While HAMET was thus enjoying the happineſs, which his virtue derived from the ſame ſource, from which the vices of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021881_0017_0FB75302CDDBE5B8"/>
ALMORAN had filled his breaſt with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and diſcontent; OMAR was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in what manner their joint govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could beſt be carried into execution.</p>
                     <p>He knew that Solyman, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the diſpoſitions of his ſons, was of opinion, that if they had been blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one perſon, they would have produced a character more fit to govern in his ſtead, than either of them alone: ALMORAN, he thought, was too volatile and warm; but he ſuſpected, that HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET would ſink into inactivity for want of ſpirit: he feared alike ALMORAN'S love of enterprize, and HAMET'S fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for retirement: he obſerved, in HAMET, a placid eaſineſs of temper, which might ſuffer the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lie too looſe; and, in ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, a quickneſs of reſentment, and jealouſy of command, which might hold them too tight: he hoped, therefore, that by leaving them a joint dominion, he ſhould blend their diſpoſitions, at leaſt in their effects, in every act of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſhould take place; or that, however they ſhould agree to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter their government, the public
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021881_0018_0FB7532B6057A9C0"/>
would derive benefit from the virtues of both, without danger of ſuffering from their imperfections, as their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would only operate againſt each other, while, in whatever was right, their minds would naturally concur, as the coincidence of rectitude with recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is neceſſary and eternal. But he did not conſider, that different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions operating ſeparately upon two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent wills, would appear in effects very unlike thoſe, which they would concur to produce in one: that two wills, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the directions of diſpoſitions ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, would ſeldom be brought to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide; and that more miſchiefs would probably ariſe from the conteſt, than from the imperfections of either alone.</p>
                     <p>But Solyman had ſo long applauded himſelf for his project before he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to OMAR, that OMAR found him too much diſpleaſed with any objection, to conſider its weight: and knowing that peculiar notions are more rarely given up, than opinions received from others, and made our own only by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he at length acquieſced, leſt he ſhould by farther oppoſition loſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021881_0019_0FB7532CDE1D59C0"/>
which on other occaſions he might ſtill employ to the advantage of the public; and took a ſolemn oath, that he would, as far as was in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſee the will carried into execution.</p>
                     <p>To this, indeed he conſented without much reluctance, as he had little leſs reaſon to fear the ſole government of ALMORAN, than a joint adminiſtration; and if a ſtruggle for ſuperiority ſhould happen, he hoped the virtues of HAMET would obtain the ſuffrages of the people in his favour, and eſtabliſh him upon the throne alone. But as change is itſelf an evil, and as changes in government are ſeldom produced without great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and calamity, he applied himſelf to conſider in what manner the government of ALMORAN and HAMET could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, ſo as moſt effectually to blend their characters in their adminiſtration, and prevent the conduct of one from exciting jealouſy in the other.</p>
                     <p>After much thought, he determined that a ſyſtem of laws ſhould be prepared, which the ſons of Solyman ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and alter till they perfectly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021881_0020_0FB753362A123F98"/>
approved, and to which they ſhould then give the ſanction of their joint authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that when any addition or alteration ſhould be thought neceſſary, it ſhould be made in the ſame manner; and that when any inſuperable difference of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent happened, either in this or in any act of prerogative independent of the laws for regulating the manners of the people, the kings ſhould refer it to ſome perſon of approved integrity and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and abide by his determination. OMAR eaſily foreſaw, that when the opinion of ALMORAN and HAMET ſhould differ, the opinion of ALMORAN would be eſtabliſhed; for there were many cauſes that would render ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN inflexible, and HAMET yielding: ALMORAN was naturally confident and aſſuming, HAMET diffident and modeſt; ALMORAN was impatient of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, HAMET was attentive to argument, and ſolicitous only for the diſcovery of truth. ALMORAN alſo conceived, that by the will of his father, he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrong; HAMET, that he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a favour: ALMORAN, therefore, was diſpoſed to reſent the firſt appearance
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021881_0021_0FB7533816E54C30"/>
of oppoſition; and HAMET, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to acquieſce, as in his ſhare of government, whatever it might be, he had more than was his right by birth, and his brother had leſs. Thus, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the will of ALMORAN would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably predominate in the ſtate: but as the ſame cauſe which conferred this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, would often prevent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, OMAR conſidered it, upon the whole, rather as good than evil.</p>
                     <p>When he had prepared his plan, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſent a copy of it, by different meſſengers at the ſame time, both to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN and HAMET, incloſed in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which he expreſt his ſenſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to their father, and his zeal and affection for them: he mentioned the promiſe he had made, to devote himſelf to their ſervice; and the oath he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to propoſe whatever he thought might facilitate the accompliſhment of their father's deſign, with honor to them and happineſs to their people: theſe motives, which he could not reſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impiety, he hoped would abſolve him from preſumption; and truſting in the rectitude of his intentions, he left the iſſue to God.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                     <p>THE receipt of this letter threw ALMORAN into another agony of indignation: he felt again the loſs of his prerogative; the offer of advice he diſdained as an inſult, to which he had been injuriouſly ſubjected by the will of his father; and he was diſpoſed to reject whatever was ſuggeſted by OMAR, even before his propoſal was known. With this temper of mind he began to read, and at every paragraph took new offence; he determined, however, not to admit OMAR to the honour of a conference upon the ſubject, but to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a plan of government with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the leaſt regard to his advice.</p>
                     <p>A ſupercilious attention to minute formalities, is a certain indication of a little mind, conſcious to the want of innate dignity, and ſolicitous to derive from others what it cannot ſupply to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: as the ſcrupulous exaction of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling tribute diſcovers the weakneſs of the tyrant, who fears his claim ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021881_0023_0FB7534002EA8D30"/>
be diſputed; while the prince, who is conſcious of ſuperior and indiſputable power, and knows that the ſtates he has ſubjugated do not dare to revolt, ſcarce enquires whether ſuch teſtimonies of allegiance are given or not.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the jealouſy of ALMORAN al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enſlaved him to the punctilios of ſtate; and the moſt trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances involved him in perplexity, or fired him with reſentment: the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fidelity of OMAR ſtung him with rage, as inſolent and intruſive; and though it determined him to an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate interview with his brother, yet he was embarraſſed how to procure it. At firſt he roſe, and was about to go to him; but he ſtopped ſhort with diſdain, upon reflecting, that it was an act of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion which might be deemed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſuperiority: he then thought of ſending for HAMET to come to him; but this he feared might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, as implying a denial of his equality: at length he determined to propoſe a meeting in the chamber of council, and was juſt diſpatching an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer with the meſſage, when HAMET en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the apartment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:021881_0024_0FB75341B4206BE0"/>
The countenance of HAMET was fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, and his heart was warmed with the pleaſing ſenſations of affection and confidence, by the ſame letter, from which ALMORAN had extracted the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of jealouſy and reſentment; and as he had no idea that an act of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to his brother could derogate from his own dignity or importance, he indulged the honeſt impatience of his heart to communicate the pleaſure with which it overflowed: he was, indeed, ſomewhat diſappointed, to find no traces of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the countenance of ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, when he ſaw the ſame paper in his hand, which had impreſſed ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own.</p>
                     <p>He waited ſome time after the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, without mentioning the ſcheme of government he was come to concert; becauſe having obſerved that ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN was embarraſſed and diſpleaſed, he expected that he would communicate the cauſe, and pleaſed himſelf with the hope that he might remove it: finding, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that this expectation was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he addreſſed him to this effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:021881_0025_0FB75344DA2EC240"/>
                        <q>How happy are we, my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the wiſdom and fidelity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAR! how excellent is the ſyſtem of government that he has propoſed! how eaſy and honourable will it be to us that govern, and how advantageous to the people that obey!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The advantages, ſaid ALMORAN, which you ſeem to have diſcovered, are not evident to me: tell me, then, what you imagine they are, and I will afterwards give you my opinion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>By eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem of laws as the rule of government, ſaid HAMET, many evils will be avoided, and many benefits procured. If the law is the will only of the ſovereign, it can never certainly be known to the people:—many, therefore, may violate that rule of right, which the hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has written upon the living ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets of the heart, in the preſumptuous hope, that it will not ſubject them to puniſhment; and thoſe, by whom that rule is fulfilled, will not enjoy that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſecurity, which they would derive from the protection of a preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021881_0026_0FB7534682E01968"/>
law, which they have never bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither will thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do evil, be equally reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fear of puniſhment; if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the offence is aſcertained, nor the puniſhment preſcribed. One motive to probity, therefore, will be wanting; which ought to be ſupplied, as well for the ſake of thoſe who may be tempted to offend, as of thoſe who may ſuffer by the offence. Beſides, he who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns not by a written and a public law, muſt either adminiſter that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in perſon, or by others: if in perſon, he will ſink under a labour which no man is able to ſuſtain; and if by others, the inferiority of their rank muſt ſubject them to temptations which it cannot be hoped they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſiſt, and to prejudices which it will perhaps be impoſſible for them to ſurmount. But to adminiſter govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a law which aſcertains the offence, and directs the puniſhment, integrity alone will be ſufficient; and as the perverſion of juſtice will in this caſe be notorious, and depend not upon opinion but fact, it will ſeldom be practiſed, becauſe it will be eaſily puniſhed.</q>

ALMORAN, who had heard the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of HAMET with impatience and ſcorn, now ſtarted from his ſeat with a proud and contemptuous aſpect: he firſt glanced his eyes upon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then looking diſdainfully downward, he threw back his robe, and ſtretching out his hand from him, <q>Shall the ſon of Solyman, ſaid he, upon whoſe will the fate of nations was ſuſpended, whoſe ſmiles and frowns were alone the criterions of right and wrong, before whom the voice of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom itſelf was ſilent, and the pride even of virtue humbled in the duſt; ſhall the ſon of Solyman be harneſſed, like a mule, in the tramels of law? ſhall he become a mere inſtrument to execute what others have deviſed? ſhall he only declare the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſtatute, and ſhall his ear be affronted by claims of right? It is the glory of a prince, to puniſh for what and whom he will; to be the ſovereign, not only of property, but of life; and to govern alike without preſcription or appeal.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>

HAMET, who was ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at this declaration, and the vehemence with which it was uttered, after a ſhort recollection made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: <q>It is the glory of a prince, to govern others, as he is governed by Him, who is alone moſt merciful and almighty! It is his glory to prevent crimes, rather than to diſplay his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in puniſhment; to diffuſe happineſs, rather than enforce ſubjection; and rather to animate with love, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs by fear. Has not He that ſhall judge us, given us a rule of life by which we ſhall be judged? is not our reward and puniſhment already ſet before us? are not his promiſes and threatnings, motives to obedience? and have we not confidence and joy, when we have obeyed? To God, His own divine perfections are a law; and theſe he has tranſcribed as a law to us. Let us, then, govern, as we are governed; let us ſeek our happineſs, in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we beſtow, and our honour in emulating the benevolence of Heaven.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ALMORAN feared, that to proceed farther in this argument would too far
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021881_0029_0FB75351B112ED60"/>
diſcloſe his ſentiments, and put HAMET too much upon his guard; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for the preſent to diſſemble: and as he perceived, that HAMET'S opinion, and an adminiſtration founded upon it, would render him extremely popular, and at length poſſibly eſtabliſh him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; he was now ſolicitous only to withdraw him from public notice, and perſuade him to leave the government, whatever form it ſhould receive, to be adminiſtered by others: returning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to his feat, and aſſuming an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of complacence and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with which he could not form his language perfectly to agree; <q>Let us then, ſaid he, if a law muſt be ſet up in our ſtead, leave the law to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by our ſlaves: and as nothing will be left for us to do, that is worthy of us, let us devote ourſelves to the pleaſures of eaſe; and if there are any enjoyments peculiar to royalty, let us ſecure them as our only diſtinction from the multitude.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Not ſo, ſays HAMET; for there is yet much for a prince to do, after the beſt ſyſtem of laws has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed:
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021881_0030_0FB753530EA51988"/>
the government of a nation as a whole, the regulation and extent of its trade, the eſtabliſhment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories, the encouragement of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, the application of the revenues, and whatever can improve the arts of peace, and ſecure ſuperiority in war, is the proper object of a king's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But in theſe, ſaid ALMORAN, it will be difficult for two minds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; let us, then, agree to leave theſe alſo to the care of ſome other, whom we can continue as long as we approve, and diſplace when we approve no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: we ſhall, by this expedient, be able to avert the odium of any popular meaſure; and by the ſacrifice of a ſlave, we can always ſatisfy the people, and ſilence public diſcontent.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>To truſt implicity to another, ſays HAMET, is to give up a prerogative, which is at once our higheſt duty and intereſt to keep; it is to betray our truſt, and to ſacrifice our honour to another. The prince, who leaves the government of his people implicitly to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021881_0031_0FB753548C8D6CB8"/>
a ſubject, leaves it to one, who has many more temptations to betray their intereſt than himſelf: a vicegerent is in a ſubordinate ſtation; he has, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, much to fear, and much to hope: he may alſo acquire the power of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he hopes, and averting what he fears, at the public expence; he may ſtand in need of dependants, and may be able no otherwiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them, than by conniving at the fraud or violence which they commit: he may receive, in bribes, an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for his ſhare, as an individual, in the public proſperity; for his intereſt is not eſſentially connected with that of the ſtate; he has a ſeparate intereſt; but the intereſt of the ſtate, and of the king, are one: he may even be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to betray the councils, and give up the intereſts of the nation, to a foreign power; but this is impoſſible to the king; for nothing equivalent to what he would give up, could be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. But as a king has not equal temptations to do wrong, neither is he equally expoſed to oppoſition, when he does right: the meaſures of a ſubſtitute
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021881_0032_0FB7535D14DBC860"/>

                     <p>As ALMORAN now perceived, that the longer this converſation continued, the more he ſhould be embarraſſed; he put an end to it, by appearing to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in what HAMET had propoſed.

AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, in the mean time, applauded himſelf for having thus far practiſed the arts of diſſimulation with ſucceſs; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified himſelf in the reſolutions he had before taken; and conceived new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence and jealouſy againſt HAMET.</p>

                     <p>WHILE HAMET was exulting in his conqueſt, and his heart was overflowing at once with ſelf-compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and affection to his brother; he was told that OMAR was waiting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and deſired admittance. HAMET ordered that he ſhould be immediately introduced; and when OMAR entered, and would have proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he catched him in his arms in a tranſport of affection and eſteem; and having ordered that none ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, compelled him to ſit down on a ſofa.</p>
                     <p>He then related with all the joy of a youthful and an ardent mind, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he had had with ALMORAN, intermixed with expreſſions of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſe and the moſt cordial eſteem. OMAR was not without ſuſpicion, that the ſentiments which ALMORAN had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

only becauſe to communicate ſuſpicions is to accuſe without proof, but becauſe he did not think himſelf at liberty to make an ill report of another, though he knew it to be true. He approved the ſentiments of HAMET, as they had been infuſed by his own inſtructions; and ſome precepts and cautions were now added, which the acceſſion of HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET to a ſhare of the imperial power made particularly neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Remember, ſaid OMAR, that the moſt effectual way of promoting virtue, is to prevent occaſions of vice. There are, perhaps, particular ſituations, in which human virtue has always failed: at leaſt, temptation often repeated, and long continued, has ſeldom been fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſiſted. In a government ſo conſtituted as to leave the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perpetual ſeduction, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of diſſolute pleaſure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitious gain, the multiplication of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws will only tend to depopulate the kingdom, and diſgrace the ſtate; to devote to the cymitar and the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

diſſolute, turbulent and factious. If the ſtreets not only abound with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who inflame the paſſenger by their appearance, their geſture, and their ſolicitations; but with houſes, in which every deſire which they kindle may be gratified with ſecrecy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; it is in vain that <q>the feet of the proſtitute go down to death, and that her ſteps take hold on hell:</q> what then can be hoped from any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which the laws of man can ſuperadd to diſeaſe and want, to rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perdition? If you permit opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um to be publickly ſold at a low rate; it will be folly to hope, that the dread of puniſhment will render idleneſs and drunkenneſs ſtrangers to the poor. If a tax is ſo collected, as to leave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to procure the commodity, without paying it; the hope of gain will always ſurmount the fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If, when the veteran has ſerved you at the riſque of life, you withhold his hire; it will be in vain to threaten uſury and extortion with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and ſines.

rather to preſerve the life of a horſe than a man; be aſſured, that your own ſword is drawn for your enemy: for there will always be ſome, in whom intereſt is ſtronger than humanity and honour.

                     <p>To theſe precepts of OMAR, HAMET liſtened as to the inſtructions of a father; and having promiſed to keep them as the treaſure of life, he diſmiſſed him from his preſence. The heart of HAMET was now expanded with the moſt pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; but ALMORAN was pining with ſolicitude, jealouſy, and diſtruſt: he took every opportunity to avoid both OMAR and HAMET; but HAMET ſtill retained his confidence, and OMAR his ſuſpicions.</p>

                     <p>IN the mean time, the ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was eſtabliſhed which had been propoſed by OMAR, and in which HAMET concurred from principle, and ALMORAN from policy The views of ALMORAN terminated in the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own appetites and paſſions; thoſe of HAMET, in the diſcharge of his duty: HAMET, therefore, was indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in the buſineſs of the ſtate; and as his ſenſe of honour, and his love of the public, made this the employment of his choice, it was to him the perpetual ſource of a generous and ſublime feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. ALMORAN alſo was equally dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but from another motive: he was actuated, not by love of the public, but by jealouſy of his brother; he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his taſk as the drudge of neceſſity, with reluctance and ill will; ſo that to him it produced pain and anxiety, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and impatience.</p>
                     <p>To atone for this waſte of time, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to crowd all that remained with delight: his gardens were an epitome

of all nature, and on his palace were exhauſted all the treaſures of art; his ſeraglio was filled with beauties of every nation, and his table ſupplied with dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the remoteſt corners of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. In the ſongs that were repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his preſence, he liſtened at once to the voice of adulation and muſic; he breathed the perfumes of Arabia, and he taſted the forbidden pleaſure of wine. But as every appetite is ſoon ſatiated by exceſs, his eagerneſs to accumulate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deprived him of enjoyment. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the variety of beauty that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, the paſſion, which, to be luxurious, muſt be delicate and refined, was degraded to a mere inſtinct, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted in endleſs diſſipation; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs was unendeared by a conſciouſneſs of reciprocal delight, and was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded by indifference or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.

him, without being ſeen. Even flattery and muſic loſt their power, by too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent a repetition: and the broken ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the night, and the languor of the morning, were more than equivalent to the tranſient hilarity that was inſpired by wine. Thus paſſed the time of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, divided between painful labors which he did not dare to ſhun, and the ſearch of pleaſure which he could never find.</p>
                     <p>HAMET, on the contrary, did not ſeek pleaſure, but pleaſure ſeemed to ſeek him: he had a perpetual complacence and ſerenity of mind, which rendered him conſtantly ſuſceptible of pleaſing impreſſions; every thing that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to refreſh or entertain him in his ſeaſons of retirement and relaxation, added ſomething to the delight which was continually ſpringing in his breaſt, when he reviewed the paſt, or looked forward to the future. Thus, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſenſe were heightened by thoſe of his mind, and the pleaſures of the mind by thoſe of ſenſe: he had, indeed, as yet no wiſe; for as yet no woman had fixed his attention, or determined his choice.</p>

Among the ambaſſadors whom the monarchs of Aſia ſent to congratulate the ſons of Solyman upon their acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the throne, there was a native of Circaſſia, whoſe name was Abdallah. Abdallah had only one child, a daughter, in whom all his happineſs and affection centered; he was unwilling to leave her behind, and therefore brought her to the court of Perſia. Her mother died while ſhe was yet an infant; ſhe was now in the ſixteenth year of her age, and her name was ALMEDIA. She was beautiful as the daughters of Paradiſe, and gentle as the breezes of the ſpring; her mind was without ſtain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd her manners were without art.</p>
                     <p>She was lodged with her father in a palace that joined to the gardens of the ſeraglio; and it happened that a lamp which had one night been left burning in a lower apartment, by ſome accident ſet fire to the net-work of cotton that ſurrounded a ſopha, and the whole room was ſoon after in a flame. ALMORAN, who had been paſſing the afternoon in riot and debauchery, had been removed from his banquetting room aſleep; but
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021881_0042_0FB7537A166352C0"/>
HAMET was ſtill in his cloſet, where he had been regulating ſome papers that were to be uſed next day. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of this room opened towards the inner apartments of the houſe in which Abdallah reſided; and HAMET, having by accident looked that way, was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appearance of an unuſual light, and ſtarting up to ſee whence it proceeded, he diſcovered what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
                     <p>Having haſtily ordered the guard of the night to aſſiſt in quenching the flame, and removing the furniture, he ran him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the garden. As ſoon as he was come up to the houſe, he was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſhrieks of a female voice; and the next moment, ALMEDIA ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the window of an apartment directly over that which was on fire. ALMEDIA he had till now never ſeen, nor did he ſo much as know that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallah had a daughter: but though her perſon was unknown, he was ſtrongly intereſted in her danger, and called out to her to throw herſelf into his arms. At the found of his voice ſhe ran back into the room, ſuch is the force of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate

                        </gap>he wrapt her veil round her, and leaped into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. HAMET caught her in his arms; but though he broke her fall, he ſunk down with her weight: he did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, quit his charge; but perceiving ſhe had fainted, he made haſte with her into his apartment, to afford her ſuch aſſiſtance as he could procure.</p>
                     <p>She was covered only with the light and looſe robe in which ſhe ſlept, and her veil had dropped off by the way. The moment he entered his cloſet, the light diſcovered to him ſuch beauty as before he had never ſeen: ſhe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to revive; and before her ſenſes returned, ſhe preſſed the prince with an involuntary embrace, which he returned by ſtraining her cloſer to his breaſt, in a tumult of delight, confuſion, and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, which he could ſcarce ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. As he ſtill held her in his arms, and gazed ſilently upon her, ſhe opened her eyes, and inſtantly relinquiſhing her
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021881_0044_0FB753842D1E3390"/>
hold, ſhrieked out, and threw herſelf from him. As there were no women nearer than that wing of the palace in which his brother reſided, and as he had many reaſons not to leave her in their charge; he was in the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity what to do. He aſſured her, in ſome haſty and incoherent words, of her ſecurity; he told her, that ſhe was in the royal palace, and that he who had conveyed her thither was HAMET. The habitual reverence of ſovereign power, now ſurmounted all other paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the boſom of ALMEDIA: ſhe was inſtantly covered with new confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and hiding her face with her hands, threw herſelf at his feet: he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her with a trepidation almoſt equal to her own, and endeavoured to ſooth her into confidence and tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto her memory had been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpended by violent paſſions, which had crowded her in a rapid and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion, and the firſt gleam of recollection threw her into a new agony; and having been ſilent a few moments, ſhe ſuddenly ſmote her hands together, and burſting into tears, cried
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021881_0045_0FB753854AF1ECF8"/>
out, 'Abdallah! my father! my father!'—HAMET not only knew but felt all the meaning of the exclamation, and immediately ran again into the garden: he had advanced but few paces, before he diſcerned an old man ſitting on the ground, and looking upward in ſilent anguiſh, as if he had exhauſted the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of complaint. HAMET, upon a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er approach, perceived by the light of the flame that it was Abdallah; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly calling him by his name, told him, that his daughter was ſafe. At the name of his daughter, Abdallah ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarted up, as if he had been rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the voice of an angel from the ſleep of death: HAMET again repeated, that his daughter was in ſafety; and Abdallah looking wiſtfully at him, knew him to be the king. He was then ſtruck with an awe that reſtrained him from enquiry: but HAMET directing him where he might find her, went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that he might not leſſen the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their interview, nor reſtrain the firſt tranſports of duty and affection by his preſence. He ſoon met with other fugitives from the fire, which had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

a communication between the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and the ſtreet; and among them ſome women belonging to ALMEDIA, whom he conducted himſelf to their miſtreſs. He immediately allotted to her and to her father, an apartment in his diviſion of the palace; and the fire being now nearly extinguiſhed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to reſt.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH the night was far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, yet the eyes of HAMET were ſtrangers to ſleep: his fancy inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly repeated the events that had juſt happened; the image of ALMEIDA was ever before him; and his breaſt throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with a diſquietude, which, though it prevented reſt, he did not wiſh to loſe.</p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, in the mean time, was ſlumbering away the effects of his intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; and in the morning, when he was told what had happened, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no paſſion but curioſity: he went haſtily into the garden; but when he had
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021881_0047_0FB753884DF0C190"/>
gazed upon the ruins, and enquired how the fire began, and what it had conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he thought of it no more.</p>
                     <p>But HAMET ſuffered nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded himſelf to exclude others from his attention: he went again to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, not to gratify his curioſity, but to ſee what might yet be done to alleviate the miſery of the ſufferers, and ſecure for their uſe what had been preſerved from the flames. He found that no life had been loſt, but that many perſons had been hurt; to theſe he ſent the phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of his own houſhold: and having rewarded thoſe who had aſſiſted them in their diſtreſs, not forgetting even the ſoldiers who had only fulfilled his own orders, he returned, and applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to diſpatch the public buſineſs in the chamber of council, with the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and diligent attention as if nothing had happened. He had, indeed, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enquiry to be made after ALMEIDA; and when he returned to his apartment, he ſound Abdallah waiting to expreſs his gratitude for the obligations he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

HAMET accepted his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a peculiar pleaſure, for they had ſome connexion with ALMEIDA; after whom he again enquired, with an ardour uncommon even to the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of HAMET. When all his queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been aſked and anſwered, he appeared ſtill unwilling to diſmiſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallah, though he ſeemed at a loſs how to detain him; he wanted to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his daughter had yet received an offer of marriage, though he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſcover his deſire by a direct enquiry: but he ſoon found, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be known, which was not directly aſked, from a man whom reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility kept ſilent before him, except when ſomething was ſaid which amounted to a command to ſpeak. At length, however, he ſaid, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome heſitation, <q>Is there no one, Abdallah, who will thank me for the preſervation of thy daughter, with a zeal equal to thy own?</q> 
                        <q>Yes, replied Abdallah, that daughter whom thou haſt preſerved.</q> This reply, though it was unexpected, was pleaſing: for HAMET was not only gratified to hear,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:021881_0049_0FB75392174CC478"/>
that ALMEIDA had expreſſed herſelf warmly in his behalf, at leaſt as a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; but he judged, that if any man had been intereſted in her life as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the anſwer which Abdallah had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him would not ſo readily have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to his mind.</p>
                     <p>As this reflection kept HAMET a few moments ſilent, Abdallah withdrew; and HAMET, as he obſerved ſome marks of haſte and confuſion in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was unwilling longer to continue him in a ſituation, which he had now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think gave him pain. But Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallah, who had conceived a ſudden thought that HAMET'S queſtion was an indirect reproach of ALMEIDA, for not having herſelf ſolicited admiſſion to his preſence; went in haſte to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ordered her immediately to make ready to attend him to the king.</p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA, from whoſe mind the image of HAMET had not been abſent a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince ſhe firſt ſaw him, received this order with a mixture of pain and pleaſure; of wiſhes, hopes, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, that ſilled her boſom with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021881_0050_0FB753938EDA3730"/>
and covered her face with bluſhes. She had not courage to aſk the reaſon of the command, which ſhe inſtantly prepared to obey; but the tenderneſs of Abdallah, who perceived and pitied her diſtreſs, anticipated her wiſh. In a ſhort time, therefore, he returned to the chamber of preſence, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved permiſſion, he entered with ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA in his hand. HAMET roſe in haſte to receive her, with a glow of pleaſure and impatience in his countenance; and having raiſed her from the ground, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her in his arms, waiting to hear her voice; but though ſhe made many attempts, ſhe could not ſpeak. HAMET, who knew not to what he owed this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected interview, which, though he wiſhed, he could contrive no means to obtain; imagined that ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA had ſome requeſt, and that therefore urged her tenderly to make it: but as ſhe ſtill remained ſilent, he looked at Abdallah, as expecting to hear it from him. <q>We have no wiſh, ſaid Abdal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, but to atone for our offence; nor any requeſt, but that my lord would now accept the thanks of ALMEIDA
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021881_0051_0FB753950CC16950"/>
for the life which he has preſerved, and impute the delay, not to ingratitude, but inadvertence: let me now take her back, as thy gift; and let the light of thy favour be upon us.</q> 
                        <q>Take her, then, ſaid HAMET; for I would give her only to thee.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words of HAMET did not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the notice either of Abdallah or ALMEIDA; but neither of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned their conjectures to the other. ALMEIDA, who was inclined to judge of HAMET'S ſituation by her own, and who recollected many little incidents, known only to herſelf, which favoured her wiſhes; indulged the hope, that ſhe ſhould again hear of HAMET, with more confidence than her father; nor were her expectations diſappointed. HAMET reflected with pleaſure, that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way for a more explicit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; and as his impatience encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his paſſion every hour, he ſent for Abdallah the next morning, and told him, that he wiſhed to be more acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his daughter, with a view to make her his wife: <q>As neither you nor your daughter are my ſubjects, ſays HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, 
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021881_0052_0FB7539A8C28E658"/>
I cannot command you; and if you were, upon this occaſion I would not. I do not want a ſlave, but a friend; not merely a woman, but a wife. If I find ALMEIDA ſuch as my fancy has feigned her; if her mind correſponds with her form; and if I have reaſon to think, that ſhe can give her heart to HAMET, and not merely her hand to the king, I ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</q> To this declaration, Abdallah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with expreſſions of the profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubmiſſion and gratitude; and HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET diſmiſſed him, to prepare ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA to receive him in the afternoon of the ſame day.</p>

                     <p>AS eight moons had only paſſed ſince the death of Solyman, and as the reverence of HAMET for the memory of his father would not ſuffer him to marry till the year ſhould be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he determined not to mention AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEIDA to his brother, till the time when he could marry her was near. The fierce
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021881_0053_0FB7539ECFFB00E0"/>
and haughty deportment of ALMORAN, had now left HAMET no room to doubt of his character: and though he had no apprehenſion that he would make any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon ALMEIDA, after ſhe ſhould be his wife; yet he did not know how much might juſtly be feared from his paſſion, if he ſhould ſee her and become enamoured of her, while ſhe was yet a virgin in the houſe of her father.</p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA had not only unſullied pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mind, but principles of refined and exalted virtue; and as the life of HAMET was an example of all that was either great or good, Abdallah felt no anxiety upon leaving them together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what aroſe from his fears, that his daughter would not be able to ſecure the conqueſt ſhe had made.</p>
                     <p>As it was impoſſible for HAMET to have ſuch an acquaintance with ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA as he deſired, till he could enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to converſation with her upon terms of equality; it was his firſt care to ſooth her into confidence and familiarity, and by degrees he ſucceeded: he ſoon found, in the free intercourſe of mind with
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021881_0054_0FB753A04DB43D60"/>
mind, which he eſtabliſhed inſtead of the implicit ſubmiſſion which only ecchoed his own voice, how little of the pleaſure that women were formed to give can be enjoyed, when they are conſidered mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſlaves to a tyrant's will, the paſſive ſubjects of tranſient dalliance and caſual enjoyment. The pleaſure which he took in the youthful beauty of ALMEIDA, was now endeared, exalted, and refined, by the tender ſenſibility of her heart, and by the reflexion of his own felicity from her eyes: when he admired the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of her motion, the elegance of her figure, the ſymmetry of her features, and the bloom of her complexion, he conſidered them as the decorations only of a mind capable of mixing with his own in the moſt exquiſite delight, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocating all his ideas, and catching new pleaſure from his pleaſure. Deſire was no longer appetite; it was imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was reaſon; it was included re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the paſt, and anticipation of the future; and its object was not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ex, but ALMEIDA.</p>
                     <p>As HAMET never with-held any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that it was in his power to impart,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021881_0055_0FB753A5F3815938"/>
he ſoon acquainted Abdallah, that he waited only for a proper time to place ALMEIDA upon the throne; but that he had ſome reaſons for keeping a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he thought himſelf obliged to communicate to him, concealed from others.</p>
                     <p>It happened, however, that ſome of the women who attended upon ALME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IDA, met with ſome female ſlaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſeraglio of ALMORAN, at the public baths, and related to them all the particulars of ALMEIDA'S pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by HAMET; that he had firſt conveyed her to his own apartments, and had ſince been frequently with her in that which he had aſſigned her in his palace: they were alſo laviſh in the praiſe of her beauty, and free in their conjectures what might be the iſſue of her intercourſe with HAMET.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ſituation of HAMET and ALMEIDA became the ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the ſeraglio of ALMORAN, who learnt it himſelf in a ſhort time from one of his women.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:021881_0056_0FB753A8C7555990"/>
He had hitherto profeſſed great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for HAMET, and HAMET was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his profeſſions: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the irregularities of his life, he did not think him capable of concealed malice; or of offering injury to another, except when he was urged by impetuous paſſions to immediate pleaſure. As there was, therefore, an appearance of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affection between them, ALMORAN, though the report of ALMEIDA'S beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had fired his imagination and fixed him in a reſolution to ſee her, did not think proper to attempt it without aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing HAMET'S conſent, and being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his order; as he made no doubt of there being a connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which would make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a contrary conduct.</p>
                     <p>He took an opportunity, therefore, when they were alone in a ſummer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion that was built on a lake behind the palace, to reproach him, with an air of mirth, for having concealed a beauty near his apartments, though he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have no ſeraglio. HAMET in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſcovered his ſurprize and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a bluſh, which the next moment
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021881_0057_0FB753AA16D379B0"/>
left his countenance paler than the light clouds that paſs by night over the moon. ALMORAN took no notice of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; but that he might more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conceal his ſentiments and prevent ſuſpicion, he ſuddenly adverted to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject, while HAMET was heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what to reply. By this artifice HAMET was deceived; and concluded, that whatever ALMORAN had heard of ALMEIDA, had paſſed ſlightly over his mind, and was remembered but by chance; he, therefore, quickly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that eaſe and chearfulneſs, which always diſtinguiſhed his converſation.</p>
                     <p>ALMORAN obſerved the ſucceſs of his artifice, ſoon after, as if by a ſudden and caſual recollection, again mentioned the lady; and told him, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate Abdallah upon having reſigned her to his bed. As HAMET could not bear to think of ALMORAN'S mentioning ALMEIDA to her father as his miſtreſs, he replied, that he had no ſuch intimacy with ALMEIDA as he ſuppoſed; and that he had ſo high an opinion of her virtue, as to believe, that if he ſhould propoſe it ſhe would not conſent. The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021881_0058_0FB753AC50501620"/>
imagination of ALMORAN caught new fire from beauties which he found were yet unenjoyed, and virtue which ſtamped them with ſuperior value by rendering them more difficult to acceſs; and as HAMET had renounced a connection with her as a miſtreſs, he wanted only to know whether he intended her for a wife.</p>
                     <p>This ſecret he was contriving to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, when HAMET, having reflected, that if he concealed this particular, AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN might think himſelf at liberty to make what attempts he ſhould think fit upon ALMEIDA, without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him, or giving him juſt cauſe of offence, put an end to his doubts, by telling him, he had ſuch a deſign; but that it would be ſome time before he ſhould carry it into execution. This declaration increaſed ALMORAN'S im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience: ſtill, however, he concealed his intereſt in the converſation, which he now ſuffered to drop.</p>
                     <p>He parted from his brother, without any farther mention of ALMEIDA; but while he was yet near him, turned hastily
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021881_0059_0FB753ADCB967610"/>
back, and, as if merely to gratify his curioſity, told him with a ſmile, that he muſt indulge him with a ſight of his Circaſſian; and deſired he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in his next viſit, or at ſome more convenient time: with this requeſt, HAMET, as he knew not how to refuſe it, complied; but it filled his mind with anxiety and trouble.</p>
                     <p>He went immediately to ALMEIDA, and told her all that had happened; and as ſhe ſaw that he was not without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of miſchief from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's viſit, ſhe gently reproached him for doubting the fidelity of her affection, as ſhe ſuppoſed no power could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted by ALMORAN to injure him, who in power was equal. HAMET, in a tranſport of tenderneſs, aſſured her that he doubted neither her conſtancy nor her love; but as to interrupt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of her mind, would only double his own diſtreſs, he did not tell her whence his apprehenſions proceeded; nor indeed had they any determinate object, but aroſe in general from the character of his brother and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his becoming a competitor, for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021881_0060_0FB753B6AF429A30"/>
what was eſſential to the happineſs of his life.</p>
                     <p>But if the happineſs of HAMET was leſſened, the infelicity of ALMORAN was increaſed. All the enjoyments that were in his power he neglected, his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being wholly fixed upon that which was beyond his reach; he was impatient to ſee the beauty, who had taken entire poſſeſſion of his mind; and the probability that he would be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reſign her to HAMET, tormented him with jealouſy, envy, and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>HAMET, however, did not long delay to fulfil his promiſe to his brother; but having prepared ALMEIDA to receive him, he conducted him to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The idea which ALMORAN had formed in his imagination, was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reality, and his paſſion was proportionably increaſed; yet he found means not only to conceal it from HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, but from ALMEIDA, by affecting an air of levity and merriment, which is not leſs incompatible with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures than the pains of love. After they
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021881_0061_0FB753B793887530"/>
had been regaled with coffee and ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, they parted; and HAMET congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated himſelf that his apprehenſions of finding in ALMORAN a rival for ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA'S love, were now at an end.</p>
                     <p>But ALMORAN, whoſe paſſions were become more violent by reſtraint, was in a ſtate of mind little better than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: one moment he determined to ſeize upon the perſon of ALMEIDA in the night, and ſecrete her in ſome place acceſſible only to himſelf; and the next to aſſaſſinate his brother, that he might at once deſtroy a rival both in empire and in love. But theſe deſigns were no ſooner formed by his wiſhes, than they were rejected by his fears: he was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Many other projects, equally raſh violent, and injurious, were by turn conceived and rejected; and he came a laſt to no other determination, than ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>IN the mean time OMAR, to whom HAMET had from time to time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the minuteſt particulars of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and deſign, kept his eye almoſt continually upon ALMORAN; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him with an attention and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which it was difficult either to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude or deceive. He perceived, that he was more than uſual reſtleſs and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent; that in the preſence of HAMET he frequently changed countenance; that his behaviour was artificial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, frequently ſhifting from gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my diſcontent and furious agitation, to forced laughter and noiſy merriment. He had alſo remarked, that he ſeemed moſt diſcompoſed after he had been with HAMET to ALMEIDA, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021881_0063_0FB753BA8CF761B8"/>
generally once in a week; that he was become fond of ſolitude, and was abſent ſeveral days together from the apartment of his women.</p>
                     <p>OMAR, who from this conduct of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN had begun to ſuſpect his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, determined to introduce ſuch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics of diſcourſe, as might lead him to diſcover the ſtate of his mind; and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to enforce and confirm the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he had taught him, by new proofs and illuſtrations.</p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, who, ſince the death of his father, had nothing to apprehend from the diſcovery of ſentiments which before he had been careful to conceal; now ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his objections againſt religion, when OMAR gave him opportunity, without reſerve. <q>You tell me, ſays he, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are immortal, becauſe they are immaterial; beings which do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of parts, and which, therefore, can admit no ſolution, the only natural cauſe of corruption and decay: but that which is not material, can have no extenſion; and what has no extenſion, poſſeſſes no ſpace; and of ſuch beings,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021881_0064_0FB753C3DA707E60"/>
the mind itſelf, which you pretend to be ſuch a being, has no conception.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If the mind, ſays OMAR, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there is in itſelf any ſingle property of ſuch a being, it has irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable evidence that it is ſuch a being; though its mode of exiſtence, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from matter, cannot now be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</q> 
                        <q>And what property of ſuch a being, ſaid ALMORAN, does the mind of man perceive in itſelf?</q> 
                        <q>That of <hi>acting,</hi> ſaid OMAR, without <hi>motion.</hi> You have no idea, that a material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can act, but in proportion as it moves: yet to <hi>think,</hi> is to <hi>act;</hi> and with the idea of thinking, the idea of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is never connected: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we always conceive the mind to be fixed, in proportion to the degree of ardour and intenſeneſs with which the power of thinking is exerted. Now, if that which is material cannot act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion; and if man is conſcious, that to think, is to act and not to move; it follows, that there is, in man, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is not matter; ſomewhat that has no extenſion, and that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes no ſpace; ſomewhat which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021881_0065_0FB753C50DF3CAE8"/>
no contexture or parts that can be diſſolved or ſeparated, is exempted from all the natural cauſes of decay.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>OMAR pauſed; and ALMORAN ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtood ſome moments without reply, he ſeized this opportunity to impreſs him with an awful ſenſe of the power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Supreme and eternal Being, from whom his own exiſtence was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <q>Let us remember, ſaid he, that to every act of this immaterial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal part, the Father of ſpirits, from whom it proceeds, is preſent: when I behold the buſy multitudes that crowd the metropolis of Perſia, in the purſuit of buſineſs and projects infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated and various; and conſider that every idea which paſſes over their minds, every concluſion and every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with all that they remember of the paſt, and all that they imagine of the future, is at once known to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who without labour or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion weighs every thought of every mind in His ballance, and reſerves it to the day of retribution; my follies cover me with confuſion, and my ſoul is humbled in the duſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="unknown:021881_0066_0FB753C68EEE28A8"/>
ALMORAN, though he appeared to liſten with attention, and offered nothing againſt the reaſoning of OMAR, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly deſpiſed it as ſophiſtry, which cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning only had rendered ſpecious; and which he was unable to confute, merely becauſe it was ſubtil, and not becauſe it was true: he had been led by his paſſions, firſt to love, and then to adopt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions; and as every man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to judge of others by himſelf, he doubted, whether the principles which OMAR had thus laboured to eſtabliſh, were believed even by OMAR himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the mind of ALMORAN to the inſtructions of OMAR, as a rock ſlightly covered with earth, is to the waters of heaven: the craggs are left bare by the rain that waſhes them; and the ſame ſhowers that fertilize the field, can only diſcover the ſterility of the rock.</p>
                     <p>OMAR, however, did not yet diſcloſe his ſuſpicions to HAMET, becauſe he did not yet ſee that it could anſwer any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To remove ALMEIDA from her apartment, would be to ſhew a diſtruſt, for which there would not appear to be

any cauſe; and to refuſe ALMORAN ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to her when he deſired it, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate ſuch meaſures as he might medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and engage him in ſome deſperate attempt: he, therefore, contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with adviſing HAMET, to conceal the time of his marriage till the evening before he intended it ſhould take place, without aſſigning the reaſon on which his advice was founded.</p>
                     <p>To the council of OMAR, HAMET was implicitly obedient, as to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Prophet; but, like his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, it was neglected by ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, who became every moment more wretched. He had a graceful perſon, and vigorous mind; he was in the bloom of youth, and had a conſtitution that promiſed him length of days; he had power which princes were emulous to obey, and wealth by which whatever could adminiſter to luxury might be bought; for every paſſion, and every appetite, it was eaſy for him to procure a perpetual ſucceſſion of new objects: yet was ALMORAN, not only without enjoyment, but without peace; he was by turns pining with diſcontent, and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021881_0068_0FB753CFA636BAE8"/>
raving with indignation; his vices had extracted bitter from every ſweet; and having exhauſted nature for delight in vain, he was repining at the bounds in which he was confined, and regretting the want of other powers as the cauſe of his miſery.</p>
                     <p>Thus the year of mourning for Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was compleated, without any act of violence on the part of ALMORAN, or of caution on the part of HAMET: but on the evening of the laſt day, HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, having ſecretly prepared every thing for performing the ſolemnity in a private manner, acquainted ALMORAN by a letter, which OMAR undertook to deliver, that he ſhould celebrate his marriage on the morrow. ALMORAN, who never doubted but he ſhould have notice of this event much longer before it was to happen, read the letter with a perturbation that it was impoſſible to conceal: he was alone in his private apartment, and taking his eye haſtily from the paper, he cruſhed it together in his hand, and thruſting it into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, turned from OMAR without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and OMAR thinking himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, withdrew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:021881_0069_0FB753D10C3726C8"/>
The paſſions which ALMORAN could no longer ſuppreſs, now burſt out in a torrent of exclamation: <q>Am I then, ſaid he, blaſted for ever with a double curſe, divided empire and diſappointed love! What is dominion, if it is not poſſeſſed alone? and what is power, which the dread of rival power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually controuls? Is it for me to liſten in ſilence to the wrangling of ſlaves, that I may at laſt apportion to them what, with a clamorous inſolence, they demand as their due! as well may the ſun linger in his courſe, and the world mourn in darkneſs for the day, that the glow-worm may ſtill be ſeen to glimmer upon the earth, and the owls and bats that haunt the ſepulchres of the dead enjoy a longer night. Yet this have I done, becauſe this has been done by HAMET: and my heart ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens in vain with the deſire of beauty, becauſe my power extends not to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEIDA. With dominion undivided and ALMEIDA, I ſhould be ALMORAN; but without them, I am leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</q>

                     <p>At firſt, both ſtood motionleſs with confuſion and amazement; but ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN'S pride ſoon ſurmounted his other paſſions, and his diſdain of OMAR gave his guilt the firmneſs of virtue.</p>

the robe; and proſtrating himſelf upon the ground, intreated to be heard. His importunity at length prevailed; and he attempted to exculpate himſelf, from the charge of having inſidiouſly intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the privacy of his prince; but ALMORAN ſternly interrupted him:—<q>And what art thou, ſaid he, that I ſhould care, whether thou art innocent or guilty?</q> 
                        <q>If not for my ſake, ſaid OMAR, liſten for thy own; and though my duty is deſpiſed, let my affection be heard. That thou art not happy, I know; and I now know the cauſe. Let my lord pardon the preſumption of his ſlave: he that ſeeks to ſatisfy all his wiſhes, muſt be wretched; he only can be happy, by whom ſome are ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</q> At theſe words ALMORAN ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his robe from the hand of OMAR, and ſpurned him in a tranſport of rage and indignation: <q>The ſuppreſſion of deſire, ſaid he, is ſuch happineſs, as that of the deaf who do not remember to have heard. If it is virtue, know, that, as virtue, I diſpiſe it; for though it may ſecure the obedience of the ſlave, it can only degrade the prerogative of a

prince. I caſt off all reſtraint, as I do thee: begone, therefore, to HAMET, and ſee me no more.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>OMAR obeyed without reply; and AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN being again alone, the conflict in his mind was renewed with greater violence than before. He felt all that he had diſguiſed to OMAR, with the keeneſt ſenſibility; and anticipated the effects of his detection, with unutterable anguiſh and regret. He walked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward with a haſty but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted pace; ſometimes ſtopping ſhort, and preſſing his hand hard upon his brow; and ſometimes by violent jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhowing the agitation of his mind: he ſometimes ſtood ſilent with his eyes fixed upon the ground, and his arms folded together: and ſometimes a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den agony of thought forced him into loud and tumultuous exclamations: he curſed the impotence of mind that had ſuffered his thoughts to eſcape from him unawares, without reflecting that he was even then repeating the folly; and while he felt himſelf the victim of vice, he could not ſuppreſs his contempt of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: <q>If I muſt periſh, ſaid he, I will at

                     <p>ALMORAN, when he recovered from his aſtoniſhment, and had reflected upon the prodigy, determined to wait the iſſue, and refer all his hopes to the interpoſition of the Genius, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting any thing to retard the marriage; at which he reſolved to be preſent, that he might improve any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural event which might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in his favour.</p>
                     <p>HAMET, in the mean time, was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating the morrow with a mixture of anxiety and pleaſure; and though he had no reaſon to think any thing could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his marriage, yet he wiſhed it was over, with an impatience that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed by fear.</p>
                     <p>Though the anticipation of the great event that was now ſo near, kept him waking the greateſt part of the night, yet he roſe early in the morning; and while he waited till ALMEIDA ſhould be ready to ſee him, he was told that OMAR was without, and deſired admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021881_0076_0FB753EA1B1EBFC0"/>
When he came in, HAMET, who always watched his countenance as a mariner the ſtars of heaven, perceived that it was obſcured with perplexity and grief. <q>Tell me, ſaid HAMET, whence is the ſorrow that I diſcover in thy face?</q> 
                        <q>I am ſorrowful, ſaid OMAR, not for myſelf, but for thee.</q> At theſe words HAMET ſtept backward, and fixed his eyes upon OMAR, without power to ſpeak. <q>Conſider, ſaid OMAR, that thou art not a man only, but a prince: conſider alſo, that immortality is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; and that thy felicity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; and that thy felicity, during the endleſs ages of immortality, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon thyſelf: fear not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what thou canſt ſuffer from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the evil and the good of life are tranſient as the morning dew, and over theſe only the hand of others can prevail.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HAMET, whoſe attachment to life was ſtrong, and whoſe expectations of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate enjoyment were high, did not feel the force of what OMAR had ſaid, though he aſſented to its truth. <q>Tell me, ſaid he, at once, what thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

whom there is wiſdom from everlaſting to everlaſting, and He illuminated my darkneſs with His light. I know, by ſuch ſenſations as the world either feels not at all, or feels unnoticed without knowledge of their uſe, when the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are inviſible are permitted to mingle in the walks of men; and well I know, that ſome being, who is more than mortal, has joined with ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN againſt thee, ſince the veil of night was laſt ſpread upon the earth.</q>

                     <p>HAMET, whoſe blood was chilled with horror, and whoſe nerves were no longer obedient to his will, after ſeveral ineffectual attempts to ſpeak, looked up at OMAR; and ſtriking his hand upon his breaſt, cried out, in an earneſt, but faultering voice, 'What ſhall I do?' <q>Thou muſt do, ſaid OMAR, that which is RIGHT. Let not thy foot be drawn by any allurement, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by any terror, from the path of virtue.

ALMORAN, upon preſumption that his right had been decided by a ſuperior power; the guard ruſhed between HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET and ALMEIDA, and with looks that expreſſed the utmoſt reluctance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, attempted to ſeparate their hands, which were claſped in each other. She was affrighted at the violence, but yet more at the apprehenſion of what was to follow; ſhe, therefore, turned her eyes upon HAMET, conjuring him not to leave her, in a tone of tenderneſs and diſtreſs which it is impoſſible to deſcribe: he replied with a vehemence that was worthy of his paſſion, <q>I will not leave thee,</q> and immediately drew his ſabre. At the ſame moment they forced her from him; and a party having interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to cover thoſe that were carrying her off, HAMET lifted up his weapon to force his paſſage through them; but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by OMAR, who, having preſſed through the crowd, preſented himſelf before him. 'Stop me not,' ſaid HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, 'it is for ALMEIDA.' <q>If thou wouldſt ſave ALMEIDA," ſaid OMAR, and thyſelf, do that only which is RIGHT. What have theſe done who

                     <p>Theſe words of OMAR ſuſpended the rage of HAMET, like a charm; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his ſcymitar into its ſheath, <q>Let me then, ſaid he, ſuffer, and be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.

To govern in concert with thee, is to aſſociate with the powers of hell. The beings that are ſuperior to evil, are the friends of HAMET; and if theſe are thy enemies, what ſhall be thy deſence?</q> ALMORAN replied only by a contemptuous ſmile;

and the aſſembly being diſmiſſed, he retired to his apartment; and HAMET and OMAR went out to the people, who had gathered in an incredible multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude about the palace.</p>

                     <p>ARUMOUR of what had happened within had reached them, which ſome believed, and ſome doubted: but when they ſaw OMAR and HAMET re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn together, and obſerved that their looks were full of reſentment and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they became ſilent with attention in a moment; which OMAR obſerving, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them with an eloquence of which they had often acknowledged the force, and of which they never repented the effect.</p>
                     <p>He told them the tender connection between HAMET and ALMEIDA, and diſcloſed the ſubtil hypocricy of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN: he expatiated upon the folly of ſuppoſing, that the power that was ſupreme in goodneſs and truth, ſhould

command a violation of vows that had been mutually interchanged, and often repeated; and devote to ALMORAN the beauties, which could only be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſurrendered to HAMET. They heard him with a vacant countenance of ſurprize and wonder: and while he waited for their reply, they agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, that no man could avoid the deſtiny that was written upon his head; and that if ALMEIDA had thus been taken from HAMET, and given to ALMORAN, it was an event that by an unchangeable decree was appointed to happen; and that, therefore, it was their duty to acquieſce. OMAR then beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his hand for audience a ſecond time; and told them, that ALMORAN had not only practiſed the arts of ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to deprive HAMET of ALMEIDA, but that he meditated a deſign to uſurp the ſole dominion, and deprive him of the ſhare of the government to which he had a right by the will of Solyman his father.

it? and if it is not, who can bring it to paſs? <q>But know ye not, ſaid O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAR, that when the end is appointed, the means are appointed alſo. If it is decreed that one of you ſhall this night die by poiſon, is it not decreed alſo that he ſhall drink it?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The croud now gazed upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without reply, for ſome minutes: and at laſt they only ſaid, that no effort of theirs could change the univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of all things; that if ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN was to be king alone, he would be ſo notwithſtanding all oppoſition; and that if he was not to be king alone, no attempt of his own, however ſupported, could make him ſo. <q>I will not, ſaid OMAR, contradict your opinion; I will only tell you what I have heard, and leave you to ſuffer the calamities which threaten you, with a fortitude and reſignation that are ſuitable to your principles; having no conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to offer you, but that HAMET, whoſe deſtiny it was not to make you happy, will ſuffer with you the evils, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor you could prevent: the mournful comfort of this fellowſhip,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021881_0089_0FB754190D149260"/>
he will not be denied; for he loves you too well, to wiſh even to be happy alone.</q> The crowd fixed their eyes upon HAMET, for whom their affection was now ſtrongly moved, with looks of much greater intelligence and ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a confuſed murmur, like the fall of the pebbles upon the beach when the ſurge retires from the ſhore, expreſſed their gratitude to HAMET, and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>OMAR waited till they were again ſilent, and then improved the advantage he had gained. <q>ALMORAN, ſaid he, conſiders you as the ſlaves of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; HAMET as the objects of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence: your lives and your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, in the opinion of ALMORAN, are below his notice; but HAMET conſiders his own intereſt as connected with yours.

A new fire was now kindled in their eyes, and their cheeks glowed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at the wrongs that threatened them; they were no longer diſpoſed to act upon the principles of fatality, as they had perverſely underſtood them; and they argued at once like reaſonable and free beings, whoſe actions were in their choice, and who had no doubt but that their actions would produce adequate effects. They recollected that OMAR had, in the reign of Solyman, often reſcued them from ſuch oppreſſion, as now threatened them; and that the power of HAMET had ſince interpoſed in their behalf, when ALMORAN would have ſtretched his prerogative to their hurt, or have left them a prey to the farmer of a tax. <q>Shall HAMET, ſaid they, be deprived of the power, that he employs only to our benefit; and ſhall it center in ALMORAN, who will abuſe it to our ruin? Shall we rather ſupport ALMORAN in the wrong he has done to HAMET, than HAMET to obtain juſtice of ALMORAN? HAMET is our king; let him command us, and we will obey.</q> This was uttered with a

ſhout that echoed from the mountains beyond the city, and continued near a full hour. In the men time, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was increaſing every moment; and the troops that lay in and near the city having taken arms, fell in with the ſtream: they were ſecretly attached to HAMET, under whoſe eye they had been formed, and of whoſe bounty they had often pertaken; and their fear being removed by the general cry, which left them no room to apprehend an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in favour of ALMORAN, they were now at full liberty to follow their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, ALMORAN, who had retired to the intermoſt court of the palace, had heard the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the inſurrection and to what end its force would be directed.</p>
                     <p>Among thoſe whom accident rather than choice had attached to the intereſt
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:021881_0092_0FB7541D945692D0"/>
of ALMORAN, were Oſmyn and Caled: they were both diſtinguiſhed by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and each had conceived hopes that, if he ſhould poſſeſs the throne alone, he would delegate his authority to him. ALMORAN now ordered them to take the command of the troops, that were appointed to attend his perſon as their peculiar duty, with as many others as had not declared for HAMET, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all the avenues that led to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</p>
                     <p>OMAR and HAMET were now on horſeback, and had begun to form the troops that had joined them, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others as were armed, which were before mingled together in a confuſed multitude. An account of this was brought to ALMORAN by Oſmyn; and threw him into a perturbation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that diſgraced his character, and confounded his attendants. He urged Oſmyn, in whom he moſt confided, to diſpatch, without giving him any orders to execute; then turning from him, he uttered, in a low and inarticulate voice, the moſt paſſionate exclamations of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and terror, being ſtruck with the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021881_0093_0FB7542AC099A7F0"/>
thought that his guard might betray him: when he recollected himſelf, and perceived that Oſmyn was ſtill preſent, he burſt into a rage, and ſnatched out his poignard, he ſwore by the ſoul of the Prophet, that if he did not inſtantly attempt ſomething, he would ſtab him to the heart. Oſmyn drew back trembling and confuſed; but having yet received no orders, he would have ſpoken, but ALMORAN drove him from his preſence with menaces and execrations.</p>
                     <p>The moment that Oſmyn left him, his rage ſubſided in his fears, and his fears were mingled with remorce:—<q>Which way ſoever I turn, ſaid he, I ſee myſelf ſurrounded by deſtruction. I have incenſed Oſmyn by unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpleaſure, and cauſeleſs menaces. He muſt regard me at once with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and contempt: and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but he ſhould revolt to HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this agony, the terrors of futurity ruſhed upon his mind with all their force; and he ſtarted as if at the bite of a ſcorpion: <q>To me, ſaid he, death,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021881_0094_0FB7542B9FAF2138"/>
that now approaches, will be but the beginning of ſorrow. I ſhall be cut off at once from enjoyment, and from hope; and the dreadful moment is now at hand.</q> While he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the palace again ſhook, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>'ALMORAN,' ſaid the inhabitant of the unapparent world, <q>the evil which thou feareſt, ſhall not be upon thee. Make haſte, and ſhew thyſelf from the gallery to the people, and the tumult of faction ſhall be ſtill before thee: tell them, that their rebellion is not againſt thee only, but againſt Him by whom thou reigneſt: appeal boldly to that power for a confirmation of thy words, and rely for the atteſting ſign upon me.</q> ALMORAN, who had ſtooped with his face to the ground, now looked upward, and found himſelf alone: he haſted, therefore, to follow the directions he had received; and hope was again kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in his boſom.</p>
                     <p>Oſmyn, in the mean time, made a proper diſpoſition of the troops now

While he was waiting at his poſt, and revolving in his mind the total diſappointment of his hopes, and conſidering what he ſhould do if HAMET ſhould eſtabliſh himſelf alone, he was joined by Caled.</p>
                     <p>Caled had a ſecret enmity againſt Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn, as his rival in the favour of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN; but as he had concealed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If we had gone over to HAMET, when he firſt declared againſt his brother, he would have received us with joy, and probably have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded our ſervice; but I know, that his virtue will abhor us for treachery, though practiſed in his favour: trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, under the dominion of HAMET, will not only cover us with diſhonour, but will probably devote us to death.</q>

                     <p>In this reaſoning, Caled could not but acquieſce; he felt himſelf ſecretly but forcibly reproved, by the ſuperior virtue of Oſmyn: and while he regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his having made a propoſal, which had been rejected not only as impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent but infamous; he concluded, that Oſmyn would ever after ſuſpect and deſpiſe him; and he, therefore, from a new cauſe, conceived new enmity againſt him.

                     <p>ALMORAN had now reached the gallery; and when the multitude ſaw him, they ſhouted as in triumph, aud demanded that he ſhould ſurrender.

The diſappointment of his hope, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his right, were the chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her regret and her fears, in all that had already happened, and in all that was ſtill to come; every inſult that might be offered to herſelf, ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an injury to him. Yet the thoughts of all that he might ſuffer in her perſon, gave way to her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of what might befall him in his own: in his ſituation, every calamity

that her imagination could conceive, was poſſible; her thoughts were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bewildered amidſt an endleſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of dreadful images, which ſtarted up before them which way ſoever they were turned; and it was impoſſible that ſhe could gain any certain intelligence of his fate, as the ſplendid priſon in which ſhe was now confined, was ſurrounded by mutes and eunuchs, of whom nothing could be learned, or in whoſe report no confidence could be placed.</p>
                     <p>While her mind was in this ſtate of agitation and diſtreſs, ſhe perceived the door open, and the next moment AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN entered the apartment. When ſhe ſaw him, ſhe turned from him with a look of unutterable anguiſh; and hiding her face in her veil, ſhe burſt into tears. The tyrant was moved with her diſtreſs; for unfeeling obduracy is the vice only of the old, whoſe ſenſibility has been worn away by the habitual perpetration of reiterated wrongs.</p>
                     <p>He approached her with looks of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his voice was involuntarily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated to pity; ſhe was, however, too

He gazed upon her with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and admiration; and taking her hand into his own, he preſſed it ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his boſom: his compaſſion ſoon kindled into deſire, and from ſoothing her diſtreſs, he began to ſolicit her love. This inſtantly rouſed her attention, and reſentment now ſuſpended her grief: ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ALMORAN, that he might at once addreſs her virtue and her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, obſerved, that tho' he had loved her from the firſt moment he had ſeen her, yet he had concealed his paſſion even from her, till it had received the ſanction of an inviſible and ſuperior power; that he came, therefore, the meſſenger of heaven; and that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her unrivalled empire and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. To this ſhe anſwered only by an impatient and fond enquiry after HAMET. <q>Think not of HAMET, ſaid ALMORAN; for why ſhould he who is rejected of Heaven, be ſtill the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of ALMEIDA?</q> 
                        <q>If thy hand,

ſaid ALMEIDA, could quench in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting darkneſs, that vital ſpark of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual fire, which the word of the Almighty has kindled in my breaſt to burn for ever, then might ALMEIDA ceaſe to think of HAMET; but while that ſhall live, whatever form it ſhall inhabit, or in whatever world it ſhall reſide, his image ſhall be for ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to him ſhall my love be for ever true.</q> This glowing declaration of her love for HAMET, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded by a tender anxiety for his ſafety; and a ſudden reflection upon the probability of his death, and the danger of his ſituation if alive, threw her again into tears.</p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, whom the ardour and impetuoſity of her paſſions kept ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſilent, and ſometimes threw into confuſion, again attempted to ſooth and comfort her: ſhe often urged him to tell her what was become of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he as often evaded the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As ſhe was now about to renew her enquiry, and reflected that it had already been often made, and had not yet been anſwered, ſhe thought that AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:021881_0109_0FB754574C613850"/>
MORAN had already put him to death: this threw her into an agony, of which he did not immediately diſcover the cauſe; but as he ſoon learned it from her reproaches and exclamations, he perceived that he could not hope to be heard, while ſhe was in doubt about the ſafety of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

ſuſpended for a while every paſſion, but her love: the ſudden eaſe of her mind made her regardleſs of all about her, and ſhe had in this interval ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ALMORAN to remove her veil, without reflecting upon what he was doing. The moment ſhe recollected herſelf, ſhe made a gentle effort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, with ſome confuſion, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anger.

He ſeized her hand, and gazing ardently upon her, he conjured her, with a tone and emphaſis that ſtrongly expreſſed the tumultuous vehemence of his wiſhes, that ſhe would renounce the rites which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden above, and that ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to whom by miracle ſhe had been allotted.</p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA, whom the manner and
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:021881_0111_0FB7545F2B2C4EA0"/>
voice of ALMORAN had terrified into ſilence, anſwered him at firſt only with a look that expreſſed averſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, over-awed by fear. <q>Wilt thou not, ſaid ALMORAN, fulfil the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Heaven? I conjure thee, by Heaven to anſwer.</q> From this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn reference to Heaven, ALMEIDA derived new fortitude: ſhe inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that ſhe ſtood in the preſence of Him, by whoſe permiſſion only every other power, whether viſible or inviſible, can diſpenſe evil or good: <q>Urge no more, ſaid ſhe, as the decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that which is inconſiſtent with Divine perfection. Can He, in whoſe hand my heart is, command me to wed the man whom He has not enabled me to love? Can the Pure, the Juſt, the Merciful, have ordained that I ſhould ſuffer embraces which I loath, and violate vows which His laws per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to make? Can He have ordained a perfidious, a loveleſs, and a joyleſs proſtitution? What if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand prodigies ſhould concur to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it a thouſand times, the deed itſelf would be a ſtronger proof that

thoſe prodigies were the works of darkneſs, than thoſe prodigies that the deed was commanded by the Father of light.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, whoſe hopes were now blaſted to the root, who perceived that the virtue of ALMEIDA could neither be deceived nor overborne; that ſhe at once contemned his power, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ALMEIDA beheld him with an earneſt yet ſteady countenance, till he vowed to revenge the indignity he had ſuffered, upon HAMET. At the name of HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, her fortitude forſook her; the pride of virtue gave way to the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of love; her cheeks became pale, her lips trembled, and taking hold of the robe of ALMORAN, ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his feet. His fury was at firſt ſuſpended by hope and expectation; but when from her words, which grief and terror had rendered ſcarce articulate,

                     <p>As he paſſed through the gallery with a haſty and diſordered pace, he was ſeen by OMAR; who knowing that he was returned from an interview with ALMEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA, and conjecturing from his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance what had happened, judged that he ought not to neglect this opportunity to warn him once more of the deluſive phantoms, which, under the appearance of pleaſure, were leading him to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he, therefore, followed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived, till he had reached the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he had been uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire alone, and heard again the loud and tumultuous exclamations, which were wrung from his heart by the anguiſh of diſappointment: <q>What have I gained, ſaid he, by abſolute dominion!

It was my wiſh alſo to have the perſon of ALMEIDA in my power, and this wiſh alſo has been gratified; yet I am ſtill wretched. But I am wretched, only becauſe the means have not been ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the end: what I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obtained, I have not deſired for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and of that, for which I deſired it, I am not poſſeſſed: I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtill wretched, becauſe I am weak.

                     <p>Oſmyn, who was pleaſed with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of recommending himſelf to ALMORAN, by praiſing an act of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous virtue which he ſuppoſed him now to exert in favour of his brother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the command with a look, that expreſſed not only approbation but joy: <q>Let the ſword of deſtruction, ſaid he, be the guard of the tytant; the ſtrength of my lord ſhall be the bonds of love: thoſe, who honour thee as ALMORAN, ſhall rejoice in thee as the friend of HAMET.</q> To ALMORAN, who was conſcious of no kindneſs for his brother, the praiſe of Oſmyn was a reproach: he was offended at the joy which he ſaw kindled in his countenance, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſhew favour to HAMET; and was fired with ſudden rage at that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of his real conduct, which was implied by an incomium on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of which he aſſumed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for a malevolent and perſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſe: his brow was contracted, his lip quivered, and the hilt of his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was again graſped in his hand. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:021881_0121_0FB7547C0CB2CF08"/>
was again overwhelmed with terror and confuſion; he had again offended, but knew not his offence. In the mean time, ALMORAN recollecting that to expreſs diſpleaſure againſt Oſmyn was to betray his own ſecret, endeavoured to ſuppreſs his anger; but his anger was ſucceeded by remorſe, regret, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. The anguiſh of his mind broke out in imperfect murmurs: <q>What I am, ſaid he, is, to the wretch, the object not only of hatred but of ſcorn; and he commends only what I am not, in what to him I would ſeem to be.</q>

In theſe reflections, did the ſovereign and the ſlave paſs thoſe moments, in which the ſovereign intended to render the ſlave ſubſervient to his pleaſure or his ſecurity, and the ſlave intended to expreſs a zeal which he really felt, and a homage which his heart had already paid. Oſmyn was at length, however, diſmiſſed with an aſſurance, that all was well; and ALMORAN was again left to reflect with anguiſh upon the paſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the preſent, and to anticipate the future with ſolicitude, anxiety, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation.</p>
                     <p>He was, however, determined to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the figure of his brother, by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſman which had been put in his power by the Genius: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This held him ſome time in ſuſpenſe: but reflecting that HAMET might not, perhaps, be apprized of his advantage, till it was too late to improve it; that he was now a fugitive, and probably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

leaving Perſia behind him with all the ſpeed he could make; and that at the worſt, if he ſhould be ſtill near, if he ſhould know the transformation as ſoon as it ſhould be made, and ſhould inſtantly take the moſt effectual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to improve it; yet as he could diſſolve the charm in a moment, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhould be neceſſary for his ſafety, no formidable danger could be incurred by the experiment, to which he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, proceeded without delay.</p>

                     <p>IN the mean time, HAMET, to whom his own ſafety was of no importance but for the ſake of ALMEIDA, reſolved if poſſible, to conceal himſelf near the city. Having, therefore, reached the confines of the deſert, by which it was bounded on the eaſt, he quitted his horſe, and determined to remain there till the multitude was diſperſed, and the darkneſs of the evening might conceal his return, when in leſs than an hour he could reach the place.</p>

He ſat down at the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Kabeſſed, without conſidering, that in this place he was moſt likely to be found, as thoſe who travel the deſert ſeldom fail to enter the cave that winds its way under the mountain, to drink of the water that iſſues there from a clear and copious ſpring.</p>
                     <p>He reviewed the ſcenes of the day that was now nearly paſſed, with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of aſtoniſhment and diſtreſs, to which no deſcription can be equal. The ſudden and amazing change that a few hours had made in his ſituation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like a wild and diſtreſsful dream, from which he almoſt doubted whether he ſhould not wake to the power and the felicity that he had loſt. He ſat ſome time bewildered in the hurry and multiplicity of his thoughts, and at length burſt out into paſſionate excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: <q>What, ſays he, and where am I? Am I, indeed, HAMET; that ſon of Solyman who divided the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Perſia with his brother, and who poſſeſſed the love of ALMEIDA alone? Dreadful viciſſitude!

without an aſſociate, and without a dwelling: for me the cup of adverſity overflows, and the laſt dregs of ſorrow have been wrung out for my portion: the powers not only of the earth, but of the air, have combined againſt me; and how can I ſtand alone before them? But is there no power that will interpoſe in my behalf? If He, who is ſupreme, is good, I ſhall not periſh. But wherefore am I thus?

                     </p>
                     <p>With theſe reflections he ſoothed the anguiſh of his mind, till the dreadful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arrived, in which the power of the taliſman took place, and the figure of ALMORAN was changed into that of HAMET; and the figure of HAMET in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of ALMORAN.</p>
                     <p>At the moment of transformation, HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET was ſeized with a ſudden langour, and his faculties were ſuſpended as by the ſtroke of death. When the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

his limbs ſtill trembled, and his lips were parched with thirſt: he roſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and entering the cavern, at the mouth of which he had been ſitting, he ſtooped over the well to drink; but glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his eyes upon the water, he ſaw, with aſtoniſhment and horror, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, not his own countenance, but that of his brother. He ſtarted back from the prodigy; and ſupporting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the ſide of the rock, he ſtood ſome time like a ſtatue, without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of recollection: but at length the thought ſuddenly ruſhed into his mind, that the ſame ſorcery which had ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his marriage, and driven him from the throne, was ſtill practiſed againſt him; and that the change of his figure to that of ALMORAN, was the effect of ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN'S having aſſumed his likeneſs, to obtain, in this diſguiſe, whatever AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEIDA could beſtow. This thought, like a whirlwind of the deſert, totally ſubverted his mind; his fortitude was borne down, and his hopes were rooted up; no principles remained to regulate his conduct, but all was phrenſy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and deſpair. He ruſhed out of

When he ſaw ALMORAN, therefore, in the likeneſs of HAMET, he felt a ſecret deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize him of his ſituation, and offer him his friendſhip.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="unknown:021881_0137_0FB754B4F0CE5AB0"/>
held him long in ſuſpenſe; a thouſand expedients occurred to his mind by turns, and by turns were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                     <p>His firſt thought was to put Oſmyn to death: but he conſidered, that by this he would gain no advantage, as he would be in equal danger from whoever ſhould ſucceed him: he conſidered alſo, that againſt Oſmyn he was upon his guard; and that he might at any time learn, from him, whatever deſign might be formed in favour of HAMET, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming HAMET'S appearance: that he would thus be the confident of every ſecret, in which his own ſafety was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and might diſconcert the beſt contrived project at the very moment of its execution, when it would be too late for other meaſures to be taken: he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, therefore, to let Oſmyn live; at leaſt, till it became more neceſſary to cut him off. Having in ſome degree ſoothed and fortified his mind by theſe reflections, he entered the apartment of ALMEIDA.</p>
                     <p>His hope was not founded upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to marry her under the appearance
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:021881_0138_0FB754B5CD43B8B0"/>
of HAMET, for that would be impoſſible, as the ceremony muſt have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the prieſts who ſuppoſed the marriage with HAMET to have been forbidden by a divine command; and who, therefore, would not have confen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even ſuppoſing they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have ventured, at the requeſt of HAMET, to perform a ceremony which they knew would be diſpleaſing to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN: but he hoped to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her tenderneſs for his brother, and the particular circumſtances of her ſituation, which made the ſolemnities of marriage impoſſible, to ſeduce her to gratify his deſires, without the ſanction which alone rendered the gratification of them lawful: if he ſucceeded in this deſign, he had reaſon to expect, either that his love would be extinguiſhed by enjoyment; or that, if he ſhould ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to marry ALMEIDA, he might, by diſcloſing to her the artifice by which he had effected his purpoſe, prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her to conſent, as her connection with HAMET, the chief obſtacle to her marriage with him, would then be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ever; and as ſhe might, perhaps,

wiſh to ſanctify the pleaſure which ſhe might be not unwilling to repeat, or at leaſt to make that lawful, which it would not be in her power to prevent.</p>
                     <p>In this diſpoſition, and with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he was admitted to ALMEIDA; who, without ſuſpicion of her danger, was expoſed to the ſevereſt trial, in which every paſſion concurred to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her virtue: ſhe was ſolicited by all the powers of ſubtilty and deſire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of a lover, whoſe tenderneſs and fidelity had been long tried, and whoſe paſſion ſhe returned with equal conſtancy and ardour; and ſhe was thus ſolicited, when the rites which alone could conſecrate their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were impoſſible, and were rendered impoſſible by the guilty deſigns of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, in whoſe power ſhe was, and from whom no other expedient offered her a deliverance. Thus deceived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, ſhe received him with an exceſs of tenderneſs and joy, which flattered all his hopes, and for a moment ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his miſery. She enquired, with a fond and gentle ſolicitude, by what means he had gained admittance, and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:021881_0140_0FB754BC38841FD8"/>
how he had provided for his retreat. He received and returned her careſſes with a vehemence, in which, to leſs partial eyes, deſire would have been more apparent than love; and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She then complained of the ſolicitations to which ſhe was expoſed, expreſſed her dread of the conſequences ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect from the ſudden ſally of the tyrant's rage, and related with tears the brutal outrage ſhe had ſuffered when he laſt left her: <q>Though I abhorred him, ſaid ſhe, I yet kneeled before him for thee.

                     <p>At theſe words, the face of ALMORAN was again covered with the bluſhes of confuſion; to be ſtill beloved only as HAMET, and as ALMORAN to be ſtill hated; to be thus reproached without anger, and wounded by thoſe who knew not that they ſtruck him; was a ſpecies of miſery peculiar to himſelf, and had been incurred only by the acquiſition of new powers, which he had requeſted and received as neceſſary to obtain that felicity, which the parſimony of nature had placed beyond his reach. His emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however, as by ALMEIDA they were ſuppoſed to be the emotions of HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, ſhe imputed to a different cauſe: <q>As Heaven, ſays ſhe, has preſerved thee from death; ſo has it, for thy ſake, preſerved me from violation.</q> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, whoſe paſſion had in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val again ſurmounted his remorſe, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed eagerly upon her, and catching her to his boſom: <q>Let us at leaſt, ſays he, ſecure the happineſs that is now offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let not theſe ineſtimable moments paſs by us unimproved; but to ſhew

As they were now reclining upon a ſofa, he threw his arm round her; but ſhe ſuddenly ſprung up, and burſt from him: the tear ſtarted to her eye, and ſhe gazed upon him with an earneſt but yet tender look: 'Is it?' ſays ſhe—<q>No ſure, it is not the voice of HAMET!</q> 
                        <q>O! yes, ſaid ALMORAN, what other voice ſhould call thee to cancel at once the wrongs of HAMET and ALMEIDA; to ſecure the treaſures of thy love from the hand of the robber; to hide the joys, which if now we loſe we may loſe for ever, in the ſacred and inviolable ſtores of the paſt, and place them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power not of ALMORAN only but of fate?</q> With this wild effuſion of deſire, he caught her again to his breaſt, and finding no reſiſtance his heart exulted in his ſucceſs; but the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the total diſappointment of his hopes, he perceived that ſhe had faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his arms. When ſhe recovered, ſhe once more diſengaged herſelf from him, and turning away her face, ſhe burſt into tears£ When her voice could be heard, ſhe covered herſelf with her veil, and turning again towards him, <q>All but

You was my only ſolace in diſtreſs; and when the tears have ſtolen from my eyes in ſilence and in ſolitude, I thought on thee; I tho't upon the chaſte ardour of thy ſacred friendſhip, which was ſoftened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refined, and exalted into love.

As ALMORAN now perceived, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ALMEIDA, by this impious inſult, was rouſed from grief to indignation: <q>As thou haſt now dared, ſaid ſhe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the laws, which thou wouldſt firſt have broken; ſo haſt thou broken for ever the tender bonds, by which my ſoul was united to thine.

Thus to have incurred the hatred of ALMEIDA in the form of HAMET, was more fortunate than to have taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her love; the path that led to his wiſhes was now clear and open; and his marriage with ALMEIDA in his own perſon, waited only till he could reſume it.

ALMORAN, or conceal his fault, was led to conſider what puniſhment he would either incur or eſcape in conſequence of her determination; and the images that ruſhed into her mind, the moment this became the object of her thoughts, at once determined her to be ſilent: <q>Could I bear to ſee, ſaid ſhe, that hand, which has ſo often trembled with delight when it enſolded mine, convulſed and black! thoſe eyes, that as often as they gazed upon me were diſſolved in tears of tenderneſs and love, ſtart from the ſockets! and thoſe lips that breathed the ſofteſt ſighs of elegant deſire, diſtorted and gaſping in the convulſions of death!</q>

<pb n="155" facs="unknown:021881_0152_0FB754E3C2F9D358"/>
now, not as HAMET, but as AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN; and that he was to queſtion ALMEIDA concerning ALMORAN, while ſhe had miſtaken him for HAMET; he was therefore to maintain the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at whatever expence, till his doubts were reſolved, and his fears either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or confirmed: he was ſo firmly perſuaded, that ALMORAN had been there before him, that he did not aſk the queſtion, but ſuppoſed the fact; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained alike both his tenderneſs and his fears; and looking earneſtly upon ALMEIDA, who had riſen up in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with bluſhes and confuſion, <q>To me, ſays he, is ALMEIDA ſtill cold? and has ſhe laviſhed all her love upon HAMET?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the name of HAMET, the bluſhes and confuſion of ALMEIDA increaſed: her mind was ſtill full of the images, which had riſen from the thought of what HAMET might ſuffer, if ALMORAN ſhould know that he had been with her; and though ſhe feared that their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view was diſcovered, yet ſhe hoped it might be only ſuſpected, and in that caſe the removal or confirmation of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:021881_0153_0FB754E5B46EC678"/>
on which the fate of HAMET depended, would devolve upon her.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation, ſhe, who had but a few moments before doubted, whether ſhe ſhould not voluntarily give him up, when nothing more was neceſſary for his ſafety than to be ſilent; now determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with whatever reluctance, to ſecure him, though it could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſſimulation, and though it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that in this diſſimulation ſhe would be detected. Inſtead, therefore, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the queſtion, ſhe repeated it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'On whom ſaid my lord, on HAMET?' HAMET, whoſe ſuſpicions were increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the evaſion, replied with great emotion, <q>Aye, on HAMET; did he not this moment leave you?</q> 
                        <q>Leave me this moment?</q> ſaid ALMEIDA, with yet greater confuſion, and deeper bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. HAMET, in the impatience of his jealouſy, concluded, that the paſſions which he ſaw expreſſed in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and which aroſe from the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle between her regard to truth an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

a breach of virtue, to which ſhe had been betrayed by his own appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance united with the vices of his brother: he, therefore, drew back from her with a look of inexpreſſible anguiſh, and ſtood ſome time ſilent. She obſerved, that in his countenance there was more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of trouble, than rage; ſhe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hoped to divert him from purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enquiries, by at once removing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſtruck him with new aſtoniſhment, and increaſed the torments of his mind. Suppoſing what he at firſt feared had happened, and that ALMORAN had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her as HAMET; he could not account for her now addreſſing him, as ALMORAN, with words of favour and compliance: he, therefore, renewed his enquiries concerning himſelf, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of a different kind. She, who was ſtill ſolicitous to put an end to the enquiry, as well for the ſake of HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, as to prevent her own embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, replied with a ſigh, <q>Let not thy peace be interrupted by one thought of HAMET; for of HAMET ALMEIDA ſhall think no more.</q> HAMET, who, though he had fortified himſelf againſt whatever might have happened to her perſon, could not bear the alienation of her mind, cried out, with looks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and a voice ſcarcely human, 'Not think of HAMET!' ALMEIDA, whoſe aſtoniſhment was every moment increaſing, replied, with a tender and intereſting enquiry, <q>Is ALMORAN then offended, that ALMEIDA ſhould think of HAMET no more?</q> HAMET, being
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:021881_0156_0FB754EE76182CD0"/>
thus addreſſed by the name of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, again recollected his ſituation; and now firſt conceived the idea, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of ALMEIDA'S ſentiments with reſpect to himſelf, might be the effect of ſome violence offered her by ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN in his likeneſs; he, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to his firſt purpoſe, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by a direct enquiry, to diſcover, whether ſhe had ſeen him under that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. This enquiry he urged with the utmoſt ſolemnity and ardor, in terms ſuitable to his preſent appearance and ſituation: <q>Tell me, ſaid he, have theſe doors been open to HAMET? Has he obtained poſſeſſion of that treaſure, which, by the voice of Heaven, has been allotted to me?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this double queſtion, ALMEIDA anſwered by a ſingle negative; and her anſwer, therefore, was both falſe and true: it was true that her perſon was ſtill inviolate, and it was true alſo that HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET had not been admitted to her; yet her denial of it was falſe, for ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the contrary; ALMORAN only had been admitted, but ſhe had received him as his brother. HAMET, however, was
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:021881_0157_0FB754F1D77C67C8"/>
ſatisfied with the anſwer, and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its fallacy. He looked up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with an expreſſion of gratitude and joy; and then turning to ALMEIDA, <q>Swear then, ſaid he, that thou haſt granted to HAMET, no pledge of thy love which ſhould be reſerved for me.</q> ALMEIDA, who now thought nothing more than the aſſeveration neceſſary to quiet his mind, immediately complied: <q>I ſwear, ſaid ſhe, that to HAMET I have given nothing, which thou wouldſt wiſh me to with-hold: the power that has devoted my perſon to thee, has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united my heart from HAMET, whom I renounce in thy preſence for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HAMET, whoſe ſortitude and recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were again overborne, was thrown into an agitation of mind, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered itſelf by looks and geſtures very different from thoſe which ALMEIDA had expected, and overwhelmed her with new confuſion and diſappointment: that he, who had ſo lately ſolicited her love with all the vehemence of a deſire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to be gratified, ſhould now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a declaration that ſhe was ready to comply, with marks of diſtreſs and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:021881_0158_0FB754F354E574F0"/>
anger, was a myſtery which ſhe could not ſolve. In the mean time, the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in his breaſt became every moment more violent: <q>Where, then, ſaid he, is the conſtancy which you vowed to HAMET; and for what inſtance of his love is he now forſaken?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA was now more embarraſſed than before; ſhe felt all the force of the reproof, ſuppoſing it to have been given by ALMORAN; and ſhe could be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified only by relating the particular, which at the expence of her ſincerity ſhe had determined to conceal. ALMORAN was now exalted in her opinion, while his form was animated by the ſpirit of HAMET; as much as HAMET had been degraded, while his form was animated by the ſpirit of ALMORAN. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of her perfidy to his rival, tho' it favoured his fondeſt and moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſhes, there was an abhorrence of vice, and a generoſity of mind, which ſhe ſuppoſed to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with his character. To his reproach, ſhe could reply only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and could no otherwiſe evade his queſtion, than by obſerving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:021881_0159_0FB754F4CC1F4198"/>
of his own behaviour: <q>Your words, ſaid ſhe, are daggers to my heart. You condemn me for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with your own wiſhes; and for obedience to that voice, which you ſuppoſed to have revealed the will of heaven. Has the caprice of deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wandered to a new object? and do you now ſeek a pretence to refuſe, when it is freely offered, what ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you would have taken by force?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HAMET, who was now fired with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt ALMEIDA, whom yet he could not behold without deſire; and who, at the ſame moment, was impatient to revenge his wrongs upon ALMORAN; was ſuddenly prompted to ſatisfy all his paſſions, by taking advantage of the wiles of ALMORAN and the perfidy of ALMEIDA, to defeat the one and to puniſh the other. It was now in his power inſtantly to conſummate his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as a prieſt might be procured without a moment's delay, and as AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEIDA'S conſent was already given; he would then obtain the poſſeſſion of her perſon, by the very act in which ſhe perfidiouſly reſigned it to his rival; to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:021881_0160_0FB754FD43D21E70"/>
whom he would then leave the beauties he had already poſſeſſed, and caſt from him in diſdain, as united with a mind that he could never love. As his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was fired with the firſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this deſign, he caught her to his breaſt with a fury, in which all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in all their rage were at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred: <q>Let the prieſt, ſaid he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly unite us. Let us comprize, in one moment, in this inſtant, NOW, our whole of being, and exclude alike the future and the paſt!</q> Then graſping her ſtill in his arms, he looked up to heaven: <q>Ye powers, ſaid he, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but yet preſent, who mould my changing and unreſiſting form; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but for one hour, that myſterious charm, that is now upon me, and I will be ever after ſubſervient to your will!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA, who was terrified at the furious ardor of this unintelligible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, ſhrunk from his embrace, pale and trembling without power to reply. HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET gazed tenderly upon her; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the purity and tenderneſs with which he had loved her, his virtues ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:021881_0161_0FB754FE8D375CA0"/>
recovered their force; he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her from his embrace; and turning from her, he dropped in ſilence the tear that ſtarted to his eye, and expreſſed, in a low and faultering voice, thoughts that ruſhed upon his mind: <q>No, ſaid he; HAMET ſhall ſtill diſdain the joy, which is at once ſordid and tranſient: in the breaſt of HAMET, luſt ſhall not be the pander of revenge. Shall I, who have languiſhed for the pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which can ariſe only from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſoul with ſoul, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared by mutual confidence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; ſhall I ſnatch under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which belies my features and degrades my virtue, a caſual poſſeſſion of faithleſs beauty, which I deſpiſe and hate? Let this be the portion of thoſe, that hate me without a cauſe; but let this be far from me!</q> At this thought, he felt a ſudden elation of mind; and the conſcious dignity of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that in ſuch a conflict was victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rendered him, in this glorious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuperior to misfortune: his geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture became calm, and his countenance ſedate; he conſidered the wrongs he
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:021881_0162_0FB755000ACCD0F8"/>
ſuffered, not as a ſufferer, but as a judge; and he determined at once to diſcover himſelf to ALMEIDA, and to reproach her with her crime. He remarked her confuſion without pity, as the effect not of grief but of guilt; and fixing his eyes upon her, with the calm ſeverity of a ſuperior and offended being, <q>Such, ſaid he, is the benevolence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to the children of the duſt, that our misfortunes are, like poiſons, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes to each other.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA, whoſe faculties were now ſuſpended by wonder and expectation, looked earneſtly at him, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſilent. <q>Thy looks, ſaid HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, are full of wonder; but as yet thy wonder has no cauſe, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that which ſhall be revealed. Thou knoweſt the prodigy, which ſo lately parted HAMET and ALMEIDA: I am that HAMET, thou art that AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEIDA.</q> ALMEIDA would now have <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>interrupted him; but HAMET raiſed his voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and demanded to be heard: <q>At that moment, ſaid he, wretched as I am, the child of error and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, my heart repined in ſecret at
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021881_0163_0FB75506C6979388"/>
the deſtiny which had been written upon my head; for I then thought thee faithful and conſtant: but if our hand had been then united, I ſhould have been more wretched than I am; for I now know that thou art fickle and falſe. To know thee, though it has pierced my ſoul with ſorrow, has yet healed the wound which was inflicted when I loſt thee: and though I am now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to wear the form of ALMORAN, whoſe vices are this moment diſgracing mine, yet in the balance I ſhall be weighed as HAMET, and I ſhall ſuffer only as I am found wanting.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMEIDA, whoſe mind was now in a tumult that bordered upon diſtraction, bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and wonder, and alike dreading the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what ſhe heard, whether it was falſe or true, was yet impatient to confute or confirm it; and as ſoon as ſhe had recovered her ſpeech, urged him for ſome token of the prodigy he aſſerted, which he might eaſily have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by relating any of the incidents which themſelves only could know. But juſt at this moment, ALMORAN, having at
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:021881_0164_0FB75507D95588E0"/>
laſt diſengaged himſelf from Oſmyn, by whom he had been long detained, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his own figure: and while the eyes of ALMEIDA were fixed upon HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, his powers were ſuddenly taken from him, and reſtored in an inſtant; and ſhe beheld the features of ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN vaniſh, and gazed with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his own: <q>Thy features change! ſaid ſhe, and thou indeed art HAMET.</q> 
                        <q>The ſudden trance, ſaid he, has reſtored me to myſelf; and from my wrongs where ſhalt thou be hidden?</q> This reproach was more than ſhe could ſuſtain; but he caught her as ſhe was falling, and ſupported her in his arms. This incident renewed in a moment all the tenderneſs of his love: while he beheld her diſtreſs, and preſſed her by the embrace that ſuſtained her to his boſom, he forgot every injury which he ſuppoſed ſhe had done him; and perceived her recovery with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that for a moment ſuſpended the ſenſe of his misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>Her firſt reflection was upon the ſnare, in which ſhe had been taken; and her firſt ſenſation was joy that ſhe had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped:
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:021881_0165_0FB755090BBC3238"/>
ſhe ſaw at once the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of events that had deceived and diſtreſſed her; and nothing more was now neceſſary, than to explain them to HAMET; which, however, ſhe could not do, without diſcovering the inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of her anſwers to the enquiries which he had made, while ſhe miſtook him for his brother: <q>If in my heart, ſays ſhe thou haſt found any virtue, let it incline thee to pity the vice that is mingled with it: by the vice I have been enſnared, but I have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the virtue. ALMORAN, for now I know that it was not thee, AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, when he poſſeſſed thy form, was with me: he profaned thy love, by attempts to ſupplant my virtue; I reſiſted his importunity, and eſcaped perdition; but the guilt of ALMORAN drew my reſentment upon HAMET. I thought the vices which, under thy form, I diſcovered in his boſom, were thine; and in the anguiſh of grief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and diſappointment, my heart renounced thee: yet as I could not give thee up to death, I could not diſcover to ALMORAN the attempt
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:021881_0166_0FB7550BCF43CE70"/>
which I imputed to thee; when you queſtioned me, therefore, as ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, I was betrayed to diſſimulation, by the tenderneſs which ſtill melted my heart for HAMET.</q> 'I believe thee,' ſaid HAMET, catching her in a tranſport to his breaſt: <q>I love thee for thy virtue; and may the pure and exalted beings, who are ſuperior to the paſſions that now throb in my heart, forgive me, if I love thee alſo for thy fault. Yet, let the danger to which it betrayed thee, teach us ſtill to walk in the ſtraight path, and commit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our peace to the Almighty; for he that wanders in the maze of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſhall paſs by the good that he would meet, and ſhall meet the evil that he would ſhun. I alſo was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I was ſtrengthened to reſiſt; if I had uſed the power, which I deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the arts that have been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed againſt me, to return evil for evil; if I had not diſdained a ſecret and unavowed revenge, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed pleaſures of a brutal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; I might have poſſeſſed thee in the form of ALMORAN, and have
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:021881_0167_0FB75510147FE8D8"/>
wronged irreparably myſelf and thee: for how could I have been admitted, as HAMET, to the beauties which I had enjoyed as ALMORAN? and how couldſt thou have given, to ALMORAN, what in reality had been appropriated by HAMET?</q>

ALMORAN however, without regarding ALMEIDA, or making
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:021881_0169_0FB75515D07F09A8"/>
any reply to HAMET, ſtruck the ground with his foot, and the meſſengers of death, to whom the ſignal was familiar, appeared at the door. ALMORAN then commanded them to ſeize his brother, with a countenance pale and livid, and a voice that was broken by rage. HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET was ſtill unmoved; but ALMEIDA threw herſelf at the feet of ALMORAN, and embracing his knees was about to ſpeak, but he broke from her with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fury: <q>If the world ſhould ſue, ſaid he, I would ſpurn it off. There is no pang that cunning can invent, which he ſhall not ſuffer: and when death at length ſhall diſappoint my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, his mangled limbs ſhall be caſt out unburied, to feed the beaſts of the deſert and the fowls of heaven.</q> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this menace, ALMEIDA ſunk down without ſigns of life; and HAMET ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in vain for liberty to raiſe her from the ground, ſhe was carried off by ſome women who were called to her aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>In this awful criſis, HAMET, who felt his own fortitude give way, looked up; and though he conceived no words, a prayer aſcended from his heart to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:021881_0170_0FB755174F34D668"/>
and was accepted by Him, to whom our thoughts are known while they are yet afar off. For HAMET, the fountain of ſtrength was opened from above; his eye ſparkled with confidence, and his breaſt was dilated by hope. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the guard that were leading him away to ſtop, and they implicitly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he then ſtretched out his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ALMORAN, whoſe ſpirit was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked before him: <q>Hear me, ſaid he, thou tyrant! for it is thy genius that ſpeaks by my voice. What has been the fruit of all thy guilt, but accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated miſery? What joy haſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from undivided empire? what joy from the prohibition of my marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with ALMEIDA? what good from that power, which ſome evil daemon has added to thy own? what, at this moment, is thy portion, but rage and anguiſh, diſappointment and deſpair? Even I, whom thou ſeeſt the captive of thy power, whom thou haſt wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of empire, and yet more of love; even I am happy in compariſon of thee. I know that my ſufferings, however multiplied, are ſhort; for they ſhall

end with life, and no life is long: then ſhall the everlaſting ages commence; and through everlaſting ages thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſhall increaſe. The moment is now near, when thou ſhalt tread that line which alone is the path to heaven, the narrow path that is ſtretched over the pit, which ſmokes for ever, and for ever! When thine aking eye ſhall look forward to the end that is far diſtant, and when behind thou ſhalt find no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; when thy ſteps ſhall faulter, and thou ſhalt tremble at the depth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, which thought itſelf is not able to fathom; then ſhall the angel of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution lift his inexorable hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee: from the irremediable way ſhall thy feet be ſmitten; thou ſhalt plunge in the burning flood; and tho' thou ſhalt live for ever, thou ſhalt riſe no more.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the words of HAMET ſtruck AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN with terror<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and over-awed him by an influence which he could not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount; HAMET was forced from his preſence, before any other orders had been given about him, than were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the menace that was addreſſed
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:021881_0172_0FB75521C201E698"/>
to ALMEIDA: no violence, therefore, was yet offered him; but he was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till the king's pleaſure ſhould be known, in a dungeon not far from the palace, to which he was conducted by a ſubterraneous paſſage; and the door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſed upon him, he was left in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, darkneſs, and ſolitude, ſuch as may be imagined before the voice of the Almighty produced light and life.</p>
                     <p>When ALMORAN was ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected to conſider his ſituation, he deſpaired of prevailing upon ALMEIDA to gratify his wiſhes, till her attachment to HAMET was irreparably broken; and he, therefore, reſolved to put him to death. With this view he repeated the ſignal, which convened the miniſters of death to his preſence; but the ſound was loſt in a peal of thunder that inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and ſafety, and enjoyment.</q> 
                        <q>Look up, ſaid the Genius, for the iron hand of deſpair is not yet upon thee Thou canſt be happy, only by his death, and his life thou art forbidden to take away: yet mayſt thou ſtill arm him againſt himſelf; and if he dies by his own hand, thy wiſhes will be full.</q>

                        <q>Select, ſaid the Genius, ſome friend.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the name of friend, ALMORAN ſtarted and looked round in deſpair. He recollected the perfidy of Oſmyn; and he ſuſpected that, from the ſame cauſe, all were perfidious: <q>While HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET has yet life, ſaid he, I fear the face of man, as of a ſavage that is prowling for his prey.</q> 
                        <q>Relinquiſh not yet thy hopes, ſaid the Genius; for one in whom thou wilt joyfully confide, may be found. Let him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly obtain admittance to HAMET, as if by ſtealth: let him profeſs an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of thy reign, and compaſſion for his misfortunes; let him pretend that the rack is even now preparing for him; that death is inevitable, but
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:021881_0175_0FB755258A9077C0"/>
that torment may be avoided: let him then give him a poignard, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of deliverance; and, perhaps, his own hand may ſtrike the blow, that ſhall give thee peace.</q> 
                        <q>But who, ſaid ALMORAN, ſhall go upon this important errand?</q> 
                        <q>Who, replied the Genius, but thyſelf? Haſt thou not the power to aſſume the form of whomſoever thou wouldſt have ſent?</q> 
                        <q>I would have ſent Oſmyn, ſaid AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, but that I know him to be a traitor.</q> 
                        <q>Let the form of Oſmyn then, ſaid the Genius, be thine. The ſhadows of the evening have now ſtretched themſelves upon the earth: command Oſmyn to attend thee alone in the grove, where Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thy father, was uſed to meditate by night; and when thy form ſhall be impreſſed upon him, I will there ſeal his eyes in ſleep, till the charm ſhall be broken; ſo ſhall no evil be attempted againſt thee, and the transformation ſhall be known only to thyſelf.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, whoſe breaſt was again illuminated by hope, was about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his gratitude and joy; but the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius

ſuddenly diſappeared. He began, therefore, immediately to follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that he had received: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Oſmyn to attend him in the grove, and forbad every other to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; by the power of the taliſman he aſſumed his appearance, and ſaw him ſink down in the ſupernatural ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before him: he then quitted the place, and prepared to viſit HAMET in the priſon.</p>

                     <p>THE officer who commanded the guard that kept the gate of the priſon, was Caled. He was now next in truſt and power to Oſmyn: but as he had propoſed a revolt to HAMET, in which Oſmyn had refuſed to concur, he knew that his life was now in his power; he dreaded leſt, for ſome ſlight offence, or in ſome fit of cauſeleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, he ſhould diſcloſe the ſecret to ALMORAN, who would then certainly condemn him to death. To ſecure this fatal ſecret, and put an end to his inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:021881_0177_0FB7552F7ADE4448"/>
he reſolved from the moment that ALMORAN was eſtabliſhed upon the throne, to find ſome opportunity ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy Oſmyn: in this reſolution, he was confirmed by the enmity, which inferior minds never fail to conceive againſt that merit, which they cannot but envy without ſpirit to emulate, and by which they feel themſelves diſgraced without an effort to acquire equal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; it was confirmed alſo by the hope which Caled had conceived, that, upon the death of Oſmyn, he ſhould ſucceed to his poſt: his apprehenſions likewiſe were increaſed, by the gloom which he remarked in the countenance of Oſmyn; and which, not knowing that it aroſe from fear, he imputed to jealouſy and malevolence.</p>
                     <p>When ALMORAN, who had now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the appearance of Oſmyn, had paſſed the ſubterranean avenue to the dungeon in which HAMET was confined, he was met by Caled; of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded admittance to the prince; and produced his own ſignet, as a teſtimony that he came with the authority of the king. As it was Caled's intereſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:021881_0178_0FB75530CE5981F8"/>
the favour of Oſmyn till an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhould offer to cut him off, he received him with every poſſible mark of reſpect and reverence; and when he was gone into the dungeon, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a beverage to be prepared for him againſt he ſhould return, in which ſuch ſpices were infuſed, as might expel the malignity which, in that place, might be received with the breath of life; and taking himſelf the key of the priſon, he waited at the door.</p>
                     <p>When ALMORAN entered the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, with a lamp which he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Caled, he found HAMET ſitting upon the ground: his countenance was impreſſed with the characters of grief; but it retained no marks either of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or fear. When he looked up, and ſaw the features of Oſmyn, he judged that the mutes were behind him; and, therefore, roſe up, to prepare himſelf for death. ALMORAN beheld his calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fortitude with the involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry praiſe of admiration; yet perſiſted in his purpoſe without remorſe. <q>I am come, ſaid he, by the command of ALMORAN, to denounce that fate,

the bitterneſs of which I will enable thee to avoid.</q> 
                        <q>And what is there, ſaid HAMET, in my fortunes, that has prompted thee to the danger of this attempt?</q> 
                        <q>The utmoſt that I can give thee, ſaid ALMORAN, I can give thee without danger to myſelf: but though I have been placed, by the hand of fortune, near the perſon of the tyrant, yet has my heart in ſecret been thy friend. If I am the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of evil, impute it to him only by whom it is deviſed. The rack is now preparing to receive thee; and every art of ingenious cruelty will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted to protract and to encreaſe the agonies of death.</q> 'And what,' ſaid HAMET, 'can thy friendſhip offer me?' <q>I can offer thee, ſaid ALMORAN, that which will at once diſmiſs thee to thoſe regions, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary reſt for ever.</q> He then produced the poignard from his boſom; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HAMET, whoſe heart was touched with ſudden joy at the ſight of ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

a remedy for every evil, did not immediately reflect, that he was not at liberty to apply it: he ſnatched it in a tranſport from the hand of ALMORAN, and expreſſed his ſenſe of the obligation by claſping him in his arms, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tears of gratitude in his breaſt. <q>Be quick, ſaid ALMORAN: this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I muſt leave thee; and in the next, perhaps, the meſſengers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may bind thee to the rack.</q> 
                        <q>I will be quick, ſaid HAMET; and the ſigh that ſhall laſt linger upon my lips, ſhall bleſs thee.</q> They then bid each other farewell: ALMORAN retired from the dungeon, and the door was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain cloſed upon HAMET.</p>
                     <p>Caled, who waited at the door till the ſuppoſed Oſmyn ſhould return, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the beverage which he had prepared, of which he recounted the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and ALMORAN received it with pleaſure, and having eagerly drank it off, returned to the palace.

him with the death of HAMET. HAMET, in the mean time, having graſped the dagger in his hand, and raiſed his arm for the blow, <q>This, ſaid he, is my paſſport to the realms of peace, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and only object of my hope!</q> But at theſe words, his mind inſtantly took the alarm: <q>Let me reflect, ſaid he, a moment: from what can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive hope in death?—from that patient and preſerving virtue, and from that alone, by which we fulfil the taſk that is aſſigned us upon the earth. Is it not our duty, to ſuffer, as well as to act? If my own hand conſigns me to the grave, what can it do but perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that miſery, which, by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I would ſhun? what can it do, but cut off my life and hope together?</q>—With this reflection he drew the dagger from him; and ſtretching himſelf again upon the ground, reſigned himſelf to the diſpoſal of the Father of man, moſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Almighty.</p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, who had now reſolved to ſend for the intelligence which he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear, was diſpatching a meſſenger to the priſon, when he was told that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

deſired admittance to his preſence. At the name of Caled, he ſtarted up in an extaſy of joy; and not doubting but that HAMET was dead, he ordered him to be inſtantly admitted. When he came in, ALMORAN made no enquiry about HAMET, becauſe he would not appear to expect the event, which yet he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he had brought about; he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, aſked him only upon what buſineſs he came. <q>I come, my lord, ſaid he, to apprize thee of the treachery of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn.</q>

As the command which I received, when he was delivered to my cuſtody, was abſolute, that no foot ſhould enter, I doubted whether the token had not been obtained, by fraud, for ſome other purpoſe; yet, as he required ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance only, I complyed: but that if any treachery had been contrived, I might detect it; and that no ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                        <q>What then, ſaid ALMORAN, didſt thou hear?</q> 
                        <q>A part of what was ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Caled, eſcaped me: but I heard Oſmyn, like a perfidious and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſlave, call ALMORAN a tyrant; I heard him profeſs an inviolable friendſhip for HAMET, and aſſure him of deliverance. What were the means I know not; but he talked of ſpeed, and ſuppoſed that the effect was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, though he was ſtill impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to hear of HAMET; and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that if he was dead, his death was unknown to Caled; was yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding rejoiced at what he heard: and as he knew what Caled told him to be true, as the converſation he related had paſſed between himſelf and HAMET, he exulted in the pleaſing confidence that he had yet a friend; the glooms of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, which had involved his mind, were diſſipated, and his countenance brightened with complacency and joy.
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:021881_0184_0FB755450F188850"/>
He had delayed to put Oſmyn to death, only becauſe he could appoint no man to ſucceed him, of whom his fears did not render him equally ſuſpicious: but having now found, in Caled, a friend, whoſe fidelity had been approved when there had been no intention to try it; and being impatient to reward his zeal, and to inveſt his fidelity with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which would render his ſervices moſt important; he took a ring from his own finger, and putting it upon that of Caled, <q>Take this, ſaid he, as a pledge, that to-morrow Oſmyn ſhall loſe his head; and that, from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou art inveſted with his power.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Caled having, in the converſation between ALMORAN and HAMET, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned indubitable treachery, which he imputed to Oſmyn, whoſe appearance ALMORAN had then aſſumed, eagerly ſeized the opportunity to deſtroy him; he, therefore, not truſting to the event of his accuſation, had mingled poiſon in the bowl which he preſented to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN when he came out from HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET: this, however, at firſt he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conceal.</p>

In conſequence of his accuſation, he ſuppoſed Oſmyn would be queſtioned upon the rack; he ſuppoſed alſo, that the accuſation, as it was true, would be confirmed by his confeſſion; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould then ſay to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his accuſer, would be diſbelieved; and that when after a few hours the poiſon ſhould take effect, no inquiſition would be made into the death of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, whom the bow-ſtring or the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar would otherwiſe have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to deſtroy. But he now hoped to derive new merit from an act of zeal, which ALMORAN had approved before it was known, by condemning his rival to die, whoſe death he had already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured: <q>May the wiſhes of my lord, ſaid he, be always anticipated; and may it be found, that whatever he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains is already done: may he accept the zeal of his ſervant, whom he has delighted to honour; for, before the light of the morning ſhall return, the eyes of Oſmyn ſhall cloſe in everlaſting darkneſs.</q>

                     <p>At theſe words, the countenance of ALMORAN changed; his cheeks became

pale, and his lips trembled: <q>What then, ſaid he, haſt thou done?</q> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who was terrified and aſtoniſhed, threw himſelf upon the ground, and was unable to reply. ALMORAN, who now, by the utmoſt effort of his mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his confuſion and his fear, that he might learn the truth from Caled without diſſimulation or diſguiſe, raiſed him from the ground and repeated his enquiry. <q>If I have erred, ſaid Caled, impute it not: when I had detected the treachery of Oſmyn, I was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by my zeal for thee. For proof that he is guilty, I appeal now to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for he yet lives: but that he might not eſcape the hand of juſtice, I mingled, in the bowl I gave him, the drugs of death.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At theſe words, ALMORAN, ſtriking his hands together, looked upward in an agony of deſpair and horror, and fell back upon a ſofa that was behind him. Caled, whoſe aſtoniſhment was equal to his diſappointment and fears, approached him with a trembling tho' haſty pace; but as he ſtooped to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, ALMORAN ſuddenly drew his
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:021881_0187_0FB7555056884F80"/>
dagger and ſtabbed him to the heart; and repeated the blow with reproaches and execrations, till his ſtrength failed him.</p>
                     <p>In this dreadful moment, the Genius once more appeared before him; at the ſight of whom he waved his hand, but was unable to ſpeak. <q>Nothing, ſaid the Genius, that has happened to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, is hidden from me. Thy peace has been deſtroyed alike by the defection of Oſmyn, and by the zeal of Caled: thy life may yet be preſerved; but it can be preſerved only by a charm, which HAMET muſt apply.</q> ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, who had raiſed his eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome languid hope, when he heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

If what I ſhall propoſe, he refuſes to perform, not all the powers of earth, and ſea, and air, if they ſhould combine, can give thee life: but if he complies, the death, that is now ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended over thee, ſhall fall upon his head; and thy life ſhall be again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the hand of time.</q> 
                        <q>Make haſte then, ſaid ALMORAN, and I will here wait the event.</q>

                     <p>When ALMORAN was alone, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that every act of ſupernatural power which the Genius had enabled him to perform, had brought upon him ſome new calamity, though it always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

By his counſel, I perſuaded HAMET to deſtroy himſelf; and, in the very act, I was betrayed to drink the portion, by which I ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: I have been led on, from miſery to miſery, by ineffectual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and fallacious hopes.

                     <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
                     <p>IN conſequence of this reſolution, AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN, having commanded one of the ſoldiers of the guard that attended upon HAMET into an inner room of the palace, he ordered him to wait there till his return: then making faſt the door, he aſſumed his figure, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the dungeon; where produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his ſignet, he ſaid, he had received orders from the king to remain with the priſoner, till the watch expired.</p>
                     <p>As he entered without ſpeaking, and without a light, HAMET continued ſtretched upon the ground, with his face towards the earth; and ALMORAN, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſilently retired to a remote corner of the place, waited for the appearance of the Genius.</p>
                     <p>The dawn of the morning now broke; and, in a few minutes, the priſon ſhook, and the Genius appeared. He was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by a lambent light that played a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him; and HAMET ſtarting from the ground, turned to the viſion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:021881_0191_0FB7555E02542930"/>
and wonder: but as the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent was ever preſent to his mind, to whom all beings in all worlds are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and on whom alone he relied for protection, he was neither confuſed nor afraid. 'HAMET,' ſaid the Genius, 'the criſis of thy fate is near.' <q>Who art thou, ſaid HAMET, and for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe art thou come?</q> 
                        <q>I am, replied the Genius, an inhabitant of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thee; and to the will of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my powers have been obedient: upon him they have not conferred hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but they have brought evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. It was my voice, that forbad thy marriage with ALMEIDA; and my voice, that decreed the throne to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN: I gave him the power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thy form; and, by me, the hand of oppreſſion is now heavy upon thee. Yet I have not decreed that he ſhould be happy, nor that thou ſhouldſt be wretched: darkneſs as yet reſts upon my purpoſe; but my heart in ſecret is thy friend.</q> 
                        <q>If thou art indeed my friend, ſaid HAMET, deliver me from this priſon; and preſerve HAMET for ALMEIDA.</q> 
                        <q>Thy deliverance, ſaid the Genius, muſt depend upon thyſelf.

There is a charm, of which the power is great; but it is by thy will only, that this power can be exerted.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Genius then held out towards him a ſcroll, on which the ſeal of ſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> powers was impreſſed. <q>Take, ſaid he, this ſcroll, in which the myſterious name of Oroſmades is written. Invoke the ſpirits, that reſide weſtward from the riſing of the ſun; and northward, in the regions of cold and darkneſs: then ſtretch out thy hand, and a lamp of ſulphur, ſelf-kindled, ſhall burn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. In the fire of this lamp, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that which I now give thee; and as the ſmoke, into which it changes, ſhall mix with the air a mighty charm ſhall be formed, which ſhall defend thee from all miſchief: from that inſtant, no poiſon, however potent, can hurt thee; nor ſhall any priſon confine: in one moment thou ſhalt be reſtored to the throne, and to ALMEIDA; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of death ſhall lay his hand upon thy brother; to whom, if I had confided this laſt beſt effort of my power, he would have ſecured the good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and have transferred the evil to thee.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="unknown:021881_0193_0FB75560CA70A350"/>
ALMORAN, who had liſtened unſeen to this addreſs of the Genius to HAMET, was now confirmed in his ſuſpicions, that evil had been ultimately intended againſt him; and that he had been entangled in the toils of perfidy, while he believed himſelf to be aſſiſted by the efforts of friendſhip: he was alſo convinced, that by the Genius he was not known to be preſent. HAMET, however, ſtood ſtill doubtful, and ALMORAN was kept ſilent by his fears. <q>Whoever thou art, ſaid HAMET, the condition of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which thou haſt offered me is ſuch as it is not lawful to fulfil: theſe horrid rites, and this commerce with unholy powers, are prohibited to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in the Law of Life.</q> 
                        <q>See thou to that, ſaid the Genius: Good and evil are before thee; that which I now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee, I will offer no more.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HAMET, who had not fortitude to give up at once the poſſibility of ſecuring the advantages that had been offered, and who was ſeduced by human frailty to deliberate at leaſt upon the choice, ſtretched out his hand, and receiving the ſcroll, the Genius inſtantly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:021881_0194_0FB7556744BC6318"/>
That which had been propoſed as a trial of his virtue, ALMORAN be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved indeed to be an offer of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; he had no hope, therefore, but that HAMET would refuſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that he ſhould be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the taliſman, and fulfil them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he judged that the mind of HAMET was in ſuſpenſe, and was doubtful to which ſide it might finally incline: he, therefore, inſtantly aſſumed the voice and the perſon of OMAR, that by the influence of his council he might be able to turn the ſcale.</p>
                     <p>When the change was effected, he called HAMET by his name; and HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET who knew the voice, anſwered him in a tranſport of joy and wonder: <q>My friend, ſaid he, my father! in this dreary ſolitude, in this hour of trial, thou art welcome to my ſoul as liberty and life! Guide me to thee by thy voice; and tell me, while I hold thee to my boſom, how and wherefore art thou come?</q> 
                        <q>Do not now aſk me, ſaid ALMORAN: it is enough that I am here; and that I am permitted to warn thee of the precipice on which
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:021881_0195_0FB75568559BAD60"/>
thou ſtandeſt. It is enough, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in this darkneſs, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the ſpecious guile, which ſome evil daemon has practiſed upon thee.</q> 
                        <q>Is it then certain, ſaid HAMET, that this being is evil?</q> 
                        <q>Is not that being evil, ſaid ALMORAN, who propoſes evil as the condition of good?</q> 
                        <q>Shall I then, ſaid HAMET, renounce my liberty and life? The rack is now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and, perhaps, the next moment, its tortures will be inevitable.</q> 
                        <q>Let me aſk thee then, ſaid ALMORAN, to preſerve thy life, wilt thou deſtroy thy ſoul?</q> 
                        <q>O! ſtay, ſaid HAMET—Let me not be tried too far! Let the ſtrength of Him who is Almighty, be manifeſt in my weakneſs!</q> HAMET then pauſed a few moments; but he was no longer in doubt: and ALMORAN, who diſbelieved and deſpiſed the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which he intended to perſuade him to renounce what, upon the ſame condition, he was impatient to ſecure for himſelf, conceived hopes that he ſhould ſucceed; and thoſe hopes were inſtantly confirmed. <q>Take then, ſaid HAMET, this unholy charm; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:021881_0196_0FB75569DC679B40"/>
it far from me, as the ſands of Alai from the trees of Oman; leſt in ſome dreadful hour my virtue may fail me, and thy counſel may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> 'Give it me then,' ſaid AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORAN; and feeling for the hands of each other, he ſnatched it from him in an extaſy of joy; and inſtantly reſuming his own voice and figure, he cried out, <q>At length I have prevailed: and life and love, dominion and revenge, are now at once in my hand!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>HAMET heard and knew the voice of his brother, with aſtoniſhment; but it was too late to wiſh he had withheld the charm, which his virtue would not permit him to uſe. <q>Yet a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſs, ſaid ALMORAN, and thou art nothing.</q> HAMET, who doubted not of the power of the taliſman, and knew that ALMORAN had no principles which would reſtrain him from uſing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and a lamp of burning ſulphur was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſuſpended in the air before him: he held the myſterious writing in the flame; and as it began to burn, the place ſhook with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

HAMET, wrapping his robe round him, cried out, <q>In the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life that flows for ever, let my life be mingled! Let me not be, as if I had never been; but ſtill conſcious of my being, let me ſtill glorify Him from whom it is derived, and be ſtill happy in his love.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALMORAN, who was abſorbed in the anticipation of his own felicity, heard the thunder without dread, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of his triumph: <q>Let thy hopes, ſaid he, be thy portion; and the pleaſures, that I have ſecured, ſhall be mine.</q> As he pronounced theſe words, he ſtarted as at a ſudden pang; his eyes became fixed, and his poſture immoveable; yet his ſenſes ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he perceived the Genius once more to ſtand before him. <q>ALMORAN, ſaid he, to the laſt ſounds which thou ſhalt hear, let thine ear be attentive!
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:021881_0198_0FB75571829C1358"/>
Of the ſpirits that rejoice to fulfil the purpoſe of the Almighty, I am one. To HAMET, and to ALMORAN, I have been commiſſioned from above: I have been appointed to perfect virtue by adverſity; and, in the folly of her own projects, to entangle vice. The charm, which could be formed only by guilt, has power only to produce miſery: of every good which thou, ALMORAN, wouldſt have ſecured by diſobedience, the oppoſite evil is thy portion: and of every evil which thou, HAMET, waſt, by obedience, willing to incur, the oppoſite good is beſtowed upon thee. To thee, HAMET, are now given the throne of thy father, and ALMEIDA. And thou, ALMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN, who, while I ſpeak, art incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the earth, ſhalt remain, through all generations, a memorial of the truths which thy life has taught!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the words of the Genius, the earth trembled beneath, and above the walls of the priſon diſappeared: the figure of ALMORAN, which was hardened into ſtone, expanded by degrees; and a rock, by which his form and attitude are ſtill

rudely expreſſed, became at once a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his puniſhment and his guilt.</p>
                     <p>Such are the events recorded by AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, the deſcendant of the Prophet, and the preacher of righteouſneſs! for, to ACMET, that which paſſed in ſecret was revealed by the Angel of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the world might know, that, to the wicked, increaſe of power is increaſe of wretchedneſs; and that thoſe who condemn the folly of an attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the purpoſe of a Genius, might no longer hope to elude the appointment of the Moſt High.</p>
