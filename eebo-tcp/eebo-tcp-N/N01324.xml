            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the ensuing DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>IF private Conferences, Remonstrances or Capitulations, for almost four Years past, would have prevailed with the gravest Heads we have, to have debated the point in Controversie betwixt me and the Church, I had not Exposed in Print these few Sheets, so very much against the mind of some to near related to the Charge. Most concern'd, have, or might have seen it, before I sent it to the Press, but it returned only with these Notes, some said, <hi>'Twas sharp,</hi> another very Ingenious Person, of great Sence, advises, <hi>Not to Publish it,</hi> for no other reason, but my own Ease; but <hi>I</hi> am more Easie to print than to forbear. But what is meant by sharp, I know not, unless too too true, and if so where's the Damage? I have fetch'd no blood; if I have, like a File, rub'd off the Rust, it is but to shew the pure clean Mettle. <hi>Rebake them sharp,</hi> says <hi>Paul.</hi> And why? because the Corruption will Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumate, and turn to Gangreen. The Reformation was never Effected by Encomiums, nor Polite meanage. <hi>He's too Polemick,</hi> or <hi>Satyrick,</hi> said another. No! I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lewd nor Malicious; then Satyr is proper. But who is so sharp as our own Folk, whose Language would not become me now. But were it no more for the sake of Innocent Truth, than the Damage I have sustained, and the unjust Wounding of my Reputation, this had never Peep'd into the World in so mean Cloathing. But Truth had none at her first Enterance, till she was drest up by
<pb facs="unknown:001572_0002_0FB3D56E0909F700"/>
the Learned, and then they made her look more like a Whore than a Chaste Virgin. But I a plain Rustick, and hope to be plainly understood, without <hi>Thomas Story's</hi> Key to open the Nice Point, as he call'd it, (for such was his Sermon up and down the Country, so Nice, so New and Strange, never heard of in our Pulpits before, as by and by will appear; wherefore his advice was, <hi>To come to him to open the Mistery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know Reader, this Discourse is intended for none but such whose known Principles from the beginning have been against Co-ersive Power and Force, professing Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conformity to the Laws of our blessed Lord and Master <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> both in Doctrine, Practice and Discipline; But if any have mist it in either, I find it my Duty to let them know <hi>Where</hi> and <hi>How,</hi> and clear the Truth from Error and Innovation; and if I have wronged any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Cause, let me know it, and I'll Repent and Recant.</p>
            <p>But it would look very strange, if after Four Years Pause on my Papers and Searching, for all I had sent to our Elders, and carrying them to our Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington</hi> (for what, judge Reader) and to this Day, no man ever told me of one Error in all my Scribbles. I say, now to Charge would look very oddly; however, I am not too old to learn yet; but if what I have Writ, be <hi>unanswerable,</hi> according to our own Axioms, then, I hope, some Body will thank me, for taking so much pains, to wash the Spots out of Mothers Coat, not with Gall, but with clean Water of the Word of Truth. No! I am neither prejudiced nor byassed; but if all my Labour be lost (which I hope will not) I must leave the Issue to the Great Baptizer, that can wash, and must wash us, if ever we are clean. <hi>Why do I differ with Friends</hi> (say
<pb facs="unknown:001572_0003_0FB3D56ED9741D00"/>
some) To which I Answer, That I don't see where I differ in the least point, if by <hi>Friends</hi> is meant such as were called <hi>Quakers</hi> Fifty or Sixty Years ago. But Woe is me! my Mother, that hath born me a man of Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. I do not affect Quarrels; but for strife or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Striving, and Contending heartily for the Principles of our Primitive, most holy Profession, it falls to my Lot; and Woe is me if I do not do it. Is there not a Cause, when I see Errors creeping in so fast? What! though the Church have a Plenipotentiary Power let her not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed her Commission, nor bind that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

If that will not do the Civil Magistrate must. But if the Members of the true Church will be Civil Magistrates, they must divest themselves of the Canonick Gown; lay by their Spiritual Sword, and put on their Wardrobes, and take up the Carnal Weapon. This is and has been the trade of our Spiritual Shepherds, this thirty years, to my knowledge; and when this peice of Carnal Drudgery is over, it is but puting on their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> and then goe to Church and sing divine Service, and be as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as ever, till next Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>Tribute to Caesar, How paid by the Best Christians, WITH Some Remarks on the late Expedition to Canada, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THat which induced me to write the following Periods was the one half of a Sermon Preached by <hi>Thomas Story</hi> the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1711. beginning with this Text, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter or see the Kingdom of God.</hi> Had he kept here, and so ended, we had been Edified to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering our Progress thither.</p>
            <p>But all the other half of his Doctrine was to lead us to <hi>Canada;</hi> such a Digression, I believe, was never known in our Pulpit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor in any other. The Text was forgot by Hearers and Preacher too (for ought I know) for he never came to it again at that time, and so left a great Army of us (near two Thousand Souls) either to follow the Camp, or pay others in our stead (which is all one) for so doing. <hi>Tribute to Casar</hi> was the whole Burden of the Story. No <hi>High-Church-Man</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> no, not <hi>Sacheverill</hi> himself could have managed the Subject better. I confess it Amazed me as much as if (at unawares) I had been in the midst of the Camp between <hi>New-York</hi> and the <hi>Lake. Strange Doctrine</hi> (says one) <hi>I never heard the like,</hi> says another. What! was this the Quakers Doctrine formerly? <hi>I know is was not,</hi> says another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001572_0005_0FB3D573561532C0"/>
But from <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. we skip to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to 7. <hi>Let every Soul be Subject to the higher Powers,</hi> &amp;c. If by the <hi>higher Powers</hi> is meant here Kings and Rulers, let <hi>G. FOX</hi> Answer for me, as on the same occasion else-where, to perswade us to pay our Taxes [of which more anon] see his Book, entituled, <hi>Several Papers given forth,</hi> 1666. <hi>page.</hi> 8. <q>Friends, To you all that desire an Earthly King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not you worse than they in the Days of <hi>Moses,</hi> and as blind as the <hi>Jews?</hi> &amp;c. Did the Christians in the Days of Christ, and his Apostles, cry up any King but Christ? or to have any other Ruler over them? Is he not the Head of the Church? Hath he not all power in Heaven and Earth given to him? Must not all bow to and be Subject to him, and all things to be done in his Name? You say <hi>Peter</hi> said, Honour the King and Love the Brother-hood, and honour all Men. This don't hold forth that Peter bid them set up an Earthly King over them, neither do ye read, tho' there were so many Thousands Convinced among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there was an Earthly King among them; neither do ye read that there was any <hi>K</hi>ings since the Days of the Apostles, but amongst the Apostate Christians, and false Church, the Mother of Harlots.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to the Powers that are ordained of God, if all the Powers that are, are ordained of God, then God ordains Powers to plague and vex his own Royal Seed, which is absurd to affirm. Besides, when the Devil took Christ into the Mountain, and shewed him all the World, <hi>These,</hi> said he, <hi>are mine, and</hi> (Christ did not gain-say it) <hi>I give them to whom I please; I,</hi> the Prince of this World; Can any suppose this Power was ordained of God? permited it mightt be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he permits Wicked Princes, and Popes too, that Tyrannize over their Subjects. Are these the Powers the Apostle means? <hi>Yes,</hi> says <hi>T. S. Casar must be obeyed, though a Tyrant.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> can prove all the Antient and Modern Reformers (<hi>R. B.</hi> not excepted) oppose him. The whole World wandred after the Beast; The Dragon gave his Power to the Beast, see <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 13. 17. prove sufficiently what Powers were of God, and what not. And pray, who ordained our Powers here? Why, <hi>W. Penn.</hi> And who ordained him Supream Ruler and Governour? <hi>Charles</hi> the second.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001572_0006_0FB3D574F6031E30"/>
And who ordained him, the whole Course of his Life and Actions speak louder than Words. But by <hi>G. F'</hi>s Rule, We as well as other Earthly Powers are Apostates, false Church and Mother of Harlots.</p>
            <p>Thus by our own Rules <hi>I</hi> have Answered what Rulers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained are, that Rule for <hi>Casar</hi> and themselves more than for God. <hi>I</hi> Charge no Body.</p>
            <p>The next verse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>He that Resisteth the Pomers receiveth Damnation. I</hi> have received no Damnation for Resisting the Ordinance; no, though <hi>I</hi> am a <hi>Low Church-man, I</hi> am for Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience; and where for Conscience <hi>I</hi> cannot Assist, <hi>I'</hi>ll not Resist, but suffer my Pewter Dishes to be taken from me, and not so much as murmer at it, as <hi>I</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Rulers are not a Terror to good, but Evil Works; He that resisteth such <hi>R</hi>ulers deserves to be whipt; and this answers and agrees with <hi>G F'</hi>s printed sheet sent up and down the Country here to make us pay our Taxes; for Caesars Weapons are for Punishment of Evil doers, &amp;c. for which he is to have his Tribute. &amp;c. I wonder how this made for the Cause in hand, to pay Tribute for a vigorous War against Canada.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But e'er I go further, let me tell the Reader the cause of this great Dispute about Tribute to Caesar, Thus Our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers here ordained an order, without any Ordination but their own (for the Queen never thought on't or expected it from <hi>Quakers</hi>) for Two Thousand Pound for Military uses (though 'tis denyed) but if I prove it not to all but Bigots, I loose the Cause, but if I do (<hi>I</hi> have heard many say) they are great Hypocrites.</p>

Convened, the Governour was Ordered to send two Hundred Men [not a word of Money] for this Expedition. Our Powers to shew their Loyalty to <hi>Casar,</hi> very Frankly orders two Thousand Pounds to be Levyed in Form, and the Severest that ever was known here or else-where ('tis said) And when the Army was on their way, <hi>Samuell Hariot</hi> told me, his Sloop had been prest and another Master sent with her if he had not gone himself with Bread and Flower, Freighted by the Treasurer <hi>S. C.</hi> and ordered by our Governour to go first to the Governour of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York,</hi> and thence to the Governour of <hi>New-England</hi> at <hi>Boston,</hi> to whom this Cargo was delivered. How or to what Uses this Cargo was Imployed is not my Business, but some that knew the thing, and can tell, and would if it did not interfer with the Honour of our Religion; however, it is said the Army was little the better for it.</p>
            <p>The meaning of this Politick Fetch (you must know) was kept under the Thumb in the House; but a Member, a man in Boots told 'em, They had better be plain and above board with the Country.</p>
            <p>But why so private, when the <hi>Jersians</hi> at the same time (a Friend the Speaker) raised a larger Fond, directly and in express words for the Expedition against <hi>Canada;</hi> and all the Country (some few excepted) pay'd it, and no body to call them to account, for such unaccustomed Practice among the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and yet, at the same Time, the same People, to a Nicity, scruple, and will not pay Caesars Militia, nor the Poor Parson, a civil Minister, that has had Acts of Parliament for Five Hundred Years, to pay him Tythe; <hi>This we can't do for Conscience,</hi> tho' the Powers ordained, do order it.

The other to me said, <hi>Now ye are gone,</hi> T. S. <hi>and</hi> G.

            <p>We must have Ministers of the Gospel to be the Powers, Governours, Judges, Justices, States-men, and every thing that belongs to the Powers, <abbr>

            <p>It's no Improper Question, if again I ask, Who ordain'd these Powers? for from <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Constantine,</hi> they were never heard of. <hi>I</hi>f they had properly belong'd to Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we should have had order, upon order, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Succession (no doubt) of the same form of Government; But alas! it's absurd, ay, and prepostrous too, to plead for such a Government, where Christ's Kingdom is not, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was nor will be, <abbr>

Tho' they were one Corporation under the Law, Christ made them two distinct Functions, unless you'll have Gospel to be Law, and Law Gospel. I have often told our Church Doctors, They have no more to do in Caesars Court, than in his Camp; the last they decline in Conceit. But don't the Court maintain the Camp? Don't the Camp defend the Court? Then where's the difference? We deny the Camp in words, but in works

But from whence do all these Blunders proceed, but from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Ignorance, Carelesness and a Superstitions Veneration to the Clergy. But more of this by and by.</p>
            <p>It seems to me as if our <hi>Moses</hi> has left us, and gone up into the Mount, and committed us to the care of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who forgetting, or neglecting his duty, has made a Golden Calf, and set us all a dancing about it, and Sacrificing our Reason and Senses to it; the Name of which Calf is <hi>Custom, Humane Tradition, Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c. These are the Gods we serve, or the Tyrants we obey. But <hi>Moses</hi> comes down by and by, and he'll make Dust of the Idol, and teach ye better manners, or I am mistaken. Excuse this small Digression.</p>
            <p>I hope I have sufficiently Proved the above Fond and Tax was raised and levyed on the Country for no other end, but to maintain an offensive War.</p>
            <p>The next point is to prove, <hi>How Inconsistent it is with our own Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles, as well as the Doctrine of Christ, and all the Primitive Christians.</hi>

If the Magistrate be truly a Christian, or desires so to be, he ought himself in the First place, to obey the Command of his Master, saying, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. and then he could not Command us to kill them; but if he be not a true Christian, than ought we to obey our Lord and King, Christ Jesus, to whom he ought also to obey; For in the Kingdom of Christ, all ought to Submit to his Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any say he pay'd Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> so do we; What then? This is but a man of Straw, and proves not the Case.</p>

                  </gap> thy Rattles?</hi> Here's the Foundation of this Dispute, occasion'd by <hi>Thomas Story,</hi> and his language to me, who is so Conceited of his Doctrinal <hi>N</hi>otions, and so dogmatical that we ought to believe it, if it comes from his mouth; And such is the Superstitious Veneration to this poor man, that rather than call him, or suffer him to be call'd to account for his Doctrine, patiently take (like Asses) all that's lay'd on their Backs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>W. Penn</hi> against the Clergy (not our Clergy) says, <q>The Consequence of not doing it, has been the Introduction of much false Doctrine, Superstition and Formality, which gives just occasion for Schism.</q> We blame other Professions for their too much Relyance on their Teachers and Church Ordinances, Discipline (Church Discipline) <hi>Yes,</hi> said <hi>Thomas Story, The Church is the Ground and Pillar of Truth;</hi> so says <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Prelate</hi> too; so says <hi>T. S.</hi> ay! and so say I. But I ask <hi>T. S.</hi> too, What Church this was? Whether Militant or Triumphant? but no Answer to this, only, <hi>If the Church believe his Doctrine, I had no Business to call him in Question.</hi> No, yes but I will, and do call him, and Church too, to Answer for this Anti-Church Doctrine; And if they Defend either one or t'other, I'll oppose (to my power) both. But it is too clear, Ignorance and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness is the very cause of <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> and <hi>blind Obedience.</hi> And
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001572_0014_0FB3D58190E47680"/>
thus it comes to pass, that after a people have had a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Knowledge of Divine Truths, yet it may and often does Vanish away either through Idleness and Carelesness, attended with Formality and Supperstitious Ceremony. What a natural propensity People have to Change! though Truth cannot Change. This saying we all have at our Fingers ends. Nevertheless, when the Preachers change in their Doctrine, we ought not to perswade our selves, that we are incapable of Judging in Matters of Religion. No! we ought to be scrutinous, and cannot sufficiently over-hawl whatever we hear preached. But read <hi>W Penn'</hi>s <hi>Address to Protestants,</hi> it will sufficiently excuse me for Examining <hi>T. S.</hi> with his false Notions. But false or true, here's the Misery, no such thing in our Church as Debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any point of Doctrine, in a Monthly or Weekly Meeting, though preached in the greatest General Meeting of all <hi>America.</hi> Nay, so far from Debating, that he is counted Rude and Absurd, that dares contradict the Doctor; No! have a care, if he does, by our new Rule of Discipline, we'll turn him out. But more of this anon.</p>
            <p>Now something by it self of Civil Government.</p>
            <p>I Have Observed before, That Civil Government belongs not properly to the Church of Christ, nor was it ever <hi>I</hi>ntroduced here, till <hi>Constantine,</hi> the fast Friend to <hi>Pontifix Maximus, Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Episcoporum,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> The <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Prelate,</hi> where the effect has lodged ever since, not to the honour of Christ, nor his Spouse, the Bride, the Lambs wife; The Woful Consequence of this <hi>Hodge-Podge Mess of Medly,</hi> and Jumbling of Church and State together again, that had been so long parted by Christ himself, brought more Trouble into the Church, and was more occasion of the Suffering of the Church, than all the Sufferings she ever met with before, as any one a little acquainted with Reading, may and will easily understand. But to us, that have been as great Sufferers under this Civil Ecclesiastical Power, as any in this last Age, (burning excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) for us, I say, in this Province, to assume to our selves the State Politick Power, is the point I mean to debate with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001572_0015_0FB3DB2FD82486D8"/>
our Church Members in Publick, after many years private Conferences with them, and their weak Opposition, dropt with these words, or the same in effect, <hi>We wish it were come to that, as there was no need of us in the State, &amp;c.</hi> But I'll go on, and shew what Harmony there is betwixt Church and State.</p>
            <p>If we do but take our measures by the holy Scripture of the New Testament, and not fly to Apostolical Example, we shall Resolve the Case at once.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, when men grew <hi>N</hi>umerous they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted themselves into Societies, for preservation of Concord and good Discipline, and began to think on foundations to set their Structure upon, and found by Experience, that no Natural or Artificial Building, nor Civil nor Ecclesiastick Society of Men, could be upheld without a Bottom on which they were first founded; <hi>first,</hi> The <hi>C</hi>ivil Society united, that they might live safely, and enjoy their Libertys without Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and they united into Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to live Religiously, according to Christ's Doctrine, and the Example of the Apostles. Now Civil Societies have their <hi>L</hi>aws proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themselves; and the Churches have their <hi>R</hi>ules of Discipline peculiar to themselves, and far different from each other. But the cause of so many Wars in <hi>Christendom,</hi> has been because the Civil Magistrate and the Church confound their Jurisdictions under the Law. These Societies were (as 'twere) one Corporation, Individual; for the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> had their Ministerial Office in Civil Causes; but Christ has made them now two distinct Provinces. I wou'd fain know, how we come to unite them together again? Or what Rule or Foundation our Gospel Ministers have to build a House on such a Bottom, that has neither Christ nor his Apostles for Example? Then if neither Precept nor President be from, of, or by them, Certainly it must be against them; and if against them it must needs be Anti-christian, and Anti-Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. That Christ never abetted such a Discipline to his disciples, is plain from his Doctrine to them, of <hi>L</hi>ording over one another (We want him here, to Check our Lords and Masters, that <hi>L</hi>ord it over their Brethren with the utmost Severity,

               <q>The Roman Censor, tho' a Civil Function, had no Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, nor Courts of Plea, or Indictment, nor any puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Force annext. It stood more with the Majesty of that

Office, to have no other Constable, Serjeants or Boms about 'em, than that of Terrour and Shame.</q>

            <p>
               <q>Then (pray observe) if the Courts of Judicature, to a Politick Censorship, seem too Contentious, much more may it to the Discipline of the Church, and her Members, to be quite divested of all Jurisdiction whatever? for so much the less Contention, so much more Christian. And could this <hi>Roman</hi> Office of a Censor, without his Jurisdicial Sword, strike such a Terrour and Awe on the great Spirits of <hi>Rome,</hi> as with one dash of Igno<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

Much more may the true Christian Minister, Guard himself with more piercing Beams of Dread and Majesty, to Conquer the Enemies of the true Church, without the Keys of State to help; for when the Church Members, without Carnal Weapons (indeed they ought to have none) are able to do so great a work upon the unforced Obedience of Men, it argues a Divinity about them, well becoming their holy Function. Thus far Milton.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I wish our Divines had this faculty of the <hi>Roman Censor,</hi> there would be no need of all the Constables in the County to Guard them with Clubs and Staves, to knock down all that do not Obey Order.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply;</hi> But this was a Civil Capacity, nor is the same Rule neither observ'd in our Church, for it has not the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy nor Power; for the Offender, without any shame at all, or Regret, will make an Hypocritical Confession, Sign a Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hold his old course still (under the Rose) and no shew of Reformation,</p>
            <p>But to <hi>Politicks</hi> again, This has been Objected, <hi>The Burthen of the State has providentially fallen on our Shoulders in this Uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated Land, where Rules of Discipline have been wanting; and why may we not assist in the Civil Power? Seeing good men are fittest for Government? and the act seems to become them too very well; They Incourage Virtue, and punish Vice.</hi> Well! of a Civil Plea, this is the best that can be offer'd. Again, <hi>The Saints shall Judge the Earth</hi> Good still; <hi>besides, here's Acts of Justice, Mercy and</hi>

To all which <hi>I answer,</hi> If Saints be Judges, they must use none but Saints Weapons; <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal,</hi> &amp;c. says <hi>Paul.</hi> But then I Query, Are none good or fit to Rule, but such of our Communion? Yes! But though Such; This interfers not with the Discipline of the true Church; <hi>I</hi>f the Duty of Office, can be perform'd by Love, Perswasion, Argument, or by the Authority of that Power, Christ gives his Church, and that is no Jurisdictive Power, <hi>I'</hi>m sure; as appears by the Power he us'd himself, to any of his Churches (tho' some take more, as <hi>I'</hi>ll prove e'er I have done) When the two Brothers Quarrel'd about their Estate, and applyed to him, <hi>Who made me a Judge or a Divider,</hi> (said he)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, The Woman taken in the Act of Adultery, <hi>Go away, do so no more.

Judge then! can you serve two Masters? <hi>I</hi>n short, the <hi>G</hi>overnment of Christ, is O economecal in his Church <hi>ONLY,</hi> and is altogether Love and Peace, and has no business with any of the Affairs of State, any further than to Admonish to Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, is it not Strange to see a <hi>States Minister,</hi> a <hi>Justice of Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Gospel Minister</hi> in one Skin; indeed, he may have two Cloaks, his Divinity Cloak, and his Humanity Cloak, but then he must lay by one, when he wears t'other. <hi>I</hi>ts not common to wear two great Cloaks at once; But to be very Exact, he should have three at least, one for the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> t'other for the <hi>Upper House,</hi> and the third for the <hi>Honourable Bench;</hi> and this Cloak too, must be lined with Stuff call'd <hi>Patience,</hi> to bear with all the Billings-gate <hi>R</hi>hetorick, with the Brawls and Hocus Pocus Fiteagues of the Noisy Bar; And what a fine Shew the Pulpit Divine makes amidst the throng of K<gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">

Now, I'll Appeal to any, but Wise Men, if I am not an Obedient, Patient Son, to loose Three Hundred Pounds, rather than displease Mother?

No Tyrant could do worse (unless to my Life) and what's my Life, if what should Support it, be taken from me? Better kill me at once. But here's another Tryal for me; after my Vineyard is gone, she takes away my Vail, and beats me too. Was ever poor Ladd so Buffeted! Yet notwithstanding this and more, if it could be, I heartily pray for all her Legitimate Sons and Daughters, as for my own.

               <hi>If</hi> Domestick Doctrine out-vied our Neighbours, this might fill the Church with Proselytes. But the best Rhetorick will not do half so well. I think then 'tis high time to find a Rule, and Square too, besides a Line, to help on this Emergent occasion, lest for want of such Rule of Discipline, untaught and practised, we loose the way to the Gare, or it be shut against us for want of timely care.</p>
            <p>We Read of a man formerly, that laid House to House, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Pray, what Title or Epitaph shall I bestow on him that Adds, and Builds, and Buys, and Fills, and will not say it is enough yet, but a <hi>Perpetuum Mobile</hi> hawls and pulls with Arms and Skulls, and is not content yet? Was it not a pretty Sight to behold our <hi>Metropolitan See</hi> up to the A—se in Mud, Water and Ice, the last Winter, fishing for Bags for his Heirs (when he gets 'em) Besides his other <hi>Monopoly,</hi> gained by his <hi>Pulpie Rhetorick,</hi> with his Politick and Sophestick Turns? But tho' admired for his great Talent, the time will come he shall be Dumb, with all the whole Fraternity that belong to the Tribe of <hi>Avarice;</hi> And then, and not till then, shall Church Flourish. Our Ancient Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ministers left their Nets, and never took them more, that we read of. But now, instead of leaving them, how many take 'em along with them to Catch. What? Men? No. What then? Bags. Of what sort? Any sort; <hi>Gold, Silver, Wheat, Barley, Oats, Bread, Flower,</hi> or any thing that comes to hand. All's Fish that comes to th' Net.</p>
            <p>But what's the Matter, that this Thirty Years we've been fishing, and ha'nt caught one poor <hi>Indian?</hi> How should we? We never cast the net on that side the Ship where they are to be had. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> and N<hi>ew</hi>-Y<hi>ork</hi> has out done us, I understand they have laboured hard to bring them to the Faith of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What have we done? Except two poor honest Fishers, that have left their Nets and tryed once, and catcht none yet (I fear)—This is worth the most Serious thought of a Gospel Minister.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>PAUL</hi> valued himself for Preaching the Gospel where it was not heard of; but most of us go where they may be sure of a Belly full, and good Lodging, and to preach among such as have something to give, and know as much as themselves.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001572_0027_0FB3DB41D7889110"/>
And that's one Reason we get no more Proselytes but what are spurious.—<hi>I</hi> know what Answer <hi>I</hi> shall have for not preaching to <hi>I</hi>ndians, <hi>We stay for a Motion.</hi> And as <hi>I</hi> can't dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this, <hi>I</hi> cannot prove, (nor they neither, <hi>I</hi> doubt) they have the Divine Oracle for preaching to any other; if they had, some <hi>F</hi>ruit would be brought forth. But <hi>I'</hi>ll forbear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> am perswaded <hi>Thomas Story,</hi> our Apostle, could or would not have been Tongue-tied so many Weeks or Months, if Providence had not cast him on <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> (taken by the French coming from <hi>Jamaica</hi>) where the Name of a QUAKER was not heard of. <hi>I</hi> ask'd him if he Preach'd there? No, said he. But if he had had the Oracle for his Commission, which no doubt he pretended to, when he took the Churches Authority to preach else-where; then he would not have been Silent, besides, his Concern to Travail again on the same <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

This <hi>I</hi> can prove true, and the ill scent of the Action stinks all over the Province; yet no notice in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly.</hi> Here be some unruly Fellows we want to have Ralied or Punished, but Partiality, <hi>I</hi>ndulgence or <hi>I</hi>ndifference lets them slip, <abbr>

            <p>All these Regulars, that have no Rule, and Canons that have no Law, nor Christian Custom, are Monsters, and ought to be Banished all Society, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>But, is not this a Rite that's quite Wrong? when Judgement is gone against me, I go to the Clerk for a Copy; <hi>No not without leave of the Meeting.</hi> Where has this Custom any President, in any Court of Judicature?</p>
            <p>Hear two or three more weak Ceremonies, and than Judge of the whole Catalogue.—Here's a Couple wants to be Coupled, one a bare F<hi>ormalist,</hi> and has no Religion but Theory, and Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; the other a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi> but has the Practick part of Solid Religion, and both believers. They, lay their <hi>I</hi>ntents before the Meeting (only he dissents in some points of Faith) <hi>No! we can't allow of such Marriages; it interfers with our Discipline.</hi> They are baulkt, but cannot forego their Engagements, nor violate their Nuptial Vows, but they proceed according to Laws made by the Church Members. A Gospel Minister gives them a Bill to publish their Marriage; but when it's done, he must or ought to be present at the Solemnity; but this is against Discipline, for any Member to witness to a Lawful Marriage. No, if this be suffer'd, we shall Gallop over all bounds of Discipline, and the Act must be Censured and Condemned, if Unity be preserved. What must we do? loose a good Wife or Husband, or not Marry at all; rather than loose the Unity of the Meeting? Answer this point, and then I have done.</p>
            <p>Now, I modestly offer, Whether it is not high time to Regulate these irregular, impracticable and unnatural Rules, lest we make our selves Ridiculous to all Christian Communion? For I do know, they have ruined many a Man and Woman irretrievably; and some both in Soul, <hi>B</hi>ody and Estate, meerly because they have been forced asunder, after God and Nature had Cemented their hearts and minds. This of all the foolish Rules is the worst.</p>

            <p>I know a Man that loves good Discipline, as well as any body, that had a Son lately Married, both came to Meeting from their Cradle, but the Woman was bashful, and would not shew herself before the Meeting; they put their Bill up according to Law, and were decently Marryed, the Justice a Member of the Meeting, present, and a great many Relations, all of the meeting abovesaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pray over-hawl this breach of Discipline? as much as that Gospel Minister of the highest Class, that was present at a Marriage of a known Fornicator, Marryed by a Justice, I never heard, that any one charged him for breach of Discipline, nor any other Justice of the Meeting, tho' present at such Marriage, but not one of the little Members must Escape, but must condemn the act, or turn out.—I shall not further Enlarge at present.

And this <hi>I</hi> wot well, That as Fools do see Wise Men stoop under pretence of Peace, No wonder then that the Empire of that Cruel Tyrant <hi>Custom,</hi> is so great, the greatest in all the World, I dare say. But this I'll tell you that are concerned, That if ye, like School-boys, will play Truant together (I mean out of the School of Christ) Ye shall be all Whipt together for Company. Think of me when <hi>I</hi> am gone; the time is near, that ye shall see (unless ye loose your Eyes) that the nearer ye get to the State, the further ye get from the true Church.</p>
            <p>Ye know your Lord and Master tells ye, You <hi>cannot be Heirs to God and Mammon too.</hi> My advice therefore is, To choose while it is in your power, lest when ye would ye cannot; for its a clear
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001572_0032_0FB3DB495633B740"/>
Truth, ye can Rule but in one, properly. But the Mistery is to make ye believe it; for some men will not be guided by their knowledge, because of Pre-possession, but will Perswade themselves they see not that heretofore was as clear to them as the Sun. Wherefore I say, open your Eyes, and look at this Text, and lay by your Honourable Faculty of the Gown.</p>
            <p>The House of God is his Church, and the Body of Christ is his <hi>C</hi>hurch; the <hi>C</hi>hurch is Subject to <hi>C</hi>hrist. Now am I not Homogeneal with that Body to whom I am joyned? <hi>T</hi>o be joyned to two bodies is a Monster. And if the house of God be his Church, can any Man joyn himself (Homologically speaking) to both Houses, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Church and State too? <hi>Lastly,</hi> If the Church be subject to Christ, Pray whose Subjects are ye? You'll answer, To Both. Well then, if this Plea will do, go on in the Name of <hi>George</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> for his Servants ye are and good Subjects too.</p>
            <p>I conclude with Devine <hi>Dell,</hi> in his Book, called, <hi>The way of true Peace and Unity in the true Church of Christ.</hi> His first Practical <hi>R</hi>ule, Thus, <q>The true Curch is to preserve it self Distinct from the World, and is neither to mingle it self with the World, nor suffer the World to mingle it self with it; for if the World and the Church be mingled together in one Society, the same Common Laws will no more agree to them who are of such contrary Natures, Principles and Ends, then Light and Darkness, Life and Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His second Rule. <q>The Church being thus distinct from the World, it is to be content with its own power for its own Affairs.</q> But that the Affairs of the State belong to the Church of Christ or any of the true Members, is the point in controversie. Let the Learned Answer this, and perhaps it may save me the Labour of penning another Thesis, to Prove that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have no more to do in the State, than the State has to do in their most Solemn Meetings.</p>
            <p>By the State let the unlearned know, 'tis the Worlds Power, the Civil Magistrate that bears not the Sword in vain, not the Sword of the Spirit, for that belongs to the true <hi>C</hi>hurch, and no other.</p>
