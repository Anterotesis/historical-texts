            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of this chapter we have the parable of the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this cautionary precept of our SAVIOUR was probably intended as a practical applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The parable itſelf is undoubtedly familiar to all of you. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inſtruction which it conveys is very obvious. It was manifeſtly deſigned to repreſent the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, to mark the diverſity which is obſervable in its reception, and to point out the manner in which it muſt be heard, ſo as to admit of the bleſſed effect, to which it is ultimately directed. CHRIST in his diſcourſe teaches us, that to ſecure the perſonal advantages, and final benefit of a preached Goſpel, the hearing of it muſt be like the operation of good ſoil, upon ſeed which is ſown in it. The ſoil muſt be of ſufficient depth to receive the ſeed, admit of its taking ſuitably deep root, favour the principle of vegetation, and its progreſs to maturity, or there will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023136_0004_0FBC83EDDE3E3BB8"/>
be no fruit. So in the expoſition of the parable, CHRIST explicitly aſſures us, that no good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent benefit can be ſecured to hearers, from the preaching of the moſt weighty and intereſting truths, unleſs they are heard in a manner, correſpondent to their ſolemnity, and the obligations which attend them. He teaches us, that neither the ſupine, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid multitude, who give a tranſient attention to the Goſpel, as a matter of courſe only; nor thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling triflers, who attend to it merely as a matter of ſpeculation; nor even thoſe, who for a little time are convinced of the reality and importance of the truths of Chriſtianity, but ſoon loſe this conviction, in ſcenes of buſineſs or gaiety; can, in the indulgence of their reſpective habits, be ſavingly benefited by the preaching of the Goſpel. The ſubſtance of what CHRIST urges, is this, that men muſt be in that moral ſituation which will admit of a due reception of the Goſpel, that they muſt be diſpoſed to receive it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, that they muſt reduce it to a uniform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious practice, and that then, and then only, will they bring forth fruit to the glory of GOD and their own ſalvation. Such being the importance of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel rightly; with great force and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety did CHRIST addreſs the cautionary injunction to his diſciples, and by them to us, <hi>Take heed how ye hear.</hi> And it cannot but affect us with a particular ſolemnity that he adds, <hi>for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; and whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which he ſeemeth to have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the paſſage, connected with the explanatory obſervations which have been made, we are obviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023136_0005_0FBC83EF3646DA08"/>
taught theſe important practical truths; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the preaching of the Goſpel there are duties appropriate to miniſters<note n="*" place="bottom">FOR unleſs the Goſpel is duly preached, it cannot be heard, <hi>How can they hear without a preacher?</hi>
               </note>; that there are alſo duties which are peculiar to, and binding on the people, as hearers; and that the diſcharge of theſe duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally, is eſſential to the ſecurity of the ſaving, and final benefit of a preached Goſpel. Let us then purſue the following arrangement in the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſubject:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. INQUIRE what is to be heard; or what are the chief things which ought to be inſiſted on, in the due publication of the Goſpel.</item>
               <item>II. HOW ſuch an exhibition of the Goſpel ſhould be heard. And,</item>
               <item>III. SHEW the importance of hearing it in a right manner.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. WE are to inquire what is to be heard; or what are the chief things which ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, in the due publication of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>HERE let us for a moment conſider what is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> of the Goſpel; for that will help us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, what thoſe truths are, which ſhould be chiefly inſiſted on, in the preaching of it. The Goſpel is not deſigned to develop the principles of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, or furniſh a philoſophical ſurvey of the material ſyſtem. It is not deſigned to make men politicians, artiſts, or proficients in huſbandry. It is not deſigned to teach them ſkill, or to ſtimulate them to enterprize, in worldly purſuits; but to make them
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023136_0006_0FBC83F0EC4701B8"/>
holy. Its grand object is, to exhibit the true char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, the will, and the purpoſes of GOD; to diſplay the medium of ſalvation for ſinners; and to mark out the path in which they muſt go, that they may be aſſimilated to GOD, be reinſtated in his favour, and become candidates for, and the final poſſeſſors of celeſtial bleſſedneſs. Whatever truths then have an obvious direction to theſe objects, and are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with them, are to be principally inſiſted on in the miniſtration of the Goſpel. Give me leave to deſcend to a few particulars.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be ſuppoſed that men will be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, that they will love GOD, and be happy in him, unleſs they have juſt views of his character. The attributes of the DEITY then, as the foundation of all religion, and forming the diſtinguiſhing glories of the divine character, are to be illuſtrated, as far as they are diſcoverable, from the light of nature, and the holy ſcriptures. It is not conceivable that men will feel that they are ſinners, the objects of divine abhorrence, and expoſed to puniſhment, and realize their need of that atonement which the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, unleſs they know whether they are tranſgreſſors of the divine law; and this they cannot decide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they become acquainted with it. The moral law then, as a tranſcript of the divine nature, and containing the ſum of our duty, is to be diſtinctly explained, and warmly enforced. Farther—How can men realize their proper moral ſtanding with reſpect to GOD and his kingdom, and their need of ſupernatural agency to transform and ſanctify, and of the blood of JESUS to cleanſe them, unleſs they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023136_0007_0FBC83F467B348C8"/>
are made acquainted with their fallen, <hi>i. e.</hi> with their totally ſinful ſtate? The hiſtory then of the original lapſe of human nature, and the extenſively dreadful conſequences of it, muſt be faithfully given. The decided declarations of Scripture, on this ſubject, muſt not be withheld; that <hi>we are by nature children of wrath, being children of diſobedience</hi>; that <hi>we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins</hi>; that <hi>the carnal heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt GOD, not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be.</hi> Hence too the doctrine of regeneration, as wrought by the agency of the HOLY SPIRIT, is a cardinal doctrine of the Bible; is eſſential to the ſcheme of religion there exhibited; and though called in queſtion by ſome, and derided by others, is one which cannot be too critically explained, or too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily urged. It is ſo clearly taught by CHRIST and his Apoſtles, that the chriſtian preacher, in his publick miniſtrations, cannot paſs it over, or conceal its importance, without treaſon againſt his Maſter, and the cauſe he has profeſſedly eſpouſed. That men may know whether they exerciſe a holy truſt in GOD, and are prepared to join the triumph of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in his government; and that they may be led to anticipations of that triumph; the nature of the divine adminiſtration, with reſpect to the immutable plan of it, as laid in the eternal and predeterminate counſels of the DEITY, as comprehending the conditions of creatures, and operating in the way of a gracious election, holy ſovereignty, and perfect benevolence, is to be held up to view in all its extent and glory. In connexion with theſe ſubjects, that which was the leading one of the Apoſtles' addreſſes, the ſalvation of the croſs, in reſpect to its author, its nature, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023136_0008_0FBC83F5FA03E9D8"/>
iſſue, as it muſt warm the heart, will be frequently the theme of the faithful preacher. To his fellow ſinners he will exhibit the LORD JESUS CHRIST, in his abſolute divinity, as the only Saviour. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent offices which belong to his mediatorial charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he will explain: The nature and ſufficiency of his atonement he will delineate: The terms of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in it, repentance and faith, he will illuſtrate and enforce; together with its infallible ſafety as a ground of dependence. It is highly important alſo, that the invariable connexion between faith, and a perſonal compliance with the duties which we owe to GOD and our fellow creatures, be fully urged. And that men may be perſuaded to live by faith on the SON of GOD, and to lead holy and unblamable lives; that ſinners may be awakened, and ſaints prompted to zeal and diligence, the ſolemn realities of death, judgment, and eternity, are to be diſplayed in their utmoſt ſeriouſneſs. The endleſs horrors of the world of puniſhment, and the glories of the heavenly paradiſe, are to be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their ſolemnity and luſtre. Publick and prevalent ſins are to be the ſubject of reproof. Men's accountableneſs at the bar of GOD for every thing done here in the body, is to be ſolemnly taught; and many other intereſting topicks there are, which a true miniſter of CHRIST, in fidelity to his Maſter, and the ſouls of men, will inſiſt on with honeſt fervour and boldneſs. In a word, the whole counſel of GOD, as contained in the Holy Scriptures, is to be exhibited without partiality or palliation; as becomes a dying man, ſtanding on the verge of eternity, and ſoon to leave the preſent ſcene, for the ſolemn adjudications of another, and an endleſs ſtate. We are now to ſhew</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:023136_0009_0FBC83F78DEC7018"/>II. HOW ſuch an exhibition of the Goſpel is to be heard. <hi>Take heed how ye hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE, my friends, are not mere philoſophick ſpeculations, or matters of tranſient occurrence. They are truths, weighty, divine and eternal; in which the everlaſting life or death of every ſon and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Adam is embarked. Theſe are truths which the SON of GOD came into the world to reveal and propagate; they have been ſealed by his blood; they have been witneſſed to, by the tragical deaths of innumerable martyrs; and there is no room to doubt, but that the Goſpel which conſiſts of them, will operate as a ſavour of life unto life, or of death unto death, to every one of us here preſent. We ſhall all of us ſoon find, that ſuch is the importance of hearing ſuitably, this Goſpel, that <hi>whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; and whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which he ſeemeth to have.</hi> How then ſhould we hear?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WITH honeſt and good hearts.</hi> This is what CHRIST expreſsly inculcates, in a verſe preceding our text. <hi>But that on the good ground are they, which in an honeſt and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.</hi> Nothing is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable an obſtacle to ſaving improvement, under the preaching of the Goſpel, as a vitiated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified heart. It is indeed as abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a heart unſubdued by divine grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its native averſion to divine things, ſhould well receive and duly improve the Goſpel, as that a rock ſhould receive ſeed, and rear it up to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Hence the apoſtle ſays, <hi>They that are in the

fleſh,</hi> they who retain a depraved heart, and are not led by the SPIRIT, <hi>cannot pleaſe GOD</hi>; thoſe who <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the truth in the love of it</hi> are expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. What can be more indiſputable, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, than that holy exerciſes are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render a performance beneficial, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What is there of duty in a prayer offered up with the lips only, without ſincerity or affection? What is there in an external act of charity, which can be acceptable to GOD, when he himſelf, and the proper motives of action, are diſregarded? Of what advantage was it to the diſobedient Jews, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed with the glorious and endearing truths which CHRIST preached, while they were his inveterate enemies, and were reſolved to perſecute him, and his diſciples, to the laſt extremity? Hence holineſs of heart is the primary thing enjoined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>My ſon give me thine heart.—Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby you have tranſgreſſed againſt me, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit, for, Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> How correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent with this ſentiment is the injunction of the apoſtle—<hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. THE truths of the Goſpel muſt be heard with <hi>ſolemn and ſerious attention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT certainly can anſwer no valuable purpoſe for you, my friends, to come to the houſe of GOD, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you attend ſeriouſly to the proper buſineſs before you. If you bring the world with you into the ſanctuary—if inſtead of worſhipping GOD in ſpirit and in truth, and giving that attention to divine
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023136_0011_0FBC83FA6F7AEC28"/>
truths, which the nature of the Sabbath, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the truths themſelves clearly demand, your minds are occupied in ſenſual and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns—Can GOD be pleaſed with you, or can it be ſuppoſed that you will be gainers by the Goſpel? Inattention to the faithful preaching of the Goſpel, is in every view totally inexcuſable. It is a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful index of a hard, ſtupid, and unfeeling heart. The Goſpel is of conſequence enough to engage atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether we conſider it as the only medium of our ſalvation, or as a ſource of moral inſtruction merely; and the motives which are adapted to ſecure this attention, are certainly numerous and weighty. Theſe motives, however, I ſhall have occaſion by and by to exhibit more fully. I take leave but to obſerve here, that whatever good individuals may obtain by the preaching of the Goſpel, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any advantage ſhould be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE a man comes to the houſe of GOD, and the moſt ſolemn truths are delivered, and in the cleareſt and moſt forcible manner—yet if he ſleep, or employ his time in gazing on trifling objects, or in ſtudying how he may ſucceſsfully puſh his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſchemes—In what reſpect will he be the wiſer or the better? He will go out of the houſe of GOD as ignorant and as ſtupid as he came in, and will be more the child of hell than before. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD.</hi> But how can there be this hearing without ſerious attention?</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE truths of the Goſpel ſhould be heard <hi>without prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:023136_0012_0FBC83FDB3AFC408"/>PREJUDICE has a moſt pernicious influence in the minds of men: It is like a deep rooted, and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſeaſe, which reſiſts all applications, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes certain death. When a ſpirit of prejudice is imbibed, either againſt truth, againſt religion in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, againſt a miniſter, or profeſſors of Chriſtianity; but little good is to be expected from the moſt dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent labours. There is ſcarce any thing which more obſtructs the genuine progreſs of the Goſpel than this. It renders the ſubject of it deaf to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to all reproof, and may entirely defeat the moſt benevolent exertions for his good. Prejudice has fomented enmities, divided churches and ſocieties, made man an enemy to man, and has probably done more towards peopling the world of darkneſs with wretched inhabitants, than is conceivable. We ſhould therefore make it our great concern, to have all our prejudices mortified; we ſhould be open to conviction; we ſhould be candid, and liberal; ready to yield to the light of truth whenever it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. For he will be likely to know moſt, and to judge righteſt, whoſe mind is leaſt under the ſhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of prejudice, and whoſe ingenuous heart is moſt open to the light of revelation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE truths which are exhibited in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, ought certainly to be heard, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cavilling and captious ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are many people who attend upon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of publick worſhip, with ſcarce any other view than to find fault. They come to the houſe of GOD, not to honour him, not to ſeek his favour and learn their duty; but to diſcover imperfections
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023136_0013_0FBC83FFC0F82B40"/>
in the preacher, in his manner, in his language, or in his doctrines; that they may have the malicious pleaſure of railing againſt him afterwards, and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting others towards him. Is this a proper return for the benevolent exertions of a faithful miniſter? Is this the ſpirit, with which we ſhould appear in the ſanctuary of the LORD GOD of hoſts? Is this the temper, with which the Goſpel of the meek SAVIOUR ſhould be heard? What an unamiable diſpoſition of mind is this! What protection can it meet with, my friends, before the bar of that Being, whoſe ſolemn requiſition is, <hi>Take heed how ye hear</hi>; and who can approve of thoſe only, who, <hi>as new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby?</hi> And what an effectual barrier muſt ſuch a ſpirit be, to preclude all the benign influences of the bleſſed truths of Chriſtianity! How much more lovely and charming is the temper of that man, who is formed to benevolent propenſities, who loves to throw a veil of charity over the defects and undeſigned devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his miniſter, and whoſe ultimate deſire is to be made better by the ſolemn truths he delivers!</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE truths of the Goſpel ſhould be heard, with a <hi>ſerious reſpect to thoſe very truths, and not from an idle unmeaning curioſity, or a chief regard to the manner, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and addreſs of the ſpeaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE come not to the houſe of GOD, that is, if we come rightly, to ſee new things, or to gratify a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſpirit. We come not to the temple of the LORD, as many go to a concert or theatre, to have the ear pleaſed with muſick, the flowing eaſe of language, or the graces of oratory. And to gratify people in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023136_0014_0FBC84012F112DD8"/>
their undue thirſt for theſe objects, can never be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly ſought by that miniſter, who conſiders that he is ſpeaking for GOD, and that the eternal life or death of his hearers is, as it were, ſuſpended on every word he utters. It will be rather his concern, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to declare the whole counſel of GOD, and to win ſouls to CHRIST. And thoſe people only will hear in a right and profitable manner, who chiefly regard the <hi>truth,</hi> who have conſciences open to conviction, and who realize that the Goſpel contains an infinitely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous addreſs to them from the King of Heaven, and that if they receive it not, it will be but a ſavour of death unto death to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE Goſpel ſhould be heard <hi>with prayerfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MINISTERS are but humble inſtruments in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the deſigns of grace. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but GOD that giveth the increaſe.</hi> As with reſpect to our exiſtence, <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our beings</hi>; ſo with reſpect to every moral good exerciſe of heart, <hi>he worketh in us, both to will and to do, of his good pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure.</hi> On the favourable gales, and friendly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his ſpirit, are we dependent, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them the Goſpel will be preached abſolutely in vain. This dependence we ſhould feel, and relying on the ability, the inexhauſtible fulneſs, and unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy of GOD, through JESUS CHRIT, we ſhould come to him as children to a father; ſoliciting the grateful breathings of his SPIRIT, and his particular bleſſing on his own inſtitutions. <hi>Let us therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023136_0015_0FBC8402DEF58980"/>
need.</hi> Bleſſed privilege! O that we knew the ſweets of it, by a more general and conſtant experience! Were there more prayers in the morning of the LORD's day; were there more in the evening; were there more ejaculatory deſires offered up in the courſe of publick worſhip; did we know more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally, in what a devout communion with GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; divine truths would undoubtedly have a more extenſive, and bleſſed influence. Then, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the righteous would flouriſh like the palm tree, he would grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</hi> Thrice happy that man who walks with GOD, and while he is hearing divine truths diſpenſed, lifts the pious deſires of his ſoul to him, that thoſe truths may ſink deep into his heart, and be a mean of his conformity to his Maker.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF we would comply with the direction of CHRIST, in our manner of hearing the weighty truths of his Goſpel, we muſt hear them <hi>with a diſpoſition, and readineſs to obey them in our practice.</hi> Faith muſt be attended with the external teſtimony of good works. Theory is of little uſe without practice. The more we become acquainted with the character of GOD, the greater are our obligations to love it, and to exhibit the fruit of ſuch a love, the purity of a holy conduct. The end of ſtudying the Goſpel and its precepts, is, that we may rejoice in the one, and fulfil the other.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE Goſpel ſhould be heard <hi>as a meſſage from GOD, and not from men.</hi> It is a revelation from GOD, and contains the beſt news that were ever publiſhed to the univerſe. It is to be heard therefore as the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023136_0016_0FBC8405E53C93D8"/>
word of GOD, and not as the word of men. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to give heed to it, as a proclamation from Heaven, announcing terms of peace to rebellious creatures; on the improvement of which depends our eternal well being. It is to be attended to, not as the dream of an enthuſiaſt, or a compilation of fabulous legends, but as the unalterable word of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble GOD. This inveſts it with a ſolemnity which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the deepeſt regard—which requires us to yield up our underſtandings to its inſtructions with implicit faith; and did we attend to it duly under this conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, every ſentiment would come to us with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible weight, and it would be impoſſible for us to be eaſy while diſobedient to its requirements.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE preaching of the Goſpel ſhould be heard <hi>under a ſenſe of the uncertainty of its enjoyment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OPPORTUNITY to attend to the overtures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming grace is a precarious privilege. The means of ſpiritual improvement may be ſhortly taken from us, and the things which relate to our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, may be ſoon hid from our eyes. We are ſliding with rapidity, on the tide of time, into the boundleſs ocean of eternity. Very ſoon our ſeats in the houſe of GOD will be vacant, or be filled by others. The Goſpel, as to us, will be publiſhed no more, and all opportunity for gaining inſtruction unto ſalvation will be loſt forever. How ſerious and ſolicitous ſhould this conſideration make us in our attention to the glorious Goſpel of CHRIST; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince it muſt be eventually a ſavour of life unto life or of death unto death to us!—Which brings me to obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:023136_0017_0FBC840735A36E18"/>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> THAT we ought by all means to hear the Goſpel, not only as dying, but as <hi>accountable creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR accountableneſs at the bar of GOD ſhould ſtimulate us to the greateſt circumſpection and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence in every duty. The declarations of the Holy Scripture on this ſubject are delivered in ſuch ſolemn language as this—<hi>Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Bethſaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which he ſeemeth to have. He that deſpiſed Moſes' law, died without mercy under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the SON of GOD, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the SPIRIT of grace.</hi> What can be more ſolemn than theſe declarations! To what an infinitely awful and intereſting ſcene do they point us! As ſtewards, we are to remember that we are to be reſponſible for our ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, at the tribunal of the great GOD. Solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will be made whether we have liſtened duly to the proclamations of his grace. At that period of grand aſſize, when the intelligent univerſe ſhall be aſſembled before the SUPREME JUDGE, to ſuſtain their reſpective irreverſible allotments, we ſhall be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the balance of divine truth, and find, to our eternal joy or ſorrow, that nothing is more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023136_0018_0FBC8408DC13A328"/>
than a due hearing of the truths of Chriſtianity, Now under the influence of theſe vaſt and weighty ideas, we ſhould hear the Goſpel, and certainly if we do, our attention will be very ſerious.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE third particular which was to engage our attention, you recollect was, The importance of hearing the Goſpel in a right manner.</p>
            <p>THIS part of our ſubject I have in a meaſure una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably anticipated, in what has been already ſaid; but you will ſuffer me to make ſome enlargement.</p>
            <p>A SUITABLE hearing of the Goſpel of the bleſſed JESUS, is of great importance, becauſe it muſt conduce in the higheſt degree to our reputation and uſefulneſs. The knowledge of the ſublime truths, and great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion, connected with their ſanctifying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the heart, will go far towards furniſhing a man for the diſcharge of the various duties of life with honour to himſelf, and extenſive advantage to others. This will qualify him to contribute eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to the good of his fellow creatures, in different capacities and relations. It is this, more than any one thing, which forms the good ſtateſman, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right patriot, the charitable benefactor, the conſtant friend, the amiable ſpiritual inſtructor, the firm ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of the truth, the kind neighbour, the humane maſter, and the tender relative. He who hears properly, who imbibes and practiſes, the eſſential principles of Chriſtianity, is a pillar of ſociety and an ornament of his generation. He goes about, in imitation of his Divine Maſter, doing good. He wipes the tear from affliction's eye. He eſpouſes the intereſts of publick and private happineſs. His
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023136_0019_0FBC840A320B10D0"/>
prayers draw down bleſſings upon a guilty world. He lives revered, and when he dies, ſociety feels the ſhock, and the bleſſings of many come upon him. Farther,</p>
            <p>TO hear the Goſpel rightly is of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the happineſs of the preſent life. <hi>The ways of wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace. Great peace,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>have they who love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> The man who has heard the Goſpel in the love of it, who has made it his object to learn and to fulfil his duty, who has been careful to treat the ſolemnities of Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation with that deference and attention which they claim, is happy. He is happy in that he has a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of faith on which he leans, and which will not admit of his being driven about by every wind of doctrine. He is not eaſily turned aſide from the foundations of his hope, or the comforts of it, by the glooms of melancholy, the cavils of the ſceptick, or the jeers of the ſcoffer. He is happy in that he is prepared to ſuſtain the calamities of life with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſerenity. His principles, views, affections and hopes diſarm adverſity of its ſting, and furniſh him with thoſe conſolations, which are more than a counterbalance to the ſevereſt ſtroke of affliction. Which leads me to obſerve, that he is more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in his devotional exerciſes. Heaven is ſhed into his boſom. He has anticipations of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſedneſs which are not to be conceived by natural men. His own experience teaches him, that <hi>the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:023136_0020_0FBC840C21B787E0"/>LET us now for a moment look at a character the reverſe of this. Conſider him as born in a chriſtian land, taught to read his Bible from his childhood, and led, in compliance with education and habit, to attend generally on the publick worſhip of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but he has never read the Scriptures with an intereſted attention and evangelical ſpirit. His heart has ſtill remained hard, ſtupid, and uninfluenced by religion. Though he is preſent ſtatedly in the houſe of GOD, he is trifling and inattentive. His mind is buried in worldly concerns. Or if in a meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally attentive, ſome darling prejudice perhaps has made him deaf to every rational ſentiment, and to all the remonſtrances of truth. He has made no ſerious inquiries into his own perſonal ſtate, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpects; and having no reliſh for ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he is a ſtranger to the ſincere devotional effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the humble heart. Such is the character of one who hears the Goſpel careleſsly. He is in a chriſtleſs, ſpiritually dead ſtate. The conſequence is, he is almoſt as ignorant as a heathen of the great principles and glorious ſcheme of Revelation; and is of courſe liable to become a prey to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. He is neither furniſhed, nor diſpoſed to communicate inſtruction to his houſehold, nor to ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit his neighbours in their moſt important concerns. While he is expoſed with others to diſappointments, diſtreſſes and croſſes; this peculiar infelicity attends him, that he is not armed againſt them. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is not improving. It ſavours not of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but of preſent and ſenſual things. His example is poiſonous. Death is his terror. In ſhort, he has a bare exiſtence, without ſolid enjoyment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:023136_0021_0FBC840D2DD0DDD8"/>BUT the importance of hearing the Goſpel rightly riſes, and appears to be infinitely great, as it reſpects our eternal welfare. Here the vaſtneſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject eludes our conceptions. On this are ſuſpended the amazing deciſions of the future world. Though we are by nature and practice ſinners, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laws of GOD to endleſs woe; we are not left in abſolutely hopeleſs circumſtances. A SAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IOUR is provided, and offered to us; pardon is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in his name to the penitent and believing. The declaration is made, <hi>Today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts</hi>; and we are aſſured that <hi>there is no other name under heaven given amongſt men whereby we can be ſaved</hi>; and that <hi>he who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved</hi>; and that <hi>he who believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> The preſent is a ſtate of probation. At death it is cloſed. The allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beyond it are retributive, fixed, and irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If we hear the Goſpel rightly, receive with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diality its gracious overtures, become the ſubjects of the genuine ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and the true follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the LAMB, the Goſpel will operate as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life unto life to us. Its promiſes will be ours. We ſhall die in peace. <hi>This corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.</hi>— Through the gloomy valley of the ſhadow of death, the divine preſence will irradiate our way, and we ſhall be brought to the <hi>general aſſembly and church of the firſtborn, to</hi> JESUS <hi>the mediator of the new covenant, and to an innumerable company of angels.</hi> We ſhall be emboſomed in the embraces of Almighty Love, and ſhall be making progreſs in knowledge, in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and happineſs, to all eternity. On the other
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023136_0022_0FBC84105B4C24D8"/>
hand; if we wear away this probationary ſtate, as forgetful hearers and not doers of the word; if we are ſtony ground hearers; if we neglect the great ſalvation; and live in the ungrateful rejection of GOD's unſpeakable gift, our death will be dreadful, and our eternity wretched. Our doom will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the lips of JESUS himſelf, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> We ſhall be excluded from the ſociety, the peace, and bliſs of Heaven. Hope will be extinguiſhed in our boſoms, and leave them to be the manſions of deſpair. Never more ſhall we hear the invitations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or have opportunity to believe unto ſalvation. Our reſidence muſt be, in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Our aſſociates apoſtate and malicious ſpirits. For <hi>without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi> Our conſolations will be the gnawings of that worm which never dies. Such is the portion of thoſe who forget GOD. <hi>This ſhall they have at mine hand, ſaith the LORD, they ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi> This, my hearers, will be our inevitable doom, if we liſten not to the pacifick terms of grace in the Goſpel, if we continue barren figtrees in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of GOD, if we do not take heed how we hear. And it ought to be obſerved, and I pray that we may deeply realize the truth, that our puniſhment will be aggravatedly intenſe, in proportion to the privileges which we enjoy. Our miſery will be more intolerable than heathens, who have no Goſpel to account for. Their treatment at the hands of their Judge, will be far more lenient, their doom will be far leſs deplorable, than what thoſe of us will

experience, who have had the Bible in our hands, and been favoured with the publication of its glorious truths, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and yet have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. GOD will not ſee his SON ſlighted, and yet hold his deſpiſers guiltleſs. He cannot be an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpectator of ungrateful abuſes of his grace. And by how much he loves his only begotten SON, by ſo much will he make the contemner of him feel the weight of his diſpleaſure. Now the only way to ſhun this immenſe miſery on the one hand; and to ſecure the enjoyments of heaven on the other, is to hear the Goſpel of the SON of GOD <hi>rightly.</hi> We muſt treaſure up the truth into good and honeſt hearts, receive it in the love of it, hear as accountable creatures, and with that ſerious and practical diligence, which become ſuch ſolemn realities. This is the great thing which we need as immortal creatures. Many other things may be of advantage to us in this world, but nothing elſe will do for the other. Learning, extenſive knowledge in different branches of human ſcience, may make us reſpectable in the ſight of men; but without the genuine influence of religion, we ſhall be odious in the ſight of GOD. Skill in trade may facilitate your worldly advancement, and furniſh you with the means of figure, and grandeur; but it can never ſave you from hell, or put you into heaven. Ingenuity in the mechanick arts, may make your circumſtances comfortable in this world; but can never make your circumſtances comfortable in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Diligence and prudence in huſbandry, may fill your ſtores and your barns with valuable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; but can never inſure you a treaſure in heaven. By learning, ſkill and induſtry, we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive

to worldly opulence and honour, and yet at the ſummons of mortality ſink deeper than Judas in the dungeon of darkneſs. A king may today wield the ſceptre of extenſive dominion, and flouriſh with all the ſplendor of an eaſtern monarch; yet, if he neglects duly to hear the Goſpel of the SON of GOD, and diſregards its gracious propoſals, tomorrow he may be the moſt abject, and wretched creature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable.</p>
            <p>OF how much conſequence then our preſent uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and happineſs may be ſuppoſed to be; of how much our intereſts in a future and retributive ſtate; of ſo much importance it is, that we hear the great truths of the Goſpel in a right and acceptable manner.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FROM the preceding obſervations, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the reaſon why preaching does no more good among mankind in general. It is very obvious that if the truths of the Goſpel were clearly, faithfully, and forcibly delivered; and if they were heard with that cordiality, candour, prayerfulneſs, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which they are entitled, the moſt bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects would be produced. Religion would be the cement of ſociety, and the ſtability of the times. Hypocriſy would be extirpated from churches. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſtupidity would be baniſhed. The light of the Goſpel would break forth as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſalvation which it proclaims, would wear a brightneſs like a lamp that burneth.

                  </gap> now, religion is contemned, and eternity forgotten. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of every kind, profanity, irreligion, debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023136_0025_0FBC841768DE1110"/>
fraud and falſehood, reign triumphant. Genuine Chriſtianity has but few adherents; and even thoſe who profeſs to love CHRIST, at leaſt many of them, ſeem aſhamed of his cauſe, and act as though they really thought him unworthy of their obedience. What can be the reaſon of this? Certainly a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal one is, that the great truths of the Goſpel are not generally preached with that clearneſs, fidelity, and fervour; and are not heard with that cordiality, attention, candour, and prayerfulneſs, to which they are entitled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. SUCH being the Goſpel when properly exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the manner in which it is to be heard, and the unſpeakable importance of hearing it rightly, we can ſcarcely fail of feeling our abſolute need of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural agency and bleſſing. As preachers, and as hearers, we may alike exclaim, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things! Without divine ſtrength we can do nothing.</hi> If we are left to ourſelves we ſhall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fulneſs and glory of the Goſpel, and the frequent publication of it, treaſure up to ourſelves wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD. On our knees then let us daily fall; and as dependent, polluted creatures, humbly implore the bleſſing of GOD, the guidance of the HOLY SPIRIT, and grace to help in every time of need.</p>
               <p n="3">3. FROM the preceding diſcourſe we may infer, that the duties which are incumbent on a miniſter and people reſpecting the Goſpel, are the moſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn and weighty that belong to man. It is his province to watch for ſouls as one who muſt give
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023136_0026_0FBC84193A3D4188"/>
account. It behoves him at his eternal peril to warn every man, to declare the whole counſel of GOD, and to endeavour by every poſſible mean to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the progreſs of the REDEEMER's kingdom, and the ſalvation of precious ſouls. He muſt not be intimidated from the faithful proſecution of his duty, by the malice or the ridicule of men. Perſecution he muſt patiently encounter, in whatever ſhape it may meet him. Truths which are grating to the proud hearts of ſinners, he muſt not ſuppreſs, leſt they ſhould give diſguſt. But he muſt be faithful to GOD, and to his own conſcience, and cheerfully riſque the conſequence. On the other hand, people, to whom the truths of the Goſpel are addreſſed, are bound to <hi>take heed how they hear,</hi> to <hi>receive the truth in the love of it,</hi> to practiſe it, to feel its importance, and to act from the influence of it. They are bound to hear as under the inſpection of their Judge, and as haſtening on the ſwift wings of time to his bar; always remembering, that the rule of judgment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Goſpel, is to be, <hi>whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which he ſeemeth to have.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. SUFFER me now, my brethren and friends, to call into view our perſonal concern in this ſubject, eſpecially with reſpect to the relation which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently been formed between us. In the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of GOD's holy providence, I am now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your miniſter. This to me is a concern of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite moment. Death is before me, and the awful, the grand, the all intereſting ſolemnities of a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, are ſoon to be realized. The charge
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023136_0027_0FBC841AB16CD500"/>
which I have received to watch over your ſouls as one who muſt give account, lies heavy on my heart. The loſs of a ſoul how, fearful! What! an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit wading through ſeas of anguiſh, ſuſtaining a puniſhment without diminution or end! And ſhall that ſoul be loſt through any careleſſneſs, ſtupidity or unfaithfulneſs of mine! May divine grace keep me from ſuch an unſpeakable infelicity. I deſire to be faithful, to declare to you the whole counſel of GOD, though I ſhould provoke your diſpleaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my own temporal eaſe. I come to you, my dear friends, as far as I know my own heart, not ſeeking yours but you; and I truſt I ſhall aim at your beſt good, though the more I love you, the leſs I be loved. Could I be inſtrumental in your eternal happineſs, I ſhould count no trials too great in the purſuit of ſo dear an object. From the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I have had of the difficulties attending the faithful diſcharge of the duties of the miniſtry, I do not allow myſelf to look forward into future life, with any great expectations of temporal proſperity, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But it is of very little conſequence what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals me, if you, my dear friends, may but be ſaved; and that you may indeed be ſaved, I hope will be the drift of my prayers, my exertions, my preaching, and my whole courſe of life. I truſt I ſhall have your prayers, your friendſhip, your kindneſs. I find in my heart that I love you, and unleſs I be deceived, I ſhall love you till my laſt breath. My time in this world will probably be ſhort. May it be filled up with the moſt diligent exertions for your good. As I am brought into a near and tender relation to you, I ſhall enter into all your afflictions, your diſtreſſes,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023136_0028_0FBC841C44BC6318"/>
and your ſpiritual wants. May we live together in love, may we walk together in chriſtian duty, and at laſt meet in the boſom of JESUS. I wiſh you to uſe freedom with me, with my houſe and family, in neighbourly intercourſe; and ſhould any of you have any diſtreſſes of mind, ſhould you hereafter feel the want of a chriſtian inſtructor and guide, when ſunk under ſpiritual burdens, come to me freely as to a brother, and let me endeavour to be an inſtrument of your happineſs. If I declare to you, at any time, truths which are grating to your natural feelings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is becauſe I would not flatter you at your eternal expenſe, but would approve myſelf to GOD a faithful miniſter of the New Teſtament. And inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome intricate doctrines muſt be preached and explained, and the manner of treating them may be miſunderſtood, whenever perſons are diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and feel an oppoſition to them prevailing in their minds, I requeſt that they would be ſo ingenuous as to converſe familiarly with me on their difficulties, that I may have a fair opportunity to remove them, that ſo that harmony which is the only baſis of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſociety may be ſecured.</p>
               <p>ON your part, my brethren, you ſee your duty. Obey then the injunction, <hi>Take heed how ye hear.</hi> Hear with honeſt, good, and believing hearts. Hear with ſolemn and ſerious attention. Hear without prejudice. Hear without a captious and cavilling ſpirit. Hear from an intereſted reſpect to the truths of the Goſpel; and not from an idle curioſity, or a chief regard to the manner, language, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the ſpeaker. Hear with prayerfulneſs. Hear
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023136_0029_0FBC841FDA70D068"/>
with a diſpoſition and readineſs to obey in your uniform practice. Hear the Goſpel as the word of GOD, and not as the word of men. Hear under a ſenſe of the uncertainty of its enjoyment. And hear as creatures who are to give account at the laſt great day, and whoſe eternal ſtate is to be determined by their reception or rejection of the Goſpel. Let me be encouraged by your ſtrict and conſcientious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the publick exerciſes of the LORD's houſe. Do not ſuffer yourſelves to fall into habits of ſloth and tarrying at home on the Sabbath. Let me, I entreat you, be favoured with a ſolemn attention to the truths I am called to deliver. Let every one remember that he muſt give an account for the manner in which he treats the Goſpel. Deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize that if you neglect the great ſalvation which it propoſes; if you fail to hear rightly its intereſting truths; if you manifeſt an indifference and diſreſpect to the proclamations of redeeming grace, and refuſe a compliance with them; deſtruction will moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly overtake you as an armed man, and there will be no eſcape. Lay feelingly to heart the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated guilt, which muſt attend a voluntary, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual abuſe, of that exhibition of almighty love which is addreſſed to you in the Goſpel. Conſider what anguiſh will penetrate your ſouls at the day of judgment, if you are unhappily found to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this grace of GOD in vain. Remember that if ye believe not, ſtill <hi>GOD abideth faithful; he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> The Eternal Word, found in the form of a ſervant, addreſſing ſinners, by the miniſters of his kingdom, with the endearing perſuaſions of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering love, cannot be diſregarded with impunity.

Conſider alſo the preſent felicity, and the intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble future glory, which are annexed, by divine prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, to a due hearing, to a cordial admiſſion of the Goſpel. Welcome then, I entreat you, its inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and let them have control over all your views, feelings, and conduct. Let your ears, your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, your hearts be open to the reception of the truth as it is in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
