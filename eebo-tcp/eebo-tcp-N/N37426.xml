            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>LIFE OF Poll Flanders.</head>
            <p>AT the requeſt of ſeveral friends, and finding myſelf draw near the cloſe of life, I ſhall, in this edition, give a more full account of my birth and parentage than any yet publiſhed; as alſo of my real name, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I had for taking the name of <hi>Poll Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My grandfather was born at <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> in the north part of the kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> of good and honeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entage, who joining with O'<hi>Neale</hi> in the troubles of that Kingdom, forfeited his eſtate, and a little after died for grief, leaving my father <hi>James Fitzpatrick,</hi> to the care of his brother, who brought him up a gentleman; but at his death did not leave him above fifty pounds to ſeek his fortune, with which he equipped himſelf like a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as he really was one, and came over to <hi>England;</hi> but that ſmall ſum being ſoon expended, he was driven very much to his ſhifts, and liv'd upon dice and Miſſes as is uſual with too many of that country, and at that time got acquainted with my mother, whoſe name was <hi>Mary Flanders,</hi> and the top of all the miſtreſſes about <hi>Whets<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's-park,</hi> then the rendezvous of all the Miſſes about town. But her beauty fading, and ſhe becomine an old face, they found that way of living would not maintain them in their extravagancies, and my father was obliged now and then to <hi>turn out,</hi> and go upon the highway, wherein he always behaved like a gentleman, and never killed any one in his life, as he declared the very laſt moment of his breath; but aſſociating with ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es worſe than himſelf, he was in a years time betray'd by his companions, taken, committed to Newgate, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:049057_0003_10264CFB9275B928"/>
at Tyburn, where he died truly penitent, and like a good chriſtian, made a decent Exit.</p>
            <p>My mother was young with child, at the death of my father, and his untimely end had like to have coſt her her life; but it was not ſo decreed, for in a little time ſhe recovered, and found herſelf in a more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition than ſhe expected, being much in debt with the charges ſhe was at, in hopes of getting a reprieve for my father; and the world frowned very hardly upon her, every one was for getting his own, tho they knew ſhe had not a farthing to pay them; ſo miſerable is the caſe of perſons in diſtreſs, that inſtead of affording pity, they add one affliction to another; and nothing would ſerve the hard hearted creditors, but that they would have my mother rot in a goal, and make dice of her bones, which made her begin to look about her, and conſider what way ſhe had beſt to take: if ſhe could not get money, ſhe knew ſhe muſt ſoon periſh in goal; how to get it ſhe had no way, her beauty being, as I ſaid before decayed, and ſhe having been an old batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch about town, had but little to expect from that courſe of life; beſide, the very name of having her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hanged, added very much to her misfortunes. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her creditors were moſt of them of that frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity themſelves; yet theſe hard-hearted creatures, never dreaming how ſoon it might be their own turns to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, arreſted her, and threw her into the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> where ſhe lay in a very deplorable condition for above a month, and was then diſcharged upon paying her ſees, when they found they could make nothing of her.</p>
            <p>When ſhe came out, ſhe found herſelf in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than before, and did not know what to do to ſupport nature; to work ſhe was unable, and to beg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed: and in this deplorable ſtate ſtrolling about the ſtreets one evening, ſhe met a woman that had been a priſoner with her in the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> with whom going to drink a pint of beer, comparing notes, they found their conditions to be much alike, and the other being an old practitioner, adviſed my mother to go along with her a ſhoplifting, who not having a farthing in the world, and being afraid to go home for want of money
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:049057_0004_10264CFE439D6E28"/>
to pay her lodging, they at length agreed, when going along <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apſide,</hi> they went into a linen draper's ſhop, and cheapened ſeveral pieces of linen, in which time the other woman concealed three pieces of holland, which ſhe gave to my mother to hide under her petticoats, and ſhe went away, leaving my mother to ſhift for herſelf, who being but a young practitioner at the buſineſs, was eaſily diſcovered, ſecured, and carried before a juſtice of the peace, who committed her to Newgate, from whence ſhe was carried to the Old Bailey, and there condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but pleading pregnancy, was respited for about four months, when being called down to her former judgment, was ordered for tranſportation till which ſhe lay in Newgate above five months, and then left me in the hands of the priſoners, who ſold me to the Gypſies, with whom I continued till I was about three years old, when they left me at Colcheſter in Essex, where I was taken up by the pariſh, but could give no account how I came there only that I belonged to the Gypſies, and that they had left me, but why or where they were gone, I did not know, neither could they find them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſent every way to look for them.</p>
            <p>I was now too young to take care of myſelf, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above three years old, and was ordered by the church warden, to the pariſh nurſe, who proved a very good ſort of a woman, and took a great deal of care of the children under her, teaching them to read and work till they were fit to go to buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Under this good woman I continued till I was eight years old, and then the officers were for putting me to ſervice, which I had a ſtrong averſion to, and told my nurſe, if ſhe would keep me, I was ſure I could get my own living by ſpinning and working with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and that I would work night and day rather than leave her. Fooliſh child, ſaid ſhe, thou wilt learn to do houſe-work as thou haſt learnt thy needle, and they won't put thee to hard work at firſt: Yes they will, ſaid I, and if I don't do it they will beat me: and then I could not forbear crying for a quarter of an hour, which ſo moved the good woman, that ſhe took me in her arms and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:049057_0005_10264CFFDDE7DE58"/>
ſaid I ſhould not go to ſervice, ſhe would ſpeak to the Mayor to let me continue at my needle a little longer.</p>
            <p>The next day, ſhe going to wait on the Mayor, who would often ſend for her to know how the children did, ſhe told him they were all well, but that ſhe had one that would be nothing but a gentlewoman; which ſtory ſo pleaſed the Mayor's lady and her daughters, that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> week's time they came to the ſchool, and being pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the order and management of the children, one of the daughters enquired which was ſhe that was a gentlewoman? which terribly frighted me; but ſhe taking me by the hand, and ſaying <hi>Miſs has a lady's hand, and for ought I know may be one before ſhe dies.</hi> This gave me courage to preſent my work to Mrs. Mayoreſs who, being mightily pleaſed with it, gave me a ſhilling, and bade me mind my work, and I would be a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman the ſooner.</p>
            <p>But alas! they did not know what I meant by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman; for the young ladies aſking me, What a gentlewoman was, I told them, to get my own living by my needle, and not go to ſervice: This prattle ſo pleaſed the daughters, that they gave me money too.</p>
            <p>I gave my money to my nurſe, and told her ſhe ſhould have all I got when I was a gentlewoman, which ſo diverted the good old woman, that ſhe would be often talking with me, all which ſhe related to the Mayor's daughters, who told other young ladies of the town, with whom they were uſed to come every week to ſee me, and they were often uſed to ſay I was a very pretty girl, which made me not a little proud, and I began to ſpruce myſelf up a little finer than the reſt of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with linen and laced head-dreſſes, and gloves, which my nurſe bought me with the money that was given me, which ſhe always faithfully gave an account of to thoſe who gave it me; which ſo pleaſed many of them, that they ſtrove who ſhould give me moſt money; ſo that by the time I was ten years old. I was as fine as a gentlewoman indeed. And now I was again call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to go to ſervice, but by this time my nurſe did not care to part with me, for I was now become uſeful to her ſchool, and could teach the children in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:049057_0006_10264D03A5CBA4D8"/>
ſo that ſhe told them, if they pleaſed ſhe would keep the gentlewoman herſelf, which ſo pleaſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that they were kinder to me than before, and bro't me fine works to do, which they not only paid me for, but taught me how to do it themſelves, ſo that by twelve years old, I not only helped my nurſe in her ſchool, but paid her for my keeping, and went very genteelly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and had money in my pocket.</p>
            <p>At laſt one of the ladies deſired my nurſe in the Chriſtmas to let me go home with her to keep her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters company, which the old woman could ſcarcely be perſuaded to do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the lady would keep me for good and all, which ſhe told her ſhe did not know but ſhe might do in a little time, but at preſent I ſhould only ſtay a week, to ſee how I could agree with her daughters, where I had not been a day or two, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the delight of the whole family.</p>
            <p>However, according to promiſe, I went home to my nurſe again, much, you may be ſure, againſt my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for I had gotten ſuch a taſte of genteel living at my lady's, that every thing was out of order at my nurſe's, and nothing could pleaſe me, having quite other notions of being a gentlewoman than I had formerly and believed it to be a fine thing even to be among la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; However, the many obligations I had to my nurſe would not let me think of leaving her, and, indeed if I had I did not know where to go, ſo that I judged it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> continue longer with her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome kind opportunity ſhould offer; which I did till I was paſt fourteen years of age, when my good old woman ſickened and died, which indeed was a ſad grief to me, I not knowing what to do, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> where to go, the pariſh children being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſchool broken up; and what was ſtill worſe, my nurſe had two and twenty ſhillings ſterling of mine, which was my all, in her hands when ſhe died, which her daughter at firſt denied to give me, altho her mother had told her of it before ſhe died.</p>
            <p>I was now a poor gentlewoman indeed, for the goods being removed, I did not know where to go, till ſome of the neighbours informed the lady, in whoſe family I had been how I was left, who ſent a maid for me, and I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:049057_0007_10264D06662F4C90"/>
went with a glad heart, you may be ſure; however the fright had made ſuch an impreſſion upon me, that I was willing to do any thing they ſhould put me to; but my good lady deſigned no hard work for me, but received me very generouſly, and if poſſible, exceeded the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in kindneſs; and the Mayoreſs ſoon after ſent for me, and then others, ſo that I was very much made of wherever I went; but the lady would not part with me, altho the Mayoreſs claimed me as her right, ſhe being the firſt that had taken notice of me.</p>
            <p>By this time I was between ſeventeen and eighteen years of age, and had all the advantages of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable; and the young ladies having maſters at home, teaching them French, dancing, and muſic, I learnt faſter than any of them, and could ſing much better, which made me not a little proud of myſelf; and I alſo heard the young gentlemen ſay, I was the pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt girl they ever ſaw in their lives, which was no ſmall addition to the good opinion. I had of myſelf. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, I carried myſelf very modeſtly, which gained me the eſteem of all that knew me, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the lady's two ſons who both fell in love with me, and which proved my ruin, as you ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The eldeſt was a gentleman of pleaſure, and knew the gaiety of the town as well as the ſolidity of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he was always praiſing my beauty, and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to entrap me, which he knew as well how to do as to catch a patridge; always commending me to his ſiſters, but to be ſure it was in my hearing, which would make them often rebuke him, ſaying, I heard what he ſaid, which he would put off with a joke, and then preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently begin to talk of me again, this pleaſed me ſo much that I was always as willing to hear as he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
            <p>After this fly way of laying his bait, he endeavored to catch me more openly: and coming one day into his ſiſter's chamber when I was with them, he aſked me if my cheeks did not burn? to which I anſwered not a word, but bluſhed and made a courteſy: why? ſaid the lady becauſe we have been talking of her ſaid he, above half an hour below ſtairs: and what then? ſaid his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:049057_0008_10264D080C8E6AA0"/>
I am ſure you can ſay no harm of her: no faith, ſays he, far from it, we all agree ſhe is the handſomeſt young woman in Colcheſter, and in ſhort ſhe is become the toaſt of the town.</p>
            <p>One of the young ladies checked her brother for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so before me, and ſaid, that Betty wants but one thing, and ſhe had as good want all the graces, and that's money, which is all that men want now-a-days; for tho a woman were as beautiful as Venus, chaſte as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and wiſe as Minerva—hold, ſiſter, ſaid the younger, who was ſtanding by, if I could find a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſo accompliſhed as you talk of, I would not matter the money; but you will ever be uneaſy about that, ſaid the ſiſter.</p>
            <p>How do you know, ſaid the elder brother, you have more fortune than beauty: you need not exclaim againſt it, then ſaid the ſiſter, I have the better of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors: You don't know that, ſaid the younger brother; beauty will often ſteal a huſband in ſpite of money, and the maid often makes a better bargain than her miſtreſs that rides in her coach before her.</p>
            <p>I thought it was high time for me to withdraw, which I did, but not ſo far, but I heard all their diſcourſe, which proved not much to my advantage; for the younger brother fell out with his ſiſter about me, which ſhe ſo reſented, that her future conduct was very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, tho indeed at that time ſhe had no occaſion, for I had no thoughts of her younger brother, and the eldeſt ſaid ſo many things in jeſt, that I gave credit to nothing he ſaid.</p>
            <p>Knowing they were out, he came one day to the door, and knocking as he uſed to do, I told him the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were gone out; I know that ſaid he, my dear, but you are here, and that's better; and upon that he claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in his arms, and gave me repeated kiſſed, at which I ſtrugged, I can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t ſay but it was faintly, and ſo he held me and kiſſed me till he was out of breath, ſwearing he was in love with me, which put me into ſome diſorder, he ſtill continuing to repeat it, and I cannot ſay but I in my heart wiſhed it, were ſo; however I ſoon recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered myſelf, and he ſeeing his sisters coming up the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:049057_0009_10264D0BB14D3740"/>
ſwore he was in earneſt, kiſſed me and took his leave.</p>
            <p>My head now ran upon nothing but love; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but the pride of having ſuch a fine gentleman in love with me, would have made me yield to any thing he could have deſired, had he at that time thought fit to have aſked it, but he was more modeſt then, than he proved afterwards: for in a few days, the family being all abroad, and I not dreaming he was at home, he ſurprized me in his younger ſiſter's chamber, and fell a kiſſing me as before, and when he had done, he ſat down, and ſwore he was charmed with my beauty, and abundance of fine things, and that if I would but return his love, I ſhould ſave his life; and then taking me in his arms, he threw me upon the bed, and kiſſed me vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, but offered then no rudeneſs to me, lifting me up again, and put five guineas into my hand, ſwearing it was in honeſt affection; and then going down ſtairs, and finding the houſe clear, he returned and fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to work with me, as he did before, but with leſs ceremony, for ſhutting the door, he ſaid he fancied there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body coming up ſtairs, Miſs Betty; but I ſaid I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, for there was no body in the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe but he and I; well, my dear, ſaid he, it is good to be ſure, however, and ſitting down he began to tell me how he loved me, and that as ſoon as he came to his eſtate he would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, which I had no more wit than to believe; and then he threw me upon the bed again, and ſtopt my mouth with kiſſes, and offered ſome things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not permit me to mention; however he did not attempt the laſt favor, on which he made a plea for his other freedoms, which done, he put a handful of gold in my hands, and renewed his former proteſtations of love. Vanity had now gotten the maſter of my virtue, &amp; I was reſolved not to deny him any favour he ſhould aſk &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I wondered that he had not done it before: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I was cunning enough not to give the leaſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

made more difficulty about it than there really was, for to be plain, I was as willing as he.</p>
            <p>The Devil, who never wants means as well as agents, to do his work, ſoon found out a way to enjoy that, which I cannot but ſay we had both ſo long wiſhed for. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day into his ſiſter's chamber, he deſired them to let me go to a milliner's for two neck cloths he had bought, of the ſame muſlin with a turnover he had in his hand, in which he gave me a note which was my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then he began to tell them a long ſtory of a viſit he was going to make, and that he ſhould be very glad of their company, which they deſired to be excuſed of, becauſe they had company to viſit them that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, as he knew very well.</p>
            <p>In the mean time a gentleman's chariot came to the door, under pretence of fetching him, but he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it on purpoſe, which he had no ſooner notice of, than be took his leave of his ſiſters, in a very formal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and came to meet me at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At firſt he began to tell me, that his love would not let him betray me, and that he would marry me as ſoon as he came to his eſtate, and many ſuch proteſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ions that he needed not to have done; and ſaid he, my dear, if you prove with child. I'll take care of you both, and to ſatisfy you I am in earneſt, here's an hundred guineas for you in this purſe, and I'll give you ſuch another eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year till I marry you.</p>
            <p>My colour came and went at the ſight of the purſe, ſo that I could not ſpeak a word, which he perceiving, put the purſe into my boſom, and ********** from which moment I might reckon the date of my ruin; for my virtue and modeſty being gone, I had nothing left to recommend myſelf to God or man,</p>
            <p>After which I went and bought the neck-cloths, and was home ſoon enough not to be ſuſpected, and my lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtayed out till late at night, fluſhed with wine and pleaſure. Afterwards we made uſe of all opportunities to renew our unlawful pleaſures for above half a year,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:049057_0011_10264D11294A7EE0"/>
and yet all this while I proved not with child. When his younger brother finding me alone in the garden one evening, began to talk to me of love, and prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of ſuch a gentleman who, had taken me into the houſe in ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> deplorable condition; but there happen'd a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty which I did not expect, for this young man made no ſcruple of owning it publickly, and though they could not prove I had ever given him any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I found their behaviour towards me more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind than ever before, and I underſtood by one of the ſiſters, that in a little time I ſhould be deſired to remove.</p>
            <p>This did not at all trouble me, knowing that I ſhould be provided for, and that if I ſhould prove with child I muſt then go away with diſgrace: but the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man coming to me, ſaid, Since it was known, he was not aſham'd to own it, and that if I would have him, he was bred up to the law, and could maintain me, let his father and mother be pleas'd or not, he was not afraid to make me his wife, which words he ſpoke ſo cordially, that I began to repent of my converſation with his elder brother, but I could not bear to think of being a Miſs to one brother and a wife to the other, beſide, I ſtill imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the elder would marry me; but then I remembered he had not ſaid one word of that ſince I was his miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I was now, to be ſure, in a great ſtrait, the one laid cloſe ſiege to me, and declar'd it publickly, which the other could not be ignorant of altho' he took no notice of it; upon which I began to think for the firſt time, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er having done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

at laſt I told him, that indeed I was troubled, and I had great reaſon to be ſo, for I knew not what courſe to take unleſs he would direct me, upon which he bade me not to be troubled, for he would protect me, be it what it will.</p>
            <p>I then began to ſpeak more freely, and told him I was afraid we were diſcovered, for I was remov'd from his ſiſter's bed, to lie with one of the maids, who told me ſhe heard I was to be turned away, and that his mother ſaid, it was not ſafe to keep me in the houſe; at which he ſmil'd, and ſaid No, my dear, we are not ſo much as ſuſpected, it is my brother Robin, who has been ſo ſilly to own his love to you, and is always vexing them, which makes them ſo unkind to you.</p>
            <p>I know that too, ſaid I, but this is not all, your broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has not only the vanity to be confident of my being his wife, but has the folly to tell every body, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have ſo often given him a flat denial which when they underſtand, they will preſently imagine there is ſomething elſe in it, or I would never refuſe a match ſo much above me; which ſurpriz'd him ſo that he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he did not well know what way he ſhould take, but he would conſider of it, and in the mean time adviſed me not to conſent, nor yet be rude to his brother, but keep him in ſuſpenſe for a while; at which words I ſeem'd to be very uneaſy, ſaying, He knew very well I had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to give, that he had promis'd to marry me, and that he all along perſuaded me to call myſelf his wife.</p>
            <p>He pacify'd me as well as he could, telling me if he were not my huſband, he would be as good as a huſband to me, &amp; then he gave me money; but he never offer'd to touch me, although we were two hours together, which I wondered at, conſidering how he uſed to be, and what opportunity we had.</p>
            <p>In about a week's time his brother came from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when he took an opportunity to talk with him, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, That he heard ſtrange news, that he made love to Miſs Betty, which the youngeſt frankly owned, but I find ſays he, ſome do concern themſelves about it, and uſe the poor girl ill, which I take as done to myſelf.

            <p>Next time we met, he told me what diſcourſe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt Robin, and him, which ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Is it in my power, think you, to make ſuch a change at demand? No, ſaid I, it is impoſſible, and whatever the change on your ſide may be, I will ever be true; and I had much rather be your Miſs, ſince it is come to that, than your brother's wife.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all my reproaches, he replied again, my dear, I have not broken one promiſe with you yet; I did tell you I would marry you when I was come to my eſtate; but you ſee my father is a firm healthy man, and may live theſe thirty years ſtill, and not be older than ſeveral are round us in the town; and you never propoſed my marrying you ſooner, becauſe you know it might be my ruin; and as to all the reſt, I have not failed you in any; you have wanted for nothing.</p>
            <p>He told me he had but one queſtion then to aſk me that could lie in the way of it, and if that queſtion were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the negative, he could not but think ſtill it was the only ſtep I could take. I gueſſed at the queſtion preſently, namely, whether I were ſure I was not with child? I told him he need not be concerned about that, for I was not; with this he took his leave, by reaſon of his mother and ſiſters ringing juſt then at the gate. He left me in the utmoſt confuſion of thought from Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day till Sunday, when all the family, but himſelf, went to church, and then he had me an hour and an half again by myſelf; and after falling into divers arguments, I aſked him what opinion he could have of my modeſty; that he could ſuppoſe I could entertain a thought of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with two brothers? and aſſured him it could never be.</p>
            <p>Being ſurprized at my obſtinacy, as he called it, he told me it was ſuch an unlooked for criſis, that he did not ſee any other way to ſave us both from ruin; and that if he muſt ſay no more of it, he knew of nothing elſe we had to talk of, and ſo he roſe up to take his leave; I roſe up too, as if with the ſame indifference, but when

            <p>He was ſenſibly moved with this, ſo he ſat down again, and ſaid a great many things to me, to abate the exceſs of my paſſion; but letting me plainly ſee that he would decline me in the main point, nay, even as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, making it a point of honor not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that for ought he knew might come to be his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's wife.</p>
            <p>The bare loſs of him as a gallant was not ſo much my affliction, as the loſs of his perſon, whom indeed I loved to diſtraction, and the loſs of all the expectations I had of having him one day for my huſband; Theſe things oppreſſed my mind ſo much, that I fell into a high fever, ſo that none in the family expected my life. I was reduced very low, and was often delirious and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, about the end of five weeks I grew better, but was ſo weak, and recovered ſo ſlowly, that the phyſicians apprehended I ſhould go into a conſumption; and which vexed me moſt, they gave it as their opinion, that I was in love; upon this they were all ſet on to examine me, and preſs me to tell whether I were in love or not; but I denied my being in love at all.</p>
            <p>They had, on this occaſion, like to have put the whole family in an uproar; for happening to be all at table, but the father, when the maid told the old gentlewom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that I could not eat what her ladyſhip had ſent up: Alas! ſays ſhe, that poor girl I am afraid, will never be well; why, ſays the elder brother, how ſhould ſhe be well? they ſay ſhe is in love.

               </gap> they have made ſuch a rout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her being handſome, and that in her hearing too, that it has turned the creature's head, I believe: Why, ſiſter, you muſt acknowledge ſhe is very handſome, ſays the elder brother: Ay, much handſomer than you, ſiſter, ſays Robin, and that's your mortification: She is well enough ſays his ſiſter; ſhe need not be told of it to make her vain: We are not talking of her being vain, ſays the elder brother, but of her being in love: I would ſhe were

in love with me, ſays Robin, I'd quickly put her out of pain: What do you mean by that ſays the old lady, how can you talk ſo? Why, ſays Robin, do you think I'd let the girl die for love, and or one who is ſo near at hand too: I find, ſays the elder ſiſter, if Betty be not in love, my brother is: I wonder he has not broken his mind to Betty, I warrant ſhe wont ſay No: They who yield when they are aſked, ſays Robin, are one ſtep before them who were never aſked, and that's an anſwer to you. This fired the ſiſter, and ſhe flew into a paſſion, ſaying, ſince things were come to that paſs, it was time the wench, meaning me, was removed.</p>
            <p>It run a great deal farther, and poor Betty loſt ground by it extremely, I heard of it and cried heartily, and the old lady came up to me I complained to her, that it was very hard the doctors ſhould paſs ſuch a cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, for which they had no ground, and that I had more need to think of a coffin than of being in love. She deſired I would anſwer her one queſtion: I told her I would which was, whether there were any thing between her ſon Robert and me? I told her there was not, nor ever had been; adding that Mr. Robert had rattled, as ſhe knew it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>courſe which had no ſignification in it. The old lady was fully ſatisfied, and took her leave; but when ſhe came down ſhe found the brothers and ſiſters togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the ear; but her coming put a ſtop to it, telling them all the diſcourſe ſhe had with me, and that I ſaid there was nothing between Mr. Robert and me, but Robert ramble, ſo in his diſcourſe that no body know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whether he be in earneſt or jeſt. It is in vain to tell any more lies about it; I am in earneſt; and if Miſs Betty would marry me, I would have her to-morrow morning faſting: Well, ſays the mother, then there's one ſon loſt: I hope not, ſays he, when a good wife has found him: Why ſays the old lady, ſhe is a beggar: She has more need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the firſt letter, he ſent me word where he had pawned twenty pieces of fine Holland for thirty pounds, of which I made one hundred, with which, and all that I had carried off myſelf, and what money I had, I could not make above five hundred pounds, and what was worſe a tho I had no children by him I was a widow bewitched, had a huſband and no huſband, and I could not pretend to marry again tho I was ſure my huſband durſt never ſee England again; and beſides, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that if the creditors could have found me, they would ſeize me, till I delivered up what I carried off, which made me take ſhelter in a private place in the mint, where I went in the habit of a widow, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my name to that of Flanders.</p>

            <p>It was often matter of wonder to ſee men, whoſe families were objects of their own error and others char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity endeavouring to drown their ſorrow in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it is none of my talent to preach, this place was ever too wicked for me, there was ſomething hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid in their way of ſinning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I was not wicked enough, as yet, for this ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and finding that I began daily to waſte, I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be gone, but where, I did not know, till getting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

with a good ſort of a woman, whoſe huſband had been a ſea captain, but loſing his ſhip and cargo, was forced to take ſhelter in that place: ſhe invited me to go home with her, where ſhe told me I might live privately enough, and it was twenty to one but I might marry ſome rich ſea-captain or other; which I readily accepted of, and was with her half a year; but what ſhe propoſed to me happened to herſelf, and I found noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two or three boatſwains, or ſuch fellows, that courted me in that part, for the captains ſeldom marry any, but ſuch as have fortunes, or thoſe who have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are owners of ſhips, neither of which was my caſe, and ſo I was likely ſo lie on hand, beſide I found that little I had daily grew leſs.</p>
            <p>I ſoon perceived that love had no ſhare in this part of the world, and that wit, beauty, good humour or any thing, without money, had no power to recommend; and that money would make any deformity in a wiſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though not in a miſtreſs, and as the market run all on the men's ſide, it was a favor for a woman to have the queſtion, if the dared to ſay no, ſhe would never have an opportunity of denying again; beſides, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that men made no ſcruple of going a fortune <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I endeavored to fortify her mind againſt taking it to heart, and told her there were a hundred ways for a woman to be revenged on a man who uſed her ill; which pleaſed her very much, and ſhe told me ſhe would be very glad I would either put her in a way to recover him, and make him ſenſible of his ill uſage, or to have the ſatisfaction of a revenge as public as poſſible.</p>

I told her then, that as he had reported among the ladies he had left her, the way to recover him, which I found ſhe was deſirous to do, was to report that ſhe had enquired into his circumſtances, and found he was not ſo good a man as he pretended to be, or as ſhe expected, and that he was of an ill temper, and made it his buſineſs in all companies to degrade the ladies of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that he was a debauched follow, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was true, yet I did not find that ſhe liked him the worſe for it. This advice worked upon her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and took beyond expectation, for ſhe wanted not her agents to publiſh it abroad, neither was ſhe wanting to do it herſelf wherever ſhe came, ſo that it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the chat of the tea-table over all that part of the town: and to help her at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> it, it would bring in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, which I told him was too much for one of my fortune, and that he would do better to marry a lady of that country; he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he did not aſk me what my fortune was, becauſe at firſt he told me he never would, but that he would never go to Virginia without my conſent, or deſire me to go unleſs I were willing.

            <p>In ſhort we were married, and he proved the beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured man that ever woman had; but his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were not ſo good as I imagined, and he did not better himſelf much by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We had not been married above a fortnight before I thought it time to diſcover to him my little ſtock which I did not know how to bring about, but one day I ſaid to him in the midſt of our amours, my dear, I wonder you never aſk me after my portion, your time for that, child, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

no body to blame but myſelf. That's ſo generous, ſaid I, that my not having more is a double affliction to me. The leſs you have, ſaid he, ſmiling, is the worſe for us both; but I hope you don't think I ſhall be unkind to you upon that account; perhaps I may tell the captain he has cheated me, but I ſhall never ſay ſo to you. Well, ſaid I, my dear, you cannot ſay I have cheated you; but to ſatisfy you I am not ſo poor as you might imagine, here is two hundred pounds in bank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> telling him there was ſomething for him, and that not all, which was doubly welcome, becauſe he owned he expected nothing, and in two or three days more I brought him home a hundred pounds more in gold, and in a week after I fetched him two hundred pounds more; and now, my dear, ſaid I, I am ſorry to tell you I have given you my all. I added, that I had loſt five hundreds in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's hands, with whom I had entruſted it; which ſo obliged him, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it very thankfully. By which management you ſee how I got over the fraud of paſſing for a fortune, which I take to be one of the moſt dangerous ſteps a woman can take, becauſe ſhe runs the hazard of being ill uſed afterwards.</p>
            <p>My huſband finding his return from his plantations not to anſwer his expectations, any more than my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, diſcovered his inclinations to go to look after them, which I readily agreed to and told him to make him amends for his diſappointment in my fortune, I would willingly go along with him. At which he ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand kind things to me, aſſuring me, that tho he was diſappointed in the expectations of a fortune, he was not in that of a wife.</p>
            <p>In ſhort we agreed to go, and he told me he had a very good houſe well furniſhed, in which his mother then lived, but ſhe would remove to another plantation which was to be his after her deceaſe; which was all true. In our paſſage, we met with two terrible ſtorms, and a pirate who took away moſt of our proviſions, and what was worſe, had like to have taken away my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but at length we arrived in York river, and were received with all the tokens of affection by his mother,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:049057_0029_10264D74A17A2CD8"/>
with whom we lived ſome time very comfortably, for ſhe was a good ſort of a woman, and I would not let her go to another plantation, for ſhe uſed to divert me with abundance of ſtories, as well of the country as the people; among the reſt, ſhe told me how the colony came at firſt to be inhabited; and ſaid, the people were originally ſuch as are brought over by maſters of ſhips to be ſold as ſervants, or felons that are tranſported, amongſt whom we make no difference, ſaid ſhe, they work together in the field and when their time is out, they have land to form a plantation given them for themſelves: hence child, ſaid ſhe, many a Newgate Bird becomes a great man, and ſeveral of our juſtices have been burnt in the hand, and indeed ſaid ſhe, I was one of them myſelf, for being too buſy with what was none of my own, I was convicted a criminal, and here, ſaid ſhe, is the mark of it, ſhewing me her hand. This made me enquire more particularly into her own caſe who frankly told me, that her mother uſing to ſend her often abroad, ſhe had fallen into very ill company at London in her youthful days, for which ſhe was ſent to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and condemned to die, but pleading pregnancy, ſhe was ordered for tranſportation, and forced to leave her child, who, ſaid ſhe, with tears in her eyes, I fear was ſoon ſtarved to death, for that Newgate is a miſerable place, and breeds more rogues and thieves than all the clubs of villains in the land, and then ſhe went on in ſo particular a manner, that I began to be very uneaſy, but when ſhe came to tell her name, I thought I ſhould have ſunk down in the earth, which ſhe eaſily perceived, and aſked me if I were not well: I told her I was ſo affected with her melancholy ſtory, that it had ſomewhat diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me, why, ſaid ſhe, my dear, theſe things were long before your time, and I look back on them with pleaſure. And then ſhe goes on, and tells how ſhe came to marry her maſter, by whom ſhe had my huſband; to which I did not give much attention becauſe I wanted to retire and give vent to my paſſion, which you may imagine was very great when I concluded this muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be my mother, and I had now two children, and was with the third by my brother.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:049057_0030_10264D7653A46588"/>
I leave it to any one to judge what difficulties I was in; if I diſcovered it, I could expect nothing leſs than to loſe my huſband, for he was too honeſt a man to lie with his ſiſter; and on the other hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the mean time, my huſband grew jealous, without any other reaſon but that I was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He uſed all his rhetoric to perſuade me to the contrary, but all in vain; for he was become ſo loathſome to me, that I would not let him touch me in bed, which at laſt put him ſo out of humour, that he reſolved I ſhould not go to England, ſaying, it would unhinge his affairs, and ruin the whole family, which touched me very much; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he knew nothing of the reaſons that prompted me to take ſuch meaſures.</p>
            <p>Many ſay, it is impoſſible to make a woman change her mind, when once ſhe is ſet upon a thing, and ſo it was with me, which provoked my huſband ſo far, that he called me the moſt unnatural woman in the world, to leave a huſband, and what was worſe, two children, with a deſign never to ſee them more. About this we had ſeveral family quarrels, which at laſt grew to ſuch a height, that we both did what we could to provoke one another, till at length I refuſed to bed with him, which ſo enraged him, that he told me I was mad, and that he would have me in a mad-houſe, which ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me, that I reſolved to lay open my whole caſe, but to whom I did not know: however, the next quarrel, I told him enough to make him uneaſy as well as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that as for my behaviour towards him and my

            <p>Firſt I rehearſed her own ſtory, and her London names, and that my trouble was all upon that account, and then I told her my own name and aſſured her that I could be no other, than her daughter born in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who had ſaved her front the gallows by being in her, and in what manner ſhe left me when ſhe was tranſported.</p>
            <p>Unhappy child, ſaid ſhe, what deſtiny brought thee hither? and to be my ſon's wife, we are all undone and thus ſhe run on a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhould offer to diſcover it to my huſband, and that if I would do ſo, ſhe would leave me all ſhe had at her death; which I told her was impoſſible, and aſked her how ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>A length I reſolved that I would tell him of it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which put my mother in a ſad fright, but ſaid I, I will do it when he is in a good humour, ſo that I did not queſtion ſucceeding; as we might part with conſent, and both ſtill love as brother and ſiſter, though he could not as huſband and wife.</p>
            <p>All this while my huſband was very uneaſy to know what I meant by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I told him I was glad to hear him ſay ſo, and if he would promiſe me one thing I would diſcover it, tho' it was the moſt againſt my inclinations of any thing in the world.

            <p>We were all in a very deplorable condition, and my love to him began to revive at firſt, but it threw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep melancholy, and had likely to have coſt him his life, which made me importune him to let me go to England, as the only mean to recover his health, and make us both eaſy; which at length he agreed to, and gave me a very good cargo to bear the expence of my voyage.</p>

We agreed, before we parted, that ſome time after I arrived, he ſhould pretend to have an account that I was dead, and that he might marry again when he would, and he pomiſed to aſſiſt me, as long as he lived, and if he died before me, he would leave ſufficient to take care of me, which indeed he did.</p>
            <p>In two and thirty days I arrived in England, and had a pretty good voyage, meeting with but one or two ſtorms, and thoſe on the coaſts or Ireland.</p>
            <p>I had now a new ſcene of life upon my hands, and not above three hundred pounds in the world that I was ſure of, and not a friend in the world to adviſe with me; but buſineſs calling me to Briſtol, where the ſhip was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded, I determined, afterwards to go to the Bath, where ſomething I thought might offer, which I did not foreſee, for I had ſtill a gaiety in my temper, tho' no fortune to ſupport it, where I ſtayed the ſeaſon, and contracted ſome unhappy acquaintance, which rather promoted the follies I fell afterwards into, than fortified me againſt them.</p>
            <p>I got acquainted with a woman, in whoſe houſe I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who was not one of the beſt, though ſhe did not keep a bad houſe, where there was a gentleman lodged, who always ſingled me out for the diverſion of my company, and his converſation, I confeſs, was as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, as mine could be to him, and there was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but modeſty for a long time paſs'd between us; he would indeed frequently come into my chamber, even when I was in bed, yet he never offered any thing to me further than a kiſs, of which I frequently took notice to my landlady; and ſhe anſwered me that he was a man of ſtrict honor and very good eſtate, and therefore I ought to oblige him, for it was my intereſt ſo to do. I anſwered I had never told him how my circumſtances were; Oh! then, ſaid ſhe, I will for I had let her in part know how my condition ſtood, which ſhe did ſoon after, and the next time we met he earneſtly enquired how I lived, and whether I did not want money? I told him not as yet; for altho' my cargo was damaged in the ſtorm, yet it was not quite loſt, and that I hoped I ſhould make it hold out till more was come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:049057_0035_10264D82434B4EB8"/>
Not long after he attacked me again, and aſſured me he enquired into my condition, for no deſire to ſatisfy his own curioſity, but to aſſiſt me if there were occaſion; and that if at any time I ſhould find myſelf ſtreightned, he begged I would be ſo kind as to let him know, and I ſhould always find a friend of him; but yet I could not do it, though I was glad of his offer, I muſt own.</p>
            <p>In a little time my landlady, unknown to me came into the room, when we were both together, crying out, O widow, I have bad news to tell you, the virginia fleet is taken by the French, and the man you ſent to Briſtol for money is come back without it. I cannot help that, ſaid I, I have about twenty guineas left, and I will pay you preſently.</p>
            <p>The next morning he began to talk of it again, and ſaid he had heard the ſame at the coffee-houſe, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why I would not accept of a ſmall matter from him, when I had promiſed him otherwiſe. I anſwered that I was ſurpriſed why my landlady ſhould ſo expoſe me, but I imagined it was for a ſmall matter that I owed her, which was about eight guineas, which I had paid her, and would have done with her very ſoon.</p>
            <p>Not ſo, madam, ſaid he, firſt take this key and open that walnut-tree box, and bring me hither the drawer, which I ſoon did, and I believe there might be in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred guineas; now ſaid he, take out a handful for your pains, which I refuſing, he held my hand and made me do it; and now, ſaid he, go and count them in your chamber, which I did, and with what I had of my own, they made up in all fifty gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, he began every day to find fault with my cloth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, laces, and head-dreſſes, and preſſed me, to buy better, which I was willing enough to do, tho' I did not ſeem ſo to him; but he ſtill preſſing me to do it, I told him I could not afford it till I had paid him what I owed him; at which he ſaid ſmilingly, he had not lent me the money, but given it me, which was the leaſt he ought to do for my agreeable company.</p>
            <p>In about three months the company began to go off, and he talked of going ſoon, and was very deſirous to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:049057_0036_10264D86F3AF27C8"/>
have me along with him, which I did not care to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did not know how he might uſe me, but before he went, he was taken very ill of a fever for five weeks, all which time I looked after him as carefully as if I had been his wife, and after ſome time he grew better, when he made me a preſent of fifty guineas more for ſaving his life, as he called it, making the deepeſt proteſtations of his reſpect for me in the world, and that he would take another opportunity to give me an undoubted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it.</p>
            <p>A little after, I had occaſion to go to Briſtol, where he accompanied me, when it was our chance to lye in an inn, where all the lodgings were taken up, except, one room which had two beds in it, but a very great curtain drew between them, which troubled us both very much I but ſeeing it could not be helped, my friend bade me go to bed firſt, and he would come afterwards to his bed; and ſo he did, where we lay talking together a great while, till ſtarting from his bed on a ſudden he comes to me, and bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me not be concerned, for he would aſk nothing immodeſt, and indeed he did not, for we lay all night together as innocently as children, altho, he was a vigorous briſk man, and I cannot ſay for my part that I ſhould have made much reſiſtance had he made any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>At our return to the Bath, he lay with me almoſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery night, and although we had mutual embraces every time, and always ſlept in one another's arms, yet he nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er offered any thing further; this he mightily valued himſelf for, yet I cannot ſay I ſo much liked it, till one night as we were in bed pretty merry, having drunken a little more than uſual, being claſped cloſely in his arms, I told him I could find in my heart to diſcharge him of his engagement for one night and no more.</p>
            <p>He took me at my word, and after this we were one as willing as the other; for this reaſon I exchanged the name of a friend for that deteſtable name of a Miſs. In the morning we looked ſtrangely at one another, and both ſeemed to be ſorry for what we had done, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a week before we were ſo free as uſual with one another. I could not forbear bluſhing, whenever I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:049057_0037_10264D8883C001B8"/>
was with him, and he looked as if he were frightened, till one night I aſked him, what if I ſhould be with child! he bade me not be frightened at that, for he would take care of the child and me, which hardened us both ſo much, that we repeated the crime every night, and in a little time it ſo happened that I was with child, and when I was certain of it, I propoſed truſting the ſecret to my landlady, who ſaid ſhe knew it would come to that at laſt, and made us very merry about it that evening.</p>
            <p>When I grew near my time, ſhe adviſed him to go to London, and then acquainted the pariſh officers that there was a lady ready to lye in at her houſe, but ſhe was a woman of faſhion, and that ſhe knew her huſband very well, which ſatisfied them; and I lay in, in as much ſtate as if I had really been a lady, having many of the beſt in the town at my labour.</p>
            <p>My gentleman allowed me very handſomely, and I was as ſparing as poſſible in my expences, ſo that I ſaved nearly one hundred pounds in my lying in. I had alſo a fine boy, which as ſoon as he heard, he wrote a very obliging letter to me, and adviſed me to come to London as ſoon as I was able, and he would take a lodging for me at Hammerſmith, which I liked very well; and accordingly I took coach for myſelf, child, nurſe and maidſervant, he meeting us at Rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he took me in his own chariot, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us all to my new lodgings at Hammerſmith.</p>
            <p>And now I wanted nothing to make me happy but to be a wife, which I knew could not be, for he had a wife already, but ſhe was mad, I therefore laid up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a rainy day what I could, knowing very well that kept miſtreſſes, like old cloths, are thrown away when they are done with: However, I lived ſix years with him, and in that time I had three fine children by him but only the firſt lived. At length I was ſurprized with a very melancholy letter from him, intimating, that he was very ill, and that he was afraid he ſhould have another fit of ſickneſs but that he being in the houſe with his wife's relations, it was not poſſible for me to come to him, which he deſired very much.</p>
            <p>I was very much concerned at this account, you may
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:049057_0038_10264D8B2C1C6390"/>
be ſure, and I was every day impatient to know how he did, hearing nothing further from him for about a month, I diſguiſed myſelf like a ſervant maid in a round cap, and went to his houſe, and ſaid my maſter and miſtreſs ſent to know how he did; where under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the doctors ſaid they had but little hopes of him, I began to conſider that it was well that I had ſaved ſomething while he was alive to maintain me and my ſon.</p>
            <p>This was ſad news, no doubt; however, I did not ceaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I was now free from all obligations: a wife or a miſtreſs, except to the linen draper, whom I had never heard of nor my huſband, or father brother at Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, when I received, after a long expectation, a return of ſome goods from my brother, but upon condition of ſigning a general releaſe, which I promiſed to do, but having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0l. with which I had the world to begin again; but what was my greateſt misfortune, I was not the ſame woman as formerly, but now ſomething old.</p>
            <p>I thought upon ſeveral ways to ſet me off, but noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would offer, till at length a new ſcene opened. There was in the houſe where I lodged a North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentlewoman, who was talking to me of the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her country till at length ſhe tempted me to promiſe to go and live with her in the country, telling her, that altho' I had enough to live on, yet I found London was an extravagant place, and I did not much care for it.</p>
            <p>Before I went, it came into my mind to go to the bank, where I had often been to receive the intereſt of ſome bill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and adviſe with one of the clerks, who always was very ready to ſerve me; but when I told him what my buſineſs was, he aſſured me, be could not do it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to himſelf, but that he would recommend me to

a gentleman whom he could be anſwerable for and was always well pleaſed to do ſuch acts of charity.</p>
            <p>I anſwered I would rather have depended on him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had found him honeſt, but if that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns, but that he himſelf was obliged, by virtue of that place, not to meddle with any buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I no ſooner ſaw his friend, than I was ſatisfied he was a very honeſt man by his looks, and to whom I told my circumſtances at large, how that I was a widow, newly came from America, and had a little money, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> little and was afraid to loſe it having no friend to adviſe with, and that I was going to the North of England to live cheaply.</p>
            <p>He told me, that I might lodge the money in the bank on account, which would entitle me to the money at any time, but then it would be eſteemed as running caſh, or that I might buy ſtock with it, but if I wanted to diſpoſe of it at any time, I muſt come to town to transfer it or elſe I might enter it in ſome friend's name, and he might receive it for me; and then ſaid, ſmiling, madam, why don't you get an honeſt ſteward that might take you and your money together! That, ſaid I, is more difficult than the other, ſaid he, he had a wife, or elſe he ſhould have been very glad of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for, ſaith he, I have a wife and no wife, and it would be no ſin to hang her, for ſhe is a w—e.</p>

               </gap>ented cuckold, though I cannot rid my hands of her as yet. I begun to wave the diſcourſe and talk of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but I found he could not have done with it but went on, and told me, how that his buſineſs called him out of England, and that ſhe in the mean time had two children by an officer in the army, and that on her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

he took her again and maintained her very well, till ſhe ran away with a linen draper, and robbed him of what ſhe could come at: and now madam, ſaid he, ſince you come to aſk advice, let me aſk yours.</p>
            <p>Alas ſir, ſaid I, 'tis a nice caſe that ſince ſhe is run away, you are well off I think: however you may get a divorce if you think fit, and then marry another. Will you take me, madam ſaid he. I cannot tell, ſaid I, your caſe ſeems worſe than mine, although the queſtion pleaſed me better than any thing he had ſaid before, however, I knew the way to ſecure him was to ſtand off, and that it was time enough to accept it when he was able to perform it; upon which he broke off, and he made me promiſe to come the next day, which I did; and brought my maid with me, to let him ſee that I kept a maid, whom he deſired me, to ſend home, and he would wait on me in a coach by myſelf—which I did not much care for, for fear he ſhould enquire into my character.</p>
            <p>He provided a handſome ſupper for me, and then began to talk of love and preſſed me to drink a glaſs or two of wine, and deſired me to give him leave to make a propoſal; which I ſaid I was willing to hear, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it were honorable. Why ſaid he, it is to marry me, and to convince me that he meant honorably he would not live with me, or go to bed to me, till the divorce was obtained.</p>
            <p>I declared the motion unfair, with ſome warmth, and told him there could be nothing in it, but to entangle us both in greater difficulties; but that if he did get a divorce, I did not know what I might ſay, or he could not expect that I ſhould ſay yes, at firſt aſking, beſides I never did imagine that he had any ſuch deſign.</p>
            <p>He preſſed me to give him a promiſe, which I would not before I had ſeen the iſſue of my journey in the North, wherein my friend had promiſed me great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but I told him, as a pledge of my ſincerity, I had entruſted him with almoſt my all, and as ſoon as he had ſued out the divorce, if he would ſend me an account of it, I would come up to London, and—then we would talk more of the matter.</p>

It was a baſe deſign in me, I confeſs, and it proved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. I went with my friend (as I called her) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Lancaſhire, who all the way down treated me with a great deal of good manners, and her brother in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's coach met us at Warrington, and from thence carried us to Liverpool, where we were entertained at a merchant's houſe three or four days, and then her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as ſhe called him, ſent a coach and four; which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us to a gentleman's ſeat forty miles further, where I was nobly entertained; but I diſcovered they were all Roman Catholics, which did not in the leaſt alter their behaviour to me, altho the ladies ſoon found I was not of their religion.</p>
            <p>I ſtayed here about ſix weeks and then we returned to a village near Liverpool, where her brother, as ſhe called him, met us in his own chariot with two footman, and carried us to his own houſe, where I had not been long before he began to make love to me, his pretended ſiſter telling him I was a great fortune, and he paſſed for a gentleman of a thouſand pounds a year in Ireland. I cannot ſay but to outward appearance he was a fine gentleman, and talked as naturally of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Nor have I any eſtate, my dear, ſaid he, for what little I had, this devil has made me run it out in putting me into this equipage. At this I was confounded as much as he and thought I had the worſt of it by far, telling him, if I had a fortune I found I had been cheated, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I told him it was very unhappy, that ſo much love and ſo much good nature as I diſcovered in him, ſhould be thus precipitated into miſery, and that what little I had, was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to relieve us a week; and with that I pulled out a bankbill of twenty pounds, which with elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en guineas I had in my pocket, I thought would have maintained me two or three years, which if it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me, I told him I was left deſtitute; however, there it was at his ſervice.</p>
            <p>He told me, that he ſcorned to make me miserable, and that he had fifty pounds left, and throwing it down on the table bade me take it, tho he ſhould ſtarve. I returned him thanks, and told him I was willing to ſtarve with him. He begged of me not to expreſs ſo much kindneſs, for that would make him diſtracted; but ſaid he, my dear, tell me if you have any money at all, I told him I had the bank-bill and eleven guineas, thinking it proper to conceal the reſt, for I would have been rid of him at any rate.</p>
            <p>He ſhook his head, and remained ſilent ſome time, and after a pauſe he ſaid, my dear, tho the caſe is bad, it is to no purpoſe to be dejected, I will endeavor to find out ſame way or other to live, and then thinking

We had a great deal of talk that night, and he propoſed many ways, but came to no reſolution, till at laſt he took a huſband's leave of me, and then fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.</p>
            <p>He roſe betime in the morning, and left me aſleep, taking with him his ſervants, horſes, and baggage, and upon the table I found the following letter, which when I had read, I thought I ſhould have fallen down dead.</p>

            <p>Nothing ever made ſo great an impreſſion upon me as this letter, and more when I found in my pocket ten guineas, a gold watch, a diamond ring, and a plain one, upon which I could not forbear looking above two hours, till my maid came and told me dinner was ready, but I could not eat any thing you may be ſure: After it was over, I fell a crying. O Jemmy, come back, I'll beg, I'll ſtarve with you, when to my ſurprize, he comes

back in the evening, but without any ſervant, and I not knowing what could be the occaſion of it, aſked him how he could be ſo unkind to leave me, and whether he did not hear me call him to come back again, which he ſaid he did about ten miles off, upon Delamare foreſt, and that was the reaſon of his coming back, believing it would be very melancholy for me to travel to London alone, and that he might as well go that way as any other, ſaying he had diſmiſſed his ſervants, and that they were in a happier caſe than himſelf, for they could get places when he might be in a goal.</p>
            <p>Two days after this we quitted Cheſter, I in a ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coach, and he on horſeback, leaving my maid behind me, and he came with me as far as Dunſtable, within thirty miles of London, and there he told me he muſt leave me, for he durſt go no further; I told him if it were ſo, I deſired he would ſtay a week or two in that town, which, he readily agreed to; then calling the landlady, he told her his wife was taken ill, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whether ſhe could not get us a lodging in the town for two or three nights, till I had recovered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which ſhe willingly agreed to and indeed I liked the room very well, and the people of the inn as well, ſo we paid the coach and took out our baggage, and then told him I would live with him there till I had ſpent our money, which with a great deal of difficulty at length I brought him to agree to, and we ſtayed here about a month, in which time he let me into part of his own life which was very ſurprizing, and full of variety, and of which I ſhall give a full account hereafter.</p>
            <p>We parted at lad, with great reluctance on both ſides, for I found by what he ſaid, that he durſt not come to London, and the next day I came to St. Jones's in Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon well, a private place where no body knew me; but being a ſtranger, I did not know where to lye in, for I grew big, and people in the houſe taking notice of it, intimated that I muſt think of removing, which troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me ſo much that I grew ill, and my melancholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my diſtemper, ſo that the miſtreſs of the houſe propoſed to ſend for a midwife, which ſhe did, who, told her, ſhe believed that my condition was pretty much in
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:049057_0046_10264DA2F2A26AE8"/>
her way; but I did not underſtand at firſt, what ſhe meant: but the midwife ſoon informed me, and ſaid ſhe believed I was under ſome circumſtances that rendered my lying in difficult, and that if I pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to her, ſhe would ſoon make all eaſy, which put new life into me, and I found my blood began to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate immediately.</p>
            <p>I was too ſenſible of the want I had of ſuch a friend, not to return her thanks for her kind offers, but I aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her I had a huſband, tho he could not appear pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly thro misfortunes; at which ſhe preſently took me up, and ſaid that was none of her buſineſs to enquire into, ſaying, all the ladies that came under her care were married women to her; if you dare truſt yourſelf in my hands, ſaid ſhe, I live in ſuch a place, and I have already given ſecurity to the pariſh, to ſecure them from any charge that ſhall happen under my roof; and I have only one queſtion further to aſk,—which is, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you have money? I anſwered, I thanked God I did not want for that, tho I did not much abound in it. Why then, ſaid ſhe, you are happy, for without that nothing can be done: and to ſatisfy you I will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on you, you ſhall know the whole charges before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. I told her that was very fair, but that as I had not over much money, I begged ſhe'd be as reaſonable as poſſible, which ſhe ſaid ſhe would, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would give me an account of the expences in two or three ſhapes which were as follows:

            <p>I looked upon the bills, and telling her I could not ſay but the bills were very reaſonable: but that I was ſorry to tell her, I feared I muſt be her loweſt cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. With all my heart, ſaid ſhe, I have ten to one as many of them as the other; and then, ſaid ſhe, if the child be dead born, or ſhould not live, you ſave the

            <p>I told her I would be her cuſtomer, but as I had two months to go, I might perhaps ſtay with her longer than three months, and deſired to know if ſhe would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper, which ſhe ſaid ſhe never did upon any account whatever; and then looking about, ſhe began to find fault with my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and ſaid I might remove as ſoon as I pleaſed.</p>
            <p>I quitted my lodgings at St. Jones's, and went to my new governeſs's where I was well looked after, and I underſtood that ſhe had about twelve ladies of pleaſure under her care at that time, and about thirty abroad. But before I was delivered, I received a letter from my truſtee at the bank, full of obliging things, and preſſing me to come to London, which was ſent from Liverpool, as I had ordered; to which I returned an anſwer, and dated it at Liverpool, but ſent it by a meſſenger, as if it came by a friend to town, wherein I gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how glad I was, that he had obtained a divorce, but I queſtioned the lawfulneſs of his marrying again, notwithſtanding, I would be in London in three months at farthereſt.</p>
            <p>I was brought to bed a little after receiving this letter, and then I received another from him, wherein he aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that his wife having a remorſe of conſcience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the divorce was obtained, had deſtroyed herſelf; and altho' he was concerned at her diſaſter, yet he had no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But then there was this difficulty, which was the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thy child, which grieved me very much, but this was ſoon removed, for it died within the month. Now I began to write to my friend in a more kind man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſent him word, that I deſigned to be in town in a month, which he deſired to be informed, becauſe he would come two days journey to meet me, which puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled me more than the other; till at laſt it came into my mind to go into the country, which would not only blind my old governeſs, but cover all my other affairs, for ſhe did not know, whether my lover lived in London or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire; and ſo taking a place in the ſtage-coach to Weſt Cheſter, where I had no manner of buſineſs but only to conceal my having been in London, I went down, and next week I took a place in another ſtage-coach for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſent him word I ſhould be up ſuch a night, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of which, he met me according to prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe at Brickhill.</p>

            <p>I had two children by him, and was left in a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, for I was now forty eight years old, and the time was over with me ever to be courted for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I cannot ſay but this execrable deed did ſometimes trouble me, but I grew harden'd and paſt any remorſe of conſcience.</p>

            <p>The Barthelomew following I went to the cloiſters, and fell into one of the raffling-ſhops, where I met with a gentleman well dreſt and very rich, who ſingled me out, and told he would put in for me to raffle, and I getting a muff, he preſented it to me, and continued

talking to me very reſpectfully, till at length drew me out to walk in the cloiſter, with him, where he told me he was charmed with my company, and aſked me if I durſt truſt myſelf in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He carried me to ſpring-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Knightforidge, where we drank very freely, and by that time we got to London it was nearly ten o'clock at night, when we ſtopt at a houſe wherein he was acquainted, and they made to ſcruple to ſhew us up ſtairs into a room with a bed in it. Here he began to be a little free with me, and I by little and little yielded to every thing, till he did what he pleaſed with me, and about one o'clock, he drinking freely all the while we went into the coach again, where he was for doing what he had done before; but I finding him in drink, thought my game ſecure, and bade him ſit ſtill a little, which he did, and in a minute fell aſleep, which I no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than I took his gold watch, a ſilk purſe of gold, and a ſnuff-box, and gently opening the door, got away and came home to my governeſs; with whom I then lodged, telling her what I had done, which pleaſed her wonderfully, ſaying child, this uſage may, for ought I know, reform this gentleman more than all the ſermons he ever heard in his life.</p>
            <p>Another time I placed myſelf at a ware houſe by the water ſide, where comes a young fellow with a letter, and wanted a box and a hamper that came from New-caſtle upon Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this I had many adventures, and ſome of them proved very fortunate; but at length as when doth the pitcher come ſafely home that goes ſo often to the well, I met with an unlucky accident which did me no good, altho I knew nothing of the matter.

In which time the ſervants uſed me very fancily tho the conſtable was by, whom I deſired to let me ſend for my friends, which he would not agree to, till I came before a juſtice: With that I ſpoke aloud to the maſter of the ſhop, and ſaid, Sir, you know in your own conſcience that I am not the perſon, and why do you detain me then? which he ſaid he ſhould do as yet: I then ſaid to the conſtable and porter, he pleaſed to remember this; which hard-uſage to moved the conſtable, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to let me go, but he would not, although the conſtable told him, he was afraid he ſhould bring himſelf into trouble by it.

            <p>The next day I dreſſed myſelf up in quite different cloaths, and went to St. James's Park where I ſaw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:049057_0056_10264DBED9124A08"/>
of fine ladies walking in the Mall, and among them a little miſs, twelve or thirteen years old, with a ſiſter about nine, who I obſerved had a gold watch on, and a necklace of pearl; and obſerving the footman to ſtop at going into the Mall, I ſtept up to him, and made myſelf acquainted with the whole family; and then put myſelf in rank with the young ladies, whom I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by name, and aſked her when ſhe heard from her father, and when her mother wou'd be in town, and how they did; and a thouſand ſuch impertinent queſtions, when on a ſudden the guards came, and a crowd ran to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the king go to the parliament-houſe: and among them lady Betty and her ſiſter; and lifting the little one up in my arms, that ſhe might be high enough to ſee, I conveyed the watch ſo clean from her that ſhe never miſſed it, till ſhe got into the middle of the Mall, and was carried away in the crowd, while I got into St. James's, where I took coach and made off.</p>
            <p>I am now drawing towards a new variety of life: in three days after, I ventured into a factor's houſe, where I ſaw the doors open and all things ſafe ſeeing no body in it, where I took up two pieces of flowered ſilk, very rich; but as quickly as I was going out I was attacked by two wenches, who came to me open mouthed and ſhutting the door called the maſter and miſtreſs, to whom I gave very good words, and told them it was my firſt act and being poor, it was a temptation to me to find the door open, which moved the miſtreſs to compaſſion; but the maſter grew outrageous, and ſent for a conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ſight of which ſtruck me with horror, ſo that I thought I ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I offered to pay for the pieces, whatever the value was, but all wou'd not do. I was carried before a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrate, and committed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

crowd of afflictions that I ſaw there, joined together to make the place ſeem an emblem of hell itſelf, or a kind of entrance into it.</p>
            <p>Then I repented of all my life paſt, but it yielded me no ſatisfaction, no peace, becauſe it was repenting after the power of ſinning was taken away; and was peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, not that I had ſinned, but that I was to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And what added to my afflictions, were the revilings of thoſe hardened wretches that were there before me; ſcoffing, what Mrs. Flanders catched in the trap at laſt, ſurely the devil had helped me, or I had been in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate long before. Then they welcomed me to the place, and then called for brandy, and drank to me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurely I had money, tho they had none.</p>
            <p>But nothing could expreſs the amazement and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize I was in. when the firſt man that came out I knew to be my Lancaſhire huſband, the very ſame with whom I lived ſo well at Dunſtable and the ſame whom I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſaw at Brickhill, when I was married to my laſt huſband.</p>
            <p>I was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>auck dumb at the ſight of him, and knew nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what to ſay, nor what to do; but returning, I cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vehemently for a great while; my own caſe gave me no diſturbance, in compariſon with his: Oh! ſaid I, how many poor people have I made miſerable? How many wretches have I ſent to the devil? And this misfortune I placed all to my account, reproaching myſelf for it.</p>
            <p>While I was under theſe influences of ſorrow for him, came notice to me, that the next ſeſſions I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be tried for my life at the Old-Baily, which ſoon abated the hardened ſpirit I had acquired by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Newgate: and I became dejected to the laſt degree, ſending for my old governeſs who, to give her her due, left no ſtone unturned to prevent the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury's finding the bill, but it would not prevail. I could hear nothing about the priſon, but every one pitying me, and ſaying, Mrs. Flanders will be hanged; and at laſt one of the keepers came to me, and ſaid, Mrs. Flanders! What do you intend to do? you will be tried on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: I wont flatter you, I would have you prepare for death; for as you are an old offender, I doubt you will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:049057_0058_10264DC4CF3F9080"/>
find but little mercy. Which was ſuch a ſtab to me, that I could not ſpeak a word; and he left me in the greateſt confuſion imaginable.</p>
            <p>Well! there was no remedy. On Thurſday I was carried down to the ſeſſion to be arraigned for ſtealing two pieces of ſilk, value forty pounds, where I pleaded not guilty, the next day I was appointed to be tried, which, when it came on, I would have ſpoken, but they told me the witneſſes muſt be heard firſt, and then I ſhould have time to be heard. The witneſſes were a couple of hard-mouthed jades, for they aggravated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to the utmoſt; and although what they ſaid was true in fact, yet I inſiſted that they ſtopped me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was out of the houſe, and that I went in with a deſign to buy, but ſeeing no body in the houſe, I took them, and was going to the door to look at them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort I was found guilty of the felony, but acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the burglary, and the next day was carried down to receive the dreadful ſentence; when being aſked what I had to ſay, I told them, I had nothing to ſay but to beſpeak the mercy of the court, that I had broken no doors, had carried nothing off, and that the proſecutor having loſt nothing, had deſired mercy might be ſhewn me, and added alſo, that it was my firſt offence; all which I ſpoke in ſuch a pitiful tone, that it moved many in the court to pity.</p>
            <p>The judges were grave and mute, and gave me leave to ſay what I could, but at length one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence of death upon me, which was almoſt as bad as death itſelf.</p>
            <p>It is more eaſily to be imagined than expreſſed, what trouble I was in; I had nothing before me but death, and expected my name in the dead-warrant every day.</p>
            <p>In the mean time my governeſs ſent me miniſter who was a very good man indeed, and he exhorted me ſeriouſly to repent, and not dally any longer with my ſoul; which was the firſt time I felt any real ſigns of repentance, beginning to look back upon my paſt life which abhorrence, and have a view to eternity.

He viſited me again the next morning, and explained to me the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Twelve days after ſentence, we were ordered for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and my name was in the dead warrant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>About a month afterwards, there was a rumour that I ſhould be included in the dead warrant next ſeſſions; but through the induſtry and application of the good miniſter, it was changed to tranſportation, which was bad enough, but ſomething better than death and that day five weeks I went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When it was my turn to come up, I aſked one of the officers, if I might not be allowed to ſend a letter, to let my friends know where we lay, which the boatſwain told me very civily I might; and when the boat went off, he told me if I would give him the letter he would take care of it. I gave him the letter, and a ſhilling, which I took out of a purſe, in which I had a pretty deal of money, taking care to let him ſee it, which I found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, was no diſadvantage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He delivered my letter to my governeſs, and brought me back an anſwer, giving me the ſhilling again, and aſked me whether that gentlewoman were my ſiſter? I told him, no, but one of my beſt friends, and would give an hundred pounds to deliver me from this condition. Will ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In the mean time, my governeſs went to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſoon came to me, and brought me a ſea-bed and all its furniture, a ſea-cheſt, and what money I de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſigned to take with me, to redeem me when I came on ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I told her, I had made an agreement to go with him, if poſſible, and that when we came there, how we deſigned to plant, ſettle, and grow rich, without any more adventures; which pleaſed my governeſs very much, ſo that ſhe made it her buſineſs to get him deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in time.</p>
            <p>When my huſband came on board, he looked with a dejected countenance, but afterwards he began to be cheerful; and told me what money he had when he came to the priſon, but ſaid, the making of friends, and ſoliciting his caſe, had been expenſive; and that he had

but an hundred and eight pounds left which was in gold.</p>
            <p>I gave him an account of my ſtock then as faithfully, that is, what I had taken with me, which was 246l, ſo that we had 354l, between us; but a worſe gotten eſtate was never put together to begin the world with, it being all in money, an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the plantations.</p>
            <p>In this condition we ſet ſail from Bugby's hole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I went with a woman who was my guide, to enquire after him, as if I had only a deſire to ſee the country, and coming near the houſe, I aſked the woman, Whoſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetion that was? who anſwered, there's the gentleman who owns it, and his father with him.</p>
            <p>You may gueſs what a confuſion I was in, betwixt joy and grief, however, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>e from the ground; and to divert me, ſhe began to tell the ſtory. How that old gentleman going to England, fell in love with a young lady and married her, and brought her over to his mother, with whom ſhe lived ſeveral years, and had that young gentleman by her? but after ſome time, the daughter-in-law being very much ſurpriſed at ſomething the mother had told her and upon inquiry, finding ſhe was her daughter, would not live with him, but went away for England and had not ſince been heard of. This relation troubled me ſo much, that I could ſcarcely bear the hearing of it; but cheering up a little, aſked in what

circumſtances the old woman died, and to whom ſhe had left what ſhe had, who anſwered, that ſhe had left that plantation to her daughter, if ever ſhe could be heard of; which was good news enough for me, and I was ſatisfied with this account But it was ſome time before I could reſolve on making myſelf known; but knowing that there was no other way of recovering the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I at length ſent a meſſage with a letter to my brother, diſcovering who I was, and deſiring to ſee my ſon; but my brother not being at home, his ſon opened and read it; and taking a horſe and ſervant, came with a meſſenger to the place where I was, which was about ſeven miles off.</p>
            <p>I cannot expreſs the joy of my ſoul, when I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound that he came not as a ſtranger, but a ſon, and a ſon who had never before known what a mother of his own was. After our mutual embraces, he told me that what his grand-mother had left me was in his hands, and that he would do me juſtice to my full ſatisfaction; that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had become very infirm, and that he would leave to me either to diſcover myſelf to him or let it be ſtill a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p>We then ſettled on a plantation near his own, where he provided for me with great care, calling me his aunt; and here I lived ſo happily, that I began to wiſh I had not brought my Lancaſhire huſband with me from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But we went on proſperouſly for a long time, and managed our plantation very well, until my huſband di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and my brother dying the ſame year, I went to live with my ſon, willing to him the plantation, which his grand-mother willed to me.</p>
            <p>And now being on the laſt ſtage of my life, I began ſeriouſly to reflect on the paſt follies and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And although I often felt the ſtings of conſcience, and the keeneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, for many years, yet by a ſincere repentance I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the forgiveneſs of God, and cloſe my life entirely reſigned to his holy will.</p>
