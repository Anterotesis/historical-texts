            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> near 50 years ago, in anſwer to one <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yan,</hi> who it ſeems had writ that the <hi>Quakers deni'd the man Chriſt without them, and owned him no otherwiſe than as he is within:</hi> [an ancient miſtake, or worſe] It ſeems it was that becauſe our friends were raiſed up to direct people (as John did) to the needful and and Ancient doctrine of <hi>the Light of Chriſt within, that all through it might believe.</hi> John 1: 7.

Again, <hi>Bunyan</hi> having ſaid that we perſwade Souls not to <hi>believe that that man that was Crucified and roſe again &amp;c: ſhall ſo come again to judgment as he went away &amp;c: Edward Burrough</hi> Anſwers <q>Oh how ſwiftly thy Tongue runs without fear, for in the Affirmative I further ſay, that that Chriſt Jeſus that was Crucified, and roſe

            </p>
            <p>Again in pa: 285. ſaith he, <q>there is not many Chriſts, but one Chriſt, which is not only within but without, not only without but within; But is all, and in all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in Teſtimony for the man Chriſt Jeſus, page 4. near 30 years ago, our Friends ſay, that <q>the ſame man Chriſt Jeſus that ſuffered, and was put to death in the fleſh, and raiſed from the dead by the mighty power of God, aſcended into heaven God's dwelling place.</q> Again page 7, <q>The ſame body that was put to death, was raiſed by the power of God, &amp; was a real Body, really ſeen both before and after the Reſurrection, &amp; at the Aſcention; as alſo we confeſs the ſame Chriſt not only to be ſtill in being; but alſo Glorified, and his Body to be a Glorious. Heavenly and Spiritual Body: So that this man Chriſt did neither vaniſh nor periſh in any thing that is eſſential to him, either as to his Spirit, Soul or body.</q>

            <p>Again, in <hi>Malice</hi> of the <hi>Indep: &amp;c: pa:</hi> 19 they [the Quakers] ſay, <q>tho' Chriſt be God and Man, in a moſt Glorious Union and Power, yet the manhood is not the Deity, nor the Deity the manhood, yet inſeparable in the man Chriſt who is Lord from Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>in Poſtſcript page</hi> 23. G: W: ſaith, as hinted before, <q>Chriſt did riſe in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wherein he ſuffered, and in the ſame aſcended into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: and it is ſo far Circumſcribed or Encompaſſed in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as it's capable of, &amp; as is proper to it; and tho' it be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; Glorious, yet a body &amp; therefore not in every place where God is, to be omnipreſent is only proper to God and not to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
