            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE power of prejudice over the minds of mankind is very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; hardly any extreams too diſtant, or abſurdities too glaring for it to unite or reconcile, if it tends to promote or juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a favourite purſuit. It is thus we are to account for the fallacious reaſonings and abſurd ſentiments uſed and entertained concerning negroes, and the lawfulneſs of keeping them ſlaves. The low contempt with which they are generally treated by the whites, lead children from the firſt dawn of reaſon, to conſider people with a black ſkin, on a footing with domeſtic animals, form'd to ſerve and obey, whom they may kick, beat, and treat as they pleaſe, without their having any right to complain; and when they attain the age of maturity, can ſcarce be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that creatures they have always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſo vaſtly below themſelves, can ſtand on the ſame footing in the ſight of the Univerſal Father, or that juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the ſame conduct to them as to whites; and thoſe prejudices having been
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012323_0003_0F8A3A018B5DA330"/>
generally countenanced in time paſt, are become ſo riveted, that too few even of the ſober and religious, can hear the voice of impartial juſtice, in favour of that abuſed people, with a proper degree of patience and attention. I therefore requeſt all ſuch into whoſe hands this may fall, to diveſt themſelves of every bias ariſing either from prejudice, or temporal views, and coolly weigh the following hints, and, if any thing is met with, that tends to promote chriſtian rectitude, embrace it; without regarding the hand from whence it comes, ever bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in mind who it was that declared,—<q>Such meaſure as you mete, ſhall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to you again.</q>

            <p>MY mind having been frequently led to conſider the inconſiſtency of the practice of ſlave-keeping, and making traffic of our fellow-men, to the precepts and doctrine of our bleſſed Lord and Lawgiver, which, with regard to duty one to another, is ſum'd up in this ſhort command, viz. <q>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them,</q> and wiſhing to ſee an end put to this unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice among chriſtians, felt an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to fling a few hints together, ſeveral of which to me appeared new on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which may poſſibly lead ſome more cloſely to inſpect their own ſituation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover how far they ſtand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by impartial juſtice in this buſineſs, and as the Jewiſh law was poſitive, <q>That
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012323_0005_0F8A3A030AA92040"/>
whoever ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</q> Exod. xxi.I6.</p>
            <p>The following <hi>Queries</hi> may be worthy our ſerious attention.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Query</hi> I. Was this part of the ceremonial law intended only for the Jewiſh nation, or founded on univerſal diſtributive juſtice, adapted to the nature of things, and equally neceſſary to the reſt of mankind?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Is he who encourages the thief to ſteal and receives the goods, more innocent than the thief?</p>
            <p n="3">III. As chriſtians conſider it unlawful to make ſlaves of their fellow-believers, does the precepts of Chriſt, or nature of things give a chriſtian any ſtronger title to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive freedom than an African?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If it was a heinous crime to take a fellow-ſervant by the throat and deprive him of his liberty becauſe he could not pay a juſt debt, is it not much more ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our fellow-ſervants of their freedom who owe us nothing, nor ever did us the leaſt injury?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Is not the command which prohibits the coveting our neighbour's ox, ſervant, &amp;c. broke with a much deeper degree of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012323_0006_0F8A3A03CA00DA20"/>
guilt, by coveting his perſon, and when in our power the making him our ſlave?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Does not he, who for gain, buys, ſells, or keeps in ſlavery the deſcendants of thoſe who were unjuſtly deprived of their freedom, thereby juſtify the original act, and put himſelf in the place of the firſt aggreſſor?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the negroes brought here are captives taken in war, and, by the cuſtom of the country belong to the victors, who have a right to ſlay or otherwiſe diſpoſe of them.</p>
            <p>To paſs over the Europeans being the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of thoſe wars by their demand for ſlaves, and that many of the negroes brought here, have been ſtole, &amp;c. let us conſider how far a cuſtom allowed of among benighted Africans, is to be countenanced and upheld by enlightened chriſtians, who are commanded to, <q>Do unto others, as they would have others do unto them,</q> not to a part only, to thoſe of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or colour, but to all men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no chriſtian can keep a ſlave or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thereto, without (in ſome degree) incurring the guilt of breaking his Lord's command, unleſs he is willing himſelf and poſterity ſhould be ſlaves; and as to this cuſtom of ſelling thoſe of their own nation and colour into perpetual ſlavery, from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, huſbands, wives, children, and all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012323_0007_0F8A3A048B922498"/>
the tender connections of life; who can think of it without the utmoſt abhorrence. Shall we then, ſhall chriſtians plead it as an excuſe for our conduct, when at the ſame time we are the moving cauſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe effects, as certaintly as the weights in a clock are the cauſe of its ſtriking. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the weights and the ſtriking ceaſes. Let all who bear the chriſtian name leave buying ſlaves, and this infernal cuſtom of theirs, of ſelling their brethren will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve equally ceaſe. A cuſtom that caſts the moſt indelible odium on the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, occaſioning ſome from hence to infer that they are a different race, formed by the Creator for brutal ſervices, to drudge for us with their brethren of the ſtalls.—However extravagant ſuch a ſuppoſition may appear, it is the only rational one that can fully juſtify the practice, and give peace of mind to a ſlave keeper; for until he can perſuade himſelf that this is the caſe, the above precept muſt continually reproach him with being a hypocrite and no chriſtian who can thus live in a deliberate oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt's command; and I am fully perſuaded there is few to be found who juſtifies the practice but is more or leſs tinctured with this opinion. Well then if this people's cuſtom of going to war for no other purpoſe than to take priſoners;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012323_0008_0F8A3A054B6B2820"/>
ſtealing, kidnapping, &amp;c. their neighbours and children, in order to ſell them for ſlaves, cannot be thought of without raiſing the utmoſt deteſtation, as what moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaps and deſtroys every ſocial tie, on which all temporal happineſs ſtands — is black with every guilt, and the moſt truly infernal of any practice that ever obtained among mankind — what excuſe, what plea, will our negroe maſters make at the great day of retribution, for encouraging thoſe execrable crimes by receiving the plunder?—It will be none, I doubt, to ſay my negro was born in my father's houſe, or in America, and therefore not obtained in that way; for I conſider the perſon who was brought from his native country againſt his will and made a ſlave, to exiſt in each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of his poſterity, however diſtant in point of time. And the perſon in whoſe hand ſuch poſterity is found, ſo long as the injury is continued, to repreſent the original ſtealer or plunderer, whoſe right hath been conveyed down to him, and is that by which he claims property in ſuch poſterity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently repreſents him in whom this claim ultimately exiſted; nor can he waſh his hands from this guilt by delivering ſuch pretended property either by ſale or gift to another, more than Pilot waſhed his from the guilt of Chriſt's death, whom he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012323_0009_0F8A3A0609DA1840"/>
knew to be innocent, and had it in his power to have ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>But to return to the ſource of this evil; if we look upon the firſt move ſo odious, ſo hateful, and find ourſelves filled with indignation and abhorrence againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators, how can we countenance and encourage, and thereby become promoters, abettors, and acceſſories therein, which every one in a leſs or greater degree is who buys, ſells, or keeps in ſlavery one of theſe people after the age the law of nature gives each human being an equal right to freedom; for can there be a greater abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity than to ſay, I deteſt the plunderer, when I am greedily ſharing the ſpoils; or innocent of the guilt, if I refuſe to make reſtitution to the true owner of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which I am in poſſeſſion, and of which he was unjuſtly deprived.—This opens a large field for conſideration, for it really appears to me impoſſible for any one of their own ſeeking and choice, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſlave-keeping, or partake of the profits, without incurring a degree of the original guilt. For if an innocent free-man, who had no ways forfeited his freedom, was by force taken from his native country and made a ſlave and begets children, who by virtue of the original injury are kept ſlaves, and they beget others, and ſo on for twenty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012323_0010_0F8A3A06CAA26598"/>
generations, the firſt wrong, a robbery of freedom, is continued, and exiſts in each of theſe, as much as it did in their common anceſtors; nor can I defend or juſtify my title to one of them without defending and juſtifying the original injury on which my right is founded, and my refuſing to reſtor this ſtolen property, of which I am poſſeſſed, to its right owner, ſhews that I approve the original act, and being a ſharer of the ſpoils, become a ſharer of the guilt, as alſo juſtly chargeable with a repetition of the crime; for every individual of the human ſpecies by the law of nature comes into the world equally intitled to freedom at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, although their parents may have been unjuſtly deprived of, or forfeited theirs. Children are not to anſwer for the ſins of their parents; and whoever having the care or poſſeſſion of a child, and denies him his freedom at an age the laws of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gives it to others, and without any act or conſent of the party to juſtify it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an act of violence againſt the ſtrongeſt of laws, the law of nature,—robs that individial of his inherent property, his freedom, a right which was never given by the univerſal Father to any one of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures over one another, without ſome fault on their part, not even to parents over their children. — A property more ſacred, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012323_0011_0F8A3A0788285930"/>
and eſſential to us as free agents, and accountable creatures than any other. And whoever partakes of the labour of ſuch, or the profits ariſing therefrom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſharers of the ſpoils of oppreſſion.—Can we then believe the Supreme Being to be an indifferent ſpectator of this inhuman trade, this aſſumed authority of one part of his intelligent creatures levelling another part with the brute animals to drudge and toil for their will and pleaſure. Buy and ſell them like cattle, deprived of every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional enjoyment, with the addition of every ſpecies of human miſery.—If he really is a GOD taking cogniſance of the actions of men—of one fleſh hath created all nations of people—is no reſpector of perſons, but renders to every man according to his works—is particularly attentive to the cries of the poor and needy—will he not aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge for thoſe things? <q>Rob not the poor, becauſe he is poor, neither oppreſs the afflicted in the gate. For the Lord will plead their cauſe, and ſpoil the ſoul, of thoſe that ſpoiled them.</q> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii.22, 23.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture mentions<note n="*" place="bottom">Micah vi.II.</note> the wicked balance, and bag of deceitful weights, the uſe of which, I believe was never more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent than in this dark buſineſs, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing

the keeping ſlaves, and in raiſing difficulties againſt ſetting them free, it would be endleſs to attempt a catalogue of the trifling and abſurd reaſons uſed on theſe occaſions, nor have I any inclination, my intent being only juſt to hint at matters; to reaſon with thoſe who juſtify ſlave-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after its unlawfulneſs hath been ſo plainly and abundantly proved, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear idle in me. But ſuch who ſolemnly pretend to condemn the practice, yet ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves under ſuppoſed difficulties in ſetting theirs free, or willing to free them after they have ſpent the prime of life in their ſervice, or make them pay ſo much per year to ſecure their eſtates, &amp;c. I would beg of ſuch to lay aſide the falſe balance and deceitful weights, and uſe the true.—Weigh this matter in Chriſt's ſcales. <q>Do unto others, as ye would they ſhould do to you.</q> This will oblige you to ſet your negroes free at the ſame age your own children are, without unjuſtly coveting their labour till they are 25 or 30 years of age, or compelling them to pay you a yearly ſum. They have as good a right to their freedom at twenty-one in the eyes of unbiaſed juſtice as your own ſons, and to deny it to them, is as I ſaid before, a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the crime which brought their anceſtors out of their own country, viz. a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012323_0013_0F8A3A090A9B0AC8"/>
robbing them of their freedom, which if born and continued there, they would have enjoyed, nor can their being born among chriſtians cancel this invariable law of nature, or make the ſeizing their freedom by force here, any leſs injuſtice than had it been done there; the injury to the individual is the ſame, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incompatible with doing as we would be done unto.—Should one of your ſons be kept an apprentice by force, a year longer than his maſter had a right, ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be made, or a proſecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced and what not, for redreſs. But the poor Africans having no advocate but his maſter's conſcience, may be kept year after year, and perhaps die at his drudgery like a horſe at the plow, or have his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reſtored at a time of life when it is rather a puniſhment than favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſurely thou wilt admit of ſome diſtinction between the children of white people born free, and thoſe of our ſlaves who coſt us great ſums of money which we have not been repaid, or perhaps bought young and not earned half their coſt by the time they are of age, as is my caſe. I have a woman bought when young, who having had children faſt, hath earned very little of her purchaſe money, and if I ſhould ſet all theſe free as they arrive to

the age of men and women, ſhall be a great loſer by them; thou wilt hardly ſay that would be reaſonable.</p>
            <p>My friend thy reaſoning proceeds from the bag of deceitful weights; the true balance diſcovers juſtice to be quite another thing than thou ſeems to think it, here is no reſpect of perſons. Juſtice to thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe weighs as heavy as juſtice to thyſelf, a ſmall loſs in thy intereſt put in this ſcale againſt the freedom of an innocent fellow; creature, weighs but as a feather againſt mount Atlas, perhaps the barely claiming no right to them after the age of I8 and 2I may fall greatly ſhort of chriſtian juſtice in this ſcale; let us therefore a little inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query.</hi> How came thee poſſeſſed of this woman?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I bought her of an African mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who brought her from Guinea when a child.</p>

               <hi>Query.</hi> How came he by her?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I know not: I ſppoſe he bought her of them who had a right to ſell her.</p>
            <p>A right to ſell her! No one, not even her father could have ſuch a right longer than till ſhe came to the age of a woman, at which time ſhe was pronounced free by the law of nature, the rules of equity and juſtice, and precepts of Chriſt, whether in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012323_0015_0F8A3A0A8A540EE8"/>
houſe, or a maſter's, in her native country, or among ſtrangers; this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right ſhe carries with her, and cannot be diſſeized of but by her own conſent.—But it is very likely ſhe was ſtolen from her parents, and then juſtice will ſay the perpetrator had not the leaſt right to her, conſquently could convey none, but that he deſerved death for the act.—If this is the chain of conveyance on which thy title to theſe negroes ſtands, thou ſees it is none at all, but that the life of the perſon thou holds under, was juſtly forfeited for being the means of putting them into thy power; therefore if thou had been a chriſtian in deed and in truth, that is, been dictated in all thy conduct by the precepts of Chriſt, which are the perfections of juſtice, would ſooner have caſt thy money into the fire, than have made ſuch an unchriſtian pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, by doing of which, thou approved of, and made thyſelf a partner in all ſtring of crimes committed in procuring, bringing, and ſelling this child for a ſlave; but having done it, ſhould then have acted the part of a father by her, been more earneſt in giving her a chriſtian education, than to make her earn her purchaſe-money, and have claimed no right to her after ſhe came to woman's age.—This is as thou would deſire a child of thine ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012323_0016_0F8A3A0B4A346D40"/>
treated in the like circumſtances; but as thou did not then diſcharge a chriſtian duty by her, hath now an additional cumber, and ought to do this by her children; for being under thy care, their own father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it, and by a free act of thy own, thou ſtands his ſubſtitute as to their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ought to diſcharge a father's duty to them in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I act the part of a father by negroes! be at the coſt of raiſing them, ſchooling and what not, and when they are able to earn ſomething, ſet them free! I'll aſſure thee I'll do no ſuch thing, it would be injuſtice to myſelf and family.—Why at that age they'll bring me near one hundred pounds per head.</p>
            <p>Do not be warm my friend, I am not about to force thee to obey the laws of God,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mic. vi.8.</note> "To deal juſtly, and love mercy." I know thou has the laws of men on thy ſide. I am only endeavouring to ſhew thee it would be abundantly thy greateſt intereſt ſo to do; and as thou calls thyſelf a chriſtian, ſhould expect much rhetorick need not be uſed to convince thee that to be ſuch it is abſolutely neceſſary to obey Chriſt's precepts and doctrine; to which there is nothing more diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012323_0017_0F8A3A0C08F9B2F0"/>
than the ſlave trade from firſt to laſt.—But if, with Dives, thou art preferring this world's treaſure to that which ought to be laid up in heaven,—I fear thou will ſhare his lot in the concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am not preferring this world's treaſure in that ſort, but think it very juſt theſe negroes ſhould ſerve me till they are 25 or 30 years of age to pay for their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and then a yearly ſum for ſome time to ſecure my eſtate from charge.</p>
            <p>Thou art ſtill uſing the falſe balance, the true one will decide quite otherwiſe. It hath been already ſhewn that by the law of nature and precepts of chriſtianity, thou had not the leaſt right to the mother's labour after ſhe was of woman's age, and thy keeping her againſt her will, was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her of her freedom, which at that time became her own property, and in conſequence of that unlawful act, now claims her children;—but can juſtly have no other, or greater power over them than that of a father until they are men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when having received from thee a chriſtian education to enable them to get a living, and be uſeful members of ſociety, ought then enjoy their freedom as fully as thy own children. And as to paying a yearly ſum to ſecure thy eſtate, it is the
height of injuſtice; this incumbrance was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012323_0018_0F8A3A0CCB021998"/>
not brought on by any fault or act of theirs, but by thyſelf, and as it was of thy own ſeeking, ought to bear the burden, and not puniſh innocent perſons for thy faults. Do the beſt the preſent circumſtances will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lviii.6</note> 
               <q>Looſe the bands of wickedneſs,  and let the oppreſſed go free,</q> and thereby atone for what cannot be recalled; for whoever attempts to ſatisfy juſtice by ſetting their negroes free by halves in that ſort, will find themſelves as much miſtaken, I believe, as Ananias and his wife, in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deceive the apoſtles with a part of the money their poſſeſſions ſold for.—It is inflicting a penalty upon them,—and for what?—Juſtice abhors puniſhing an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon; and if they are innocent why ſhall they not enjoy their natural rights as fully and abſolute as the reſt of mankind. Or is it their being born of a different colour from ourſelves that gives us this prerogative of dealing with them as we pleaſe; making natural juſtice quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing when applied to negroes, from what it is when applied to thoſe of our own colour. However this ſimple circumſtance may have prejudiced our minds, it may be well for all who are concerned with this people to remember, that they are equally
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012323_0019_0F8A3A0D892EBD10"/>
the work of an Almighty hand, with a ſoul to ſave or loſe, as themselves, and being ſo, doubtleſs will avenge their cauſe, altho' in his mercy he forbears long, the time of retribution will come; juſtice is as much his attribute as mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Thou ſays much of doing as we would be done unto, &amp;c. for my part I think it a great happineſs for the negroes that they are brought here, whereby they become acquainted with the chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which they would have remained ignorant of, had they continued in their own country.</p>
            <p>A hopeful argument! fabricated by the ſame hand as thoſe in favour of the Spaniſh inquiſition, and with about as much ſenſe and reaſon. Thoſe murderers it is ſaid, will with a very grave face tell an heretick at the time they are torturing him in the moſt exquiſite manner, that they do it out of pure regard for his ſoul; thus for the good of their ſouls, deſtroy hereticks in a more horrible ſort than a lion, or tiger, does his prey. And theſe make uſe of the moſt unchriſtian means to get and keep their fellow-men in their power, and render them the moſt miſerable of human beings, to make them acquainted forſooth and in love with chriſtianity, which it is well known is the leaſt of their concern, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012323_0020_0F8A3A0E51E44E98"/>
that few take more care to inſtil into their negroes than into their cattle. But this plea, tho' often uſed, is too abſurd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to be ſeriously refuted, ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſmiſs the ſubject after giving another ſample of like pious concern for the ſouls of men, which may bring it more feelingly home to ourſelves. The duke of Parma, on hearing of queen Elizabeth's proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a day of thankſgiving for the defeat of the Spaniſh Armada, exclaimed! <q>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken woman! Blind nation! to return thanks for the greateſt misfortune that could have befallen them! for had that enterprize ſucceeded, they would all have been converted to the true catholic faith.</q>—Now had they obtained their ends, butchered thouſands, and enſlaved the reſt, I ſuppoſe we ſhould think it the greateſt inſult on reaſon, to ſay it would have been a real kindneſs to the Engliſh, tho' it might be ſo ſaid with much more propriety and truth, than it can reſpecting negroes, who are brought from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land, where they enjoyed freedom and independance in a more extenſive degree than we do, and placed here on a footing with the brute creatures, that are generally treated with greater care and tenderneſs than they.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Weſt-Indies, and ſome of our colonies.</note> In the other caſe, the people
