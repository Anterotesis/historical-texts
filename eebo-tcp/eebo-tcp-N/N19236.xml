            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>I AGAIN take up the pen to write to you at the Chateau of Monſ. du F—, from which place I laſt year ſent you the hiſtory of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; thoſe misfortunes which have led me to love, as well as admire, the revolution. For you know we are ſo framed that, while we contemplate the deliverance of millions with a ſublime emotion of wonder and exultation, the tears of tenderneſs, the throbbings of ſympathy, are reſerved for the moment when we ſelect one happy family from the great national groupe, and when, amidſt the loud acclamations of an

innumerable multitude, we can diſtinguiſh the ſoothing ſounds of domeſtic felicity. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with awful aſtoniſhment the ſun of liberty ſpreading its broad blaze over the French hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere; but I have traced with inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that benignant beam which has chaſed ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery cloud of calamity from the dwelling of Monſ. du F—.</p>
               <p>It ſeems the recompenſe of my French patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm that I have on ſeveral occaſions had the good fortune to witneſs thoſe ſcenes of general felicity, in which it requires but common ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to partake. I went to Rouen the very day before the King accepted the conſtitution. When the courier arrived with this intelligence, the cannons were immediately fired, the bells of all the churches rung, and the people diſplayed their joy by crowding the ſtreets with bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the afternoon Te Deum was ſung in the cathedral. The eight hundred electors of the department, who were at that time aſſembled at Rouen, walked in proceſſion, attended by all the officers of the adminiſtration, and ſeveral battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the national guard. An immenſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude filled every part of the cathedral; the ſounds of the organ and the drums, the voices of the choir, and the acclamations of the people, were mingled together, and rolled through the long aiſies of the building. It was impoſſible to witneſs this religious ſolemnity, and reflect on the greatneſs of the occaſion which had called ſo immenſe a multitude together, that of having completed the glorious work of a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without catching the enthuſiaſm which beat high in every boſom.</p>
               <p>Indeed living in France at preſent, appears to me ſomewhat like living in a region of romance. Events the moſt aſtoniſhing and marvellous are here the occurrences of the day, and every newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper is filled with articles of intelligence that will form a new era in the hiſtory of mankind.

The ſentiments of the people alſo are elevated far above the pitch of common life. All the motives which moſt powerfully ſtimulate the mind in its ordinary ſtate, ſeem repreſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the public good, and every ſelfiſh intereſt is ſacrificed with fond alacrity at the altar of the country. For my part, while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template theſe things, I ſometimes think that the age of chivalry, inſtead of being paſt for ever, is juſt returned; not indeed in its erroneous notions of loyalty, honour, and gallantry, which are as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note n="*" place="bottom">

The principal ſtreet, which extends the whole length of the town, is regularly built, and is clean, cheerful, and well lighted every night, by lamps hung acroſs it. Here is a noble cathedral of exquiſite workmanſhip, and of which the firſt ſtone was laid by Henry the Fourth; a circumſtance which makes me contemplate the building with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pleaſure.

               <p>We have lodgings in the Place du Martroy, in a ſpacious handſome houſe which formerly belonged to Monſ. d'Orleans, and where the archives of his family were depoſited.

He is at ſome diſtance from the window, ſo that I loſe much of his eloquence; but I have ſeen him diſplay a fine chapelet, which he declares was given to him by the empreſs of all the Ruſſias; and I have heard him boaſt the efficacious qualities of a certain precious pill, of which he is in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which, he ſays, cures<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The French revolution is not only ſublime in a general view, but is often beautiful when conſidered in detail. Its hiſtory abounds with circumſtances that would embelliſh the page of the Greek or Roman annals. But the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that no man is a hero to his valet de chambre, may be applied to great events, as well as great characters.

Her own titles to nobility were very new, and very inconſiderable; but ſhe was acquainted with ſome women of high tank who had fled to Germany.

that pride had inculcated, and that ſervility had learned to revere; and which has made a ſtep towards perfection ſo rapid, ſo aſtoniſhing in the progreſs of human reaſon—it is not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that ſuch a revolution ſhould have many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies among that claſs of perſons whoſe vanity, ambition, or intereſt, are affected by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe abuſes and errors, from which they enjoyed the moſt partial advantages. Some excuſe may, perhaps, be found in the weakneſs of human nature, and the prejudices of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the ariſtocracy of Monſ. d'Artois, or Monſ. de Condé. But the ariſtocracy to which common ſenſe can give no quarter, is that which you ſometimes find in the perſons of the bon, ci-devant tiers état; that claſs which by the revolution is raiſed from contempt and degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into importance and reſpect.</p>
               <p>A beautiful young woman, formerly a ducheſs, with whom I was in company at Paris, told me ſhe had remarked, that even the ſeaſons were changed ſince the revolution, and that the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of France had become ſtormy and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.

The biſhop of Orléans, who is deſcended from the ancient nobility of France, has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf by his patriotiſm; but there are at Orleans a hundred and fifty chanoines, who are far from being patriots. Theſe chanoines enjoyed each two or three thouſand livres a year for chanting Latin hymns in the cathedral. The cathedral being now transformed into a pariſh-church, theſe hymns are no longer ſung; and the chanoines are reduced to live upon half their former income. Theſe hundred and fifty chanoines had certainly a hundred and fifty cooks, and theſe cooks probably have families. The chanoines and the cooks have both loſt their places, and conſequently they and their families are ariſtocrates.</p>
               <p>By the way, I have found out that an ariſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate always begins a political converſation by aſſuring you that he is not an ariſtocrate. He will tell you, "that there certainly were intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable abuſes in the old government, and that no perſon wiſhed more ſincerely than himſelf to ſee thoſe abuſes reformed. But," he will add, "to take away the king's power, to deprive the nobility of their privileges, and the clergy of their revenues, is puſhing things to an extremity, at which every hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mind ſhudders. If the National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

had made a reform without injuring theſe orders of the ſtate, they would have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by the whole world." This reminds me of a paſſage in Monſ. Beaumarchais' comedy of the Follies of a day. "I was told," ſays Figaro, on the ſubject of writing a book, "that if I took care to ſay nothing of politics, nothing of morality, of governments, of the clergy, or of perſons in power, and then ſubmitted my book to the inſpection of the keeper of the ſeals, and obtained an 'approbation,' and 'privilege,' I might, after uſing theſe precautions, write with the moſt perfect freedom."</p>

In one ſtage of its progreſs the ſugar is clarified with the blood of oxen: it is poured into veſſels of an immenſe ſize, and appears a liquid of a deep red. I own thoſe frightful reſervoirs ſtruck my imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination as if ſtained with the blood of Africans.</p>
               <p>The long train of calamities which are the portion of that unhappy race, crowded in ſad ſucceſſion upon my mind, and I obſerved, with a degree of horror which I could not repreſs, the proceſs of a luxury obtained for the inhabitants of one part of the globe, by the wrongs, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies, the deſpair of the inhabitants of another part.—Alas! why is there ſo much more miſery in this world than benevolence can cure? Why, in the public diſcuſſions in France and in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on the Slave Trade, are the poſſibilities of gain and loſs calculated with ſuch nice preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Why are crimes and injuſtice, deſolation and death, treated in a ſtyle ſo very mercantile that humanity liſtens in deſpair to their deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations?</p>
               <p>From thence we went to ſee a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manufactory for ſpinning cotton, which has
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025039_0026_0FCDAB2A63373688"/>
been eſtabliſhed here by an Engliſh gentleman, to whom we are obliged for that cordial hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which is the ancient and honourable character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of our country, and which is ſo peculiarly grateful to the heart when received in a land of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>This manufacture, while it diſplays the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful power of mechaniſm, gives occaſion alſo to the exerciſe of humanity, by employing not only a great number of men, but fourteen hundred women and children.</p>
               <p>The gentleman to whom the manufacture belongs, related to me the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:—He happened to be in the National Aſſembly at Verſailles, when the king declared that he would give orders for diſbanding the army which ſurrounded Paris, and would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf come to the Maiſon de Ville, in compliance with the wiſhes of his people. Mr. F—, after taking a copy of the king's harangue with his pencil, immediately mounted his horſe, and galloped to Paris, in order to carry this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. At the Pont Neuf he was ſtopped, the bridle of his horſe ſeized, and the people wanted to take him to la Maiſon de Ville. He told them that he was an Engliſhman, the friend of liberty, and had galloped all the way from Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, in order to bring them good news.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:025039_0027_0FCDAB2E93522AC0"/>
The people conducted him to the Palais Royal, and there he diſmounted. A table was placed in the court of the Palais Royal, upon which he ſtood, and read over and over again the king's harrangue. After having remained there a conſiderable time, he went into a coffee-houſe of the Palais Royal to refreſh himſelf, and then enquired for his horſe. The horſe was not to be found. Mr. F—left a note at the coffee-houſe, intreating that the perſon who had taken care of the Engliſhman's horſe, while he was reading the king's ſpeech, in the Palais Royal, would deliver him to the maſter of the coffee-houſe.</p>
               <p>A few days after, an anſwer was ſent to Mr. F—, informing him, that the Engliſh horſe had gone back to Verſailles, in order to conduct the king to Paris; and was again gone to the country upon buſineſs of importance to the nation, but that whenever he returned he ſhould be ſent to his maſter.</p>
               <p>The horſe accordingly arrived, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſuffered a little for his ſervices to the ſtate; and, though he was ever after particularly cheriſhed by Mr. F—, he died in the ſecond year of French liberty; and I have ſome thoughts of writing his epitaph.</p>
               <p>Nothing, it is ſaid, could exceed the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025039_0028_0FCDAB300A0C3848"/>
and conſternation of the French court, when the intelligence that the Baſtille was taken reached Verſailles. This event appeared ſo incredible that the courtiers could ſcarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves it was true. That the people ſhould have the inſolence to complain becauſe they were threatened with famine—that, when the government had drawn an army to the gates of Paris in order to enforce ſubmiſſion, the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians ſhould dare to riſe into tumult—were things ſufficiently extraordinary—but that they ſhould, almoſt in the view of that army, take the Baſtille appeared to the court of Verſailles as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as if the courſe of nature had been changed, and the order of the univerſe broken.</p>
               <p>I lately heard an account of a converſation which paſſed at Verſailles, on the morning of the 14th of July, 1789, and which proves how little the court were prepared for the memorable event of that immortal day.</p>
               <p>A French gentleman, remarkable for his taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity and ſang-froid, things that ſeldom enter into the compoſition of a Frenchman, had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to go from Paris to Verſailles on that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in order to have a conference with the miniſter upon ſome private buſineſs.

               <p>"They ſeized upon all the arms," reſumed the gentleman, preſerving his uſual ſang-froid; "and if a man has too fuſees, he gives one to his neighbour."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid the miniſter, ſhrugging up his ſhoulders, "and what did they do next?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I believe," ſaid the gentleman, "they then went to the diſtrict."</p>
               <p>"The diſtrict!" exclaimed the miniſter: "pray what is the diſtrict?"</p>
               <p>"An invention of yeſterday," replied the gentleman: "the people have alſo another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſame date, I believe, which they call a permanent committee, and they have now got cannon."</p>

"Why, they talk of taking the Baſtille."</p>
               <p>"Very good!—excellent!" ſaid the miniſter, burſting into a violent fit of laughter: "this is really a pleaſant conceit enough. And pray who is at the head of this rabble?"</p>

"How extraordinary is it," exclaimed his friend, "to ſee the firſt genius of Europe employed in turning a ſpit!" "Why," anſwered Rouſſeau, with great ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025039_0034_0FCDAB3F566BA790"/>
and ſang-froid, "if I were not to turn the ſpit, you would certainly loſe your ſupper: my wife is gone to buy a ſallad, and the ſpit muſt be turned." At ſupper Rouſſeau produced, for the firſt time, the wine which his friend had ſent him: but no ſooner had he taſted it, than he ſuddenly put the glaſs from his lips, exclaiming with the moſt violent emotion, that it was not the ſame wine he had drank at his friend's houſe who he perceived had a deſign to poiſon him. In vain his friend proteſted his innocence: Rouſſeau's imagination, once poſſeſſed by this idea,

His friend was immediately obliged to retire, and they never met again.</p>
               <p>You, who are an admirer of Rouſſeau, will be pleaſed to hear of a tribute of enthuſiaſm paid to his memory lately by two of our countrymen. Theſe young Engliſhmen went to viſit the tomb of this lover of nature, which is placed in a beautiful little iſland on the eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te of Monſ. Girardin. Not long before their arrival, ſome profane mortal had dared to inſult the ſacred aſhes of Jean Jaques: and Monſ. Girardin, filled with indignation at this atrocious conduct, had
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025039_0035_0FCDAB41EF9D9340"/>
given orders, that no perſon, without a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar admiſſion from himſelf, ſhould henceforth be permitted to viſit the iſland. In vain our young Engliſhmen made proteſtations of their profound veneration for Rouſſeau; in vain they implored Monſieur Girardin's boatman to conduct them acroſs the ſtream. The boatman, ſurly as Charon himſelf, adhered inflexibly to the orders of his maſter. The young Engliſhmen, finding him inexorable, threw off their clothes, jumped into the ſtream, and ſwam to the iſland.—The gentleman who related to me this circumſtance, told me, that he and a friend had viſited together this iſland, and, kneeling at the tomb of Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, had burnt a book, publiſhed a ſhort time after his death by Diderot, in which he had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the memory of Rouſſeau with the moſt cruel indignity: and this he had done from a very unworthy motive. He had heard that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Rouſſeau were going to be publiſhed; and concluding that he ſhould be ill treated in thoſe Confeſſions, on account of his quarrel with Rouſſeau, he determined to be beforehand in abuſe. But when the Confeſſions were publiſhed, it was found that the feeling heart of Jean Jaques could not detach itſelf from his former friend, who had always continued to poſſeſs a place in his affections.—Monſ. Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025039_0036_0FCDAB42E9129E30"/>
was abſent from home, when the ſacrifice of Diderot's book was offered at Rouſſeau's tomb. When he returned, his boatman told him, that during his abſence two gentlemen had performed ſome witchcraft or other at the tomb; that he had obſerved them at a little diſtance; that they had ſtruck a ſtone, brought out a flame, and kept it burning an extraordinary length of time. Monſ. Girardin enquired into the meaning of theſe myſterious rites, and received an account of the ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>The celebrated opera-dancer, Mademoiſelle Theodore, whoſe talents I am told are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſuperior excellence in dancing, had an enthuſiaſtic admiration of Rouſſeau.

               <p>I HAVE been to viſit a chateau about a league from Orléans; part of which was built by the celebrated Lord Bolingbroke, and in which he paſſed ſome years of his exile, with his wife, the niece of Madame de Maintenon. Before the windows of the chateau riſes a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſmall river, called le Loiret, which, after a winding courſe of three leagues, through a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing country, falls into the Loire. The grounds of this chateau are in ſome parts formed into long alleys, ſhaded by venerable trees, in others ſpread into lawns, through which the clear Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret purſues its way. Lord Bolingbroke proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly found this retirement well adapted for philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical contemplation, and bad there ſufficient leiſure to

In this retreat he wrote the Patriot King. A company of French and Engliſh were dining with Lord Bolingbroke at this place, when the news arrived of the death of the Duke of Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, his ancient enemy. Some of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had ſervility enough to attempt paying their court to Lord Bolingbroke, by mentioning ſome
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025039_0043_0FCDAB54091EA3F8"/>
circumſtances to the diſadvantage of the Duke of Marlborough. At length a Frenchman, who was preſent, aſked Lord Bolingbroke his opinion of him. "Sir," ſaid he, "Marlborough was ſo great a man that I have forgot all his faults."—The Loiret deſerves to be conſidered as a ſort of claſſical river: for, if a famous Engliſh philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opher had his dwelling at its ſource, a far more amiable French philoſopher lived ſome time at the mouth of this little ſtream: a philoſopher, of whom not only his own country, but human nature may be proud; and whoſe writings tend to awaken the pureſt affections, the moſt ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emotions, of the human heart. This writer was Fenelon, the mild, the perſuaſive preacher of virtue.

               <p>Every Sunday evening during the month of October, as ſoon as it is dark, four men, dreſſed in black, walk through the town of Orléans, and at the corner of every ſtreet ring a loud heavy bell, which ſends forth a moſt diſmal ſound; after which they call upon the people to remember the dead, and pray for the repoſe of their ſouls. Nothing can be more gloomy than this ſuperſtitious ceremony, which laſts till after All-ſaints day, when a ſolemn ſervice for the dead is performed in all the Roman Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic churches.</p>

               <p>WHEN a French girl is intended for the wife of a merchant, ſhe is carefully inſtructed in the arithmetic, after ſhe leaves the convent, where ſhe is uſually taught little more than to count her beads. After ſhe is married ſhe acts as her huſband's firſt clerk, and paſſes the whole day in his counting-houſe. Some advantages ariſe from this practice; ſince a

French woman, if her huſband dies, is capable of carrying on his buſineſs 'till her children are of a proper age to ſucceed to it; and in the mean time ſhe knows exactly the ſtate of his affairs. Whereas, the wife of an Engliſh merchant, ſometimes from being entirely ignorant of his real ſituation, indulges herſelf in a mode of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which haſtens on his ruin, and receives like a thunder-ſtroke the intelligence that her riches were a dream, and that her huſband is a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>I am told that commerce was never ſo flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing in France as it has been for a year paſt, not only in the capital, but throughout the whole kingdom. The advantages which ſome have been enabled to gain from the paper money has led them to extraordinary enterpriſe, and the loſs which others have ſuſtained has produced extraordinary induſtry and activity. Commerce has benefited in both caſes. If the gold of France has vaniſhed with the nobleſſe, it is not of gold only that that claſs of perſons have diſbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened their country. They have alſo carried away with them that immenſe load of prejudices which has ſo long oppreſſed this nation, and which, by connecting degradation and contempt with commerce, deprived the country of the beſt uſe and improvement of its riches. If the French money has "made unto itſelf wings and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025039_0046_0FCDAB5C4BE89198"/>
fled away," ſo alſo has the corvée, the gabelle, the arbitrary impoſitions, the ſeig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orial rights, the enormous taxes which the poor paid to the rich, and which produced famine, where nature had ſcattered plenty: while they have left behind them the bleſſings of liberty, equal taxation, mild laws, trial by jury, the ſpirit of commerce. Paper money, when the criſis of the revolution is paſt, will, by a proceſs only known to free ſtates, be transformed into pure gold.</p>
               <p>I have been at la Maiſon de Ville, in which houſe died Francis the Second, the huſband of Mary Queen of Scots. He came to Orléans with Mary, to meet the States General; was ſuddenly taken ill while he was at maſs, and died immediately.</p>
               <p>The name of Mary Stuart is placed in the liſt of French female poets. Unfortunate Mary! When ſhe wrote her poetic farewell to this country,
<q>
                     <hi>Adieu, plaiſant pays de France, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
ſhe ſeems to have felt a ſad preſage of her future calamities; thoſe calamities which make me forget every weakneſs of Mary, and every great quality of Elizabeth; qualities over which the fate of Mary has ſurely caſt an everlaſting ſhade.</p>
               <p>At the Maiſon de Ville we ſaw a picture of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025039_0047_0FCDAB5ECEFAA3F8"/>
The countenance is uncommonly beautiful. It ſeems that nature, while ſhe beſtowed on the Maid of Orléans the heroic qualities of the other ſex, did not deny her the ſoft attractions of her own.</p>
               <p>There is alſo at the Maiſon de Ville the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Doctor Petit, who is a native of this place, and has acquired a very high reputation, and an ample fortune as a Phyſician at Paris. He has lately built a handſome houſe at Orléans, for the purpoſe of furniſhing advice and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines gratis to the poor; and, with additional benevolence, to defend their little property from injuſtice, he has appointed lawyers who have a ſalary allowed them for pleading the cauſe of the indigent.</p>
               <p>This public benefactor to his native city is the ſon of a taylor; and, in order to ſhew that he was ſuperior to the prejudices which ſo long enſlaved his country, he appointed the oldeſt taylor at Orléans in indigent circumſtances to take care of this new inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Doctor Petit I ſuppoſe felt, that, having arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at eminence by the path of all others the moſt honourable, that of diſtinguiſhed talents, he might be allowed to recollect, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>roture</hi> of his birth.

               <p>THERE is an univerſity at Orléans, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Philippe le Bel, in 1312. If one can forgive a tyrant who purſued his own ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement, ſometimes by the moſt perfidious policy, ſometimes by the moſt cruel oppreſſions, and who firſt changed offences againſt the king, which until his reign were only conſidered as crimes of felony, into crimes of high treaſon, it muſt be in conſideration of his having, in that barbarous age, done ſomething for the cauſe of literature. In this inſtance it appears that he did not reaſon with his uſual ſubtilty; ſince the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025039_0049_0FCDAB63C62FF818"/>
progreſs of literature is very unfavourable to the intereſts of tyranny. What example ſo mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, and ſo recent, of this truth, as the event of the French revolution? That glorious event which will probably in its conſequences change the face of this earth, and will be marked in the page of hiſtory as that luminous point of human annals, from which a better order of things is ſeen to ariſe: and this event has ſurely been the work of literature, of philoſophy, of the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing views of mankind. Liberty ſprings as nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally from knowledge, as light from the ſun; and the liberty which the French have acquired, and are determined to maintain, appears to be the deliberate, the noble, the auguſt choice of reaſon. It has no reſemblance to thoſe fiery meteors which ſometimes throw a tranſitory flaſh acroſs that darknnſs which they have not ſufficient power to diſpel: it is the ſublime effect of truth viſiting the land, like the day-ſpring from on high, and, with a ſimiliar kind of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the moral world, warming the heart, in proportion as it enlightens the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The French, in forming their new conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have made an experiment in politics, and why ſhould they be cenſured for ſo doing? While philoſophy teaches the general utility of experimental ſcience, who will be bold enough
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025039_0050_0FCDAB65A6BEAF98"/>
to aſſert, that the ſcience of government alone has attained perfection, and is incapable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement? Who will ſay to the human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, on this one point only, thus far ſhalt thou go, and no farther? If the progreſſion of reaſon in the art of government is forbidden, how miſerable are the proſpects of the human race! for ſmall indeed is the portion of political happineſs hitherto obtained by mankind.</p>
               <p>But why do I attempt to juſtify the conduct of the French, when you know we have all heard that they have been guilty of the moſt fatal errors? They have ſhewn ſome diſpoſition to reform the papal hierarchy, and to ſeparate the artificial ſplendour of church eſtabliſhments from the pure beams of that light which cometh from above. They have invaded the grand monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the dead, and thrown open the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tomos of the living. They have led beauty from the ſolitary cell, where its charms might have bloomed in ſecurity, and have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe dangerous attractions to the love and admiration of ſociety. They have drawn forth coins and medals, paintings and ſtatues, from thoſe venerable repoſitories where they had long lain buried with their paſt poſſeſſors. Their ſacrilegious hands have diſturbed the learned duſt of libraries ſtored with theological
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025039_0051_0FCDAB6915AD0E98"/>
controverſies, and which diſplayed perhaps the weakneſs, as well as the ſtrength of the human mind: and, inſtead of employing the maſon, and the carpenter, in repairing the ravages of time on Gothic edifices, they have erected obeliſks to a pagan divinity, not to be found in the monkiſh calendar, and degraded at Rome every ſince the days of the ancient republic. But let us turn from the enumeration of their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt that code of reſpectable prejudices, ſtamped with the authority of paſt age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Is it a proof of the ſuperior refinement of the French, that they are fonder of theatrical amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the Engliſh? Or does it ariſe from that love of gaiety and pleaſure, which is ſo much more prevalent in the French than the Engliſh character? A London tradeſman, when the buſineſs of the day is over, ſits down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly with his wife and children, and reads the newſpaper.

               <p>There are coffee-houſes on the Boulevards, where the people, while they drink their wine, lemonde, or orgeat, are entertained with a play gratis.

               <p>Not that the ſame gallantry, the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attention to women now prevails which exiſted before the revolution.—Like Moliere's Doctor, "on a changé tout cela." The men, engroſſed by political concerns which involve the fate of their country, and on which their own lives and fortunes depend, have no longer leiſure or inclination to devote as much time as they did formerly to the women; and I think the French ladies ſtand a fair chance of being ſoon almoſt as much neglected as the Engliſh.

I am that this revolution in dreſs and manners, this ſubverſion of the ancient laws of etiquette, has excited ſuch a degree of ſurpriſe and wonder in the king's attendants at the Tuilleries, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is the fourth year of French liberty, thoſe gentlemen have not yet got the better of their aſtoniſhment. Nothing, it is ſaid, can exceed the minute curioſity, and the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive looks, ſhrugs, and geſtures, with which they examine the dreſs of the members of the National Aſſembly, when ſent on deputations to the king.

The Abbé de Mably, however, ſeems of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion that, while our cottages are ſnug, warm, and comfortable, we have no reaſon to bluſh that the French bear away the palm from us in point of palaces. I have juſt read the Abbé de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's book, entitled, "Des Droits et des De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs du Citoyen," a work written ſeveral years ago, and in which the progreſs of the public mind in France, and the ſteps which led to the French revolution, are traced with ſo much ſimplicity, clearneſs, energy, and truth, that it ſeems rather the hiſtory of what has paſſed, than a prophecy of what was then to come.</p>
               <p>When the Baſtille was taken, this book, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a large edition of another work of the Abbé de Mably's, entitled, "Des Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>We have alſo been to viſit Rincy and Mouceaux, two houſes belonging to the Duke of Orléans. Mouceaux is the moſt ſingular and enchanting ſpot I ever ſaw. You are led through long magnificent galleries, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

with the moſt happy union of ſimplicity and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egance, and lighted by a thouſand lamps, to a hothouſe formed into ſerpentine walks, where, in the middle of winter, and at a time when the ground was covered with ſnow, an infinite variety of flowers diffuſed the moſt delicious fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance. The air was of the temperature of ſpring, a caſcade falls over rocks with the moſt ſoothing murmurs, and this delightful ſpot leads to the dining apartment, from which you enjoy the beauties and fragrance of this elyſian walk, where the charms of nature and the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of art are blended together in a manner which I imagined was only to be found in the palaces of ſylphs and fairies; perſonages, who, you know, are ſuppoſed to have a great deal more facility in raiſing ſplendid palaces than we mere mortals.</p>
               <p>Rincy is a noble manſion, where Monſ. d'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Orléans, who has lived much in England, has united with the taſte and grandeur of a French palace, the comforts and accommodations of an Engliſh houſe.</p>
               <p>The grounds of Rincy are laid out in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh taſte, are very beautiful, and of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent. We dined with an Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſervice of Monſ. d'Orléans, and who lives in a charming houſe in his park.</p>

In the morning we hunted a boar. This was the firſt time in my life I had ever been at a chace, and I find it an amuſement ſo little ſuited to my taſte, that I ſhall certainly never try it again. We rode in phaetons up and down the alleys of the woods, in ſearch of this wretched animal, who at laſt yielded himſelf up to the dogs, and had his life ſpared to another day. I believe a French hunt is as little ſuited to the taſte of an Engliſh fox-hunter, as it is to mine, but for a very different reaſon: here are neither incloſures to paſs, nor ſix-barred gates to leap; there is neither danger to encounter, nor glory to be gained; and too ſmall a chance of a broken neck to intereſt the paſſions of an Engliſh 'ſquire.</p>
               <p>Since the revolution, ſuch quantities of game have been deſtroyed, that this Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has thought proper to preſerve a number of the wild inhabitants of the foreſts from the general ſlaughter, by confining them in ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate paddocks, where boars, hares, &amp;c. are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fed: but I do not believe their good fare reconciles them to the loſs of their liberty. I have no doubt they would prefer jour maigre, together with the unconfined range of the woods, to any fète within the paddock.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh gentleman with whom we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Rincy, ſhewed me a little engraving of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025039_0063_0FCDAB87CB564478"/>
the deſcent of Meſſrs. Charles and Robert from their balloon. Theſe aërial adventurers were followed on horſeback by Monſ. d'Orléans, and a great number of perſons, among whom was this Engliſhman.</p>
               <p>The balloon deſcended after a courſe of thirty miles; and the Engliſhman, getting the ſtart of the other horſeman, ſeized a cord of the balloon as it deſcended, and then ſpringing to embrace Monſ. Charles, reminded him, that he was the firſt to meet him. But being obliged to expreſs this ſentiment in French, he could find in the agitation of the moment no other words than,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>I am Charles the firſt.</hi>

               <p>While the French princes are employing their revenues in training ſoldiers for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of deluging their native country with blood, Monſ. d'Orléans is ſpending a conſiderable part of his revenue in paying workmen who are making improvements at Rincy. Monſ. d'Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léans has many enemies, who tell you that his patriotiſm is all affectation. However, ſince it
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025039_0064_0FCDAB8BB5AE2830"/>
has been uniform and conſtant, from the firſt period of the revolution, I know not on what grounds this conjecture is founded: but this at leaſt is certain, that it would ſave this nation many millions, and too probably a great profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, if the other French princes had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by the ſame kind of affectation.</p>
               <p>With regard to the family of Monſ. d'Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léans, whom, in conſequence of my acquaintance with Madame de Sillery, I have the honour of knowing a little, I am firmly perſuaded, from my own obſervations, that their patriotiſm is pure, warm, and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To young perſons who had been inſtructed that the chief privilege ariſing from their high rank, was that of affording them opportunities of more extenſive benevolence; who had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "the luxury of doing good," and imbibed the principles of general philanthropy towards

               <p>THERE were ſome commotions lately at Paris, on account of an attempt to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize ſugar, which was already ſold at an enormous price, and which the poor of Paris, who live as much upon coffee as the poor of London do upon tea, conſidered as one of the neceſſaries of life. For three nights the guards were trebled, and the town was lighted up for greater ſecurity. In a few days the commotion was entirely appeaſed, which I own had never given me the ſmalleſt alarm; for I always conſider myſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſafety at Paris under the protection of the national guard, which the Pariſians call, with truth, la <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And one may apply to the genius of this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what I lately read in a little collection of French letters, where the writer, ſpeaking of the talents for poetry which prevail ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſouthern provinces of France, the country of the Troubadours, ſays, "Nobody has immenſe riches of genius in this country; but eaſy, even affluent fortunes are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and the ſum of poetical wealth is upon the whole far more conſiderable than if a great deal were accumulated upon one head."</p>

He is ſpeaking at the tribune of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and he is pleading the cauſe of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the earth. For it is now too late for the lovers of arbitrary power to conſider the French revolution in the light in which they once affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conſider it. The time long ago is paſt, for terming that event an affair of accident, and the triumph of the rabble, which is found to have originated in the unanimous will of a great and enlightened nation, and has taught mankind a leſſon, which perhaps the whole human race will be proud to learn.</p>

               <p>I HAVE been at the Jacobins, that ſociety which has acted a part ſo diſtinguiſhed in the French revolution, and in which every political queſtion of importance is debated before it is brought forward in the National Aſſembly. The Jacobins have too much influence in the new ſyſtem of French politics not to have many enemies. By thoſe perſons every crime, every enormity is attributed to this ſociety; which, it is aſſerted, has not only the fate of France, but the fate of Europe in its hands. If the Emperor of Germany is hoſtile to the French nation, it is the fault of the Jacobins. Leopold felt the moſt
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025039_0074_0FCDAC330E945490"/>
tender and paternal intereſt in the proſperity of the new conſtitution; but he was forced to make a declaration of war againſt that formidable, that atrocious ſect. To the Jacobins is owing every outrage committed by popular fury, and every treaſonable deſign conceived by the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratic factions. The Jacobins are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of all diſorder, the levellers of all diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the enemies of all ſubordination. It is their intention to overturn the preſent ſyſtem of government, and divide the French empire into eighty-three republics, governed by Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</p>
               <p>Such is the cry, not merely of thoſe who have the courage to profeſs themſelves of the artiſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratic party, but alſo of thoſe, who, however they may regret the ſubverſion of the old gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, have ſagacity enough to perceive that, like the age of chivalry, it is paſt for ever, and therefore prudently determine to attempt its reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration no more. The ancient ſyſtem of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they find muſt be renounced, and therefore they limit their ambition to the converſation of as many errors, as many prejudices as poſſible. Theſe perſons talk to you of their profound reſpect for the new conſtitution, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Jacobins of wiſhing to ſubvert. I believe, indeed, that if there are ſome points of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025039_0075_0FCDAC34A97D42F8"/>
the conſtitution which the Jacobins diſapprove, they are thoſe very points which theſe perſons would bind on their poſterity for ever. Even among the patriots there are many who think that, the conſtitution being now eſtabliſhed, the deliberations of the Jacobins are no longer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and who alſo think that that ſociety leans too much towards republicaniſm.</p>
               <p>There are in France ſeveral different ſects of patriots; but the two leading parties and thoſe who are reproachfully termed by each other, <hi>enragés</hi> and <hi>modérés;</hi> and the great features of difference between theſe parties ſeem to be that the eragés place the declaration of rights above the conſtitution, while the modérés place the conſtitution above the declaration of rights. Each party is as dogmatical as the former doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Sorbonne. But a Frenchman never diſputes with calmneſs on any ſubject: it were therefore unreaſonable to expect he ſhould throw aſide the natural impetuoſity of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on the very points moſt likely to call it forth.</p>
               <p>This accounts, in ſome meaſure, for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tumults which ſometimes ariſe in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly; while in our Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons debates are carried on with the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good order and tranquillity. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, however, may be aſſigned for this, beſides
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025039_0076_0FCDAC36922AC5A8"/>
the difference of national character. In the Houſe of Commons our great orators may be as eloquent as they will; they may do honour to our nation, and to the age in which they live, by the energy, the ſublimity of their talents; but every body knows that their eloquence does not influence even one ſolitary vote; and before a debate begins, all the world is well appriſed how the buſineſs will end.</p>
               <p>This is not the caſe in the National Aſſembly. There, arguments and votes have ſtill a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with each other; and therefore every point is diſcuſſed with vehemence.—But to return to the Jacobins—If they have many enemies, the party of their friends is far more numerous. Thoſe perſons declare that they never enter the hall of the Jacobins without reſpect, becauſe they conſider it as the cradle and the ſanctuary of French liberty. They are convinced that thoſe watchful, vigilant, jealous, noiſy Jacobins are its beſt guardians; and that but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive influence which they have acquired, in conſequence of their correſpondence with the other partriotic ſocieties, eſtabliſhed in every part of the kingdom, with whom they conſtantly maintain a chain of connection, the infant lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of France would have been cruſhed in its birth by its numerous and formidable enemies. The friends of the Jacobins believe that they are
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025039_0077_0FCDAC382663DD98"/>
very far from intending to overthrow the preſent ſyſtem, whatever ſpeculative opinions ſome of the members of that ſociety may have on the ſubject of government: but that, if the Jacobins ſhould find that corruption is ſuffered to taint the purity of the new conſtitution and impede its march—if it ſhould be found that the firſt National Aſſembly, after having formed that conſtitution upon the great and everlaſting baſis of the rights of man, and of which the Abbé Sieyes has the glory of having laid the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in drawing up the declaration of thoſe rights—if it ſhould be found that that aſſembly, after ſuſtaining a long and laborious ſtruggle, at length wearied of the conflict, ſhould ſuffer the beautiful work they had created to be deformed in the reviſion of it—if it ſhould be found that the conſtitution, in its preſent ſtate, is like an ill-conſtructed carriage, and that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the drivers to put ſome ſecret clogs upon the wheels, and prevent its going forward, while the patriots in vain laſh up the horſes—then, it is ſaid, the Jacobins will warn the people of the threatened danger, with that bold, that ardent eloquence which belongs to the apoſtles of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.</p>
               <p>I was at the Jacobins when the Engliſh, French, and American colours, faſtened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The colours were fixed in the hall, and it was propoſed by ſome of the members, and ordered by the ſociety, that the buſts of Price, Franklin, Algernon Sidney, Jean Jaques Rouſſeau, and the Abbé de Mably, ſhould be placed beneath the banners of the three nations.</p>
               <p>The names of Milton, of Locke, and of Hambden, re-echoed through the hall, where it was propoſed that their buſts ſhould alſo in a ſhort time be placed. I heard with exultation the well-known names of theſe celebrated perſons, and recollected with pride that I had the honour
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025039_0079_0FCDAC3D0F3CECB8"/>
of belonging to the ſame country. Surely that nation which produced the writings of Milton and of Locke, which gave birth to Sidney and Hambden, in ages when the reſt of Europe were ſlaves, has a claim to the everlaſting grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and admiration of mankind.</p>
               <p>In this enlightened period of the world more perfect ſyſtems of legiſlation may perhaps be formed than England can boaſt. <hi>Her</hi> Magna Charta was obtained not in the illumination of the eighteenth, but in the Gothic darkneſs of the twelfth century. <hi>She</hi> can never be deprived of the moſt glorious pre-eminence among the children of freedom; <hi>ſhe,</hi> who cheriſhed in her boſom the noble ſentiments of liberty, when the nations around her were ſunk in the moſt abject ſervitude. If thoſe nations now find the path of freedom, it is by purſuing the track which Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land firſt explored.</p>
               <p>The example of the revolution in America is ſuppoſed to have had conſiderable influence on the French nation: and from whom did the Americans imbibe their love of freedom? They loved it becauſe they were of Engliſh race, and had ſtudied the writings of Engliſh philoſophers, and the examples of Engliſh patriots.</p>

which have crept into her government by wiſe and temperate reformation—may ſhe avoid thoſe ſtorms and convulſions which are only neceſſary to purify the moral, as well as the phyſical world, from any mighty and fatal conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. While France has been obliged to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>her</hi> government by holding in one hand her philoſophic declaration of rights, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her unſheathed ſword in the other—may England effect the ſame auguſt purpoſe with no other arms than thoſe of reaſon—may ſhe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting her national proſperity, employ the moſt effectual means of ſecuring its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—may ſhe direct that full tide of wealth which rolls through the land, to viſit it in more equal ſtreams; and may there be "no leading into captivity, and no complaining in her ſtreets!"</p>

               <p>THE firſt National Aſſembly, amidſt the greatneſs and extent of its labours, was obliged to leave to a ſucceding aſſembly the taſk of inſtituting a plan of public education; a taſk which will ſoon occupy the preſent legiſlature, and will alone ſerve to immortalize it, if well performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:025039_0081_0FCDAC44677F5FB8"/>
It is ſaid, that Monſieur Condorcet, a member of the preſent National Aſſembly, is at preſent employed on this object; and there can be no doubt that he will execute the work he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with that philoſophical ſpirit, and that extenſive knowledge, which he poſſeſſes in ſo conſpicuous and eminent a degree.</p>
               <p>How many ſoothing, how many comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſublime ideas does this plan of public education include! There is ſomething infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely agreeable and delightful to the imagination in the anticipation of that progreſs which the riſing generation in this country may make in reaſon, in philoſophy, in virtue, and in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the improvement of the riſing gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation cannot but be highly intereſting to the friends of the French revolution, ſince it ſeems peculiarly for them that that revolution has been made. They will beſt enjoy the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from it. The preſent patriots of France may be ſaid figuratively, as well as literally, to be placed in a field of battle, they have long-rooted prejudices to conquer; they have ancient errors to ſubdue; which perhaps are more difficult to be vanquiſhed than the combined forces of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and of Pruſſia. In the auguſt career of liberty, theſe patriots are encompaſſed with dangers, and beſet with ſnares; and if they are
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025039_0082_0FCDAC4591C69D08"/>
now enabled to keep the field againſt thoſe who were formerly their tyrants, it is by the determ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, the unremitting conteſt they maintain with vice, venality, and corruption. But through the clouds and ſtorms which now obſcure the French horizon, it is eaſy to diſcern the clear, the bright perſpective which unfolds itſelf to the riſing race. We ſee that the bleſſings of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened freedom await them, and we rejoice that a ſuitable education will qualify them to enjoy their diſtinguiſhed lot; that they will be made worthy of their high deſtiny, and fit guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians of that better order of things which they will be called upon to maintain.</p>
               <p>Mirabeau had drawn out a plan of public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which he meant to preſent to the National Aſſembly; and he intended, when this queſtion was diſcuſſed, to propoſe at the ſame time the abolition of the literary academies, or rather corporations of Paris, which he conſidered as incompatible with the ſpirit of a free conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and as injuring inſtead of ſerving the cauſe of letters.</p>
               <p>Monſ. Chamfort, a member of the French academy, had, at Mirabeau's deſire, written a diſcourſe on the ſubject of that academy, which the death of Mirabeau prevented his reading at the ritbune of the National Aſſembly. It is a

               <p>I am not, however, always occupied by theſe vaſt political diſcuſſions, but ſpend a part of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery day at the Lycée, a charming inſtitution, where learning ſeems ſtripped of its thorns and decorated with flowers, and where the gay and ſocial Pariſians cultivate ſcience and the belles lettres, amidſt the pleaſures and attractions of ſociety; while in England, where the art of being happy is certainly far leſs underſtood than in France, when we wiſh to acquire knowledge, we ſhut ourſelves up for that purpoſe in ſober meditation, and ſerious ſolitude. Perhaps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the knowledge gained by ſolitary ſtudy may be the moſt profound; but the knowledge acquired in ſociety leaves on the mind, the moſt agreeable impreſſion.</p>
               <p>The Lycée was formed in 1785, under the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025039_0090_0FCDAC554A4CC3B8"/>
auſpices of Monſieur the king's brother, and Monſieur d'Artois, and was ſoon reſorted to not only by men of letters, but by the moſt faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable perſons of both ſexes. Lectures are given at the Lycée by the moſt celebrated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors at Paris, on natural philoſophy, chemiſtry, natural hiſtory, botany, hiſtory, and belles let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres; and the Greek, Italian, French and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh languages are taught.</p>
               <p>The Lycèe drooped a little at the period of the revolution. In the violent convulſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that moment, literature and arts were forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But the Lycèe ſoon revived; and though its former patrons are now at Coblentz, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an attempt, of which the leſſons of hiſtory they received at the Lycèe might have taught them the ſolly and impracticability, that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving a people who are determined to be free; this inſtitution is riſing every day into higher celebrity from the eminent abilities of ſome of the profeſſors. Of their knowledge in the different ſciences they teach, I, in my ignorance, am little qualified to judge. But I can feel the charms of eloquence, and therefore find that chemiſtry, when taught by Monſ. Fourcroy, is the moſt engaging, the moſt enchanting ſcience in the world.</p>

Monſ. Garat, member of the firſt National Aſſembly, gives us lectures on Roman hiſtory, no leſs intereſting than philoſophical, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes ſuch ſublime applications to the revolution of France as call from my eyes the tears of delight and admiration.</p>
               <p>Sometimes our ſtudies are accompanied by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOU have heard no doubt that we have had a fete at Paris, on account of the arrival of the ſoldiers de Chateau-Vieux: but to give you an idea of all the diſturbance, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, quarrels, and contention, which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this <hi>civic</hi> fête, would be ſomewhat difficult. For a fortnight before it took place the whole town of Paris was thrown into the moſt violent agitation. The approaching war ſeemed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Francis might threaten, and Pruſſia might arm; but all conſideration of foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025039_0095_0FCDABFCE2C5BBC0"/>
was laid aſide, and the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux ſolely occupied the public attention. This Swiſs regiment, called the Chateau-Vieux, was one of thoſe regiments which were encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Champ de Mars before the revolution, and which were deſtined to maſſacre the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, diſſolve the ſtates-general, and lay waſte the city of Paris. But the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux diſdained to act the part which had been aſſigned them in this bloody tragedy: they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to become the aſſaſſins of the Pariſians, and declared to their officers their reſolution to break their arms in pieces, ſooner than employ them againſt the citizens. That ſoldiers ſhould dare before they drew their ſwords to deliberate whether the cauſe was juſt—that when the word of command for murder was given, they ſhould refuſe to obey, becauſe murder is a crime—was an example of morality, which, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came contagious, would, it was immediately felt, prove abſolutely deſtructive to the good old cauſe of arbitrary power; and it was reſolved to puniſh the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dared to <hi>reaſon,</hi> when <hi>fighting</hi> was the only thing for which they had received orders.</p>
               <p>The regiment of Chateau-Vieux was ſent to Nancy in that diviſion which Bouillé command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there Bouillé, who had already formed
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025039_0096_0FCDABFFCC354268"/>
his plan of trealon, attempted to light up the flames of civil war. He led the national guards, collected in haſte from the neighbouring muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, againſt the citizens of Nancy. The ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux defended th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; both parties were in the moſt fatal error; a profuſion of blood was ſhed; and Bouillé on this occaſion acted a fit prelude to that deſign of betraying his country which he had formed at the very moment when he accepted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the conſiderable force, and had ſworn fidelity to the new government. Compared to the baſeneſs of ſuch conduct, the bold open defiance of the party at Coblentz has ſomething in it manly and honourable.</p>
               <p>The day after the action at Nancy, when the ſtreets were ſtrewed with dead bodies, among which were two hundred ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux, Bouillé aſſembled a council of war, which condemned twenty-two ſoldiers of this regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be hanged, and one to be broke upon the wheel.

Forty ſtill ſurvived, and the National Aſſembly paſſed a decree for their deliverance. This decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained long unſanctioned; but, in the mean time, the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux received from the patriots of Breſt, all the ſupport and conſolation which their ſituation admitted. The ladies of Breſt viſited the galley where they were chained, and ſhed tears upon their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etters, while the patriots of Paris wearied the miniſters with applications in their behalf, and the decree at length received the royal aſſent. The ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux left Breſt and came to Paris, in order to offer the tribute of their gratitude at the bar of the National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to declare that the only uſe they deſired to make of the liberty to which they were reſtored, was that of ſhedding the laſt drop of their blood for the French nation.</p>
               <p>On their way from Breſt to Paris, they were received in every town through which they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the moſt cordial welcome. They were conſidered as the victims of the common cauſe; fetes were prepared for their reception; and bleſſings were poured forth upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly for having reſtored them to liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:025039_0098_0FCDAC614F84E680"/>
The people of Paris feeling the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, determined alſo to prepare a fête for their reception. The citizens made a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for this purpoſe, and the plan of a very magnificent proceſſion was formed. But here the tale of diſcord begins. The enemies of the public peace ſaw in this projected fête an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of fomenting diſorder and troubles, too favourable to be loſt. Reports were rapidly circulated through Paris, that this triumphal entry of the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as an inſult to the national guard, who had fought againſt them. Placards on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were paſted up in every ſtreet, hand-bills were diſtributed, incendiary pamphlets were publiſhed, the minds of the people became infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: it was aſſerted that the fête would end in a maſſacre—in ſhort, every thing was aſſerted that paſſion and party-rage could ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>The citizens, however, had gone too far to recede: the fête took place, and was the more ſingular and intereſting from being ſtripped of much of its intended ſplendour. No perſon was ſuffered to carry arms, and the ſoldiers of Chateau-Vieux, inſtead of mounting a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal car which had been prepared for them, were mixed undi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>guiſhed with the crowd. The fête, however, notwithſtanding the gloomy
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025039_0099_0FCDAC62C8CCC6F0"/>
augurs which had preceded it, paſſed without the ſmalleſt diſorder.</p>
               <p>The people, who were aſſembled to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of between three and four hundred thouſand, formed their own police: and, finding ſome difficulty at ſetting out in marſhalling the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, every one being ambitious to have a place near the triumphal car of liberty, a gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener picked a wheat-ear, with which the people conſented to regulate the order of the march, and wherever the wheat-ear was carried, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ranged themſelves in good order.</p>
               <p>Thus marſhalled by a wheat-ear, inſtead of being kept in their places as formerly by the point of bayonets, the people, whom their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had accuſed of the moſt dark and atrocious deſigns, advanced towards the Champ de Mars, indulging themſelves in all the enthuſiaſm of ſimple and affectionate joy.

attentions for which the French have ſo long been diſtinguiſhed, and which I hope they will never loſe; for why, in acquiring the great, ſhould they renounce the amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?—But to return to the fête. The people do not always reaſon very logically; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of concluding, as they ought to have done, that ſince the ariſtocrates of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais de Bourbon were fled, thoſe who remained behind were probably good patriots, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions took quite another turn. They could aſſociate no ideas of patriotiſm with the Palais de Bourbon, and accuſed us of ariſtocracy as they approached. But they did not remain long in this error. They ſoon perceived that we were entirely diſpoſed to ſympathize in their feſtivity, and alſo that part of the company were Engliſh women: while the gentlemen from our windows repeatedly called out in as loud voices as they could. "Vive la nation!" the people anſwered by crying, "Vivent les Anglaiſes!"</p>
               <p>I have juſt heard an intereſting circumſtance relating to a ſoldier of Chateau-Vieux, who is now come to Paris in order to meet his old comrades. This young man was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom the council of war at Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had condemned to die. He had gained the affections of a girl who was an inhabitant of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025039_0101_0FCDAC6448E8EDF8"/>
Nancy. With that anguiſh of heart which thoſe who have loved can perhaps conceive, and which to thoſe who have not it were vain to deſcribe, this unhappy girl ſaw her lover led to execution. The gloomy proceſſion paſſed by the houſe in which ſhe lived; and in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the tumult, and diſorder occaſioned by the number of ſoldiers who were led together to execution, and by the rage, the deſpair, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lnt emotions which agitated the ſpectators, this girl contrived to ſnatch her lover from the fate that threatened him, and concealed him in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret of the houſe ſhe inhabited. How ſhe effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this, it is difficult to imagine: but you are not ignorant that love is fertile in expedients; and however it happened, the fact certain. In this garret the young man lived concealed from every eye but that of his miſtreſs, and ſuſtained by the food which ſhe purchaſed with the labour of her hands and which ſhe brought to him in ſecret. You will imagine the pleaſure with which ſhe toiled to ſupply the wants of her lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the tears of tenderneſs and gratitude with which he bathed the hand that miniſtred to his neceſſities. At the end of two months his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a rich farmer in one of the Swiſs cantons, uncertain of the fate of his only child, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure any longer the agonies of ſuſpenſe,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025039_0102_0FCDAC068D5CFD70"/>
arrived at Nancy in ſearch of his ſon. In vain he ſought him, in vain he queſtioned every perſon he met concerning him; no tidings, no traces of him were to be ſound. The wretched pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wandered up and down the ſtreets of Nancy in deſpair. At length he was told that there was a young perſon in the town to whom his ſon had been much attached; and he was direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the houſe where the young man lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The girl, when queſtioned about her lover, at firſt ſuſpected ſome treachery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed having any knowledge of what had befallen him. But ſhe ſoon perceived in the tears which ſtreamed plentifully down the old man's cheeks, in the agony which ſeemed to be bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grey hairs to the grave, the genuine feelings of nature. She wept with him, and at length told him, that if he would call the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, ſhe would perhaps have it in her power to give him ſome tidings of his ſon. The old man departed: the girl flew to her lover, to whom ſhe deſcribed his figure, and the young man recognized the image of his father. The next day when the old man returned, the girl led him in ſilence to the chamber where his ſon was concealed. You will imagine better than I can paint the ſcene that followed—The young ſoldier, after weeping a long while on his

It is to be hoped that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the auſpices of this Jacobin miniſtry, the affairs of the ſtate will be conducted with more energy, unanimity, and order, than they have hitherto been. For though the French have not yet engaged in foreign war, hoſtilities have long ago commenced between the executive and legiſlative powers, and a warm fire has been kept up on both ſides. The union which theſe two powers formed together when the king ſigned the conſtitution, has gone on as many modern marriages do, in quarrels and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and might perhaps have ended in a divorce, but for the ſalutary intervention of this new miniſtry, which poſſeſſes the confidence of the people.</p>

The gentleman, who is an enthuſiaſtic patriot, immediately took alarm. He concluded that ſome freſh calamity had taken place; that ſome new combination of foreign powers was formed againſt the liberty of France; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with the utmoſt earneſtneſs what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>A FRIEND of mine, who is lately gone to Toulouſe, has ſent me from thence an account of ſome circumſtances which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long ago in that part of France, and which ſhe ſays are ſtill much the ſubject of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall tranſcribe this narative, which I believe will intereſt you. Perhaps a novel-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the aid of a little additional miſery, and by giving the circumſtances which actually happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a heightened colour—by taking his pallet, and daſhing with the full glow of red what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had only tinged with pale violet, might almoſt ſpin a volume from theſe materials. Yet, after all, nothing is ſo affecting as ſimplicity, and nothing ſo forcible as truth. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſend you the ſtory exactly as I received it;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025039_0108_0FCDAC6CC613FC08"/>
and in ſuch parts of it as want intereſt, I beg you will recollect that you are not reading a tale of fiction; and that in real life incidents are not always placed as they are in novels, ſo as to produce ſtage effect. In ſome parts of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative you will meet with a little romance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; ſince the ſcene is not in the cold philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic climate of England, but in the warm regions of the ſouth of France, where the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination is elevated, where the paſſions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry flaſhed from the harps of the Trouba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours amidſt the ſullen gloom of the Gothic ages.</p>
               <p>A young Frenchman, whoſe uſual reſidence was at Paris, having travelled as far as Toul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe the year before the revolution, was invited by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where ſome of them were going in purſuit of amuſement, and others in ſearch of health from the medicinal ſprings which riſe ſo plentifully, both in hot and cold ſtreams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</p>
               <p>This young Pariſian, who had ſome taſte for the ſublime ſcenery of nature, felt that it would be luxury to leave a little longer the regular walks which art has planted in the Tuilleries, and the trim gardens and jets-d'eaux ſhe has
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025039_0109_0FCDAC1064377FE8"/>
formed at Verſailles; to wander amongſt thoſe piles of mountains which overehang each other, and liſten to the torrents which fall down them with loud and irreſiſtible impetuoſity.

What powerful ſenſations does the firſt view of ſuch a ſcene produce;—we ſeem to begin a new exiſtence—every former impreſſion is for a while eraſed from the memory, and the mind feels enwrapped and loſt in the ſtrong emotions of awe, aſtoniſhment, and admiration.</p>
               <p>Bareges was crowded, as it uſually is in the ſeaſon, not only with French company, but alſo with ſtrangers, who travel from other countries, in order to uſe its celebrated baths. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany amuſed themſelves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by ſauntering, lounging, cards, lotteries, jeux-d'éſprit, and ſcandal.</p>
               <p>Bareges is a very expenſive place. Even moderate accommodations muſt be purchaſed at a high rate; and proviſions, as well as lodgings, are ſometimes obtained with difficulty. Bareges
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025039_0110_0FCD83CE577CAE18"/>
is therefore ſeldom reſorted to by any but people of conſiderable fortune, who can afford to level the obſtacles which mountains interpoſe to their conveniences and comforts, by the all-ſubduing force of gold.</p>
               <p>Among a number of perſons of rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, there was however one family at Bareges in a different ſituation. This family conſiſted of an elderly infirm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the palſy, and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a young woman about nineteen years of age. Their appearance and mode of living ſeemed to indicate, that, though in ſearch of relief this old officer had journeyed to Bareges, he had in ſo doing far exceeded the bounds of economy which his circumſtances preſcribed, and was forced to deny himſelf every accommodation his infirmities could ſpare. He lived in the moſt retired manner, in the worſt lodging at Bareges; and, while the other ladies were dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a ſtyle of expenſive variety and profuſion, his daughter wore only a plain linnen gown, which, though always perfectly clean, was coarſe; and her dark hair was left unpowdered and without any ornament whatever. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for Madelaine however (for that was her name) her perſon was calculated to make her coarſe gown appear to the beſt advantage; and
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025039_0111_0FCDAC6FEF436D20"/>
though ſhe was not very beautiful, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had an expreſſion of ſweetneſs which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</p>
               <p>The company at Bareges ſoon became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with each other, and the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their walks, which however did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did, he was ſupported on one ſide by Madelaine, and on the other by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. It was impoſſible to ſee with inſenſibility the attention which this intereſting young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paid her father, whom ſhe never quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful tenderneſs ſhe uſed to lead him along the ſtreets of Bareges, walking the ſloweſt pace ſhe could, and watching his ſteps as he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out, ſhe was ſeen at the window of their little parlour reading in order to entertain him. Her looks and manner announced that her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was naturally ſprightly, and that ſhe would have been gay, if her father had not been ſick. But all the cheerfulneſs ſhe could aſſume while he ſuffered, was exerted to amuſe him, and ſhorten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</p>
               <p>Though Madelaine was handſome, the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025039_0112_0FCDAC12B240D288"/>
and ſecluſion in which ſhe lived preſerved her from the envy of the women. They knew well enough that the gentleman at Bareges were for the moſt part men of the world, who, though they may admire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never ſo far the dupes of any tender of moral ſentiment as to let it interfere either with their vanity, their ambition, or their intereſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the French revolution had not yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, theſe ladies were aware that, with reſpect to marriage, the age of <hi>calculators</hi> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiring the graces of her perſon, and the amiable qualities which her conduct diſplayed. Madelaine in ſhort became the object of general eſteem.</p>
               <p>Auguſte, for ſo I ſhall call our young Pariſian, who has loſt his title ſince the laws of equality have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of Madelaine than the other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at Bareges; but it was perhaps becauſe he thought of her more. Sometimes in his ſolitary morning rambles he uſed to make compariſons between her and the Pariſian ladies among whom he had paſſed the winter, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon generally ended with a deep ſigh. The ſcene of theſe meditations was certainly much
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025039_0113_0FCDAC71CA75BC00"/>
in Madelaine's favour. Perhaps at Paris or Verſailles, Auguſte might have been dazzled by the poliſhed graces of a fine lady rouged, powdered, perſumed, and equipped for conqueſt. Theſe artificial attractions might perhaps have accorded well enough with clipped trees and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular walks. But Madelaine's ſimple manners, Madelaine's natural ſmiles and unſtudied bluſhes were far more in uniſon with the Pyrenean mountains.</p>
               <p>One evening, when Auguſte was walking in the town of Bareges with ſome ladies, he ſaw Madelaine at a little diſtance aſſiſting with great difficulty to ſupport her father, who appeared to be ſeized with a fit. Auguſte darted like an arrow towards the ſpot, and held up the officer till he found himſelf ſomewhat recovered; and then Auguſte, with a ſort of gentle violence, obliged Madelaine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and ſuffer him to aſſiſt the ſervant in leading him home, which was but a few ſteps farther. Auguſte entered the houſe, where he remained till the old officer was a little revived; and, after prevailing upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine to take a few hartſhorn drops, he retired.</p>
               <p>The next morning he felt that common civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity required he ſhould pay the old officer a viſit, and learn how he had paſſed the night. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025039_0114_0FCDAC140870BC70"/>
that Madelaine had the very ſame idea. "Surely," thought ſhe, "it will be very ſtrange if this young man, who was ſo kind, ſo careful of my father, and who made me take ſome harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn drops, ſhould neglect to call and enquire after us." This idea had come acroſs her mind ſeveral times; and ſhe was meditating upon it at her father's bedſide, when Auguſte was announced.</p>
               <p>The old officer, who had all the finiſhed politeneſs of his country and his profeſſion, received him in the moſt courteous manner; and, though he ſpoke with ſome difficulty, yet he was profuſe in acknowledgments for the ſervice Auguſte had rendered him. Madelaine's thanks were few and ſimply expreſſed; but the tone in which they were uttered was ſuch that Auguſte felt he could have ſacrificed his life to have deſerved them.</p>
               <p>The old officer ſtill continued ſick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Auguſte ſtill conſidered it as an indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mark of attention to go every day, and learn the ſtate of his health. He alſo began to feel that theſe viſits became every day more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own happineſs. That happineſs was indeed embittered by many painful reflections He well knew that to obtain his father the Count de—'s conſent to marry Madelaine,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025039_0115_0FCDAC76D6E2A098"/>
was as impoſſible as it was for himſelf to conqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the paſſion ſhe had inſpired. He knew exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this ſubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be anſwered. The firſt was—"How many thouſand livres has ſhe a year?" And the ſecond—"Is ſhe noble?" And nothing could be more embarraſſing than that the enquiry concerning fortune would, he was ſure, come firſt; ſince that was the only article which could not be anſwered in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory manner; for to Madelaine's family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not abſolutely contaminate the pure ſtreams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <hi>rotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> they had always ſufficient generoſity to abate ſome generations of nobility in favour of a proper equivalent in wealth.</p>
               <p>Auguſte, while he was convinced of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of obtaining his father's conſent to his marriage, did not pay Madelaine one viſit the leſs from that conſideration; and when the uſual hour of his viſit arrived, he often ſuddenly broke a chain of admirable reaſoning on the imprudence of his attachment, in order to haſten to the dwelling of her he loved. In a ſhort time he ceaſed all kind of reaſoning on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025039_0116_0FCDAC16F5A9A008"/>
and abandoned his heart without reſerve to the moſt violent and unconquerable paſſion.</p>
               <p>Auguſte made a declaration to the old officer of the ſentiment which his daughter had inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The old gentleman mentioned it to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine, and ſhe only anſwered by tears of which he perfectly underſtood the meaning. When Auguſte explained his ſituation with reſpect to his father, the officer deſired him to think of his daughter no more. Auguſte felt that he might as well have deſired him to ceaſe to breathe. He continued his viſits, and the officer was ſoon reduced to that ſtate of languor and debility which left him neither the power nor the wiſh to forbid them. His complaints increaſed ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery day, and were attended with many alarming ſymptoms. The ſeaſon for the waters of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eges was now paſt, and all the company left the place, except the old officer, who was too weak to be removed, and Auguſte, who, while Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine remained, had no power to tear himſelf from the ſpot. In a few weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Auguſte knelt with Madelaine at his bedſide—her voice was ſuffocated by tears; and Auguſte had ſcarcely power to articulate in broken accents that he would devote his life to the happineſs of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025039_0117_0FCDAC794EF94850"/>
a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and ſoon after expired. Madelaine mourned for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover diſpel that anguiſh with which her affectionate heart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the loſs of her parent.</p>
               <p>The winter being far advanced, ſhe propoſed to defer her journey to the diſtant province where ſhe and her father had lived, until ſpring, and to place herſelf in the mean time in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not far from Bareges. Auguſte exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent immediately to a private marriage. She heſitated at this propoſal; and while they were converſing together on the ſubject, the door of the room in which they were ſitting was ſuddenly thrown open, and Auguſte ſaw his father the Count de—enter. He had heard of the attachment which detained his ſon at Bareges, and had haſtened to tear him from the ſpot before it was too late. He upbraided his ſon with great bitterneſs, and began alſo to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid Madelaine: but there was ſomething in her looks, her ſilence, and her tears, which ſtifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to addreſs her; and ordering his ſon to leave the room, he deſired to ſpeak to her alone. After explaining to her the abſolute impoſſibility
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025039_0118_0FCDAC17CAE4A2A0"/>
of her being ever united to her ſon, and his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to diſinherit him, and leave his whole fortune to his ſecond ſon, if Auguſte ſhould perſiſt in his attachment to her—after endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to awaken her pride and her generoſity, he deſired to know where ſhe propoſed going. She told him her intention of placing herſelf immediately in the convent of—. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of this deſign, and left her to go to his ſon. No ſooner was the door of the room ſhut, than Madelaine gave way to thoſe tears which ſhe had ſcarcely been able to reſtrain while the Count was ſpeaking. She had never felt ſo ſenſibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father was mingled with the agony of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed love.</p>
               <p>Meantime the Count de—declared to his ſon, that his only chance of ever obtaining his miſtreſs depended on his abſolute unconditional ſubmiſſion to his commands, and that he muſt inſtantly attend him to Paris. Auguſte eagerly enquired what was to become of Madelaine; and his father told him that ſhe had determined to take refuge in the convent of—. Auguſte abſolutely refuſed to depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The Count
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025039_0119_0FCDAC7AD03C0180"/>
was obliged to conſent; but before he ſuffered them to meet, he obtained a promiſe from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine not to mention to her lover any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the converſation which had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Count.</p>
               <p>Auguſte, in this laſt interview with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, atoned for the cruel diſdain of his father, by the moſt ſolemn and paſſionate aſſurances of fidelity, not to be ſhaken by time or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and then, after attempting to leave the room ſeveral times, and returning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> often, he at length tore himſelf away. Madelaine, when ſhe ſaw him depart, felt that every earthly hope had vaniſhed with him.</p>
               <p>She ſet out early the next morning for the convent of—; but not till after ſhe had ſat for ſome time weeping in the chair which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſte uſed to occupy.</p>
               <p>Madelaine paſſed the remaining part of the winter in the convent of—, during which period ſhe received frequent letters from Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te; and when ſpring arrived he conjured her, inſtead of removing to her own province, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a little longer in her preſent ſituation; and flattered her with hopes of being able ere long to fulfil thoſe engagements upon which all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:025039_0120_0FCDAC7C4A2ECFC0"/>
In the ſummer of this year an event took place which will render that ſummer for ever memorable. The French nation, too enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to bear any longer thoſe monſtrous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ignorance of its juſt rights alone had tolerated, ſhook off its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etters, and the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which ſhe was told had made every Frenchman free. "And if every Frenchman is free," thought Madelaine "ſurely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves." It appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, points upon which ſhe had not much meditated, out of the queſtion, obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the troubles of a revolution; and ſhe was as warm a patriot from this ſingle idea, as if ſhe had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the declaration of rights made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Aſſembly, in all its extent and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>The Count de—, who was informed of the correſpondence between the two lovers, and who ſaw little hopes of his ſon's ſubduing a paſſion which this intercourſe of letters ſerved to cheriſh, contrived means to have Auguſte's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine inquired with all the anxiety of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025039_0121_0FCDAC19F454C250"/>
for letters. In vain ſhe counted the hours till the return of the poſt-days. Poſt after poſt arrived, and brought no tidings of Auguſte. Three months paſſed in the cruel torments of anxiety and ſuſpenſe, and were at length ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by deſpair. Madelaine believed ſhe was forgotten—forgotten by Auguſte!—She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted her own heart, and it ſeemed to her impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; yet, after a ſilence of three months, ſhe could doubt no longer.</p>
               <p>Poor Madelaine now recollected with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, inſtead of pleaſure, that all Frenchmen were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ree. She would have found ſome ſad conſolation in believing that all Frenchmen were ſlaves. It would have been ſome allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſorrows if Auguſte had been forced to abandon her; and ſhe fancied ſhe could have borne to loſe him, if ſhe had been ſure that he ſtill loved her—it was loſing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</p>
               <p>The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own ſupport, was inſufficient to defray her expences as a penſioner in the convent. She had already, by her ſweetneſs and gentleneſs, gained the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſome of the nuns, to whom ſhe was alſo attached, and who inceſſantly conjured her
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025039_0122_0FCDAC1DF7A87D48"/>
to take the veil. "And why," ſhe ſometimes exclaimed, "why ſhould I heſitate any longer in ſo doing? Since Auguſte is loſt, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice do I make? What happineſs do I reſign?"</p>
               <p>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which ſhe knew but little: but to ſeparate herſelf irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably, and for ever, from him to whom her ſoul was devoted—to ſee him, to hear his voice no more—to take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him—to baniſh him even from her thoughts—alas! Madelaine felt like Eloiſa—
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Auguſte might love her ſtill—"And am I then," thought Madelaine, "going to reduce myſelf to a ſtate in which I ſhall be forced to wiſh he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, in order to ſave me from the agonies of remorſe!"—She put off her thoughts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on her novitiate for ſome weeks longer—no letters arrived, and again her reſolution to take the veil returned. "Why," cried ſhe, "why ſhould I ſtill continue to lament that inconſtant lover who thinks of me no more?

Alas, alas, did he not ſee the anguiſh of my ſoul at parting with him?—Does he not know the deſerted ſituation in which I am left?—Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource than taking the veil—no doubt he wiſhes to hear I have done ſo—he will find in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the world ſome excuſe for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity—Oh, heavens! will Auguſte hear then that I am ſeparated from him for ever without one ſigh?—Ah, why need I deliberate any longer?—My trials will ſoon be paſt—I feel that my heart will break—yes, death will come to my relief—and in heaven I ſhall find my father!"</p>
               <p>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy ſiſterhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, proſtrate with her face towards the earth, and with flowers ſcattered over her, and a part of her long treſſes cut off, ſhe was to enter upon that ſolemn trial preparatory to her eternal renunciation of the world—of Auguſte!</p>
               <p>A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the parlour, where ſhe found her lover, with ſome of the municipal officers of the town, wearing their national ſcarfs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:025039_0124_0FCDAC204EBA6E78"/>
Madelaine, at the ſight of Auguſte, with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty reached a chair, in which ſhe fell back ſenſeleſs; while Auguſte could not forbear utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome imprecations againſt the iron grate by which they were ſeparated, and which prevented him from flying to her aſſiſtance. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, procured help, and Madelaine recovered.</p>
               <p>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the National Aſſembly, forbidding any nuns to be profeſſed. He added, that the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality had already given information of this new law to the abbeſs, who had conſented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. As he pronounced theſe laſt words, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine looked at her lover. Auguſte haſtened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him and pitied his ſufferings, had at length made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father conſented to his marriage with Madelaine.</p>
               <p>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to thoſe delicious tears which were poured from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulneſs, and joy. When her firſt emotions had ſubſided, ſhe began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the convent
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025039_0125_0FCDAC81825A3FC8"/>
on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as ſhe laid aſide the white gown in which ſhe was to be married the next morning; "and this laſt de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next morning Auguſte and Madelaine were married in the pariſh-church of—, and immediately after the ceremony ſet out for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, where they now live, and are, I am told, two of the happieſt people and the beſt patriots in France.</p>

               <p>A Curé of my acquaintance is juſt going to be married. He has had a literary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the biſhop of his dioceſe, on the right of the clergy to marry. The curé inſiſts that it is the natural right of every man to take unto himſelf a wife, if he thinks proper to run that riſk; and he confeſſed to me yeſterday, that, though he felt not the ſmalleſt inclination to enter into the marriage ſtate, but on the contrary

preferred a ſingle life, he had reſolved upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony merely to ſhew Monſ. l'Evêque, that a prieſt might take that meaſure if he pleaſed. I know ſome married people both in France and and England, who would perhaps think this is carrying the deſire of triumph in argument rather too great a length; and who would, I believe, counſel the curé to yield this polemic victory, ſooner than purchaſe it with a wife into the bargain. But my friend the curé is ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I am perſuaded he will make an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent huſband, and will be happy in ſpite of the biſhop.</p>
               <p>I go frequently to a ſpacious church which the French proteſtants have lately purchaſed, called St. Thomas de Louvre, where divine worſhip is performed every Sunday, and where the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was laſt week adminiſtered. The idea that in the boſom of that city, even on the very ſpot which a few ages paſt was ſtained by the moſt cruel perſecution of the proteſtants, we were now publicly exerciſing the moſt ſolemn rite of our religion, in the preſence of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Roman Catholics, who witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that ſacred ceremony with the moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſilence and attention—this reflection, joined to the tender recollection of my own country, to which I was led by hearing the ſervice perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and joy, wore the aſpect of all others the moſt enchanting to the eye, and the moſt ſoothing to the imagination. Yet the contemplation of returning ſpring naturally leads the mind to recal the ſprings that are paſt, and to take a retroſpect of life: and thoſe in whom ſuch a retroſpect excites no melancholy reflections muſt ſurely be either peculiarly fortunate, or peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
               <p>But, at the ſame time, we find in the lovely images which ſpring preſents, a cure for thoſe gloomy reflections which the return of that ſeaſon has perhaps awakened. For while we ſee nothing around us but images of beauty and delight, "while nothing ſtrikes the eye but ſights of bliſs," the darker ſhades of care and ſorrow vaniſh, and leave only that gentle and tender melancholy which it is luxury to indulge—"that ſadneſs of the countenance by which the heart is made better."</p>

               <p>The maſter of the inn having got the better of the ill-humour our firſt enquiries had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, aſſured us we ſhould have an excellent ſupper, and that he underſtood the art of cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery perfectly, having aſſiſted ſome years in the kitchen of Madame la Princeſſe de Monaco. He by no means over-rated his talents; the ſupper was extremely well dreſſed.

               <p>Montreuil is an old melancholy looking town, with no trade, and few inhabitants.

               <p>Here are a great number of very ancient Gothic edifices; and one of them, near which we are lodged, affords me frequent ſubject of meditation. This is the Hotel-Dieu. In every town of France you find one of thoſe hoſpitals called Hotel-Dieu, where the ſick are attended by an order of nuns, who take
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025039_0132_0FCDAC8D14A95E20"/>
vows to devote their lives to that purpoſe. The moſt perfect cleanlineſs and order reigns in theſe houſes. But how great are the ſacrifices made, from a principle of piety, by theſe nuns, many of whom are in the very bloom of youth! to devote life to the moſt diſguſting occupations—to breathe only the air of contagion—to watch in ſad ſucceſſion every ſixth or eighth night, through the long years of life, in the chambers of diſeaſe—to dreſs wounds—to perform for ſtrangers thoſe offices at which nature moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils, and which we can ſcarcely fulfil without reluctance, even for thoſe to whom our ſouls are bound by the ſtrongeſt ties of duty and affection—to bear with unwearied patience the never-ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groans of thoſe that ſuffer—to adminiſter, with that unfailing tenderneſs which long habit has not blunted, the remedies preſcribed—to live amongſt the dying—theſe ſurely are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which nothing but a ſentiment of religion could inſpire—Surely it may be ſaid of ſuch perſons, "Ye are not of this world!"</p>
               <p>When we turn our thoughts from ſuch a ſcene as this, to that unfeeling indifference which prevails in the world—its ſelfiſh purſuit of its own intereſt—its eager ſearch of its own gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations—its coldneſs to the pains of others—its vanities—its littleneſs—its luxuries—we find it at a diſtance ſo remote from ſuch virtue, that
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025039_0133_0FCDAC8E61C366F0"/>
the nuns of the Hotels-Dieu appear like beings elevated above our pity, and only call forth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
               <p>On Sunday laſt, after veſpers, the tree of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty was planted, with great rejoicings, in the middle of the ſquare in which we live. A flag, from which ſtreamed the national colours, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               <p>Let us alſo remember that the great cauſe of liberty remains uncontaminated by the aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Liſle. Though fanatical bigots, in the rage of ſuperſtitious cruelty, have dragged their victims to the ſtake, would it be rational to extend our abhorrence of ſuch actions to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity itſelf?—to that benevolent religion which inculcates univerſal charity, love, and good will towards men, and chooſe the comfortleſs, the ſullen indifference of atheiſm.</p>

tranquillity of deſpotiſm? If the bleſſings of freedom have ſometimes been abuſed, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not yet well underſtood. Thoſe occaſional evils which have happened in the infant ſtate of liberty, are but the effects of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. Men have been long treated with inhumanity, therefore they are ferocious. They have often been betrayed, therefore they are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious. They have once been ſlaves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are tyrants. They have been uſed to a ſtate of warfare, and are not yet accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to univerſal benevolence. They have long been ignorant, and have not yet attained ſufficient knowledge. They have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to darkneſs, and their eyes are dazzled by light. The French have thrown aſide the ritual of deſpotiſm; but they have not all had time to learn the liturgy of that new conſtitution which is laid upon the altar of their country. But the genuine principles of enlightened free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will ſoon be better comprehended, and may perhaps at no diſtant period be adopted by all the nations of Europe. Liberty may bring "her ſons from afar, and her daughters from the ends of the earth."</p>
