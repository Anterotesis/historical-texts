            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM CXLIV, 12.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>That our ſons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner ſtones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a palace</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is natural for us to look forward with the hope of future good. This anticipation of futurity is one evidence of our immortality. We weary ourſelves to find happineſs in this world: but our labours are baffled, and our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſappointed. We are never at reſt, until we are ſettled in the firm belief, and filled with the cheerful hope of happineſs in the world to come. In youth, while we are climbing the hill of life, we amuſe ourſelves with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which opens before us: but when we have paſſed the ſummit, and are treading the downward path, the worldly proſpect ſhortens—and ſhortens, the ſhadows ſtretch over us, and we find ourſelves, at every ſtep, ſinking into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vale of infirmity and age. Our earthly proſpects are now in poſterity: Our brighter proſpects are in God.</p>
            <p>THE parent rejoices to ſee his children riſing to virtuous dignity and uſefulneſs. The hope that he ſhall live in them—that his labours will contribute to their happineſs—that their worthy conduct will embalm his name and reſcue it from oblivion, conſoles him in the melancholy thought of his haſtening diſſolution.</p>
            <p>THE patriot has much the ſame feelings toward his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the parent toward his family. He delights in its preſent proſperity—he ſeems to ſhare in its diſtant glory—he appropriates the happineſs it will enjoy after his connection with it ſhall ceaſe. It is this anticipation which prompts his exertions for the advancement of arts, learning and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. When David, in the pſalm before us, prayed that God would deliver the people of Iſrael from the invaſion of foreign enemies, who were ſtrangers to the true God, he had regard not only to the preſent, but to ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037783_0004_100F4CDE947653B8"/>
Rid me and deliver me from the hand of ſtrange children, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity, and whoſe right hand is a right hand of falſe-hood, that our ſons may riſe like young flouriſhing trees, until they attain their full ſtature and ſtrength; and our daughters adorned with virtuous manners, may ſtand like pillars of poliſhed marble, which beautify and ſupport a palace.'</p>
            <p>HE deprecated the admiſſion of foreigners, the worſhippers of falſe gods, into his country, leſt ſucceeding generations ſhould be corrupted in their principles and manners, and thus the ſentiments of piety and virtue ſhould be baniſhed from the land.</p>
            <p>HENCE then we learn the ſenſe which David had of the importance of the riſing generation. This is the thought which I intend to illuſtrate and improve.</p>
            <p>GOD has appointed the human race to be continued by ſucceſſion; and each generation is an eſſential link in the chain.</p>
            <p>THE Creator has framed a univerſe, and peopled it with an endleſs variety of beings, riſing in a gradual ſcale from the borders of nothing upwards to a degree of perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our preſent conceptions. In this ſcale the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies holds an important place. However ſmall we my appear in compariſon with angels; yet, conſidered as rational and immortal beings, deſigned for an endleſs exiſtence, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of continual improvement in knowledge, virtue and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we are of vaſt importance.</p>
            <p>THE particular regard, which the Creator has ſhown for us in providing a world for our habitation, in ſpreading around us bountiful ſupplies for our wants—in appointing his angels to be our miniſters and guardians—in giving his Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the ruins of our apoſtacy—and in furniſhing us with the neceſſary means of ſcientific, moral and religious advancement, ſhews that we are beings of diſtinguiſhed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in his univerſal plan, and that by means of our race ſome grand and glorious purpoſes are to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>IF our race is ſo important, we are not to look with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference on the generation which is riſing after us. They are rational and immortal beings—they are in a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation—they are a part of that ſpecies which the Son of God
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037783_0005_100F4CE0E28C5088"/>
came to redeem—and they are the perſons on whom the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our race depends.</p>
            <p>THEY are of <hi>particular</hi> importance in the <hi>families</hi> to which they belong.</p>
            <p>WHEN our children are young, we obſerve with pleaſure the gradual opening of their tender minds toward reaſon and maturity. We promiſe ourſelves ſtill greater ſatisfaction, when we ſhall one day ſee them acting a worthy part on the ſtage of life. Our labour and expence in their ſupport and education are encouraged by the expectation of their preſent improvement and future uſefulneſs; and amply repaid, when this expectation is realized.</p>
            <p>MANY of the ſervices neceſſary to the ſupport of human life call for the vigour, activity and enterprize of youth, and muſt be entirely neglected, if none were found but ſuch as have paſt this ſprightly period. It is the riſing generation which muſt be our ſupport and comfort in that evil day, 'when the keepers of the houſe ſhall tremble, and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelves—when the doors ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets, and they that look out at the windows ſhall be darkened—when we ſhall riſe up at the voice of the bird and fear ſhall be in the way.' In the proſpect of this uncomfortable ſeaſon, it is a relief to hope that we ſhall be ſtrong in the vigour, and ſecure in the virtue of thoſe who are growing up under our care. In this view, children are an heritage of the Lord, and as arrows in the hands of the mighty.'</p>
            <p>THE riſing generation are of great importance in <hi>civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> The defence of the ſtate in a time of war, and the promotion of arts in a time of peace, depend chiefly on <hi>them.</hi> As we advance toward old age, our ſpirit for enterprize, our reſolution to meet danger, and our ability to ſuſtain hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſenſibly decline. In this languid period, our exertions are prompted by the ſpirit of our children, and ſtrengthened by our regard for their intereſt. Were it not for their lively ambition, and our parental affection, we ſhould languiſh out the latter part of life in a dull purſuit of the old beaten track. It is the ardour of the ſon, which gives activity to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the father. The ambition of the former, directed by the prudence and checked by the caution of the latter, operates to uſeful improvements, and keeps the world in progreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037783_0006_100F4CE32C8D8098"/>
THEY who are now young are ſoon to take into their own hands the great affairs of ſociety; and general peace, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will be connected with the part they act. By their virtue and prudence, they will diffuſe happineſs around and tranſmit it to the next ſucceeding age; or by their folly and vice they will ſpread general miſery and entail it on thoſe who ſhall come after them.</p>
            <p>ON the riſing generation will depend the continuance and increaſe of <hi>uſeful knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE preſent advanced ſtate of the mechanical and liberal arts by which life is embelliſhed, and the mind enlarged is the work of many ages. The early condition of mankind was rude and uncultivated. Their firſt occupations were ſuch as neceſſity dictated, and piety preſcribed—the culture of the ground for food, and the keeping of ſheep &amp; cattle for cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and for ſacrifice. Their labours in opening the ground for paſturage, and in mellowing the ſoil for corn, muſt, for want of inſtruments, have been difficult and ſlow. We have no account of the uſe of iron and braſs until the eighth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Adam. For a long time mankind had much dependence on the ſpontaneous productions of the earth. Their firſt cloathing was made of the ſkins of beaſts. The manufacture of wool and other materials was a ſubſequent invention. Theſe probably were firſt wrought, not by the contexture of threads, as they are now among us; but by the contuſion of the maſs until the natural fibres were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; as is ſtill the method among ſome ſavage tribes. About the time that braſs and iron came into uſe, was invented the conſtruction of tents, and the formation of muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It was a long time before the ſtrength of beaſts, the impulſe of wind, the weight of water-falls, and the mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical powers of the wheel and the pully, were applied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the weakneſs and lighten the labour of men. The long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evity of the firſt generation, was favorable to improvement. But while the art of writing was unknown, the progreſs of invention muſt have been very moderate, and its communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation much confined. Geography would ſcarcely extend beyond the limits of their own travels—mathematicks would be little more than the enumeration of their flocks and herds—aſtronomy would be only ſuch an obſervation of the ſtars as was neceſſary to guide them in their journey, and direct them in their huſbandry. The firſt writing was by the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037783_0007_100F4CE4D7451B88"/>
and ſymbols of things; which would be but few, and theſe often of doubtful ſignification. It is a queſtion wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alphabetical writing can be traced higher than the time of Moſes. If letters were known earlier, probably they were of the nature of our numerical figures, the ſigns of ideas, rather than of ſounds. Alphabetical writing greatly facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the progreſs of learning, which has ſince been much improved by the invention of printing. The diffuſion of knowledge has been greatly aſſiſted by the art of navigation, which has opened an eaſy communication among the nations of the earth. Mankind are ſtill making progreſs; and a few generations hence may have the benefit of arts as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, as were the magnet and printing type, a few centuries ago; or ſome late invented engines in the beginning of the preſent century.</p>
            <p>OUR elevation in arts and refinement is the acquiſition of ages. If this were by any means loſt, ages and ages muſt paſs away before it would be again recovered: And it is doubtful whether mankind could ſurvive the loſs. The riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation are the depoſitaries of theſe treaſures of ſcience. Into their hands we are to commit them: And they, in their turn, muſt convey them, with their own additional improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the generation which ſhall ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> is a matter of ſtill higher importance. With this the preſent proſperity and future felicity of mankind are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially connected. The care God has taken to impart to us the knowledge of it by the miniſtry of his own ſon, and of holy men inſpired with his own Spirit, demonſtrates our infinite concern in it. He taught it to former ages in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural way. In theſe ages he leaves it to be conveyed on from one generation to another by means of a ſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and an inſtituted miniſtry. If religion ſhould be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neglected, revelation exploded and the miniſtry diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in one age, the next would come forward in ignorance of the truth and in depravation of manners; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would experience all the miſeries of prevailing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in this world, and ſtand expoſed to its more dreadful effects in another.</p>
            <p>WE are placed under a government the moſt liberal and happy of any known among the nations of the earth. But our government reſts on the baſis of religion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037783_0008_100F4CE79B3BF450"/>
out it cannot be ſuſtained in its preſent form. There may, indeed, be government without religion; but it will be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of terror and force; not of reaſon &amp; juſtice. When Iſrael was without the true God, without a teaching prieſt, and without the law, there was no peace to him, that went out, not to him that came in; but great vexations on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The experiment of government without religion has lately been made in Europe; and its effects have been too diſaſtrous to justify a repetition. A man muſt be either blinded by enmity to truth, or very careleſs in his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the tendency of things, not to have ſeen, in the courſe of a few years paſt, the connection of religion with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſociety, and the operation of infidelity to produce miſſery and confuſion. On this ſubject experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation have thrown ſuch light, as human reaſoning could not have diſplayed. And there is ground to hope that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has received ſome additional ſupport in this land from the attempts to undermine it in another. As we wiſh to leave with our children the privileges of a free government, we muſt train them up in the faith and obedience of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The preſent youth are the perſons by whom religion is to be preſerved and communicated in the world. If in their hands it ſhould be loſt, there is no reaſon to expect a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to reſtore it: But the ignorance and irreligion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in them will run on and ſpread round, how far, and how wide, none can tell. Such is the corruption of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that its tendency is not to amendment, but to increaſing depravation. This will be the effect, when reſtraints are caſt off, and the means of knowledge and virtue are thrown aſide. Hence God threatens, that he will viſit the iniquities of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him. Not that he will puniſh the <hi>obedient</hi> for the iniquities of their fathers; but he will puniſh theſe iniquities in the children who <hi>retain</hi> them and <hi>continue</hi> to hate God as their fathers have done before them. The threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is grounded on a natural preſumption, that the children, from one generation to another, will adopt and practiſe their fathers' ſins.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider, that the virtue, liberty and happineſs of many generations will depend on the youth who are now coming forward, and that unborn millions will be happy or miſerable here and for ever, according as theſe ſhall ſupport
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037783_0009_100F4CE950168F90"/>
or neglect religion, we muſt regard them as beings of mighty conſequence to the world and feel ourſelves bound to treat them accordingly.</p>
            <p>OUR preceeding obſervations fully evince, that the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth is an object which demands our moſt zealous attention. There is no way in which we can ſo eſſentially promote the great intereſts of humanity, as by training up this young generation to induſtry, ſcience and religion. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will be our nation while their ſons are as plants grown up in their youth, and their daughters as corner ſtones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a palace. The ſtructure of ſociety muſt not be an unſhapely pile of rude ſtones promiſcuouſly thrown together, as they are taken from the quarry; but a compact and well proportioned edifice of regular pieces, fitted each to its place, poliſhed by the tool of education, and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united by the cement of benevolence and virtue. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, horrible while it ſtands, will ſoon tumble into ruins; the latter, beautiful in its appearance, will be permanent in duration.</p>
            <p>THE education of youth muſt be begun in the families in which they are placed. But it cannot be completed here. As they are growing up to be members of a larger ſociety, ſome publick proviſion ought to be made for their obtaining a more elevated education, than can be given them within their native walls.</p>
            <p>IN the ſettled ſtate of the Jewiſh nation, ſeminaries were early erected, and liberally endowed for the education of young men to publick uſefulneſs, eſpecially to offices in the church. To preſide in theſe ſchools, perſons eminent for their wiſdom, learning and ſanctity were appointed; and into them were freely admitted ſuch young men as diſcovered a taſte &amp; aptitude for uſeful knowledge. To theſe ſchools Solomon probably alludes in the beginning of the IX Chapter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs. <q>Wiſdom hath builded her houſe, ſhe hath hewn out her ſeven pillars; ſhe hath killed her beaſts; ſhe hath mingled her wine; ſhe hath alſo furniſhed her table. She hath ſent forth her maidens; ſhe crieth upon the higheſt places of the city.</q> And this is her cry; <q>Whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. Forſake the fooliſh and live; and go in the way of underſtanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037783_0010_100F4CEC5E2E3240"/>
               <q>THE early Chriſtians,' ſays Dr. Moſheim, took all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care to accuſtom their children to the ſtudy of the holy ſcriptures, and to inſtruct them in the doctrines of their holy religion. For this purpoſe ſchools were every where erected, even from the commencement of the Chriſtian church. Beſides the ſchools deſtined for children, there were Academies erected in ſeveral large cities, in which perſons of riper years, eſpecially ſuch as aſpired to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick teachers, were inſtructed in the different branches of human learning and ſacred erudition. And we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly attribute to the Apoſtles themſelves and their injunctions to their diſciples the excellent eſtabliſhments, in which the youth deſtined for the holy miniſtry received an education ſuitable to the ſolemn office they were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE legal inſtitution of ſchools in their ſeveral grades is a privilege which commenced with the ſettlement of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and which has had the moſt happy effects. By means of this inſtitution our children are early formed to the love of knowledge, to ſentiments of virtue, to decency of manners, to habits of ſubordination, and to a preparation for publick uſefulneſs. To this it is greatly owing that knowledge is ſo generally diffuſed, and that civil ſociety is in ſo orderly and peaceful a ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE ordinary ſchools maintained in our ſeveral towns are well adapted to the object of their inſtitution. But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there ſhould be ſome in ſociety, who have an educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuperior to that which theſe ſchools are competent to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. For this purpoſe our colleges are founded. But a regular collegiate education is beyond the reach of of many happy geniuſes who wiſh to riſe above the education of an ordinary ſchool. Therefore certain intermediate ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are inſtituted by authority, &amp; endowed by publick grants and private benefactions, that with moderate expenſe the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of learning may obtain an education which will gratify their literary taſte, and lay a good foundation for farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and for more general uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>OF this kind is the WESTFIELD ACADEMY, which we, this day, dedicate to the purpoſe of erudition, and commend to the bleſſing of Providence.</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of an application from the citizens of this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037783_0011_100F4CEE9C4F7790"/>
town, the legiſlature of our Commonwealth have here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted an Academy, endowed it with competent priviledges, and appropriated for its uſe a valuable tract of land, which, with the addition made by the town, will we hope, ſoon prove a fund competent to the purpoſes of the inſtitution. By a farther grant of the town and the ſubſcriptions of particular Gentlemen in it, an elegant and capacious edifice is erected for the accommodation of ſtudents, and now prepared for their reception; and a gentleman of approved ability and character is procured, and is now preſent to whoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate government &amp; inſtruction the ſtudents will be committed.</p>
            <p>THE object of the inſtitution is to train up youth of both ſexes in virtue and ſcience. Reading, writing, arithmetic, elegant compoſition, and graceful ſpeaking will be here taught. Such as aſpire to a higher education will be aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in acquiring a knowledge of the learned languages, geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, mathematicks, and ſuch other branches of erudition as are taught in our univerſities. Particular attention will be given to the morals of the youth; and inſtruction in the principles and duties of religion will not be neglected. With a view to theſe objects the Truſtees will ever be careful, that the preceptors and teachers in this Academy be men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed learning and exemplary converſation, and that they be the profeſſed friends of piety and religion.</p>
            <p>A STRICT government will be neceſſary in the Academy. But this will be maintained, not by corporal or neceſſary puniſhments; but by means better adapted to influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous minds. Offenders, on whom ſuch means are unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, will be deemed unworthy of a place in the Academy; and they muſt retire.</p>
            <p>THE expenſe of tuition will be as moderate as the ſupport of the inſtitution will allow; and as ſoon as our funds come into operation, we hope this expence will be reduced.</p>
            <p>THE funds and donations already committed, and ſuch as may hereafter be committed to the Truſtees, will be faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appropriated; the will of benefactors will be religiouſly obeyed, and a ſtrict oeconomy will be obſerved. We anticipate the time, when this inſtitution will become reſpectable for numbers, order, virtue and ſcience, under the care of able in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors and the patronage of liberal benefactors. We hope,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037783_0012_100F275FF2E553D0"/>
from the proceeds of our funds and from the munificence of the friends of ſcience, ſoon to ſee the Academy furniſhed with a neceſſary philoſophical apparatus, a uſeful library, and a valuable collection of curioſities, to ſtimulate the enquiries and aſſiſt the improvements of the ſtudents. But an infant inſtitution muſt have time for growth and maturity.</p>
            <p>THE progreſs, reputation and uſefulneſs of this Academy will much depend on the wiſdom and virtue of the people, &amp; eſpecially of the influential characters of the town in which it is placed.</p>
            <p>WE commend the zeal and liberality of the town in the cauſe of learning and religion. We applaud the generoſity and publick ſpirit of thoſe gentlemen, who, in addition to the grant of the town, have largely contributed to the erection &amp; completion of the edifice, which we this day dedicate to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſcience. But remember, gentlemen, your work is only begun. If it ſtop here, your labor and expenſe are loſt, and the laudable purpoſe of your exertions is defeated. You have done much in pecuniary contributions: You have ſtill much to do in another line. There is a duty which you owe and which you will continually owe to this inſtitution. As it is placed among you, ſo on your virtuous influence its reſpectability; yea, its exiſtence will principally depend. Had we the remoteſt idea, that the youth who become its members, would here be contaminated in their principles and depraved in their manners, and go abroad to ſpread the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption among others, we ſhould by no means have given it our countenance, nor this day have aſſiſted in its dedication. Should this unhappily prove to be the caſe, no virtuous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent will ſend a ſon or daughter to it for an education; and it will, of conſequence, expire in diſgrace. With a regard to the uſefulneſs of the inſtitution, the intereſt of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the good of our country and the honor of religion, we expect—&amp; we ſhall require, that the pupils be reſtrained from impiety, profaneneſs, diſſipation, riot and gambling—from mingling with licentious company, and reſorting to places of temptation. Let there then be nothing of this kind among you. We expect—and we ſhall require, that they here be nurtured in the principles of religion, in ſentiments of piety, in habits of virtue, in a love of order, in decency of behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037783_0013_100F4CF28067FD18"/>
in ſobriety of manners, in a reverence for, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the inſtituted worſhip of God. Among you let theſe things be conſpicuous. You eaſily ſee, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of our object will materially depend on the wiſe &amp; virtuous conduct of the citizens and youths of this town. It will be difficult—it will be impoſſible for the immediate gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernors of the Academy to preſerve order and virtue among their pupils amids counter examples; but amidſt concurrent examples their taſk will be eaſy.</p>
            <p>WILL not my age, my truſt, my appointment for this day excuſe me, and entitle me to your attention, my young friends while I exhort you, in regard to your own reputation and ſafety—in regard to the honor of this infant inſtitution—in regard to the youths who ſhall ſeek an education here, to ſhun and deteſt thoſe evil communications which corrupt good manners? Let it never be reported abroad, or known here, that any of you are profane, diſorderly, riotous, gamblers, ſabbath-breakers, ſcoffers at religion, lovers of ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and enticers to evil. Let it appear, and let it every where be ſpoken to your honor, that you are ſober, virtuous, godly, obedient to domeſtic order, and obſervant of religious worſhip. Then our ſons and daughters, who come to reſide among you, will from your example learn the things which are virtuous and praiſe worthy, the things which are lovely and of good report. Then you will not only feel a conſcious pleaſure in your own virtue, but enjoy an additional ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in having diffuſed its influence far around.</p>
            <p>YOU who are maſters of families are always under ſacred obligations; but now you will be under <hi>new</hi> obligations, to watch over your children and domeſtics, and to maintain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, virtue and religion in your houſes; for you will thus render a moſt important ſervice to the children of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren abroad. In ſome of your families our children muſt reſide. Let them there hear nothing, but what deſerves their attention—ſee nothing but what is worthy of their imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let them ſee peace and harmony, government and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, a reverence for God's word and an obſervance of his worſhip. Let them hear nothing impious and profane, diſreſpectful of the ſcriptures, or contemptuous of divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Treat our children as <hi>your own;</hi> at leaſt ſo far as to give them ſeaſonable cautions and rebukes. We feel a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037783_0014_100F4CF7E37437B8"/>
ſolicitude for our children, when they are removed from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our eye. A perſuaſion that they are placed in orderly and religious families and under the inſpection of our pious and faithful friends, greatly relieves our anxiety.</p>
            <p>I BEGIN to fear, I ſhall be thought to have ſtepped over my line. Your goodneſs, however, will excuſe the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. I ſpeak not theſe things from an apprehenſion of any <hi>peculiar</hi> danger in this town. I honour you as the friends of order, virtue &amp; religion. But in regard to this infant academy, and to the youth who may ſeek an education in it, I felt an impulſe of duty, which I could not eaſily repreſs, to hold up to you ſome ſalutary cautions. In expreſſing my own feelings, I am ſure, I expreſs thoſe of my brethren of the board.</p>
            <p>TO the preceding cautions I will add another, which more immediately reſpects rhe officers, magiſtrates, and influential characters in the Town. Will it not, Gentlemen, be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly incumbent on you to uſe the authority and influence which you poſſeſs, I will not ſay, for the <hi>ſuppreſſion,</hi> for I know not that ſuch things exiſt here; but for the <hi>prevention</hi> of the evils which have been mentioned; profaneneſs, gamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſabbath-breaking, and whatever would tend to vitiate the manners, fully the reputation and defeat the intention of this academy? Will it not be your duty to countenance and encourage the religious obſervance of the Lord's day, and a regular and general attendance on the worſhip of God's houſe; that the ſtudents, from the example which they behold, may receive deep and permanent impreſſions of the ſacred impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of theſe divine inſtitutions?—I ſhall not enlarge—You will judge of yourſelves what is right.</p>
            <p>THIS day introduces a new year—the year which cloſes the 18th century from the era of your redemption. On this day we are aſſembled to dedicate to God and commit to his bleſſing this infant ſeminary, hoping, that here our ſons will be as plants grown up in their youth, and our daughters as corner-ſtones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a palace—that here formed to uſeful knowledge, pious ſentiments and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manners, they will bring honour to God, do ſervice to men in their day, and tranſmit to another generation the pious principles and the excellent wiſdom, which they here
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037783_0015_100F4CF9C737ABE8"/>
imbibe. That God may accept this offering at our hands, let us join piety with our charity, like the <hi>Mecedonian</hi> Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who, in preparing a benefaction for the ſaints, firſt gave <hi>themſelves</hi> to the Lord. In vain we pretend to honour him with pompous offerings, while we deny him the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our hearts and the obedience of our lives. Let us, with this new year, lament our own follies, and recognize God's mercies in the paſt. And with the dedication of this new ſeminary, let us preſent ourſelves living ſacrifices holy and acceptable to him, and ſerve him the remainder of our days in newneſs of life. When our bodies ſhall be forgotten in the duſt, and our names no longer mentioned on earth, may this inſtitution live and flouriſh, and be a bleſſing to the children of thoſe who ſhall then occupy our place. In the mean time our prayers ſhall commend it to God, and in his attendant ſmiles our hearts ſhall rejoice. Having cloſed this mortal ſcene, may we all riſe to the world of light, where we ſhall ſee, not thro' a glaſs darkly, but with open face, and ſhall know, not merely in part, but as we are known.</p>

            <p>WE have Aſſembled this day for the delightful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of dedicating, and ſetting apart this building for the important deſign of education, that the riſing generation may be inſtructed in the various branches of human and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred erudition.</p>
            <p>WE rejoice that this happy lot has fallen to us, and that we have an opportunity to impart a ſmall portion of our proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in laying the foundation of ſo uſeful an Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The attention of the Citizens of this Commonwealth to the education of the riſing Generation affords a moſt pleaſing proſpect of the future ſupport of religion ſcience and morality. Theſe are the Grand Pillars, on which this Country has been raiſed to its preſent opulence and ſplendor, and on which the principles of our moſt excellent Frame of Government muſt be continued and ſupported. Having compleated this Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic Edifice, and procured an inſtructor for the education of thoſe Children and Youth of both ſexes, who may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care; having alſo received ample teſtimony of his literary and moral character; to introduce this Gentleman into his important office is what now remains for us to do.</p>
            <p>I therefore, by the direction of this Honorable Board of Truſtees, deliver to you, Sir, <hi>this Key,</hi> in token of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture with the office of Preceptor in this Academy.</p>
            <p>UPON your exertion aided with ours, we conceive the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity of this Seminary very much depends.</p>
            <p>IT is our ardent wiſh, that you may anſwer our juſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in forming the minds and manners of the Children and Youth, that may be placed under your inſtructions.</p>
            <p>PERMIT us, Sir, on this occaſion, to ſuggeſt to you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of carefully inſpecting the morals and behaviour of your Pupils; and of frequently inſtiling into their tender minds the great principles of the chriſtian religion: The reſt we leave to your own good ſenſe.</p>
            <p>WE look forward with pleaſing ſatiſfaction to ſome future Period (far diſtant) when you ſhall reſign this Key and Office of preceptor, with honor to yourſelf and reputation to this Seminary.</p>
            <p>MAY this inſtitution long flouriſh; may it become more and more reputable for virtue and ſcience; &amp; may it continue to afford an opportunity for acquiring every branch of learing which is uſeful to the individual and beneficial to the Community.</p>
