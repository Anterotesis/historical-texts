      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BY Virtue of that ſtimulating Paſſion or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of</hi> Imitation, <hi>ſo deeply radicated in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature,</hi> Example <hi>has uſually a very attractive Force and Government over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and a diſtinguiſhing Efficacy on</hi> young <hi>People in particular. Whatever is the latent Cauſe, we find by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Experience, it ſtrikes very powerfully on their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; ductile Minds; is more engaging than the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt perſuaſive Reaſonings, or the moſt ſolemn Precepts of Superiors; and has the earlieſt Influence, to bias their Thoughts and Inclinations, and to form their Deportment. Thus 'tis in Morality &amp; Civils; and thus in Chriſtianity &amp; Spirituals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's of great Importance therefore,</hi> what Precedents <hi>young People have ſet before them, in the Family and Place of their Education: and of happy Tendency, when</hi> good <hi>Examples preſent themſelves betimes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs them in Favour of pure Religion and the beſt Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of GOD, that He has in the ſacred Scriptures preſerv'd brief</hi> Memorials <hi>of many primitive</hi> Saints; <hi>ſome of whom were ſhining Patterns of</hi> early <hi>Piety: the Review of which, while young ones have been reading their Bible, has often led them by a ſweet and powerful Conſtraint into the Conſideration, Love and Practice of the Things that pleaſe GOD, and Things that accompany Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Conformity to Scripture Sample, many</hi> biographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Pieces, of human Compoſure, have been publiſh'd by Chriſtian Writers from Age to Age. Among others, large Accounts have been exhibited to the World of the</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003518_0003_0FF85543A65078C0"/>
Lives <hi>of ſome young &amp; eminent Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhorter Memoirs have been given of many others, particularly in</hi> Funeral-Sermons: <hi>which by the Bleſſing of GOD have often been of ſingular Uſe, to promote the early Practice of Piety, by provoking Survivors of the ſame Age to an holy Emulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I look upon it the primary Buſineſs of Funeral-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, not ſo much to praiſe the</hi> Dead, <hi>as inſtruct the</hi> Living; <hi>to give GOD the Glory of his Grace beſtow'd on the Deceaſed, and to enforce a Care of Religion, by the Advantage of their Example, on the Surviving. Inſtances of</hi> early <hi>Piety, eſpecially where it has been ſignal too for the Degree, ſeem to claim a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Notice: And</hi> publick Characters <hi>in this Caſe are wont to be entertain'd with a peculiar Candour and Attention; while on other Occaſions many times ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Prejudices are unhappy Impediments to a candid Reception of them, altho' drawn up with the wiſeſt Caution, and the exacteſt Regard to Truth of Fact, as well as Sobriety of Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was very much pleas'd in hearing the</hi> Funeral-Character, <hi>in the following Sermon, from the Pulpit, on ſo</hi> juſt an Occaſion: <hi>and am glad now to ſee it in the publick Light. As it ſeem'd very</hi> acceptable, <hi>to an attentive Audience; I wiſh it may be no leſs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, <hi>to every Reader, and particularly to young People, by ſtirring up their Reſolutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of conforming to the bright Pattern here bro't to their View: concerning which,</hi> Much in a little <hi>is ſaid with</hi> Words of Truth &amp; Soberneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas the Hope of doing ſome Service to the great Ends of the Goſpel, among the riſing Generation in ſpecial, by propoſing a remarkable</hi> Example <hi>of early Religion, that at length prevail'd on my Rev. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give way to the Importunity, with which this Publication was called for. May the pious Deſires of the Author and the Publiſhers be abundantly anſwer'd, in the quickning of many to be</hi> "Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes!</p>

               <hi>May the</hi> bereaved Parents, <hi>while mourning the Death of their lovely Child (ſaying,</hi> "Alas my Daughter) <hi>often refreſh their ſorrowful Minds by reflecting on her holy Walk with GOD, &amp; peaceful End, &amp; taking a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that bliſsful World, they have ſuch Reaſon to hope, ſhe is tranſlated to! May they ſecure and enjoy</hi> 'the good Part, that ſhall never be taken away from them; "a Name better than of Sons &amp; Daughters, an everlaſting Name, that ſhall not be cut off! <hi>And may their ſurviving Children be alſo a Joy and Crown to them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>May we</hi> all <hi>that are</hi> Parents, <hi>be excited &amp; encourag'd to pray &amp; hope &amp; labour for the early Converſion of</hi> our Children! <hi>So we may comfortably part with them, if Death take them from us (knowing</hi> "the Day of their Death is better than the Day of their Birth) <hi>or elſe chearfully leave them to the Covenant-Care of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, if</hi> we <hi>are remov'd from</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let</hi> young <hi>People lay to Heart ſuch Inſtances of early Mortality: and pray to GOD, that by his Grace they may become like Examples of real &amp; vital Piety; that if they alſo ſhould</hi> die in Youth, <hi>they may</hi> have Hope in their Death, <hi>and willingly bid Adieu to Earth and Time, deſirous to be with CHRIST.</hi>

Nor can ſuch employ their time and pains, more to the divine honor and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or their own trueſt advantage, than by an <hi>early</hi> care in governing their appetites, purifying their hearts, and forming within themſelves the ſeeds and principles of virtue and a holy life.</p>
            <p>AND to engage our <hi>young people</hi> in a zealous appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of themſelves, in the uſe of all proper means, to ſuch noble purpoſes, is the deſign I have in view from the words which have been red to you.</p>

THEY are found in that inſpired Pſalm which is the longeſt, and (as ſome think) the moſt artfully compoſed of any in the whole book of Pſalms.

            <p>THE verſe I have choſen for my text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is made up of two parts; a <hi>queſtion,</hi> and an <hi>anſwer</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>I. THE firſt part of my text contains a <hi>queſtion; wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> By <hi>a young man</hi> we are here to underſtand <hi>all</hi> in their youthful days; both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women.</hi> And from the expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons of this age and character, we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led to look upon thoſe, who are in the prime and vigor of life, as under <hi>peculiar</hi> obligations to become ſeriouſly pious and ſober: for <hi>this</hi> is the great thing meant by <hi>cleanſing their way;</hi> which they would not, with ſuch <hi>particularity,</hi> have had urg'd upon them, if there had not been ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> reaſons binding them hereto, as their inviolable duty.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible there are ſeveral things of conſiderable importance, obviouſly implied in the phraſe of my text, under which the duty of early Piety is recommended to us. And I might accordingly to good purpoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your meditations, both on the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> filth, young perſons are too commonly defiled with: As alſo, the particulars of that purity of <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> wherein conſiſts the ſum of true Religion. But as I'm oblig'd to confine my ſelf to a ſingle diſcourſe, and it may be preſumed we are fully inſtructed in theſe things, I ſhall paſs them over, and make it my only buſineſs from this part of my text,</p>
            <p>To repreſent to you, in as clear and ſtrong a light as I am able, <hi>the ſpecial Conſiderations that oblige young perſons to be religious in their early days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I would offer as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003518_0008_0FF855501E4367F0"/>
I. THIS age of life is the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> in which to enter upon a religious courſe. I would charitably hope, there are few if any, but look upon a religious life to be a matter of neceſſity: which they have accordingly determined to betake themſelves to, ſome time or other; as they would not give up all hope of future and eternal bleſſedneſs. And if religion be at all a matter of neceſſity, 'tis certainly wiſdom to take that ſeaſon to engage in it, which is the faireſt and beſt; the leaſt entangled with difficulty, and attended with the moſt hopeful proſpect of ſucceſs. Now ſuch a ſeaſon is the <hi>age of youth.</hi> We may, at this time of life, begin and go on in a religious courſe, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage than we ſhall be ever able to do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed, it muſt be acknowledged, ſome difficulties, that ſeem almoſt peculiar to this age of life: As a high reliſh of the pleaſures of ſenſe; the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernableneſs of carnal appetites and evil paſſions; an exceeding aptneſs to be ſeduced by bad example; an over airineſs and gaiety of temper; want of judgment and experience; raſhneſs, ſickleneſs, inconſideration, and the like. But theſe inconveniences are vaſtly more than ballanc'd, by diſtinguiſhing advantages common to the days of youth.</p>
            <p>WE are <hi>now</hi> moſt free from a wrong biaſs; and lie moſt open to the impreſſions of religious principles, and the power of thoſe <hi>Goſpel</hi> motives, by which the practice of true piety is recommended and enforced. For this age of life is eaſily wrought upon, and moulded almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any form. "A young and tender plant readily takes the ply, which he who tends it thinks proper to give; and if by accident it becomes warp'd, and has receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wrong bent, by due and early care 'tis eaſily reduced: but if it be ſuffered to continue ſo a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time without ſuitable attendance, and grow old; it becomes ſtubborn and inflexible."</p>
            <p>ALSO, we are <hi>now</hi> moſt under the influence of conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and a natural ſenſe of ſhame and modeſty; than which there are ſcarce any ſtronger reſtraints to keep
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003518_0009_0FF85553098E7110"/>
us from doing evil. As corrupt as humane nature is, perſons can't at firſt commit ſin without trouble and uneaſineſs from conſcience; and they have naturally ſuch a ſenſe of the indecency and irregularity of moſt wicked actions, as that they ordinarily ſtart back from their firſt approaches towards them. I doubt not but moſt men have had their innocence preſerved in many inſtances, by the ſole help of innate modeſty &amp; ſhame; which powerful principles can't at once be ſtifled and ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, ſin has not <hi>yet</hi> got ſo full poſſeſſion of us; nor have we contracted ſo many vicious Habits; nor are they ſo deeply rooted, as in thoſe who have for a conſiderable length of time accuſtomed themſelves to do evil. For by repeating the acts of ſin, the habit is ſtrangely encouraged; and by degrees will become ſo obſtinate, as to make it almoſt an impoſſibility to get recovered from it. The prophet therefore deſcribes this matter in ſuch ſtrong language as that, <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. 13. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, fewer clogs and incumbrances <hi>now</hi> lie in the way of religion, than there will, when we come to ſettle in the world, and are entangled with buſineſs; the cares, temptations, difficulties, hurries and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which, are ſo many and great, as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger our not ſo much as thinking of our Souls; if a ſenſe of religion has not before been impreſſed upon our minds. And under theſe circumſtances we ſhall be far more likely to put off the buſineſs of Salvation, than ever before. Our unexperience of the world may keep us from feeling the force of this argument; but the further we get into the world, and become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares and diſtractions of it, the more weight ſhall we find to be in it.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, we ſhall certainly have more time for the work of religion, if we engage in it <hi>now.</hi> For every
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003518_0010_0FF85554A69388B8"/>
moment we defer this work, the ſpace allotted to us for the accompliſhment of it, is juſt in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion leſſened. This perhaps we may not be much concerned about: imagining religion to be a matter of eaſe; a buſineſs we may begin and finiſh at our lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But we are herein greatly miſtaken. 'Tis truly a hard and difficult matter to be ſincerely pious, and will require a great deal of time and labour. And if ever we are made ſeriouſly concerned about our Souls, we ſhall certainly find it to be ſo. 'Tis therefore an advantage, the longer time we have for the work of getting our ſelves prepared for heavenly happineſs: And if we are wiſe for eternity, we can't but eſteem it to be ſo. To be ſure, the longer time we have, the greater progreſs we ſhall be able to make in holineſs, and the more ſtrengthned will the habits of vertue be likely to be in us; the more mature and perfect the graces of God's holy Spirit. Nor is it poſſible we ſhould ever be eminent in piety; exemplary proficients in grace and goodneſs, if we cut ſhort the time to improve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by not entring upon a life of religion till we have paſs'd the prime of our days.</p>
            <p>IN FINE, we have in this age of life the moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect, of being <hi>effectually</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> in the great work of ſerving our maker. For young perſons may, at leaſt ordinarily, be ſuppos'd to have leaſt reſiſted the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> quench'd his motions, ſtiffled convictions and oppos'd the methods of divine grace. And having given leaſt provocation to the holy Spirit, there is the leaſt danger of his withdraw, and giving over to ſtrive with us. And of all perſons, <hi>We</hi> have the higheſt encouragement, upon ſuitable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions herefor, to expect thoſe ſupernatural operations and aſſiſtances that are needful for us. 'Tis in experience found true, the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> uſually ſtrives more with young perſons than others: They are oftner bro't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der convictions; filled with concern about their Souls; and made ſeriouſly inquiſitive, <hi>what they muſt do that they may inherit eternal life?</hi> In this age, we are <hi>moſt likely</hi> to be wro't upon and prevailed with: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Spirit does not loſe this <hi>beſt</hi> opportunity; but improves it by <hi>more abundant</hi> ſtrivings and motions in us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003518_0011_0FF85556DFFB7448"/>
AND O how great is our advantage, in being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the influences of God's Spirit! and the moſt hopeful proſpect of all ſupernatural aids, as we may need them! There cannot be a ſtronger encouragement to us, to enter upon a religious courſe in theſe our firſt days. For of our ſelves we can never turn to God, or ſerve him to his acceptance. The aſſiſtances of divine grace are abſolutely neceſſary hereto: and in this time of life <hi>theſe</hi> we do in ſome meaſure enjoy: and have the higheſt reaſon further to except them, in degrees proportionable to our wants. And is it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make no uſe of ſuch an ineſtimable priviledge? And ſhall we not by ſlighting and deſpiſing it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to reſolve, that <hi>his Spirit ſhall not</hi> afterwards <hi>ſtrive with us?</hi> And to ſay concerning one and another of us, <hi>"I have done with him, and he ſhall hear no more of my deſpiſed offers, nor any more reject the motions of my Spirit: Let him now take his own courſe, he ſhall for a while hear no more from me, till I ſpeak in quite another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and</hi> rend the caul of his heart, <hi>and take away his rebellious Soul."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. RELIGION in this age of life is <hi>moſt pleaſing and acceptable to God.</hi> It is indeed of ſo recommending a nature, that the glorious God is pleaſed with and will graciouſly accept it, <hi>whenever</hi> and in <hi>whomſoever</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it. Tho' we ſhould have ſpent the firſt of our time and ſtrength in the ſervice of ſin and Satan; yet if we afterwards heartily devote our ſelves to God, and faithfully employ our powers to the purpoſes of a holy life, he will not upbraid us with our former folly, or deny us his favour. The repentance of a ſinner is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways matter of joy to the bleſſed God: He conceives a pleaſure at this, in whatſoever age of life, we come to our ſelves, and return to our duty; and will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive us to mercy. But <hi>early Piety</hi> is <hi>peculiarly</hi> pleaſing and acceptable to God. He has the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared affection for young Converts: None ſo welcome to him, or that meet with ſuch diſtinguiſhing regards from him. Says God, <hi>I love them that love me: and thoſe that ſeek me</hi> EARLY <hi>ſhall find me.</hi>

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark 10. 21. compar'd with Mat. 19. 20.</note> So pleas'd is he with every thing that looks like a tendency towards early Piety! And when we read of the <hi>firſt-born</hi> and <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 22. 29.</note> as appointed to be ſeparated for the ſervice of God; may it not ſymbolically repreſent it our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to devote the <hi>firſt</hi> of our time and ſtrength to the honour of our Creator, as what he would moſt kindly accept at our hands?</p>
            <p>AND 'tis intirely conſonant to reaſon, to ſuppoſe the bleſſed God will be moſt pleaſed with the ſervice of our youthful days. For we are <hi>now</hi> moſt active and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous; our ſpirits brisk and lively; our reſolutions ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; our ſtrength firm; our health unbroken; and in a word, the ſeveral powers both of our ſouls and bodies, in their prime and glory: Upon which accounts, we are in our <hi>beſt capacity</hi> for the ſervices of religion, And to <hi>exerciſe our ſelves to godlineſs</hi> NOW; in this moſt valuable part of life; when we are beſt able, in the beſt manner, to do the duties and go through the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of religion, is moſt valuable in it ſelf, moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the divine honor; and will never fail of the moſt diſtinguiſhing acceptance. If we ſhould be ſo unhappy as to neglect God till afterwards, we might, 'tis true, of his abundant mercy, upon our thorow humiliation and ſincere repentance, notwithſtanding this moſt unworthy treatment of his divine majeſty, be admitted to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: But 'tis not reaſonable to think, we ſhould meet with ſo eaſy and free a reception under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as if we had returned to him in the flower of life. "Our youthful capacities are as <hi>the male in our flock;</hi>" with which God can't but be moſt of all pleas'd and readily accept.</p>

III. RELIGION in this age of life is <hi>peculiarly ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and will make thoſe who practice it, <hi>ſignally amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lovely.</hi> The wiſe man obſerves, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the heaven.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 1.</note> And when is the <hi>proper ſeaſon</hi> in which to enter upon a religious courſe? unleſs upon our <hi>firſt</hi> coming to the free exerciſe of our rational powers; while the bleſſing of life is <hi>new,</hi> and the ſenſe of it <hi>freſh</hi> upon our minds; and we are <hi>newly</hi> arriv'd at a capacity of knowing the Author of our Beings, and rendring back to him our moſt grateful acknowlegements. If there be at all a <hi>fit opportunity,</hi> to begin to be ſeriouſly Godly, 'tis <hi>now;</hi> upon the <hi>buddings</hi> of reaſon and underſtanding; the firſt appearances of a capacity to diſtinguiſh between moral good and evil: that ſo the principles of vertue may, with our intellectual powers, gradually grow up to a ſtate of maturity; and when our life comes to be in its higheſt perfection, we ſhall be in the moſt vigorous, lively and perfect <hi>religious</hi> capacity, to ſerve and honor our creator and father.</p>
            <p>AND what more lovely ſight than that of a young perſon, in his moſt early days enquiring after the God that made him, in the language of holy <hi>Job,</hi>

And none among the ſons of men ſhine more bright and glorious than ſuch inſtances of early piety. Their <hi>name is better than precious ointment;</hi> they are eſteemed as <hi>the excellent in the earth;</hi> are univerſally well tho't and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; and the grace of God appearing in them, is admir'd and acknowleg'd to their own, as well as the honor of God. They are beloved, and treated with uncommon reſpect by all that have a regard to virtue and goodneſs: and even the wicked and prophane, who are hardy enough <hi>openly</hi> to ridicule religion, will yet <hi>inwardly</hi> feel reverence and veneration for them.</p>

IV. THERE <hi>is great hazard we ſhall never be religious, if we ben't ſo in this age of life.</hi> For who of us knows, whether our youthful days are not the only ones, we have to live in the world? Whether God has not deſigned us to be in the number of thoſe <hi>millions,</hi> who <hi>die in youth? in</hi> their <hi>full ſtrength,</hi> being <hi>wholly at eaſe and quiet;</hi> having their <hi>breaſts full of milk, and bones moiſtned with marrow.</hi> Or if we were ſecure of our lives, is there not danger, when we have <hi>vext</hi> and <hi>griev'd</hi> and <hi>quench'd</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of his departing from us? Would it be any wonder, if <hi>He</hi> ſhould ſo reſent our contempt of him, in reſiſting his motions and ſtiffling convictions, as to retire and withdraw forever? And would not this be a fatal bar to our ever turning to God? ſince of our ſelves we can do nothing, and muſt have our <hi>chief</hi> dependance upon the aſſiſtances of divine grace. But beſides, what likelihood is there of our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to God and duty, after we are grown old in ſin, when we could not be prevailed with in our young and tender years? While young our hearts are ſoft; our wills pliable and yielding; our conſciences eaſily awaken'd, affections mov'd, and minds impreſſed with a ſenſe of religion: And if when under theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious circumſtances, we are not reſtrained by the word, nor providence, nor Spirit of God, from <hi>walking in the way of the ungodly;</hi> what probable proſpect is there of our being call'd back <hi>afterwards,</hi> and converted to God? And the hope of this will be ſtill leſs, after we have long continued in our evil courſes: for by this means we ſhall contract and render obſtinate and inveterate, innumerable vicious habits; ſhall very much weaken, if not quite deſtroy, the influence and authority of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſhall make our hearts like an <hi>adamant ſtone,</hi> hard and unrelenting; and in a word, ſhall become ſtupid and intirely loſt to all ſenſe of virtue and religion. And under theſe circumſtances, what hope is there of our repentance and converſion to God? 'Tis indeed a poſſible thing; but there is little more than a naked poſſibility of it. <hi>Nicodemus'</hi>s queſtion is in this caſe very pertinent, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> 'Tis a moſt unlikely thing! one of the greateſt rarities! And whenever it happens, it may be juſtly look'd upon as even a miracle of ſuper-abundant grace in God!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003518_0015_0FF85560C381A0F8"/>
In the laſt place,</p>
            <p>V. TWILL be <hi>much to our advantage</hi> to be ſeriouſly godly betimes. This is the beſt method we can take to ſecure the divine bleſſing in <hi>outward regards.</hi> For our <hi>Saviour</hi> has encourag'd us to hope, upon our <hi>ſeeking firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> that <hi>all theſe things ſhall be added unto us.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. 6. 33.</note> Agreable to which is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>But godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now it, and of that which is to come.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> And in virtue of this promiſe, thoſe that ſerve God; eſpecially thoſe that do ſo in the firſt of their days, may with the greateſt confidence depend upon the divine power and goodneſs for the ſupply of their wants; and are of all perſons, the moſt likely to be ſmil'd upon in providence, and ſo come to the enjoyment of temporal good things; at leaſt ſo far as God ſhall ſee it to be beſt for them. But beſides this advantage, there are vaſtly greater ones of a ſpiritual and eternal nature. Thus,</p>
            <p>BY our being pious betimes, we ſhall <hi>early</hi> obtain the pardon of our ſins; the favor and friendſhip of our maker; an adoption into the family of heaven, and with it an inveſtiture in all the rights and privileges of the ſons of God.—We ſhall hereby eſcape innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſins and follies, which would wound our conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences: defile our ſouls; diſhonor and provoke God, and make work for a moſt bitter after-repentance.—We ſhall hereby have a longer opportunity for the work of ſerving God, and our generation according to the will of God; and ſo ſhall be able to do more good, and be greater bleſſings in our day.—We ſhall hereby take the moſt certain and eaſie way to live and die good men. For when once the ſeeds of virtue have taken root in our young and tender minds, they will grow up into nature and fit us to live in the world: ſetting us in a good meaſure free from the power of luſt, preſerving us from the infection of evil example, &amp; guarding us againſt the force of thoſe number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temptations we ſhall meet with—We ſhall hereby be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003518_0016_0FF8556247C65758"/>
likely to enjoy, in the moſt uninterrupted courſe, that inward eaſe, peace and <hi>religious</hi> ſatisfaction, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the greateſt happineſs on this ſide heaven. <hi>This,</hi> thoſe who have given way to <hi>youthful luſts,</hi> and were not ſeriouſly inclined 'till in their <hi>latter years,</hi> are often ſtrangers to. Or if their conſciences are ſometimes at eaſe, it is often interrupted with perplexing fears and doubts, whereby their lives are rendred very uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Whereas thoſe who have by the grace of God, been enabled to enter upon, and walk in a religious courſe, from their early days, do ordinarily for the moſt part enjoy a holy calm in their breaſts; that <hi>peace of God which paſſes all underſtanding.</hi> Perſons even in old age, have received more ſolid comfort from a reflection on their early piety, than from all other conſiderations whatever. And when nothing elſe has been effectual, in their melancholy hours, to bring eaſe to their minds, it has at once ſcattered their fears and doubts, to look back upon that grace of God, whereby in the pride and flower of youth, they were aſſiſted to prefer a courſe of religion to the pleaſures of ſin; and to hold on in this courſe, amidſt all the temptations of this evil world.—And O the bleſſed peace and ſerenity of mind! the holy joy and triumph of ſoul! ſuch will be likely to be filled with at the hour of death: when conſcience ſhall teſtify, that they <hi>began to ſeek after God, while they were yet young;</hi> and that they have all along <hi>had their converſation in the world, in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; not by fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God.</hi> The reflection hereon will excite the lively actings of faith and hope, in the mercy of God thro' Chriſt; yield an unfailing ſpring of conſolation to their hearts, and enable them in the midſt of the throws and agonies of death, to ſing in that triumphant language, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 55,—57.</note> But the greateſt advantage of all is,</p>

THAT our <hi>future</hi> and <hi>eternal crown of glory</hi> will hereby be the <hi>greater.</hi> There will, no doubt, be degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the coming world. The Scriptures plainly teach this, by diſtinguiſhing between the reward of a <hi>prophet,</hi> and an <hi>ordinary righteous man;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 41.</note> as alſo, by aſſuring us of both a <hi>ſparing</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> future harveſt, according as we have at preſent, ſowed either <hi>ſparingly</hi> or <hi>bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> But the moſt full declaration of this doctrine is in the <hi>parable of the ten Servants;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. 19. 12. and onwards.</note> who received of their Lord, being about to go into a far country, <hi>one pound</hi> each to trade with, till he ſhould return: at which time calling them to an account, he is repreſented as reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man, that had made a good uſe of the pound delivered to him; and the reward bears an <hi>exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the ſeveral <hi>improvements</hi> made by the ſervants. He that had gained <hi>ten pounds,</hi> is made ruler over <hi>ten cities;</hi> and he that had gained <hi>five pounds,</hi> is made ruler over <hi>five cities:</hi> which obviouſly and unavoidably leads us to conceive, that the future glory will be proportioned to men <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,</hi> according to the <hi>different improvements,</hi> they have made in grace and goodneſs. Nor does this <hi>inequality,</hi> in the leaſt argue <hi>their</hi> happineſs to be <hi>imperfect,</hi> who are admitted to the loweſt degrees of future glory. For "a <hi>Star</hi> is as perfect in its order as the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet they ſhine in a different luſtre": agreeable whereto is that of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 15. 41, 42. <hi>There is one glory of the ſun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the ſtars: for one ſtar differeth from another in glory:</hi> SO <hi>alſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Where he not only argues that the <hi>reſurrection-bodies</hi> of the ſaints will differ from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory; but inſinuates the <hi>perfection</hi> of theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their ſeveral glories; as the <hi>moon</hi> and <hi>ſtars</hi> are perfect in their degree and order, tho' they ſhine with far leſs glory than the <hi>ſun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſince we have reaſon to believe God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men in the coming world, with different degrees of glory according to the different improvements, they have made in holineſs; who among men will ſhine with ſuch <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> luſtre, as early converts? As they have had the longeſt opportunity and beſt advantages for it,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003518_0018_0FF85566089ABE58"/>
we may well ſuppoſe them to be moſt confirmed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to be moſt grown in grace; to have done moſt ſervice in the world, and to have bro't forth moſt of that fruit whereby our father in heaven is glorified. They are therefore moſt meet for future glory; and will not only be admitted to it, but to the higheſt degrees of that glory. And O how great will be their bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! when they ſhall be made the <hi>moſt diſtinguiſh'd</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that happineſs, the <hi>loweſt degree</hi> whereof is ſo ſurpaſſing, that <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor has it ever enter'd into the heart of man to conceive of it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND having thus laid before you ſome of thoſe many conſiderations, which can't be deny'd to come with <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> force upon young perſons; obliging them in the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> manner, to be religious <hi>betimes:</hi> I think I may with propriety now turn my diſcourſe, into an <hi>earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> to the duty of <hi>early piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND O that thoſe of us who are in our youthful days, would be prevailed with, to engage in the great affair of religion and our ſouls ſalvation! This is what the bleſſed God moſt heartily deſires, and would be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly well pleaſed with. He therefore often with the greateſt particularity, beſpeaks the ſervice of our young and tender years. Holy <hi>David</hi> puts the queſtion in my text, <hi>Wherewith ſhall a</hi> YOUNG MAN <hi>cleanſe his way?</hi> intimating the great ſtreſs that is laid upon the age of youth; and that <hi>now</hi> to cleanſe our ſelves from ſin, is <hi>emphatically</hi> our duty. Hence young perſons are <hi>by name</hi> ſolemnly called upon, Eccl. 12. 1. <hi>Remember</hi> NOW <hi>thy creator, in the days of thy</hi> YOUTH. So in 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>And thou, Solomon my</hi> SON, <hi>know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind.</hi> And becauſe young people are generally inclined to <hi>rejoyce in their youth, and to let their hearts chear them in the days of their youth, and to walk in the way of their own hearts, and in the ſight of their own eyes;</hi> great care is taken to check and reſtrain this irregular inclination: Particularly in Eccl. 11. 9. BUT KNOW THOU, THAT FOR ALL THESE THINGS GOD WILL BRING THEE INTO JUDGMENT. And why ſhould God thus <hi>ſingle out</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> adviſe, caution and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003518_0019_0FF85568DCD59B68"/>
direct young perſons? but that 'tis their <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>eminently</hi> his expectation from them, to yield up themſelves to him; cleanſing their way from ſin, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their powers in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>OUR obligations hereto are very ſolemn and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: and I would fain hope, we are ſo far convinc'd of the reaſonableneſs and neceſſity of complying with them, as that we are reſolved upon loving and ſerving our moſt merciful God and father.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be we flatter our ſelves with the tho't, of having a <hi>more convenient</hi> ſeaſon for the work of religion, in the after-part of life: and ſo are for putting it off till then. This I believe is the vain imagination of moſt young perſons; and an effectual bar in the way of their becoming ſeriouſly godly. To which I would ſay, What if <hi>death</hi> ſhould be betwixt us, and our <hi>hereafter-opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> for the buſineſs of our ſouls ſalvation? This is no improbable ſuppoſition. Multitudes of the ſame age and character with our ſelves, die within the reach of our obſervation: And who can ſay, it won't be our own lot to die young? And if this ſhould be our caſe, "how ſtrange and unreaſonable will our conduct appear to be? Reaſonable creatures ſent into the world to ſeek and ſerve God, and made capable of it, and that had time for it; but went out of the world, and ſpent all their time in an utter diſregard and neglect of God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, of the principal end and buſineſs of life!" Beſides, we ſhall certainly be as unfit and indiſpoſed for religion <hi>afterwards</hi> as at <hi>preſent;</hi> and look upon any <hi>after-ſeaſon</hi> when we come to it, as inconvenient as that we <hi>now</hi> enjoy, and be under the ſame temptations to adjourn this buſineſs. For let us pitch on what part of life we pleaſe, it will be incumber'd with difficulties of one ſort or another; and innumerable pretences for delay will offer themſelves, and be apt without the greateſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prevail with us. We ſhall be ready to ſay with our ſelves, "to morrow will we amend our ways; and when that to morrow comes, we ſhall ſtill ſay to morrow: and ſo our to-morrow will prove endleſs." In ſhort, the greateſt objection we have againſt the <hi>preſent</hi> ſeaſon is, that 'tis <hi>preſent:</hi> and whenever our imaginary <hi>hereafter-ſeaſon</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003518_0020_0FF8556B0E1C5DA0"/>
comes to be preſent, we ſhall have the ſame objection againſt that, and find it as hard to leave our ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God and our duty.</p>
            <p>OR if any ſhould be diſcouraged from early piety, apprehending it to be a matter of ſuch difficulty, as that it can't be accompliſh'd without the greateſt labour and pains: I would ſay upon it, if it ſhould be allow'd to be a <hi>difficult</hi> thing to be truly religious, this ought not to be improved as an objection againſt our endeavouring to be ſo. For 'tis an affair of <hi>abſolute neceſſity;</hi> what muſt be engaged in, as ever we would hope for admiſſion into the eternal Kingdom of God. And therefore the proper uſe to be made of the difficulties of religion, is not to diſcourage our ſelves from ſetting about it; but to put on ſo much the more reſolution, to labour in it with the utmoſt ſpeed and all poſſible diligence. And in ſo doing, we may upon good grounds expect, aids of divine grace proportionable to the need we ſtand in of them, and the difficulties and temptations we may meet with.</p>
            <p>BUT, what is <hi>peculiarly</hi> matter of encouragement in this caſe is, that notwithſtanding all the difficulties of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious courſe, many <hi>young perſons</hi> have been enabled to go thro' them, and to become illuſtrious patterns of an early cloſe walk with God. The Scripture inſtances of this ſort we are all acquainted with. Nor have there been wanting, even from among our ſelves, remarkable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſame kind. And this leads me to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a young woman of this Congregation, ELISABETH PRICE, who was the laſt week followed to her grave; of whom it may with good reaſon be ſaid, ſhe was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common inſtance of that early piety, of which we have been ſpeaking. And as this is a caſe, wherein I flatter my ſelf I ſhan't be ſuſpected of ſiniſter views, I have been the rather inclined to take publick notice of it to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of free grace, and to recommend religion to our choice and practice in our youthful days.</p>
            <p>FROM a child ſhe was deeply impreſs'd with an awe and reverence of God; which remarkably manifeſted it ſelf, upon the firſt deliberate exerciſes of her reaſon and underſtanding, in a careful endeavour to abſtain from
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003518_0021_0FF812A763E1DA20"/>
thoſe things, ſhe apprehended to be evil: being to a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fearful leaſt in any thing ſhe ſhould offend God. Particularly, ſhe diſcovered a great abhorrence of the <hi>ſin of lying;</hi> and guarded againſt that <hi>vain, tho'tleſs tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> which are ſo incident to <hi>childhood</hi> &amp; <hi>youth:</hi> and often expreſſed her diſpleaſure thereat, to thoſe of her acquaintance, in whom ſhe perceived theſe faults to reign.</p>
            <p>SHE was obſerved to be conſtant, even from her moſt early days, in retirements <hi>evening</hi> and <hi>morning,</hi> to pour out her ſoul before God: except only when ſhe now and then intermitted this duty; which ſhe never did from a negligent careleſs frame of ſpirit, as is too commonly the caſe: but whenever ſhe was blameable in this kind, it proceeded from perplexing fears and temptations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common to one of her age; for which omiſſions ſhe was heartily ſorry, and would bitterly complain of her ſelf.</p>
            <p>HER carriage towards her parents was full of love, tenderneſs, honor and reverence. She chearfully obey'd their commands; attended their inſtructions; hearkned to their advice, and follow'd their counſels. And as ſhe did not allow of the leaſt unſeemly diſobedient behaviour towards them in her ſelf; ſo neither could ſhe bear to ſee it in her <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>ſiſters.</hi> And whenever ſhe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any diſcoveries of diſreſpect, irreverence or undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, either in their words, looks or actions; it would ſenſibly affect and grieve her: eſpecially when they were groſly guilty. And ſhe would not <hi>now</hi> fail of taking an opportunity, to repreſent to them the ſin of undutifulneſs to parents; how offenſive it was to God and provoking in his ſight.</p>
            <p>SHE was favoured with a peculiarly ſoft and tender conſcience, which made her watchful againſt ſin, careful to avoid even the appearances of it, and to maintain a cloſe walk with God. And <hi>this,</hi> when many times ſhe was under great ſpiritual fears and darkneſs. So far as I could obſerve, ſhe was of a tho'tful penſive temper; and by her conſtitution ſubject ſometimes to the power of melancholy: to which I attribute her not enjoying, at
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003518_0022_0FF8556F81E9F5B0"/>
leaſt for a conſtancy, the comforts of religion, in ſo great a meaſure as might be expected: Tho' I doubt not the hand of Satan, was evidently to be ſeen in many of the temptations, diſcouragements &amp; perplexing fears, ſhe paſſed thro'; which were greater and of a more extraordinary nature, than is uſual for perſons of ſo few years.</p>
            <p>I don't remember ſhe was able to ſix upon the <hi>particular time,</hi> in which ſhe tho't ſhe might paſs under a work of ſanctifying grace. Nor is it at all to be wondred at: When it was never obſerved, that the principles of corruption were <hi>habitually</hi> predominant in her, in any part of her life. From the <hi>first</hi> appearances of reaſon, and <hi>all along</hi> till the time of her death, her <hi>general</hi> temper and behaviour were ſuch as gave grounds to hope, that from <hi>a child</hi> ſhe was ſavingly converted to God. A moſt diſtinguiſhing priviledge!—Thrice happy they that are the ſubjects of it!—The grace herein diſcovered, can never be enough magnify'd and admir'd!</p>
            <p>SHE was a great reader of her <hi>bible;</hi> not ſuffering it to lie by a neglected book: but as her <hi>delight</hi> was <hi>in the law of God,</hi> ſo did ſhe make it <hi>the man of her counſel;</hi> repairing to it upon all emergent occaſions, beſides her more ſtated times for ſtudying of it.</p>
            <p>SHE was a ſtrict obſerver of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> behaving her ſelf as one that had an awakened ſenſe of the ſolemnity of the day: conſtantly went up to the <hi>place of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> where ſhe appeared with a viſible awe and reverence, and attended with ſuch care and diligence, as that ſhe was able to bring home, and <hi>from her memory</hi> repeat, more of the <hi>preached word,</hi> than is common for perſons grown to years; who yet are perſons of good underſtanding. And tho' thro a miſtaken apprehenſion of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as if it was an Ordinance deſigned only for Chriſtians of more than ordinary attainments in holineſs, and ſatisfaction about their good eſtate; ſhe dare not venture to approach to it: yet ſhe would not willingly neglect being preſent at the adminiſtration of it; at which times ſhe was often moſt ſenſibly affected, and her Soul refreſhed and comforted.</p>
            <p>IN her ſickneſs, by which ſhe was for a conſiderable time detained from the houſe of God, 'twas admirable to behold
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003518_0023_0FF85572572C0D78"/>
her breathings after God <hi>in his Sanctuary.</hi> With holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> her <hi>ſoul thirſted for God, the living God:</hi> and that was her complaint, <hi>O when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HER bodily pains were great and of long continuance; which gave opportunity for the illuſtration of divine grace, in that uncommon degree of patience, meekneſs, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſubjection to the father of ſpirits, ſhe was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent pattern of: never complaining; never murmuring; but always acknowledging her own deſerts, and juſtifying God in all that he laid upon her.</p>
            <p>'TIS to be hoped her <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>ſiſter</hi> will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her calling them to her bed-ſide; when with a holy freedom of ſoul ſhe gave her dying teſtimony in behalf of religion, and took her farewell of them: with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs beſeeching and exhorting them,<hi>to ſeek and ſerve God in their youthful days; to improve the preſent ſeaſon of grace, and time of their youth to the purpoſes of a holy life.</hi> And O! with what fervor of Soul did ſhe repeat the words, O THAT WE MAY DIE IN PEACE! AND MEET TOGETHER IN GLORY AT THE DAY OF CHRIST! Nor did her concern for religion end here; but ſhe advis'd, caution'd and exhorted all that came to ſee her, as ſhe had opportunity, and apprehended it might be proper and decent.</p>
            <p>BUT what is ſtill more wonderful, tho' but in her 17th year, ſhe was enabled in the midſt of tormenting pains, and the near views of approaching death, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the exceſſive ſorrow of her diſtreſſed parents: mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of the ſovereignty of God; and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that all things are ordered by him, recommending to them the duty of ſubmiſſion. And in various ways, ſhe more than once endeavoured to calm their grief, compoſe their ſpirits and bring them to a willingneſs to reſign her up to the God who had given her to them.</p>
            <p>SHE was in the beginning of her ſickneſs, and for ſome time, under darkneſs and fear; and expreſſed a deſire, if it might be God's will, of living ſtill longer in the world. But for many days before her death, ſhe had a comfortable ſenſe of her Intereſt in CHRIST; a good hope thro'
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003518_0024_0FF85573DD2351F0"/>
his merits of future glory and immortality; and was freely willing to depart hence to be here no more. And <hi>this</hi> ſhe declared upon ſeveral occaſions. Once, upon her Mother's diſcovering her grief under the view of parting with her, and asking her whether ſhe was willing to die and leave her; Her anſwer was, <hi>Yes, yes:</hi> and added, <hi>tho' you have been a loving tender mother to me, I can at God's call readily forſake all to go to</hi> CHRIST. At another time, recovering from a fainting-fit, and over-hearing ſome body ſay they tho't ſhe was gone; ſhe preſently cried out, <hi>O that I had gone then! It would have been happy with me now.</hi> Some time after being ask'd, whether her faith and hope held out; ſhe reply'd, <hi>Yes, yes:</hi> doubling the word. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before her death, being deſired to ſuffer her mouth to be moiſtned, which was almoſt ſcorched up with a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; ſhe ſaid <hi>no; for I am going where I ſhall no more want drink.</hi> And not long after, in a holy calm and bleſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of ſoul, ſhe <hi>fell aſleep in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAPPY the parents of ſuch a child!—You have infinite reaſon to magnifie and adore this diſtinguiſhing rich grace of God:—Nor ſhould you think hardly of God for taking from you, one ſo dearly beloved; when he firſt did ſo much for her, in making her meet for heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs: In the enjoyment whereof, we truſt ſhe is now ſolacing her ſelf. Comfort your ſelves herewith.—And O! be excited to the greateſt diligence in working out your own ſalvation; that you may hereafter come to be where ſhe is to behold her face in glory, and never be again parted from each other.</p>
            <p>IN FINE, <hi>my hearts deſire and prayer to God</hi> now <hi>is;</hi> that there may be, in <hi>this Church,</hi> many ſuch inſtances of an early converſion <hi>to God!</hi> We truſt there are ſome ſuch: Alas! that they are ſo rare!—The good Lord increaſe their number!—O our young people! We are the hope of this Church of our Lord Jeſus. It's increaſe; it's glory; it's very continuance in being is in a meaſure dependant on us. If we ſhould riſe up in our father's ſtead, a generation that know not God; what is like to become of the <hi>goſpel</hi> worſhip and ordinances in this place?—I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly believe, the breaſts of many of us are warmed with a generous concern for the honor of God and perpetuating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003518_0025_0FF855760E6418E8"/>
when our father are dead and gone. Let us then give our hearts to God;—ſeek FIRST his kingdom and righteouſneſs;—repent of our ſins;—believe in Chriſt;—and yield up our ſelves abſolutely and intirely to him, in an everlaſting covenant. And O! let us this day chuſe our fathers God for our God, and know and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind: So ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart of God's people; yea, we ſhall cauſe joy all over heaven: making glad not only the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but God himſelf and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But thus much for the <hi>queſtion</hi> in my text.</p>
            <p>II. THE other thing obſervable is, the <hi>anſwer</hi> to this queſtion; <hi>By taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi> And here are two things, which the time will allow me to give you only a few broken hints upon.</p>
            <p>I. IF we would become truly religious, we muſt <hi>take heed to our way.</hi> i. e. We muſt not live at random; without care or caution: but muſt adviſe with our reaſon &amp; conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; make a pauſe before we act, and not enter upon any courſe heedleſly; without tho't or conſideration.</p>
            <p>THIS is a fault too common, eſpecially among young perſons: who are therefore particularly here directed to guard againſt it. And this, not only becauſe 'tis in it ſelf a groſs inconſiſtency; for what ſounds more incongruous? a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>intelligent,</hi> yet <hi>tho'tleſs</hi> and <hi>inconſiderate</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—But becauſe 'tis a means neceſſary to our being preſerved from the pollutions of ſin. 'Tis very much ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>giddy tho'tleſsneſs</hi> which is ſo exceeding apt to prevail among young people, that they are ſo often led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray in the path of wickedneſs, that terminates in deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on And unleſs we take care to rectify this temper, and recover a ſeriouſly tho'tful, cautious and conſiderate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there will be great hazard of our <hi>never</hi> becoming truly religious.—Conſideration is the firſt ſtep mention'd in <hi>David'</hi>s return to God and his duty.—And if with him we would <hi>turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies,</hi> we muſt as he did, firſt <hi>think of our ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us realiſe the neceſſity of becoming ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate.—Let us not allow our ſelves to live without tho't;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003518_0026_0FF8557898DB72F8"/>
as tho' we were not endowed with the noble powers of reaſon and underſtanding:—But let us uſe our ſelves to deliberate before we act.—And let us review our paſt actions: and <hi>often</hi> bring them under ſtrict examination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So will there be a hopeful proſpect of our being kept within the line of duty; or otherwiſe, we ſhall ſoon ſee our miſtake, be likely to repent of it, and alter our courſe, before we get into <hi>a habit</hi> of doing evil.</p>
            <p>II. WE muſt take heed to our way, <hi>according to God's word.</hi>—And this alſo is a proper &amp; wiſe direction in order to our becoming truly religious. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE word of God is the <hi>beſt and moſt ſutable rule, by which to govern our ſelves in the buſineſs of religion.</hi> One great reaſon that young perſons eſpecially, are ſo often found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wrong way is, their not having ſettled in their minds <hi>a rule,</hi> by which to govern their conduct; and not uſing themſelves to bring their actions to ſome <hi>ſtandard,</hi> to judge of them whether they are good or bad.—'Tis therefore a good direction, the propoſing to us a <hi>rule of life,</hi> and to <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> our ſelves by this rule. And the direction is ſtill more wiſe &amp; ſutable, as the rule it recommends is <hi>the word of God;</hi> which is the beſt that can be. We have the excelling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this rule elegantly deſcribed, in Pſal. 19. 7, 8, 9. <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul; the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple; the ſtatutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: the fear of the Lord is clean, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during for ever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous altogether.</hi> Nor was the world ever favour'd with ſo clear and perfect a rule of life, as that we have in <hi>the word of God.</hi>—We are here taught the whole of our duty both towards God, our ſelves and one another; and this, as it ought to be practiſed in every relation, and under all the varying conditions and circumſtances of life: inſomuch that if we follow <hi>this direction;</hi> making <hi>the word of God</hi> the rule of our actions, doing whatever <hi>that</hi> preſcribes, and nothing that it diſapproves of; we ſhan't fail of keeping our ſelves free from ſin, and exerciſing our ſelves in all religious ſervices to the honor of God, and our own eſtabliſhment in grace and goodneſs.—To take heed to God's word as <hi>a rule of life,</hi> is therefore good advice;—a better direction could ſcarce have been given us.—</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003518_0027_0FF8557AFAF00B10"/>
2. THE word of God offers the <hi>moſt powerful arguments to prevail with us to engage in a religious courſe.</hi> For they are in ſhort, nothing leſs than the <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> of the <hi>eternal</hi> world. Theſe ſanctions of the law of God, were not I am ſenſible, at the time when <hi>David</hi> gave the advice in my text, ſo fully and clearly expreſſed as they have been ſince: Yet had good men in thoſe days <hi>ſufficient</hi> reaſon, from divine revelation, to expect a future ſtate of eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the impenitently wicked, to <hi>dwell with devouring fire, and to inhabit everlaſting burnings.</hi> But however it was then, the coming of Jeſus Chriſt has <hi>brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light;</hi> and immortality both of happineſs and miſery. "It has ſcattered all thoſe clouds that hid the other world from our ſight; and removed all doubt concerning the future exiſtence both of good &amp; bad men. The kingdom of heaven is now laid open to our view with all the glories of it: Hell alſo is repreſented naked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction without a covering." And what powerful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are theſe? And what are all other motives in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with them?—They are certainly, in the wiſeſt manner adapted to work upon our <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear;</hi> the two <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> and moſt <hi>leading</hi> paſſions of humane nature: And their operation is ſo powerful, that if the <hi>fear of eternal miſery</hi> will not affrighten us from ſin; nor the <hi>hope of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> encourage us to enter upon a life of ſerious godlineſs, we are ſunk into the depth of ſtupidity.—More powerful arguments can't be us'd with us; and if we won't be wro't upon by theſe, our caſe is truly lamentable.</p>
            <p>Now this alſo obviouſly juſtifies the wiſdom of the direction in my text. For we ſtand in abſolute need of very ſtrong and forcible arguments to prevail with us, to engage in the buſineſs of religion: and <hi>theſe</hi> which the <hi>word of God</hi> offers, are the moſt ſo of any that can be us'd with us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN the laſt place, the word of God is <hi>a moſt powerful means to purify the heart, and beget and increaſe in the ſoul, the principles of holineſs.</hi> It has a ſtrong <hi>natural</hi> tendency to theſe ends; as it contains that in it, which is moſt ſuted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the mind; inform the underſtanding; convince the judgment; perſwade the will; move the affections, &amp; ſtir up the executive powers.—But its <hi>chief</hi> efficacy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003518_0028_0FF8557D47747280"/>
more real piety, lies in its being an <hi>inſtituted means</hi> of God's diſpenſing thoſe <hi>divine aſſiſtances,</hi> that are neceſſary to our being truly religious. Upon this account eſpecially, the Goſpel is called the <hi>power of God to ſalvation;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 16.</note> And our Saviour makes that prayer,<note n="‡" place="bottom">John 17. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Sanctifie them thro' thy truth: thy</hi> WORD <hi>is truth:</hi> And we are ſaid to be <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd and cleans'd with the waſhing of water, by the</hi> WORD.<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 26.</note> All which texts do abundantly point out the <hi>word</hi> to be <hi>one ſpecial means,</hi> that is ordinarily made uſe of in the work of recovering ſinners to God and duty. I deny not but the holy Spirit may convert perſons without means: but inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind are very uncommon, if there be any ſuch at all. And as the Spirit generally makes uſe of means; ſo the <hi>word,</hi> both red and preach'd, is a ſpecial means to this end. And perhaps there are few perſons, who have paſſed under a work of regenerating grace, but from their own experience are able to ſay, the <hi>word</hi> has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental herein; and can tell what parts of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, were impreſſed upon their minds by the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
            <p>AND now, when they holy <hi>pſalmiſt</hi> was about directing young men in the way to religion and happineſs; what more ſutable and effectual method could he adviſe to, than this of paying a due regard to <hi>God's word?</hi> ſince this is <hi>naturally</hi> adapted to promote this deſign; and is the very method in which it pleaſes God <hi>ordinarily</hi> to beſtow renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaving grace. What more likely way can be taken, to become ſincerely pious, than by attending to <hi>that</hi> word, which God has inſtituted as a means, which he has given us the greateſt encouragement to hope, he will bleſs to this end?—None ſure, may be tho't to be under a more hopeful proſpect of a real thorow converſion, than thoſe who put themſelves in the <hi>preſcribed way</hi> of meeting with divine grace, by <hi>heedfully</hi> regarding <hi>God's word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now from what has been ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How great is our <hi>indebtedneſs</hi> to God for his Word! Having always been favoured with it, we ſcarce know our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003518_0029_0FF8557ECDE51548"/>
advantage herein, or how juſtly to prize it.—'Tis truly a rich gift, that <hi>to us are committed the oracles of God.</hi>—O let us value this privilege!—We can never too much eſteem it, or be too thankful for it.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUCH deſerve a <hi>ſevere reproof,</hi> who treat the word with <hi>neglect;</hi> ſeldom or never looking into it, &amp; making little or no more uſe of it than if they had no concern with it.—This is the character of multitudes, as is too evident from the <hi>groſs ignorance</hi> of ſome in the great points of chriſtianity; and the <hi>wretched careleſsneſs</hi> of others, about eternal concerns.—O be admoniſhed of your ſin and folly! You are greatly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God; caſt horrid contempt on his grace;—and not only ſo, but hurt your own ſouls, and loſe one of the beſt advantages in order to your being happy for ever.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE ſhould be <hi>much in reading</hi> the word; having our <hi>ſtated</hi> times herefor, and not allowing our ſelves <hi>ordinarily</hi> to paſs a day, without repairing to it.—And while we are ſtudying the word, we ſhould guard againſt a light, vain and trifling frame of ſpirit, as no ways becoming the importance of the duty; but ſhould endeavour to compoſe our ſelves to ſeriouſneſs, getting our minds into a tho'tful conſiderate temper.—This doubtleſs is a likely method of reading the word to ſaving advantage.—</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE ſhould <hi>eſpecially</hi> attend on the <hi>preached</hi> word; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it our care to be always at the place of publick worſhip, at the ſtated times herefor on <hi>Lord's days;</hi> and on <hi>other days</hi> alſo, as our occaſions will permit.—Nor ſhould we content our ſelves <hi>meerly</hi> with an attendance on the word: but ſhould take heed how we hear; and attend with reverence, and an awaken'd ſenſe of the awful weight of future &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concerns: with deſires of and aims at being ſpiritually profited; that we may be quickned in duty and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the performance of it; that we may get poſſeſs'd of ſanctifying grace, and have it increaſed in our ſouls; and in a word, that the life of God may be begun, maintained and carried on in us as much as may be to perfection.—</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN FINE, let us make uſe of the word to the <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion,</hi> for which it is here preſcribed. I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we are, at leaſt ſome of us, convinced of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003518_0030_0FF85581B88DBCC8"/>
and neceſſity of an <hi>early</hi> courſe of piety, and are accordingly reſolved to enter upon ſuch a courſe: And for our direction, let us as the <hi>pſalmiſt</hi> has adviſed, <hi>take heed to our way according to God's word.</hi>—We have here the great rule of all religion: Let us compare our pretences to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſs herewith, and not ſatisfy our ſelves with any thing ſhort, of that which the Goſpel allows to be pure and undefiled religion.—We have here the moſt powerful motives, and are laid under the ſtrongeſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a pious holy life: Let us herefrom learn our duty, and fetch our encouragements; quickning our ſelves in the way of godlineſs, from thoſe conſiderations which are here propoſed to us.—We have here one ſpecial means the holy Spirit makes uſe of, in converting ſinners to God: Let us attend to it as ſuch, humbly waiting and hoping for the manifeſtations of <hi>that power</hi> to our ſalvation, whereby Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>was raiſed from the dead.</hi>—In a word, as the Scriptures are profitable to all ſaving purpoſes, and every way ſufficient to make <hi>the man of God perfect,</hi> and <hi>throughly furniſhed unto all good works;</hi> let us uſe them accordingly. Let all our views, all our hopes, all our encouragements and dependances in and from religion, be regulated by the word.—And let us from the beginning of our lives, and thro' the whole courſe of them, under all the changes of time and various diſtributions of providence, govern our hearts, and order our walk according to the Goſpel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; and we ſhan't fail, <hi>thro' the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of being built up in faith and holineſs, till we become poſſeſs'd <hi>of an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE good Lord now touch our hearts with a ſenſe of theſe things! and cauſe that <hi>that grace of his which hath appeared to all men, bringing ſalvation;</hi> may effectually <hi>teach us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world:</hi> So may we with comfort <hi>look for the bleſſed hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> to whom, with the <hi>Father</hi> and the holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> be eternal praiſes. AMEN.</p>
