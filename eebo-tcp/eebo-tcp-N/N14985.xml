            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE yearly-meeting in 1783, having a concern for the reviſal of our diſcipline, committed the important work to the meeting for ſufferings, who, after waiting for a right qualification, proceeded on the buſineſs; and having the reviſal of the London diſcipline of 1782, with thoſe of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring yearly-meetings as well as our own to compare, have with much labour and cloſe attention, in the ability afforded, performed the ſame, which being laid before the laſt yearly-meeting, a large committee, conſiſting of friends from each quarter, were appointed to join the meeting for ſufferings in examining the ſame, who being met accordingly, were favoured after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſittings to go through the work; and the whole, as contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages, was agreed to; and the yearly-meeting having committed to the meeting for ſufferings the further care of communicating the ſame to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quarterly and monthly-meetings, they have thought fit to direct a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of copies to be printed for that purpoſe, in order,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That every quarterly and monthly-meeting may be furniſhed with a fair and correct collection of the minutes and advices which have been agreed to, for regulating the affairs of the ſociety.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. "That theſe minutes and advices being more generally received, may be more uniformly obſerved and put in practice, that order, unity, peace and harmony, may be preſerved throughout the churches."</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. "That in an eſpecial manner the youth of the preſent and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations may not only be early and more fully inſtructed in our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principles, but in the nature and deſign of our Chriſtian diſcipline; and through divine aſſiſtance be enabled to adorn our holy profeſſion, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent conduct and circumſpect converſation in all godlineſs and honeſty,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:019014_0003_0FA958C3C43E78B8"/>thereby avoiding the reproach which many, through a defection in principle, or a degeneracy in practice, have brought upon themſelves, and the body of which they profeſs to be members."</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. "That the unfaithful, the immoral, and the libertine profeſſors, may be ſeaſonably reminded of their danger and of their duty, as well as of the great labour, which, in much goſpel love, hath been from time to time beſtowed for their help and recovery; and that ſuch as continue to deſpiſe and reject the convictions of truth, and the counſel of their brethren, and refuſe to be reclaimed, may be made ſenſible that they themſelves are the cauſe of their ſeparation from our religious fellowſhip and communion: For when any, by their inconſiſtent and diſorderly conduct, or by imbibing and adopting principles or practices contrary to the doctrine which we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have firſt manifeſted their diſunity with the ſociety, it is but juſt and requiſite, that, after endeavouring and waiting to reſtore them without effect, the body ſhould teſtify its diſunity with ſuch erring and refractory members; at the ſame time earneſtly deſiring that they may be convinced of the error of their ways, and that through unfeigned repentance, and a conſiſtent orderly conduct in future, they may be re-united to the body. This being the utmoſt extent of our diſcipline reſpecting offenders, it is very evident, that, from the right exerciſe thereof, no degree of perſecution or impoſition can be juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; for the impoſition reſts entirely on the part of thoſe who inſiſt on being retained as members, whilſt at open variance with the body, either in principle or practice."</p>
            <p>We are not however without a clear ſenſe that this publication will prove inſufficient to produce the deſired effect, unleſs we are very careful to move and act under the immediate influence of the Spirit of Chriſt, in the pure love of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>"And whilſt we are earneſtly recommending this work to the notice and regard of friends, we cannot omit to preſs upon them a diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures, as ſuperior to all other writing for inſtruction; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Although this collection is printed ſolely for the uſe of our own ſociety, yet, ſhould it get abroad and meet the public eye, it is not doubted but every ſerious and candid reader will obſerve, throughout the whole, the conſtant and earneſt endeavours of the ſociety for the promotion of virtue and religion.</p>

            <head>ARBITRATION.</head>
            <p>AGREED, that the chooſing of arbitrators is proper in caſes of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about a man's property. 1684.</p>
            <p>Whereas it ſometimes happeneth, to the hurt of truth, and grief of many friends, that differences do ariſe amongſt ſome profeſſing truth, about outward things; it is therefore by this meeting thought convenient, and adviſed, that when any friend or friends ſhall hear of any ſuch difference betwixt any friends in that meeting to which they do belong, that they forthwith ſpeak to, and tenderly adviſe, the perſons between whom the difference is, to make a ſpeedy end thereof; and if that friend or thoſe friends do not comply with their advice, that then they take to them one or two friends more, and again exhort them to end their difference; and if they or either of them refuſe, then to let them know, that it is the advice and counſel of friends, that they ſhould each chooſe an equal number of indifferent, impartial and judicious friends, to hear and ſpeedily determine the ſame; and that they do bind themſelves to ſtand to their award and determination, or the award and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the major part of them, that ſhall be made and ſigned by the arbitrators.</p>
            <p>Alſo this meeting doth adviſe, that if any perſon profeſſing the truth among us, and eſteemed a friend, ſhall refuſe ſpeedily to end the difference, or refer it as before adviſed, complaint be made of that perſon or perſons, unto the monthly-meeting to which he doth belong; and if after admonition he ſhall refuſe ſo to refer his caſe, that then the meeting do teſtify againſt ſuch perſon, and diſown him to be of our ſociety, until he ſhall comply with the equal methods and agreements of our ſociety, and by ſuch his compliance
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019014_0013_0FA958D0B68D5500"/>doth declare that he is for peace, and doth ſeek and deſire it: And when any perſon ſo refuſing is teſtified againſt by the meeting, and diſowned, the other perſon may have his liberty to ſeek his remedy againſt him at law. 1697.</p>
            <p>Adviſed, that in all caſes of controverſy and difference, the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein either ſpeedily compoſe the difference between themſelves, or make choice of ſome faithful friends to determine the ſame; or otherwiſe, if they cannot agree upon the choice, to ſubmit to the monthly-meeting's choice of certain perſons meet to inſpect and determine the controverſy, and to ſtand to their award and final determination thereof; that ſuch controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies may not be continued, to cauſe a reproach. 1692.</p>
            <p>And it is the advice of this meeting, that perſons differing about outward things do, as little as may be, trouble public miniſtering friends with being arbitrators in ſuch caſes. 1697.</p>
            <p>And that all perſons differing be exhorted by the monthly-meeting to which they belong, when their caſes are referred, and judgment and award made, ſigned and given thereupon, as aforeſaid, to ſtand to and perform the ſaid award, which they have bound themſelves to perform: And if any ſhall refuſe ſo to do, that then the monthly-meeting to which ſuch perſon doth belong, upon notice thereof to them given, ſhall appoint a ſuitable committee to labour with him, and if he do not make it evident, that there is manifeſt error or injuſtice, they admoniſh him thereunto; and if after admonition he perſiſt to refuſe, then the meeting to teſtify againſt him as before; but if ſuch error or injuſtice be made to appear, then the matter be reconſidered by the ſame or other arbitrators, as in the judgment of the monthly-meeting may appear beſt, and ſuch correcting judgment be final. And the bonds of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration are not to be conſidered binding and final, where evident error or injuſtice is made to appear, and it is adviſed that bonds be written accordingly; but where this is not manifeſt, ſuch bonds be concluſive and final.</p>

It is the ſenſe and judgment of this meeting, that if any perſon profeſſing truth with us ſhall arreſt, ſue, or implead at law, any other of our members, before he hath proceeded in the methods herein before recommended, that ſuch perſon doth therein depart from the principle of truth, and the known way thereof, and acts contrary thereunto, and ought to be dealt with by the meeting he belongs to for the ſame; and if he ſhall not give ſatisfaction to the meeting for ſuch his diſorderly proceeding, by condemning it, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therein, that then he be diſowned by the meeting. 1697. 1692.</p>
            <p>And if the party ſo ſued or arreſted taking with him, or if under confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſending one or two friends to the perſon who goes to law, ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain thereof, the ſaid perſon ſhall be required immediately to ſtay proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and if he does not comply with ſuch requiſition, the monthly-meeting to which he belongs ſhall diſown him, if the caſe require it. 1782.</p>
            <p>So much of the minute as doth relate ſimply to the entering into bonds, and ſo far as arbitrations may be refuſed on account of diſputes and queſtions in law, relating to executors or truſtees, where the property is not their own, in both theſe caſes, that there be a particular and ſpecial regard had to the nature and circumſtances of things, it not being either now, nor at the time of making the ſaid minute, the intent of this meeting, in the above deſcribed or other caſes, to lay any unwarrantable burthen upon any brother, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the church of God. 1720.</p>

The following Method is to be obſerved in proceeding in Arbitrations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Each party having choſen one or two indifferent, impartial and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious friends, thoſe ſo choſen are to agree upon a third or a fifth friend, unleſs the parties firſt agree in the nomination, whoſe name ſhall be inſerted with the others in the bonds of arbitration, or other written agreement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The arbitrators ſhould not conſider themſelves as advocates for the party by whom they were choſen, but men, whoſe incumbent duty it is to judge righteouſly, fearing the Lord. They ſhould ſhun all previous infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation reſpecting the caſe, that they may not become biaſſed in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before they hear both parties together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The parties to enter into written engagements or bonds, if either of them require it, to abide by the award of the arbitrators, or a majority of them, to be made in a limited time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every meeting of the arbitrators muſt be made known to the parties concerned, until they have been fully heard, nor ſhall there be any ſeparate private meetings between ſome of the arbitrators, or with one party ſeparate from the other, on the buſineſs referred to them; and no repreſentation of the caſe of one party, either by writing or otherwiſe, be admitted, without its being fully made known to the other, and, if required, a copy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the other party.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The arbitrators are to hear both parties fully, in the preſence of each other, whilſt either hath any freſh matter to offer, until a certain time, to be limited by mutual agreement. Let no evidence or witneſs be withheld or rejected.</p>

6. If there ſhould appear to the arbitrators, or any of them, to be any doubtful point of law, they are jointly to agree upon a caſe, and conſult council thereupon.</p>
            <p>The arbitrators are not required to expreſs in the award their reaſons for their deciſion. One writing of the award is to be delivered to each party.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to arbitrators to propoſe to the parties, that they ſhould give an acknowledgment in writing, before the award be made, that they have been candidly and fully heard.</p>

            <p>This meeting conſidering that ſome in the preſent age do endeavour, as well by certain books, as a licentious converſation, to leſſen and decry the true faith in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, even that precious faith once delivered to his faints, which by the mercy of God is alſo beſtowed upon us, do therefore earneſtly adviſe and exhort all parents, maſters and miſtreſſes of families, and guardians of minors, that they prevent, as much as in them lies, their children, ſervants, and youth, under their reſpective care and tuition, from the having or reading books or papers that have any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

            <p>Under a conſideration of the hurtful tendency of reading plays, romances, novels, and other pernicious books, it is earneſtly recommended to every member of our ſociety to diſcourage and ſuppreſs the ſame. And friends are deſired to be careful of the choice of all books, in which their children read, ſeeing there are many under the ſpecious titles of religion and morality, containing ſentiments repugnant to the truth, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus. 1764.</p>

            <p>INASMUCH as we have a large body of youth growing up, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of friends, theſe call for our ſpecial care and concern, that they may be preſerved in the way of truth, in which our forefathers walked; and in order thereto, we tenderly recommend to all parents and guardians, firſt, that they take heed to themſelves, that their own ſpirits be rightly ſeaſoned and directed, for the help and good government of their children; and then, that they have a conſtant watchful eye in love over them for their good, and keep them as much as poſſible within their notice and obſervation; for this we are ſenſible of, that the miſcarriages of youth have very much proceeded from their being imprudently indulged or left to themſelves, by which means they become expoſed to the danger of evil examples on the one hand, and vicious corrupt principles on the other, with which the world too much abounds; and therefore we earneſtly and tenderly adviſe all parents and guardians to be watchfully concerned in this reſpect, and that they take all proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, both by example and inſtruction, to help their children; and that mothers of children as well as fathers, as they have frequently the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, would take particular care to inſtruct them in the knowledge of religion, and the Holy Scriptures; becauſe it has been found by experience that good impreſſions early made on the tender minds of children, have proved laſting means of preſerving them in a religious life and converſation.

            <p>But when parents or guardians are deficient in ſuch their care, we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to monthly-meetings, that they ſtir them up thereto, either by viſiting them in their families, or in ſuch manner as in the wiſdom of God they may ſee meet; that ſo the doctrines of the goſpel, and a converſation agreeable thereunto, may be maintained unto all generations. 1732.</p>
            <p>It is the ſenſe and judgment of this meeting, that children of ſuch parents as are married among friends ſhall be looked upon as members, and the children of ſuch parents as become members by requeſt, and are born after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhall likewiſe be looked upon as members, as alſo their children born before, if their parents apply on their behalf, and the monthly-meeting think they are ſuitable; and that where but one of the parents is a member, either father or mother, become ſo by application or otherwiſe, their children ſhall not be looked upon as members, unleſs their father or mother profeſſing with us make application to the monthly-meeting on account of their children; and then the monthly-meeting judge whether ſuch children be ſuitable to be admitted as members or not.</p>

            <p>This is our principle, and hath ever been our practice, to obey authority by doing or ſuffering, not diſputing whether the authority in itſelf be abſolutely of God or not, yet being an authority over us, we are to obey it either by doing or ſuffering, becauſe it is an authority. 1661, renewed 1782.</p>
            <p>Adviſed to walk wiſely and circumſpectly towards all men, in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus, giving no offence or occaſions to thoſe in outward government, nor way to any controverſies, heats, and diſtractions of this world, about the kingdoms of it; but to pray for the good of all, and ſubmit all to that divine power and wiſdom, which rule over the kingdoms of men. 1689.</p>

            <p>We cannot for conſcience ſake actively comply with ſome things enjoined by human laws, yet the principles we profeſs, as well as the Holy Scriptures, require that we ſhould "render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's," and be punctual in the payment of every tribute, which we can juſtly do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acting in oppoſition to that ſacred illumination beſtowed upon us by the Father of Lights, not only to teach, but alſo to enable us to perform every duty with uprightneſs and integrity, both to God, and to thoſe who, in the courſe of his providence, are placed in authority. 1757.</p>
            <p>For the preſervation of our fellow members, it appears neceſſary for this meeting to iſſue forth the following advices, viz.</p>
            <p>That they ſtrictly adhere to our long profeſſed and invariable principle, againſt being concerned in pulling down and ſetting up, or bringing about revolutions in outward government, by outward force, human policy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; and alſo that they be not deceived with the flattering proſpect of being cloathed with ſecular authority, either legiſlative, judicial or executive, knowing theſe things have a tendency rather to brace the mind with pride, and expoſe to various temptations, than to humble the creature; therefore ſhun temptation, ſeek humility, the way to be cloathed with authority in the truth, and be contented with the honour and dignity thereof. 1782.</p>
            <p>It is our ſenſe and judgment that no friend can, conſiſtent with our Chriſtian teſtimony, run, or make, or countenance on his behalf to be made, any ſhort entries of goods, wares or merchandize, imported, on which the government have laid any impoſt, duties or exciſe; but that a true and honeſt manifeſt thereof be exhibited to the proper office for receiving the ſame; and if there

            <p>We do, in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, warn and charge all that profeſs the truth amongſt us, to take heed and beware of covetouſneſs, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching, oppreſſing and defrauding of any, from whence ſtrife, contention and law-ſuits, do often ariſe; and if any difference about theſe things do happen among you, to ſtop and ſuppreſs it. 1697.</p>
            <p>As our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt exhorted and warned to take heed and beware of covetouſneſs, which is idolatry, we are concerned that all profeſſing Chriſtianity among us may take heed of pride, covetouſneſs, and haſtening to be rich in the world, which are pernicious and growing evils; let them be watched againſt, reſiſted and ſuppreſſed, in the fear and dread of Almighty God, and have no place or countenance in his camp. O ye grave elders, both men and women! be careful and watchful againſt theſe evils, and over the youth in theſe caſes. 1720.</p>
            <p>We beſeech you to ſtand upon your guard againſt the allurements and temptation of this evil world; and beware of an ambitious and covetous ſpirit, by which many are enſnared in too eager a purſuit of earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the danger of which is thus deſcribed by the apoſtle Paul: "They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare; and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition: For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows."</p>
            <p>Beware therefore, dearly beloved, leſt you alſo, being led aſide by the love of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, fall from your own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs. 1740.</p>

            <p>The Fourth day of the week they called Wedneſday, from the appellation of Woden, another of their idols.</p>
            <p>The Fifth day of the week was called Thurſday, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their devotions on that day.</p>

            <p>In the ages of Popiſh ſuperſtition, not only the uſe of ſuch heatheniſh names and cuſtoms was indulged, but alſo other unſound and unſcriptural practices in religion were invented and introduced.

Seeing therefore that theſe appellations and names of days, months, and times, are of an idolatrous or ſuperſtitious original, contrary to the divine command, the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the Chriſtian teſtimony borne by our faithful friends and predeceſſors in the truth, for the ſake of which they patiently endured many revillings; let neither the reproach of ſingularity, nor the ſpecious reaſonings of ſuch as would evade the croſs of Chriſt, turn you aſide from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, nor diſcourage you from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days according to the plain and ſcriptural way of expreſſion, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in a noble and honourable teſtimony againſt theſe, and all other remains of idolatry and ſuperſtition.</p>

            <head>DEFAMATION and DETRACTION.</head>
            <p>ADVISED to watch againſt all tale-bearing and defaming friends or others, or evil-ſpeaking tending thereunto; and ſhut out all occaſions of offences, contentions and diviſions, and to put a ſpeedy ſtop thereto, paſſing righteous judgment upon all, who appear inſtruments of diviſions and offences, contrary to that peaceable truth and goſpel we profeſs to be guided by. Be kind and tender-hearted one to another, earneſtly labouring for univerſal love, union, and peace in our religious ſociety.</p>
            <p>But when any hath received offence from another; let him firſt ſpeak privately to the party offending, and endeavour reconciliation between themſelves, and not to whiſpher, or aggravate matters againſt one another, behind their backs, to the making parties, and the breach wider. 1692.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe juſt and ancient commands of God be obſerved, Levit. xix. 16, "Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people;" and Exodus xxiii. 1, "Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report." In the fear of the Lord ſtand againſt all whiſperers, backbiters, tale-bearers, defamers and ſlanderers, and againſt all whiſperings, backbitings, tale-bearing, reproaching, and ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and put a ſpeedy ſtop thereto as much as in you lies, for ſuch works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and envy tend to diviſion and diſcord, and the righteous law of God goes againſt both the authors, fomenters, receivers and encouragers thereof. 1695.</p>
            <p>Be careful to avoid all backbitings, whiſperings, and tale-bearings; for "The words of a tale-bearer," ſays the wiſe man, "are as wounds," Prov. xviii. 8, tending to the defamation and leſſening the characters one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be not therefore like thoſe of whom the prophet complains, "Report, ſay they, and we will report;" but when you hear a thing tending to the defamation of any, enquire of the reporter, whether he has acquainted the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019014_0033_0FA958E85C90AAF8"/>perſon affected thereby with ſuch a report; if not, caution him to forbear ſpreading the ſame, leſt the reputation of the innocent be injured thereby. Endeavour to put a ſpeedy ſtop to all ſuch wicked practices, and works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtly condemnable, not only in the authors, but the encouragers thereof. "He that worketh deceit," ſays the Royal Pſalmiſt, <q>ſhall not dwell within my houſe; he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight,</q> Pſal. ci. 5, 7. 1738.</p>
            <p>We remind you to ſtand upon your guard againſt all whiſpering, backbiting and detracting ſpirits, who buſy themſelves in ſpreading evil ſurmiſings one of another, and to diſcourage every practice of that nature, obſerving the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the apoſtle, <q>Let all bitterneſs, wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,</q> Eph. iv. 31, 32. Always mindful of the precept of our Lord, <q>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them,</q> Mat. viii. 12. 1748.</p>
            <p>And in order to put a ſtop to all tale-bearing and ſlandering, friends would do well to manifeſt their averſion to ſuch a practice. <q>The north wind, ſays Solomon, driveth away rain; ſo doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue,</q> Prov. xxv. 23. 1733.</p>
            <p>It is the advice of this meeting, that any perſon charged with defamation or ſcandal, ought to be proceeded againſt in the manner and by the ſeveral ſteps following: Firſt, the perſon defamed, or ſuppoſed to be defamed, in his own perſon, or any other to whom the knowledge of the caſe ſhall come, to go to the accuſed and tell him his fault, or ſuppoſed fault, between them alone, and by the beſt method he is capable of to labour to convince him of it, in order to his acknowledgment of the truth and repentance, if he appears to be guilty. But if the accuſed ſhall appear, either through ignorance not to apprehend the validity of the proof, or through wilfulneſs not to yield to it, or being convinced, ſhall refuſe to make ſuch ſatisfaction as the nature of caſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019014_0034_0FA958E9D2105808"/>requires (that being the conſequence of true repentance) in ſuch caſe the accuſer to take with him one or two more of the monthly-meeting the accuſed belongs to, if it may be conveniently done, and if the accuſed thinks fit, he may bring with him one or two friends alſo of the ſame monthly-meeting, if it may be conveniently done; and they together, in the wiſdom of God, to endeavour to obtain the true knowledge of the caſe, by hearing witneſſes, if there be occaſion. And if they all judge him guilty, and he doth not make ſatisfaction; or if they do not all agree that he is innocent; in either of theſe caſes happening, the perſon charging is at liberty to bring the matter before the church, who are the only judges now remaining, both of the nature of the fact, and the validity of the proof of it; and they, in the wiſdom of God, which we hope will not be wanting to his church, as they humbly wait on him for it, to deal with him for the good ends before mentioned, and as they ſee cauſe, upon a mature and deliberate conſideration, to juſtify or condemn him. And if the church ſhall ſee meet to commit the conſideration of a caſe of this nature, for better diſpatch, to certain perſons of their own body, we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it as our tender advice, in caſe the accuſed ſhall object againſt one or more of the friends ſo choſen, that the church have a due regard to ſuch objection, and ſet aſide the perſon or perſons ſo objected againſt, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute another or others in his or their room, provided ſuch objection doth not extend to the major part of the friends ſo choſen; and in general we deſire all tenderneſs and regard may be had to a perſon under ſuch circumſtances; and that friends, in a ſpirit of love and condeſcenſion, ſhould be ready to make him as eaſy as they can, provided they keep up the authority of their meetings.</p>
            <p>Nameleſs books, pamphlets, and papers, reflecting darkly on friends, are teſtified againſt; and it is deſired that no ſuch book, pamphlet or paper, be written, printed, publiſhed, or privately handed about, by any under our profeſſion, for the time to come. 1718.</p>
            <p>If you hear a report of a friend (to his diſadvantage) be careful not to report it again, but go to the perſon of whom the report is, and enquire if it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019014_0035_0FA958EA8A9CFAE0"/>be true; then deal with ſuch a perſon for it, according to the doctrine of Chriſt, Mat. xviii. 16, 17; but if falſe, then endeavour as much as in you lies to ſtop ſuch report: For, as Solomon ſays, <q>A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches,</q> Prov. xxii. 1. 1719.</p>
            <p>Whereas it may happen, that ſome friends may ſuffer much in their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and character, by a detracting ſpirit, which too much prevails among ſome bearing our name, who ſhelter themſelves under a pretence that they ſay no more than they have heard from others, but will not diſcover who they are; wherefore, to prevent this evil of reporting and tale-bearing, it is agreed, that ſuch reporters or tale-bearers ſhall either diſcover their authors, or be dealt with, and teſtified againſt, as the authors thereof. 1744.</p>

            <head>DIFFERENCES and DISPUTES.</head>
            <p>ADVISED that friends be tender to the principle of God in all, and ſhun the occaſion of vain diſputes and janglings, both amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; for this many times is like a bluſtering wind, that hurts and bruiſes the tender buds of plants. 1676.</p>
            <p>Seeing our comfort, as a people, depends upon our care to maintain peace and fellowſhip amongſt brethren, in all our ſervices, we earneſtly recommend an humble and condeſcending frame of ſpirit unto all; that with godly fear, wiſdom and meekneſs, we may be ſo ordered in all our reſpective ſervices, that every high and rough thing may be laid low, that all occaſions of ſtriving may be prevented, and the peace of the church of Chriſt preſerved and increaſed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe it is tenderly adviſed, that we diligently and carefully obſerve the comely and bleſſed goſpel order, ſo long known and in practice amongſt us, in the ſpirit of meekneſs and of a ſound mind, which is the way to cruſh all differences in their infancy, and ſuppreſs the riſe as well as ſtop the progreſs of every thing that is unſeemly, and inconſiſtent with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the precious truth. 1699.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that a ſpirit of love and humility may more and more diffuſe itſelf among us, and influence the hearts of all, ſo that every one may come to ſeek peace and purſue it; and that none be apt to take offence; but each, in his own particular, be more careful to rectify his own failings and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, than curious in obſerving, cenſuring and aggravating, thoſe of others. This will lead to the exerciſe of mutual forbearance and forgiveneſs one of another, by which the occaſions of contention will be avoided, and the church preſerved in a ſtate of peace and tranquility. 1736.</p>

            <p>ADVISED that the church's teſtimony and judgments againſt diſorderly and ſcandalous walkers, as alſo the repentance and condemnation of the parties reſtored, be recorded in a diſtinct book in the reſpective monthly and quarterly-meetings, for the clearing of truth, friends, and our holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; to be produced and publiſhed by friends for that end and purpoſe, ſo far only as in God's heavenly wiſdom they ſhall ſee needful.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo our advice in the love of God, that after any friend's repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reſtoration, he abiding faithful in the truth that condemns the evil, none among you ſo remember his tranſgreſſion, as to caſt it at him, or upbraid him with it; for that is not according to the mercies of God. 1675.</p>
            <p>Earneſtly recommended, whatever your places and ſtations in the church may be, that in the moſt weighty and ſerious manner you often call to remembrance, in all humility of mind, what it was that brought us to be a people; and what is and will be that which will preſerve us ſuch: That the foundation on which a true Chriſtian is built, is the ſpirit of Chriſt; let this therefore direct you in all things, both reſpecting your private converſation, and whatever you do for God in his church: This is the only true means to preſerve you holy and blameleſs in the one, as well as ſerviceable and uſeful in the other; in this every one will have a ſingle regard to the ſervice that comes before him, in monthly and quarterly-meetings, without partiality or reſpect of perſons.</p>

And in the management of ſuch affairs, they will find their own ſpirits rightly ſeaſoned and prepared for every work and ſervice to which they may be called; and all diſorderly proceedings, ariſing from the heat of our own ſpirits, will thereby be ſhut out; and thus the church will be preſerved, on her ancient, ſolid, and permanent foundation, to the glory of God, and her own quiet and comfort. 1726.</p>
            <p>And in order for the regular and eaſy proceeding in the ſervice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the church, meetings have been by divine aſſiſtance, as above hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſet up and eſtabliſhed, ſerviceable and ſubordinate one unto another as preparative, conſiſting of friends belonging to one or more meetings particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for worſhip: Monthly, conſiſting of as many preparatives as may moſt uſefully compoſe the ſame: Quarterly, to conſiſt of as many monthly-meetings as are thought uſeful to conſtitute the ſame, to meet together once in three months: Yearly, conſiſting of all the quarterly-meetings in New-England, to meet annually the fifth day before the ſecond ſixth day, in the ſixth month, on Rhode-Iſland, for a great and weighty overſight and Chriſtian care of the affairs of the churches, pertaining to our holy profeſſion and Chriſtian communion; that good order, true love, unity and concord, may be faithfully followed and maintained among all of us as a peculiar people, called and choſen out of the world, and the errors and corruptions thereof. And as it hath been experienced, that in thoſe meetings great comfort and ſatisfaction have been received and enjoyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humility and love, with no other views but the ſervice of God, and the help and aſſiſtance one of another; this meeting doth therefore, in brotherly love, exhort all friends carefully to gather in uprightneſs and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, ſuitable to our calling, and the dignity of that power, that as we behave wiſely and meekly, will preſide and govern in all our meetings:

            <p>Let a neceſſary enquiry be raiſed in the minds of all members of the church, who have had any part of the Lord's work upon them, how they have acquitted themſelves therein, and diſcharged themſelves in the ſight of God; foraſmuch as a day comes on apace, in which an account of our ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip will be required at our hands. The diſcipline of the ſociety, in ſome places at a low ebb, would again be revived and ſtrengthened, if this awful ſenſe of rendering an account of our truſt, and the importance of being clear from the blood of all men, were enough impreſſed upon all minds. And, dear friends, as it is the Lord's work, let it be done as in his ſight. Let all our anſwers to the queries be plain and explicit. Let a due ſenſe of the ſtate of the church prevail on your minds, rather than an unwillingneſs to appear deficient among your brethren. May a ſuitable engagement of mind prevail on all the active members of the church to acquit themſelves with faithfulneſs, that they may at laſt receive the crown of righteouſneſs, which will never fade away. 1760.</p>

            <head>EDUCATION.</head>
            <p>ADVISED that friends who are of ability, and have the proſperity of truth at heart, would in the education of their children take care, as ſuitable opportunities and occaſions may offer, to let them be inſtructed in ſome modern tongues, as French, High and Low Dutch, Daniſh, &amp;c. that ſo when they are grown up, as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to diſpoſe and incline them, they may be of ſervice to the church. 1737.</p>
            <p>As the right education of children, and the nurture of youth, is of very great conſequence to them, and to the ſucceeding generation, we preſſingly exhort all parents, and heads of families, to procure ſuch uſeful learning for their children, as their abilities will admit; and to encourage them, as well by example as precept, to the frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures; and that they begin, as early as poſſible, to inſtil into their tender minds the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of truth and virtue; and inſtruct them in the nature and neceſſity of being born from above, without which, our Lord declared, no man ſhall ſee the kingdom of God; and, in order hereunto, that they labour to bring them acquainted with the holy ſeed, which is ſown by the divine hand in every heart for that gracious end; that they may, through the Lord's bleſſing of ſuch pious and paternal endeavours, be induced to place their affections upon it, and cleaving thereto in faithful obedience, come to experience it to be unto them Chriſt within the hope of their glory.</p>
            <p>The importance of an early inſtruction in the law of God, is ſet forth with peculiar ſtrength, clearneſs, and ſolemnity, in Deut. vi. 4, &amp;c. <q>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might. And theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thine heart,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019014_0043_0FA958F44FFDD388"/>and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</q> It is requiſite alſo that reſtraint be added to inſtruction, it being much eaſier, as well as more prudent, to be exerciſed upon the firſt appearances of an inclination to danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or hurtful liberties, than afterwards; for where children, through the prevalence of fond affection, have been accuſtomed to improper indulgences, when they are grown to ſuch a dangerous degree of ripeneſs, that the exertion of authority hath become abſolutely neceſſary, the ſtrength of their paſſions ſo habituated hath often proved unconquerable, or very difficult to overcome, to the great hurt of the unhappy youth, and the unſpeakable grief of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently indulgent parents. 1760.</p>

            <p>And we beſeech you, brethren, let the tender advice of ſuch as ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo brotherly an office, meet with a kind and open reception, that in the mutual giving and receiving of wholeſome counſel and advice, you may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to the help and furtherance of each other's faith, and the reviving our ancient Chriſtian teſtimony. 1752.</p>

            <p>A weighty concern being livingly impreſſed on our minds in this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that good ſervice may ariſe from viſiting the families of our brethren, by rightly concerned friends, we are engaged to recommend it to the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of the body, and to monthly and quarterly-meetings, to feel deeply after the pointings of truth; and that as this divine principle opens their way, they may promote this uſeful ſervice in their reſpective meetings, by appointing ſuitable friends, of either or both ſexes, who are deſired to proceed therein in the love of the goſpel, and under the tendering influence thereof; which we have good cauſe to hope may thus be attended with beneficial effects to the viſited, and with ſolid ſatisfaction, and additional experience in the work of truth, to thoſe who may be engaged therein. 1773.</p>

            <p>And whereas at ſome burials, when people come from far, there may be occaſion of ſome refreſhment, yet it is adviſed that it be done with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, avoiding that indecent and unbecoming practice of uſing ſpirituous liquors; and that the behaviour of all friends be with ſuch gravity and ſobriety as becomes the occaſion; and if any appear otherwiſe, let ſuch be reproved and dealt with as the caſe may require.</p>
            <p>And it is adviſed that friends carefully keep to the time appointed for burials, and not wait for ſuch as may come unſeaſonably. And that none erect grave nor tomb-ſtones.

            <p>WHEREAS ſome perſons, profeſſing with us, have proved ſo baſe and unworthy, as when they have run themſelves into debt, to remove themſelves, or their effects, to prevent juſtice; whereby thoſe creditors, who are friends, have been deprived of an opportunity of the common method of friends, ſpecified in the minute of 1697, reſpecting arbitrations; it is hereby declared, that the laſt paragraph of ſaid minute, which prohibits friends to ſue or arreſt one another, is not intended to prevent ſuch evil perſons in thoſe practices from being dealt with by a legal proceſs, as the nature of the caſe may require: Of which circumſtance the monthly and quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the proper judges; ſo it is not doubted but they will do juſtice to the parties concerned therein.

            <head>LIBERALITY to the POOR.</head>
            <p>It is deſired that ſuch among friends as are endowed with plenty of outward ſubſtance, be timely and tenderly adviſed to do good therewith, in their day and generation, eſpecially with regard to the poor; that the tokens of your charity may commend your memorial, and be good precedents to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come. 1696.</p>
            <p>We find ourſelves at this time engaged to requeſt, that where proviſions and the neceſſaries of life are dear and ſcarce, or ſickneſs doth remarkably afflict, friends would in proportion to ſuch ſcarcity and affliction exert their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aſſiſtance to the poor, which is our Chriſtian duty, as ſtewards of the mercies wherewith the Lord has intruſted us. 1729.</p>
            <p>"Let your moderation be known unto all men." "Warn thoſe that are rich in this world, that they truſt not in uncertain riches," nor apply them to the indulging their appetites in pleaſure and vanity; but that they "be ready to do good, and to communicate" to the relief of thoſe who are in neceſſity.</p>
            <p>The principal if not only ſatisfaction a man of a truly Chriſtian diſpoſition can have in the affluence and increaſe of the things of this world, muſt ariſe from the opportunities put into his hands, and the doing good therewith. 1741.</p>

            <head>LOVE and UNITY.</head>
            <p>IT is our earneſt deſire, that, above all, friends hold fervent charity in the body; that will keep the members together in a bleſſed concord and communion, which is eſteemed by the apoſtle the more excellent way, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling other gifts, which paſs away; but charity, that is the love of God (from which our Chriſtian and brotherly affection ſprings) ſhall endure forever: <q>This envieth not, vaunteth not, boaſteth not itſelf, and ſeeketh not its own; but is patient, beareth all things, ſuffereth all things, and watcheth not with an evil eye, no, nor thinketh ill, but is kind;</q> in which bleſſed love, dear friends, hold your fellowſhip one with another, which was the character of the primitive Chriſtians. 1705.</p>
            <p>Among the goſpel precepts, we find not any thing more ſtrongly and frequently recommended by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, to the primitive believers, than that they ſhould love one another: And as we are ſenſible that nothing will contribute more to the peace and proſperity of the church than a due regard to this advice, ſo we earneſtly deſire that it may be the care and concern of all friends every where to dwell therein, and, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to maintain love, concord and peace, in and among all the churches of Chriſt. 1730.</p>
            <p>By accounts received, it appears that, in general, love and concord are maintained, and that friends in divers places are under an earneſt concern for the promotion of peace, and for the ſuppreſſing and guarding againſt every occaſion of ſtrife and diſcord, tending to divide and ſcatter the flock of Chriſt: For ſtrengthening this concern, and promoting this Chriſtian diſpoſition of love whereſoever it appears, we remind you of the benefits thereof, expreſſed in Pſalm cxxxiii. <q>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is for brethren
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:019014_0052_0FA9590049120968"/>to dwell together in unity!

            <p>WE do exhort friends every where, that in the great concern of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereon much of the comfort and happineſs of life depend, they be mindful to proceed in the fear of the Lord, and have an eye to him for counſel and inſtruction in their choice; the neglect of which has been the ruin of many. 1734.</p>
            <p>Parents, who have children to diſpoſe of in marriage, are tenderly adviſed not to make it their firſt or chief care to obtain for them large portions or ſettlements of marriage; but rather be careful that their children be joined in marriage with perſons of religious inclinations, ſuitable diſpoſitions, temper, ſobriety of manners, and diligence in buſineſs (which are things eſſentially neceſſary to a comfortable life in a married ſtate) and carefully to guard againſt all mixt marriages, and unequal yoking of their children therein. 1722.</p>
            <p>We being ſenſible of the hurt that may happen by perſons under our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion drawing out the affections of one another, without the knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parents or guardians, do, for preventing ſuch miſchief, deliver it as our ſenſe and judgment, that in caſe any member of our ſociety ſhall make application to any woman, being alſo a member, with intention or endeavours to entangle her affections, or make ſuit in order to marriage, without the privity and conſent of her parents or guardians firſt had and obtained, or ſhall countenance or admit of ſuch ſuit or application, whether ſuch parents or guardians be friends or not; ſuch perſons ought not to be allowed or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to proceed in any meeting of friends, in order to the accompliſhing ſuch intended marriage, until they ſhall have removed the offence, and given ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction both to ſuch parents or guardians, and to the meeting of friends where they belong, by an open and due acknowledgment of the offence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:019014_0055_0FA959028A6C4238"/>of themſelves therefor, and ſhall have obtained the conſent of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And it is further adviſed, that after parents and guardians have ſuffered their children to engage one another in affections, they do not break off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any worldly account, but that they wait upon and ſeek the Lord for their children in propoſals of marriage, before they give any encouragement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 1707.</p>
            <p>It is our ſenſe and judgment, that it is inconſiſtent with the leadings of truth, for brothers children, ſiſters children, half brothers children, or half ſiſters children, to marry together, and for any to marry a firſt couſin's child, or any perſon nearer than a ſecond couſin; and if any notwithſtanding ſhould proceed in marriage together, nearer than a ſecond couſin, being previouſly cautioned and adviſed againſt it, that the monthly-meeting where ſuch may belong give forth a public teſtimony againſt them, and not receive ſuch into unity again, until ſuch meetings are well aſſured that they have found a place of ſincere repentance, and are received in the truth. 1772.</p>
            <p>It is our ſenſe and judgment, that no friend be allowed to marry with a deceaſed wife's ſiſter, or deceaſed huſband's brother: That friends be careful to give timely advice and admonition againſt ſuch proceedings; and if any ſhould be reluctant thereto, and proceed in marriage, that they be without delay teſtified againſt, and be not admitted to memberſhip again in ſociety, until friends be well aſſured that they are received in the truth. 1773.</p>
            <p>And we do alſo, in the name of the Lord, adviſe and exhort all young and unmarried people among friends, that they do not make or admit any motion or procedure one with another, upon the account of marriage, without firſt acquainting their parents or guardians therewith, and duly waiting upon them for their conſent and agreement therein. And we alſo adviſe, that, in the firſt
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:019014_0056_0FA959035FB9B828"/>place, all young perſons concerned ſeriouſly wait upon the Lord for counſel and clearneſs in this weighty concern, before they make or admit any motion or procedure with any, in order to marriage; that the Lord may be in their eye, ſo as they may not be led by any forward, brittle, or uncertain affections, in this great concern, to their own hurt, grief of their friends, and diſhonour of truth; and let it be the godly concern of both monthly and quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be careful and mindful of the preſervation and good of children in this matter, as here propoſed and ſignified, and not to omit giving due and faithful warnings and admonitions in this great and weighty concern. 1690.</p>
            <p>We having conſidered what time ſhall be held to be too early for propoſals of marriage, after the deceaſe of former huſband or wife; it is our ſenſe and judgment, that it is not adviſeable for any friend to make or admit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of marriage in leſs than twelve months. 1778.</p>
            <p>The prudent and Chriſtian care that has been maintained amongſt us, in relation to marriage, ever ſince we were a people, having obtained a good report, it is become afreſh the concern of this meeting, that the reputation of our religious ſociety, and the cauſe of truth herein, may ſtill be kept up; and that not only the ſeveral weighty advices of this meeting, in reſpect to the proceedings of the parties concerned, and the conduct of their parents and guardians, may be obſerved, but likewiſe that as little diverſity as may be may appear amongſt us in regard to the form and manner of ſolemnization.</p>
            <p>In order therefore that the general practice of the ſociety in reſpect to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may be uniform, it is agreed, that the following directions be ſent to the ſeveral quarterly-meetings, to be by them communicated to the monthly-meetings, as the rule of their proceedings, viz.</p>

The man; <hi>That be intends to take</hi> A. B. <hi>to be his wife, if the Lord permit.</hi> The woman; <hi>That ſhe intends to take</hi> B. C. <hi>to be her huſband, if the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Theſe declarations are to be made, firſt before the womens meeting, and then before the mens meeting. If they have parents or guardians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they are to declare their conſent; if abſent, a certificate or certificates are to be produced, ſignifying, <hi>that it is with their conſent the parties do proceed to accompliſh their intended marriage,</hi> previous to the declaration of the parties.</p>
            <p>After which declaration, no objection appearing, the meeting is to acquaint them, that notice will be taken thereof, and that they may come to the next monthly-meeting for an anſwer. An entry is then to be made in both the mens and womens meeting, and two friends out of each to be appointed to enquire into the converſation and clearneſs of the parties; and if there are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a former marriage or marriages, to ſee that their rights are duly and legally ſecured, and to make report to the next monthly-meeting.</p>
            <p>When, if no objection has appeared, the parties are to declare before the womens and mens meeting the <hi>continuance of their intention of marriage;</hi> and if nothing yet appears to obſtruct, liberty is then to be granted them to ſolemnize the ſame, according to the good order uſed among us.</p>
            <p>But if the parties are of different monthly-meetings, the man is firſt to propoſe the matter to the monthly-meeting to which he belongs, deſiring their certificate, ſignifying his clearneſs to proceed in marriage with <hi>A. B.</hi> a member of monthly-meeting; whereupon the meeting are to appoint two friends to make enquiry therein, and to report to the next monthly-meeting; when, if nothing appears to prevent his having ſuch certificate, he is to be recommended to the meeting to which the woman belongs, by a certificate, ſignifying his right of memberſhip, clearneſs as aforeſaid, and conſent of parents or guardians, to be produced at the firſt monthly-meeting where he lays his intentions.</p>
            <p>For ſolemnizing the marriage, a meeting may be appointed on ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient week-day, as the elders and overſeers of the marriage may think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:019014_0058_0FA95904C93E0338"/>of which due notice is to be given; but unleſs ſome ſpecial circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make it neceſſary, it is adviſed to ſolemnize our marriages at the uſual week-day meeting, at the meeting-houſe to which the woman belongs, unleſs leave hath been obtained of the monthly-meeting to ſolemnize the marriage in ſome other meeting-houſe, and the conſent of that meeting likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p>And it is earneſtly recommended, that the conſummation be performed decently, gravely and weightily; and in order thereto, and for the aſſiſtance of the parties immediately concerned, the monthly-meeting where the marriage is allowed is to appoint two judicious, grave and weighty men, and two ſuch women friends, to attend the ſame, and to ſit with the parties in the meeting for worſhip, and in a proper time, towards the concluſion of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpeak to the parties to proceed, who are then to ſtand up, and taking each other by the hand, declare in an audible and ſolemn manner to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing effect; the man firſt, viz. <hi>Friends, I take this my friend</hi> A. B. <hi>to be my wife, promiſing through divine aſſiſtance to be unto her a loving and faithful huſband, until it ſhall pleaſe the Lord by death to ſeparate us.</hi> And then the woman in like manner: <hi>Friends, I take this my friend</hi> C.

            <p>The committee appointed are to take the certificate, and lodge it with the clerk, to be recorded in a book for that purpoſe; and after attending at the houſe where the parties retire, to make report to the next monthly-meeting.</p>
            <p>Agreed that it be recommended to the quarterly-meetings, that according to the ancient decent practices among friends, they take care that ſuch men
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019014_0060_0FA95907936C32D0"/>and women friends, as do make ſuit or concern themſelves in propoſals of marriage, one to the other, do not dwell in the ſame houſe, from the time they begin to be concerned, until their marriage is conſummated. 1714.</p>
            <p>In order to put a ſtop to an undue liberty in contracting marriages with ſuch as are not of our ſociety, it is adviſed, that all parents and guardians of children do take eſpecial care, as much as in them lies, to prevent their children from running into ſuch marriages; and that the friends of each particular meeting, as alſo of the monthly-meeting to which ſuch perſons belong, do in the wiſdom and power of truth uſe their endeavours to put a ſtop to the ſaid evil, by admoniſhing ſuch as may attempt to marry as aforeſaid to deſiſt from accompliſhing the ſame; but if they refuſe to take counſel, or privately go to marry as aforeſaid, that then ſuch perſons be dealt with according to the good order of truth, and judgment fixed upon all who take ſuch undue liberty. 1719.</p>
            <p>This meeting having deliberately conſidered the great exerciſe brought upon our ſociety, by divers in profeſſion with us, who contrary to our known principles, and the wholeſome diſcipline eſtabliſhed among us, are joined in marriage by the prieſt, with perſons either of our own or other perſuaſions, do earneſtly adviſe, that all friends uſe their utmoſt endeavours to prevent ſuch marriages, whenſoever the parties inclinations may come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>And it is the ſenſe and judgment of this meeting, that where any do marry by the prieſt, or in any other manner, contrary to the eſtabliſhed rules of the ſociety, they ſhall be dealt with in a ſpirit of Chriſtian love and tenderneſs, agreeable to our known diſcipline; and that, after the commiſſion of ſuch offence, their collection ſhall not be received, nor ſhall they be relieved in the manner of poor friends, nor be admitted to ſit in meetings of diſcipline, until they are reſtored into unity with the monthly-meeting to which they belong.</p>
            <p>And we earneſtly adviſe all friends, that you watch diligently over one another for good, and that you deal in due time with ſuch offenders, and all
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:019014_0061_0FA95907CBED2578"/>others that walk diſorderly, endeavouring to reclaim and reſtore them by brotherly admonition and counſel; but where, after patient waiting, you find that your continued labour of love hath not its deſired effect, that you neglect not to teſtify againſt and diſown ſuch perſons; thereby preventing the reproach and diſhonour which might be brought on our holy profeſſion through their miſconduct, and that the end and deſign of friends in ſettling a wholeſome diſcipline among us may be anſwered. 1744, 1783. But as expreſs direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be given for each particular caſe that may ariſe, the ſeveral monthly-meetings are at liberty to judge how often ſuch offenders are to be viſited and dealt with, and in what manner they are to be proceeded againſt. Likewiſe monthly-meetings are to judge of the ſincerity of ſuch acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may be offered to them, and to accept or reject, as in true wiſdom may ſeem meet. 1768.</p>
            <p>This meeting being ſorrowfully affected, under the conſideration of the great exerciſe brought on friends by divers in our ſociety entering into marriage with ſuch as are not of our ſociety, or, being in profeſſion with us, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried contrary to our eſtabliſhed rules; to prevent which, many minutes directing dealing with ſuch offenders have from time to time been made, but it doth not appear that ſaid minutes extend to parents and guardians, that may be conſenting to or encouraging ſuch marriages; it is therefore the direction of this meeting, when that appears to be the caſe, that ſuch parents or guardians, ſo offending, be dealt with in a ſpirit of Chriſtian love and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and unleſs ſatisfaction be given to the monthly-meeting in which ſuch circumſtance may fall out, that a teſtimony do go forth for the clearing of truth againſt ſuch offenders. 1752.</p>
            <p>We alſo recommend the good order of friends relating to marriage, that it be carefully preſerved and daily maintained in the firſt and earlieſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings leading thereunto, as well as the orderly ſolemnization thereof; and if any perſons, contrary to the repeated advice and eſtabliſhed order of friends, ſhall, under any pretence whatſoever, preſume to take one another in any meeting for worſhip, without the conſent of the monthly-meeting to which

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>they belong, ſuch proceeding being of a clandeſtine nature, tending to make void the juſt care of friends in that caſe, we adviſe that the monthly-meeting do not fail to teſtify againſt the practice, as well as againſt the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. 1730.</p>
            <p>And as we have great cauſe to believe, that remiſſneſs in dealing, and weakneſs in ſome monthly-meetings in accepting ſuperficial and inſincere acknowledgments, have had a great tendency to promote ſuch marriages, we earneſtly adviſe, that monthly-meetings be very careful not to accept acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments without full ſatisfaction of the ſincere repentance of ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, manifeſted by a conduct circumſpect and conſiſtent with our religious profeſſion. 1783.</p>

            <p>A religious care is recommended toward our ſervants, that all appearance of pride, idleneſs and vain converſation, in them may be diſcouraged; and that they may be exhorted to attend firſt and week-day meetings, and have a ſenſe of God's love upon their ſpirits, and therein partake with us of the ſweetneſs of truth; and in the diſcharge of their duty to God, and to their maſters and miſtreſſes, know peace in themſelves. 1718.</p>
            <p>And it is further adviſed, that all parents and maſters of families do uſe their utmoſt care and endeavours to keep their youth duly to meetings, and to prevent the indecent ſtraggling abroad of their children and ſervants, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the firſt days, and other times allowed them to attend meetings, and to keep them out of all tumultuous crouds or gatherings of rude people. 1726.</p>

            <p>And we earneſtly exhort that you hold faſt the profeſſion of faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without wavering, both in reſpect to his outward coming in the fleſh, his ſufferings, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, mediation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion at the right hand of the Father; and to the inward manifeſtation of his grace and Holy Spirit in our hearts, powerfully working in the ſoul of man, to the ſubduing of every evil affection and luſt, and to the purifying of our conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God; that through the virtue and efficacy of this moſt holy faith, ye may become ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, which will enable you to worſhip God in ſpirit with acceptance, and preſerve you in a lively frame of mind, from a drowſy and lukewarm ſpirit, which in all our religious aſſemblies ought to be guarded againſt with the utmoſt care and circumſpection. In this lively faith and pure life of Chriſt you will have victory over the world, over your deſires after the grandeur and periſhing things thereof, and over all corrupt cuſtoms and faſhions, which are contrary to the purity of the goſpel, and our ancient Chriſtian teſtimony. 1736.</p>
            <p>In all your religious meetings for the worſhip of Almighty God, let your minds be ſeaſoned with an awful ſenſe of real and true devotion, and be ye exemplary to the flock of Chriſt. Let the ſolemn gravity of your deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſuch as may demonſtrate to others, that you are in earneſt in the great duty of waiting upon and worſhipping God in ſpirit; that ſerious and tender-hearted enquirers may be encouraged to come and partake in your aſſemblies of that inward and ſpiritual conſolation and refreſhment, which the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to impart to the ſouls of ſuch as are humbled in his ſight, and approach his holy preſence with reverence and fear.</p>

Take care, we beſeech you, in this day of eaſe and liberty, leſt a ſpirit of lukewarmneſs and indifferency prevail over you, to the ſtopping up the ſtreams of the water of life, and rendering you like the barren heath in the deſert, which knoweth not when good comes. We entreat you to be eſpecially watchful in this behalf, that an indolent and ſluggiſh diſpoſition appear not among you, to the ſtumbling of ſuch ſerious enquirers as may attend our meetings, in expectation of that life and power, which the obſervation of your indifference and unconcernedneſs may give them too juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that ye yourſelves are ſtrangers to. 1741.</p>
            <p>Let not the ſmallneſs of your numbers diſcourage you from conſtantly attending thoſe meetings, inaſmuch as the words of Chriſt remain unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably true and ſtedfaſt, <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</q> Mat. xviii. 20. But it hath been juſtly obſerved, that where remiſſneſs and neglect of attending meetings for worſhip have prevailed, it hath been too often an inlet to further declenſion, and ſuch other undue liberties as truth and its guidance do by no means admit of. 1754.</p>
            <p>We therefore tenderly exhort ſuch as, through fear of neglecting their temporal concerns, or other conſiderations, are kept from a due attendance of theſe meetings, ſeriouſly to conſider that gracious promiſe left upon record; <q>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</q> Some of us have to teſtify, by bleſſed experience, that our outward affairs have not ſuffered, by giving up our time, the few hours ſet apart for religious worſhip; but, on the contrary, our minds have been thereby greatly ſtrengthened to come up with propriety in the duties we owe to God, to our families, and to all mankind. 1758.</p>
            <p>As it hath pleaſed divine goodneſs clearly to manifeſt amongſt us the way of life and ſalvation, and to inſtruct us where and how to wait for him, prize, we beſeech you, theſe precious privileges; keep all your meetings in the name of the Lord, and let your minds be eſtabliſhed in an humble waiting upon him with reverence and fear; ſo ſhall ſtrength be added to ſtrength,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:019014_0069_0FA95D870AE087D8"/>and being more cloſely united to him, you will experience the indwelling of his bleſſed Spirit. 1761.</p>
            <p>When gathered in your religious aſſemblies, be truly concerned to retire to the divine and heavenly gift, which will miniſter to every ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though you may have no outward teaching, and will direct you to wait, without being reſtleſs or uneaſy, till it be a proper time to break up your meeting with that decency and ſolemnity which ſhould attend our minds in ſuch ſervice; for want of which ſome forward ſpirits, who have been deſtitute of the right and true feeling of that ſpirit, in which ſuch ſervice ſhould be performed, have broke up meetings in an unbecoming manner, to the ſorrow and pain of mind of ſuch as have been truly concerned for the good and proſperity of Zion [1755]: And be not apt, as the manner of ſome is, at the cloſe of your meetings, haſtily to enter into diſcourſes about the affairs of this life, much leſs the vain amuſements thereof; a practice inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian gravity which at ſuch time ought, in an eſpecial manner, to ſeaſon the minds of perſons ſo lately aſſembled for the worſhip of God, in ſpirit and in truth. 1748.</p>

            <head>Miniſters and Elders, and Meeting of Miniſters and Elders.</head>
            <p>IT is recommended that one or more faithful friend or friends, of either or both ſexes, be appointed out of each particular meeting as ſtanding elders by the monthly-meeting, whoſe duty is to help young miniſters, and give advice to all others as occaſion may require; to encourage our youth and others in virtue, and in a reverent and early attention to and belief in the divine appearance and operation of the ſpirit of Chriſt in their own hearts, and in a venerable eſteem of the Holy Scriptures, and a frequent reading and meditating therein; and to that plainneſs, moderation and ſimplicity, which is becoming our holy profeſſion; to ſtir up thoſe who are or may be deficient in the due attendance of our meetings, and in general to watch over the flock of Chriſt; being themſelves examples in faith, meekneſs and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 1709, 1728, 1760.</p>
            <p>As theſe are officers of the church at large, let the monthly-meeting, after they have approved ſuch as they adjudge duly anointed and qualified for that ſervice, acquaint the quarterly-meeting therewith, who after ſolidly waiting for their concurring unity, and finding nothing to hinder, are to minute the ſame, and acquaint the ſelect-meeting thereof; who are alſo to enter the appointment and concurrence on their minutes, and the friend ſo appointed may then ſit in any of our meetings of miniſters and elders. And informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch appointments is to be given by the quarterly and ſelect-meetings to their reſpective yearly-meetings, and their names when approved to be alſo entered on the yearly-meeting's record. And where any friend appearing in public miniſtry, whoſe converſation be clean and blameleſs, and the elders of the monthly-meeting he or ſhe belongs to are convinced that the Lord hath

            <p>The miniſters and elders ſo approved, within the compaſs of each monthly-meeting (or where the quarterly-meeting ſhould think beſt to unite the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of two or more meetings in one) meet by themſelves once in three months, and after ſolidly waiting to feel their minds ſeaſoned with the virtue of truth, are to proceed to read and conſider the queries, and how their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is anſwered by their members; tenderly adviſing and aſſiſting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the nature of the caſe may require; and form ſuch anſwers to the queries as are agreeable to their ſtates, which are to be ſigned by their clerk, and two or more friends are to be appointed as repreſentatives, who are to take the anſwers, and aſſembling together previous to and at the place of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quarterly-meeting, do, with the aſſiſtance of other ſelect members with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of each quarter, compoſe a ſelect quarterly-meeting, where the queries are again to be read, and the ſtate of the meeting enquired into, and ſuch advice and aſſiſtance afforded the lower meetings thereto belonging, by advice or committees, as occaſion may require.

            <p>And it is agreed that the quarterly ſelect-meeting be held the day before each quarterly-meeting, at the ſame place, at the eleventh hour; and that the yearly ſelect-meeting begin at Portſmouth the eleventh hour, on the day before the yearly-meeting.</p>

This meeting deſires that you, whom the Lord hath gifted with a public teſtimony for his name and truth, may be careful to attend to the motions of truth, and in it be diligent to viſit the heritage of God in their meetings, and eſpecially thoſe leaſt frequented. 1695.</p>
            <p>We farther entreat you, that in all your religious meetings, appointed for the worſhip of Almighty God, you wait in humble reverence for the influence of the word of life; be cautious not to move, in acts of devotion, in your own will; ſet not forward ſelf to work, but patiently attend and wait for the gift and enlivening power of the Divine Spirit, without which your perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances will be unacceptable, and like thoſe of old, of which it was ſaid, "Who hath required this at your hand?" Iſaiah i. 12. 1742.</p>
            <p>As we are fully perſuaded, that the miniſtry of the goſpel is not received of man, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, according to that apoſtolical direction, <q>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God; if any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified:</q> And as this miniſtry is divine, the motives and inducements thereunto are perfectly diſintereſted, and no way mercenary and lucrative, but concurrent to the precept Chriſt gave to his apoſtles, and immediate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, "Freely ye have received, freely give." 1771.</p>
            <p>Friends, in their reſpective counties and meetings, are earneſtly deſired and adviſed to uſe prudence and caution, ſo as not to be impoſed upon by cheats, or impoſtors, pretending to miniſtry or otherwiſe; and where there is a doubt or queſtion concerning the miniſtry of any perſons, in that caſe let ſuch be called upon to ſhew what certificate they have; and in general it is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the monthly and quarterly-meetings, to ſee that friends who travel in the work of the miniſtry do go in the unity of the meetings to which they belong, and with certificates therefrom; and further, that it may become the tender care of the ſaid meetings to watch over ſuch as may be young in the miniſtry, to ſee that they walk humbly and wiſely: That as on the one hand,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:019014_0073_0FA95D8BFB10B658"/>nothing truly tending to the glory of God, and the edification of his church and people, may be diſcouraged, ſo on the other, where any thing appears which may make advice neceſſary, that the elders of the church, both miniſters and others, do, in the wiſdom of God, give their advice thereupon, with due regard to the ſtate of weakneſs and childhood that ſuch may be in. 1720.</p>
            <p>And we do in much love caution thoſe friends who are rightly concerned in the work of the miniſtry, to watch over their own ſpirits, and not to be over haſty or cenſorious in paſſing judgment reſpecting the ſtate of thoſ w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hear them; but to manifeſt that, in the exerciſe of their miniſtry, they are led by the love of God; and that their principal aim is, that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to adminiſter ſpiritual conſolation and ſtrength to the churches where they come.</p>
            <p>Farther we earneſtly exhort, that none would offer to impoſe themſelves as preachers, in any meeting of friends, who are not themſelves faithful againſt the payment of prieſts wages, and in obſerving the other branches of our Chriſtian teſtimony. 1745.</p>
            <p>We tenderly and with earneſtneſs adviſe all friends, who travel in the work of the miniſtry, as well as others, that they not only ſhut their ears againſt all private informations of perſons and things, tending to the defamation of particular perſons or families, and to ſtir up diſputes and contentions in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for diſcipline; but alſo to rebuke and reprove the perſon or perſons, who ſhall attempt to prejudice their minds with any private informations of that nature. 1752.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of God being be foundation of all true knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, both in miniſters and hearers, we earneſtly exhort that all would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently wait upon, and mind it: Miniſters, in their public ſervices eſpecially, ought always to attend cloſely to their ſeveral and peculiar gifts, and miniſter the word faithfully as it is manifeſted and revealed to them; obſerving a decent and modeſt behaviour in the exerciſe of their miniſtry, and not entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling themſelves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better anſwer the holy warfare in which they are engaged. And let the hearers be watchful
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:019014_0074_0FA95D8C4A343690"/>over their own ſpirits, and not forwardly judge or cenſure the teſtimonies which may be delivered amongſt them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to miſtake in the judgment they may paſs on the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the preſervation of love and concord in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill conſequences which attend an haſty and cenſorious judging of the miniſtry, we think it neceſſary to caution friends not to let their own ſpirits ſway them, but let the Spirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will preſerve all in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenderneſs one towards another: The due obſervance of which will be a great help to miniſters in the diſcharge of their duty, and the ſervice to which they are called.</p>
            <p>And we earneſtly requeſt, that the elders in monthly and quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would be ready to help and inform the weak, when ſuitable opportunities preſent; and that both miniſters and hearers, purſuing one and the ſame end, namely, the glory of God, and the good and welfare one of another, the church may be edified, increaſe and flouriſh, to the conſolation of the faithful.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we adviſe miniſters to have it very much at heart, to maintain a perfect harmony and good underſtanding with the monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to which they belong; that as the ſaid meetings may ſometimes find themſelves concerned to adviſe them, reſpecting their conduct in meetings, or otherwiſe, they ſhew themſelves ready to hear and receive advice, as well as to teach and inſtruct.</p>
            <p>We further adviſe all monthly-meetings, to take great care in giving cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to thoſe who travel, to prevent the uneaſineſs which ſometimes falls on the church, from a weak and unſkilful miniſtry; and let the elders, when they ſee occaſion, adviſe miniſters to be very prudent in their conduct, not as buſy bodies, nor meddling with family or perſonal affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be aſſiſting; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and of that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to nor ſpreading reports, tending to raiſe in the minds of others a
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019014_0075_0FA95E32CD9084D8"/>leſſening or diſeſteem of any of the brotherhood; and as ſoon as their ſervice in the miniſtry is over, that they return to their habitations, and there take a reaſonable and prudent care of their own buſineſs, houſhold and family. 1731.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord, juſt before his aſcenſion, commanded his diſciples to wait at Jeruſalem, till they were endued with power from on high; knowing their inability, without the ſenſible feeling of that power, to ſpeak in his name for the converſion of the nations. It was this power that enabled them to ſpeak boldly in the name of Jeſus: This alone that made them able mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt; whoſe preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and with power.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing many of us have experienced much ſpiritual conſolation, by waiting in ſilence and humbly depending upon the Lord alone, we exhort friends, that when met together for religious worſhip, they labour to feel their minds abſtracted from viſible objects, into a true ſtillneſs and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſelf; wherein the teachings of the Holy Spirit are witneſſed by humble and contrite ſouls.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a waiting ſtate, you will have a true reliſh and ſavour of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of thoſe who are rightly concerned by the ſame ſpirit, to labour in word and doctrine among you. 1738.</p>
            <p>We earneſtly caution and intreat all ſuch among you, as find themſelves concerned in Chriſtian love to exhort and admoniſh others, that they be eſpecially careful of their own conduct; that by circumſpect walking in all holineſs of life and converſation, they may become living examples of the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellence of the advices they recommend. 1748.</p>
            <p>You that are elders and overſeers in the church, and concerned in the maintenance of good order and preſervation of diſcipline, keep your own hands clean, and garments unſpotted, that you may rebuke with authority, and being cloathed with the meekneſs and gentleneſs of the Lamb, may ſtedfaſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the ſupport of that teſtimony committed to you, that when the Great Shepherd ſhall appear, you may come before him with reverent aſſurance,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019014_0076_0FA95E33E4105C60"/>and receive the reward of <q>Well done, good and faithful ſervant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.</q> 1753.</p>
            <p>As to the elders among you, and ſuch whom God, having endued with knowledge and experience of the cleanſing operations of his Spirit, hath concerned to miniſter to others, let them adorn the doctrine of the goſpel, by ſhewing, out of a good converſation, their works with meekneſs of wiſdom: Such as theſe, being cloathed with humility, and exemplary to the flock whom the feed; not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; are worthy of double honour, and to be highly eſteemed in the church of Chriſt. 1751.</p>
            <p>As the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed effectually to touch the hearts of many of the youth, and prepare them for the reception of his heavenly gifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many are called to the work of the miniſtry; and well knowing it is a due attention to the gift, and waiting for the heavenly power and life to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves therein, which has ever proved a bleſſing to the particular, and the churches in general; we earneſtly recommend, that the elders and ſenſible ſolid friends do watch over ſuch in an holy concern for their and the churches good; that the weak and tender may be encouraged in a faithful diſcharge of their duty, and where a forward ſpirit appears, that would lead into many words out of the power and life, ſuch may be properly admoniſhed in the meekneſs of wiſdom, that each may ſpeak the language of truth, by the ability which the Lord only gives; and that the monthly-meetings do not indulge any to travel and appoint meetings too ſoon, for many have been hurt thereby. 1753.</p>
            <p>We recommend the apoſtolic advice, "Lay hands on no man ſuddenly," for we have cauſe to believe that injudicious encouragement hath tended to promote an unſound miniſtry in ſome places. It is therefore recommended, that the approved miniſters and elders, in the ſeveral monthly-meetings, would tenderly adviſe thoſe who come forth in public teſtimony, to wait patiently under a deep conſideration of their ſtate of infancy and childhood, without deſiring to be introduced into the meeting of miniſters and elders, until their
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019014_0077_0FA95E358EF27638"/>fruits afford ſufficient evidence of their qualifications for ſo important a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and they approved of by the monthly and quarterly-meetings to which they belong; that ſuch young miniſters be reported to their monthly and quarterly-meetings; which, upon ſolid and deliberate conſideration, may, as in the wiſdom of truth ſhall ſeem meet, recommend them to the ſelect-meeting of miniſters and elders, in order to their becoming regular members of thoſe meetings. 1773.</p>
            <p>Looking into the ſtate of this part of the ſociety, which ſtands in a more conſpicuous point of view than the more private members, the neceſſity of their being enſamples to the flock appears exceeding great, particularly in a diligent attendance of all our meetings for ſolemn worſhip and the diſcipline of the church, and therein to be very deep and weighty in ſpirit, labouring with an ardour of ſoul ſuited to the occaſion, for the ariſing of the ancient ſpring of life; which of a truth is the crown of our aſſemblies, and the ground of our joy and rejoicing in him, and one in another: It being this alone which preſerves living, freſh and active members in the church of Chriſt, who are enabled to communicate a degree of warmth to the riſing youth, and thoſe of leſs experience in this moſt neceſſary exerciſe; not only in word and doctrine, but alſo in ſilent, humble waiting on God, for the renewings of help day by day.</p>
            <p>That where it ſhall appear, upon due inſpection made, that any member ſhall or do neglect or omit the due attendance of their meetings for worſhip and diſcipline, through ſloth, indolence, love of the world, lukewarmneſs in religion or other inſufficient cauſe, that each monthly-meeting take care, that all ſuch be timely viſited in love, and acquainted with the deſire and mind of friends in that caſe, and admoniſhed to faithfulneſs therein. And if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the due Chriſtian labour and admonition, he, ſhe or they, ſhall continue in the ſaid neglect or omiſſion; if a miniſter, his or her public teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be denied; and if an elder, he or ſhe be diſmiſſed from that ſtation. 1770.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:019014_0078_0FA95E35CB730F90"/>
Adviſed to have a godly care of judging or contradicting one another in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meetings, or ſhewing any marks or ſigns of diviſion therein, among miniſters or others; it being of a very pernicious conſequence to bring blame or contempt upon the miniſtry, and a great hurt to our youth and others. 1716.</p>
            <p>This meeting taking under their ſerious conſideration the beauty and credit of keeping decency and good order in our meetings for worſhip, adviſes friends every where to avoid public oppoſition to a miniſter not diſowned by the monthly or quarterly-meeting to which he or ſhe ſhall belong, by keeping on their hats in time of prayer, or any other tokens of diſunion.</p>
            <p>But if any perſon, pretending to be a miniſter, ſhall give cauſe of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſſatisfaction to friends, in doctrine, behaviour or converſation, the perſon ſo offending is to be dealt with privately in a goſpel ſpirit and manner: If this ſhall not take effect, then let complaint be made of ſuch perſon to the monthly-meeting which he or ſhe may belong to; that proceeding thereon be had accordingly, and the affair ſettled with all poſſible expedition. 1723.</p>
            <p>Where friends in any monthly-meeting are really diſſatisfied, or burthened with any that take upon them to preach among them, let them firſt be duly admoniſhed in their own monthly-meeting, with the aſſiſtance of the faithful approved miniſters and elders of the ſame meeting, and adjacent meetings, if need be; and if afterwards they will perſiſt to impoſe upon and burthen friends, then to be publicly teſtified againſt, where they ſo impoſe.</p>
            <p>If any one who has been a public miniſter or elder ſhall be guilty of ſuch practices as may juſtly deſerve public cenſure, and ſhall be diſowned, and afterwards, upon tokens of repentance, be again admitted into memberſhip; ſuch readmiſſion is not to be interpreted ſo as to give him or her the liberty of appearing as a public miniſter, or exerciſing the office of an elder, until the monthly-meeting he or ſhe belongs to ſhall judge the ſcandal given by ſuch perſon is ſo far removed, as that ſuch public appearance, or exerciſing the office of an elder, may not adminiſter occaſion of reproach, either from friends or others; and in caſe they ſhould ſhew themſelves too forward in ſo appearing, the meeting to which they belong are deſired to give them ſuch advice as they ſhall ſee ſuitable to their circumſtance. 1737.</p>

A MEMORIAL of ſome neceſſary advices recommended to miniſters, and, in the love of the goſpel, to be communicated to the ſeveral meetings of miniſters and elders in the yearly-meeting, as caution and counſel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt undue and reſtleſs behaviour, under the miniſtry of any friend, whilſt in the unity of the body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all be cautious of uſing unneceſſary preambles, and laying too great ſtreſs on their teſtimony, by too poſitively aſſerting a divine motion, and frequently repeating the fame; ſeeing no ſuch pretenſions will obtain credit, when it is not manifeſtly ſo; and where it is, the baptizing power of truth, accompanying the words, is the beſt evidence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againſt miſquoting and miſapplying the Holy Scriptures; and it is deſired that all thoſe concerned be frequent in reading them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To be careful how they fall on diſputed points in their teſtimony, and making ſuch objections as they do not clearly anſwer; and alſo againſt giving repeated expectations of coming to a concluſion, recommending the people, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Againſt hurting meetings, towards the concluſion, by unneceſſary addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when the meeting was left well before.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Againſt unbecoming tones, ſounds, geſtures, and all affectation; which are not agreeable to Chriſtian gravity.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

10. Againſt men and women travelling together, as companions in ſervice, to avoid all occaſions of offence thereby.</p>
            <p n="11">11. To beware of too much familiarity, tending to draw out the affections one of another, to their hurt.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That miniſtering friends be careful not to hurt one another's ſervice in public meetings, but every one have a tender regard for others; that nothing be offered with a view to popularity, but in humility and the fear of the Lord.</p>

            <p n="15">15. That none ſhew or expoſe manuſcripts, ſo as to give expectations of their being printed, before they are approved by the meeting for ſufferings.</p>

Therefore let miniſters be careful how and what they offer in prayer, avoiding many words and repetitions, and not to run from ſupplication into declaration, as though the Lord wanted information: And let all be cautious of too often repeating the High and Holy Name, or his attributes, by a long concluſion; neither let prayer be in a formal and cuſtomary way, to conclude a meeting, without an awful ſenſe of divine aſſiſtance attending the mind. 1703, 1755.</p>
            <p>Agreed that when public friends have a concern to travel on a religious viſit, and appoint meetings out of the quarterly-meeting they belong to, or to attend the ſittings of neighbouring yearly-meetings, or quarterly-meeting belonging thereunto, they ſeaſonably communicate the ſame to the elders of their reſpective meetings for their advice and concurrence, before they move it to the monthly-meeting, in order for a certificate.</p>

               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:019014_0081_0FA95E3993645718"/>
And when their concern extends to viſiting the churches, within any other of the yearly-meetings on this continent, they proceed in like manner. And when the monthly-meeting have given their certificate, they acquaint the quarterly-meeting therewith for their concurrence, which is to be firſt had before the friend proceed. And when the concern extends to Europe, or beyond ſea, as the moſt weighty, clear and deliberate evidence ſhould be obtained in ſo important a ſervice, in which the reputation of ſociety may be more immediately concerned; it is therefore recommended, that unleſs ſuch conſiderations ſhould prevent, which the quarterly and monthly-meeting may judge ſufficient, the approbation of the yearly-meeting of miniſters and elders ſhould be likewiſe obtained.</p>
            <p>QUERIES of the Yearly-Meeting of Miniſters and Elders.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are miniſters and elders careful duly to attend all their meetings for worſhip and dicipline, bringing with them as many of their families as they can? And are they good examples in humble waiting therein, not giving way to drowſineſs?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are miniſters ſound in word and doctrine, careful to miniſter in the ability God gives and thereby kept from burthening the living?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are the lives and converſations of miniſters and elders clean and blameleſs amongſt men? Are they in unity one with another, and with the meeting they belong to, harmoniouſly labouring together for truth's honour, and careful to give no juſt occaſion of offence to any?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do they rule their own houſes well, bringing up their families in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which truth requires, in dreſs, language and true moderation? And are they good examples in thoſe reſpects themſelves?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Are they peace-makers in families and in the church, not concerned in raiſing or ſpreading evil reports, nor buſy bodies where they have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:019014_0082_0FA95E3A54449170"/>
6. Are they careful to maintain the diſcipline in every part thereof, not even to hide their own families from truth's judgment, if occaſion be given, but impartially to adminiſter juſtice as faithful ſervants?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Do any travel abroad as miniſters, without being firſt recommended to and accepted by the quarterly-meeting as ſuch? And do any appoint meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the limits of the quarterly-meeting they belong to, without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the monthly-meeting of buſineſs, or the concurrence thereof?</p>
            <p>It is further earneſtly and affectionately recommended that miniſters and elders watch over one another for good, to help thoſe who are young in the miniſtry in the right line, diſcouraging forward ſpirits that run into words without life and power, adviſing againſt affectation of tones and geſtures, and every thing that would hurt their ſervice; yet encouraging the humble, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful traveller, ſpeaking a word in ſeaſon to them that are weary. And let all dwell in that which gives ability to labour ſucceſsfully in the church of Chriſt, adorning the doctrine they deliver to others, being examples of the believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, and in purity.</p>

            <head>MONTHLY-MEETINGS.</head>
            <p>IN the love of Chriſt we earneſtly exhort you to watch diligently over the flock of God, and deal in due time, and in a ſpirit of Chriſtian love and tenderneſs, with all ſuch as walk diſorderly amongſt you, in order to reclaim and reſtore them by brotherly counſel and admonition; and when, after patient waiting, you find that your Chriſtian labour of love hath not its deſired effect, you neglect not to teſtify againſt and diſown ſuch perſons, and thereby prevent the reproach and diſhonour which may be brought upon our holy profeſſion through their means, that the end and deſign of our wholeſome diſcipline may be anſwered.</p>
            <p>We think it both unſeaſonable and diſhonourable, when perſons apply to monthly-meetings on account of marriage, or for relief in caſe of neceſſity or any ſimilar occaſion, then to object to them ſuch offences as the meeting, through neglect of their own duty, have ſuffered long to paſs by them unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and unnoticed. 1743.</p>
            <p>It is the ancient and conſtant ſenſe of friends, that any perſon denied by a monthly-meeting, is adjudged as diſowned by friends, and to ſtand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that ſtate, till by his repentance, or by the reverſal of ſuch denial by a ſuperior meeting, he is reconciled to friends, or reinſtated in member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among them, with which this meeting hath unity, and therefore confirms the ſame. 1727.</p>
            <p>When a perſon commits an offence, as ſoon as it comes to the knowledge of the meeting wherein he reſides, he not being a member thereof, that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall acquaint the meeting of which he is a member therewith.</p>
            <p>The meeting of which he is a member ſhall then proceed to viſit and deal with him, unleſs by reaſon of diſtance it be not convenient; in which
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:019014_0084_0FA95E3BCE98C548"/>caſe they ſhall apply to the monthly-meeting in which the offender reſides, to act for them and viſit him; and they ſhall report their proceedings to the meeting of which he is a member, which meeting ſhall receive his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, or diſown him, as in their judgment the caſe ſhall require.</p>
            <p>If a teſtimony of denial be iſſued, a copy thereof ſhall be ſent to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the compaſs of which the offender reſides, who ſhall acquaint him therewith, and read it in a public meeting, if they ſee meet, and acknowledge the receipt thereof to the meeting that ſent it.</p>
            <p>If the offender remove after dealing be commenced, the meeting that had him under their care ſhall continue the ſame, if he be equally within their reach, or otherwiſe write to the meeting into the compaſs of which he is removed, which meeting ſhall proceed therein, and report to the meeting of which he is a member, who ſhall receive his acknowledgment, or proceed to deny him as aforeſaid. But if the monthly-meeting where the offence is committed judge the caſe to be of ſuch a nature as to require their more ſpeedy dealing, and even diſowning the offender, for the clearing of truth according to our ancient care and practice; they are at liberty ſo to do, giving the meeting the offender did belong to as early notice thereof as they can. 1747, 1782.</p>
            <p>In caſe offenders ſhall remove to places not within the acknowledged limits of any monthly-meeting, it is agreed that they ſhall be under the care of the meeting to which they are the neareſt ſituated.</p>
            <p>If the offender cannot be found after reaſonable enquiry, the meeting to which he belongs, on notice thereof, ſhall iſſue a teſtimony againſt him, if the nature of the caſe require it, and acquaint the other meeting or meetings thereof.</p>
            <p>When a perſon is diſowned by a monthly-meeting of which he was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per member, and afterwards removes into, and reſides within, the compaſs of another meeting, he having come to repentance, and being deſirous to be reſtored into unity, the neceſſary acknowledgment ſhould be made to the monthly-meeting by which he was diſowned; which acknowledgment being
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:019014_0085_0FA95E3CB4D131C8"/>received and accepted, he ſhall be deemed a member of the ſaid meeting 1763.</p>
            <p>We recommend to friends in their ſeveral monthly-meetings, to take eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to appoint proper, prudent and judicious friends, to viſit their brethren in their families, to inform, adviſe or admoniſh, purſuant to former advices; and that ſuch friends labour faithfully in a ſpirit of love, and in the meekneſs of wiſdom, to convince the judgments of their reſpective members of the neceſſity of their coming up with their brethren in practice, agreeable to our Chriſtian principle, that ſo the ſeveral branches of the teſtimony, which truth hath given our ancients and us to bear, may be maintained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate. 1733, 1751.</p>
            <p>It is recommended, that the book of diſcipline be preſent in all our month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quarterly and yearly-meetings, that the ſame may be conſulted as occaſion requires; and as opportunity offers, ſuch portions thereof be read in each monthly-meeting, the women being preſent, as the elders, overſeers or other concerned friends, may from time to time think proper, for the inſtruction, help and furtherance of the young and riſing generation, and ſuch as may not otherwiſe be converſant or acquainted therewith.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. We fervently warn all in profeſſion with us, that they be careful to avoid being any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits of that iniquitous practice of dealing in Negroes, and other ſlaves; whereby, in the original purchaſe, one man ſelleth another as he does the beaſt that periſhes, without any better pretenſion to a property in him than that of ſuperior force, in direct violation of the goſpel rule, which teaches every one to do as they would be done by, and to do good unto all; being the reverſe of that covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, which furniſhes encouragement to thoſe poor ignorant people to perpetuate their ſavage wars, in order to ſupply the demands of this moſt unnatural traffic, whereby great numbers of mankind, free by nature, are ſubjected to inextricable bondage; and which hath often been obſerved to fill their poſſeſſors with haughtineſs and tyranny, luxury and barbarity; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the minds and debaſing the morals of their children, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prejudice of religion and virtue, and the excluſion of that holy ſpirit of univerſal love, meekneſs and charity, which is the unchangeable nature and the glory of true Chriſtianity: We therefore can do no leſs than with the greateſt earneſtneſs impreſs it upon friends every where, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of this unrighteous gain of oppreſſion. 1760.</p>

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>Agreed that no friend import, or any ways purchaſe, diſpoſe of or hold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as ſlaves; but that all thoſe who have been held in a ſtate of ſlavery be diſcharged therefrom; that all thoſe be uſed well who are under friends care, and are not in circumſtances, through non-age or incapacity, to miniſter to their own neceſſities; and that they give thoſe that are young ſuch an education as become Chriſtians, and encourage others in a religious and virtuous life. 1773, 1780.</p>

            <p>ADVISED that our Chriſtian teſtimony be faithfully maintained againſt the burthen and impoſition of oaths, according to the expreſs prohibition of Chriſt, and alſo of the apoſtle James, viz. <q>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all: Neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footſtool: Neither by Jeruſalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy head, becauſe thou canſt not make one hair white or black.

            <p>KNOWING how quickly many are removed by death, it is weightily recommended that care be taken, in each monthly-meeting, that friends who have eſtates to diſpoſe of, by will or otherwiſe, be adviſed to make their wills in time of health, and ſtrength of judgment, and to diſpoſe of their ſubſtance as in juſtice and wiſdom may be to their ſatisfaction; to prevent the inconveniences, loſs and trouble, that may fall upon their relations and friends, through their dying inteſtate. Making ſuch wills, in due time, can ſhorten no man's days; but the omiſſion or delay thereof has proved very injurious to many. 1691.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that friends, in making their wills, have a ſtrict regard to juſtice and equity, and be not actuated by caprice and prejudice, to the injury of thoſe who may have a reaſonable expectation from their kindred and near connexions; nor carry any reſentment, though occaſion may have been given or taken, to the grave, remembering we all ſtand in need of mercy and forgiveneſs. Alſo that none poſtpone making their wills to a ſick bed; an improper ſeaſon to ſettle our outward affairs, in the painful ſtruggles of nature, even if we ſhould be favoured with a clear underſtanding, which ought not to be diverted from a ſolemn conſideration of the approaching awful period of life.</p>
            <p>Friends are earneſtly recommended to employ perſons capable, and of good repute, to write their wills; as great inconvenience and loſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ruin of families, hath happened through the unſkilfulneſs of ſome who have taken upon them to write wills, being unqualified to act in an affair of ſuch importance. And all friends, who may become executors or adminiſtrators, are adviſed to make a full, clear and proper inventory of the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:019014_0091_0FA95E4416055058"/>eſtate and effects of the deceaſed, as ſoon as may be after the interment; as many difficulties and diſputes have ariſen for want of it, where it has been deferred. 1782.</p>
            <p>Recommended that friends, who have young children, do in their wills appoint faithful friends to be guardians to them, till they arrive to lawful age: That monthly-meetings take care that ſuch guardians do diſcharge their truſt with juſtice and uprightneſs; and that orphans be admoniſhed to be ſubject to the wills of their deceaſed parents, as the ſaid meetings ſhall ſee cauſe. 1706.</p>
            <p>Executors and truſtees, concerned in wills and ſettlements, are adviſed to take eſpecial care that they faithfully diſcharge their reſpective truſts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the donors and teſtators; and that all charitable gifts, lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, bequeſts, and ſettlement of eſtates, by will or deed, intended and given for the uſe of the poor, the aged, the impotent, or putting poor friends children to education or apprenticeſhips, may not be appropriated or converted to any other uſes than ſuch as the donors and teſtators have directed and enjoined by legal ſettlement, will, or teſtament. 1715.</p>

            <p>We adviſe and exhort, that all maſters of families, parents, guardians, and tutors of children, would frequently put in practice the calling together of their children and houſhold, to wait upon the Lord in their families; that receiving wiſdom and counſel from him, they may be enabled ſeaſonably to exhort and encourage them to walk in the way of the Lord; to exerciſe themſelves in reading the Holy Scriptures, and in obſerving the duties and precepts of holy living therein recommended; admoniſhing them to keep
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:019014_0093_0FA95E468CBA50E8"/>to that plainneſs and ſimplicity in apparel, ſpeech and behaviour, which the ſpirit of truth led our forefathers into, and which becomes the humble, ſelf-denying followers of holy Jeſus. 1748.</p>
            <p>It is our Chriſtian and earneſt advice and counſel to all friends concerned, (ſo far as they are able, or may be capable) to provide ſchoolmaſters and miſtreſſes, who are faithful friends, to teach and inſtruct their children; and not to ſend them to ſuch ſchools, where they are taught the corrupt ways, manners, faſhions and language of the world, and of the heathen in their authors, and names of the heatheniſh gods and goddeſſes, tending greatly to corrupt and alienate the minds of children into an averſeneſs or oppoſition to the truth, and the ſimplicity of it: But to take care that you train up your children in the good nurture, admonition and fear of the Lord, in that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and language which become truth. And parents and maſters, &amp;c. to be good examples to them, in a ſober and godly converſation, and plainneſs of ſpeech; and not to uſe the word you, or ye, to a child or ſervant, &amp;c. nor ſuffer your ſubſtance to be beſtowed on your children, to furniſh them with ſuch things as tend to pride, and to lift them up in vanity, or affect them with the vain faſhions of the world. 1690.</p>
            <p>It being under conſideration how friends children might be diſpoſed of, that are trained up in the way of truth, and fit to be put forth apprentices; it is the advice and counſel of friends, that ſpecial care be taken to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t them apprentices to honeſt friends, that they may be preſerved in the way of truth. 1697.</p>

            <head>PLAINNESS.</head>
            <p>IT is alſo our concern to exhort all friends, both men and women, to watch againſt the growing ſin of pride, and beware of adorning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a manner diſagreeable to the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the truth we make profeſſion of. Oh! that they would duly conſider that ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof which the Lord, by the mouth of his prophet, pronounced againſt the haughty daughters of Zion, Iſaiah iii. where it deſcribes even the particularities of their dreſſings and ornaments, ſo diſpleaſing to the Lord, and drawing down his judgments upon them. If thoſe things in that time were ſo offenſive in the eyes of the Lord, how much more ſo are they now, in a people profeſſing the plainneſs and ſimplicity which the goſpel of Chriſt recommends?</p>
            <p>"I will," ſaith the apoſtle Paul, <q>that women adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefacedneſs and ſobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly array; but, which becometh women profeſſing godlineſs, with good works,</q> 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10; where he plainly ſheweth that ſuch adornings are contrary to the profeſſion of godlineſs. The apoſtle Peter alſo is very full in his exhortations on this ſubject, "Whoſe adorning," ſays he, <q>let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of God of great price; for after this manner, in the old time, the holy women alſo, who truſted in God, adorned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q> 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 5; plainly intimating, that thoſe who of old were holy, and did truſt in God, placed not their delight in ſuch ornaments. Oh, that ye would weigh and conſider theſe things! <q>Let your moderation be known unto all men, and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God; but be ye
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:019014_0096_0FA95E4B95DC15A8"/>followers of him, as dear children, walking circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the days are evil.</q> 1739.</p>
            <p>Let not any ſuch as degenerate, in theſe reſpects, excuſe their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under a pretence of the miſconduct of ſome, who have appeared outwardly plain; an objection of very little weight: For did they rightly conſider, they would clearly ſee, that the very reaſon why deceivers ſometimes put on plain apparel, is, becauſe true men have been accuſtomed to wear it.</p>
            <p>We alſo tenderly adviſe, that friends take heed, eſpecially thoſe who ſhould be exemplary to others under their care, that they exerciſe plainneſs of ſpeech, without reſpect of perſons, in all their converſe among men; and not baulk their teſtimony by a cowardly compliance, varying their language according to their company: A practice of very ill example to our obſerving youth, and rendering thoſe who uſe it contemptible, and looked upon as a kind of hypocrites, even by thoſe with whom they ſo comply: Such a mean-ſpirited practice ſeems to be cautioned againſt by the apoſtle, when he adviſes, 1 Tim. "That the deacons be grave, not double-tongued;" a caution plainly import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is inconſiſtent with the gravity of the goſpel. 1743.</p>
            <p>Where any do not keep themſelves, or their children, in moderation and plainneſs, in geſture, ſpeech, apparel, and furniture of their houſes; or accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom themſelves, or ſuffer their children, to uſe the corrupt and unſcriptural language of (you) to a ſingle perſon; or to call the days or months by the names given them by the heathen, in honour to their idols, contrary to the ancient advices of friends, to which we refer: It is deſired and adviſed, that friends from time to time, as ſuch things appear, be ſtirred up in the wiſdom of truth, to take due and prudent care therein; and if any, by continuing in ſuch practices, reject the advice and labour of their friends, then let ſuch caſes be brought forward to the monthly-meeting, for further care and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as may appear neceſſary, for the ſupport of our Chriſtian teſtimony.</p>

            <head>POOR.</head>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the poor amongſt us, it ought to be conſidered, that the poor, both parents and children, are of our family, and ought not to be turned off to any others for their ſupport or education; and although ſome may think the poor a burthen, yet be it remembered, when our poor are well provided for, and walk orderly, they are an ornament to our ſociety; and the rich ſhould conſider it is more bleſſed to give than to receive, and that he who giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, who will repay. 1718.</p>
            <p>As mercy, compaſſion and charity, are eminently required in this new-covenant diſpenſation we are under; ſo, reſpecting the poor and indigent among us, and to ſee there be no beggar in our Iſrael, it is the advice of this meeting that all poor friends be taken due care of, and none of them ſent to the town or pariſh to be relieved; and that nothing be wanting for their neceſſary ſupply; which has been according to our ancient practice and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And it has long been of good report, that we have not only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our own poor, but alſo contributed our ſhare to the poor of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive towns and pariſhes wherein we dwell. 1720.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that where friends want ability in the world, their monthly and quarterly-meetings aſſiſt them, that the children of the poor may have due help of education, inſtruction, and neceſſary learning; and that the children both of the rich and the poor may early be provided with uſeful employments, that they may not grow up in idleneſs, looſeneſs and vice; but that being ſeaſoned with the truth, taught our holy ſelf-denying way, and ſanctified of God, they may become a reputation to our holy profeſſion, the comfort of their honeſt parents, inſtrumental to the glory of God, and the good of the ſucceeding generations. 1709.</p>

And as one of the firſt and great cauſes which engaged our ancient friends to the orderly eſtabliſhing our Chriſtian diſcipline, was the care of the poor; and as expences muſt neceſſarily ariſe for their ſupport and education, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to each monthly-meeting, of men and women friends, that they be open-hearted and liberal in their ſubſcriptions for the ſupply of the poor; and that a treaſurer be appointed to receive the ſame, and open to each meeting of men and women; and two or more ſuitable friends, men and women, be annually appointed as overſeers of the poor, whoſe buſineſs and duty it ſhould be to viſit, inſpect and relieve them, as becometh the followers of Chriſt, and that two or more friends be appointed as an audit to ſettle the treaſurers and overſeers accounts.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that all contention and perſonal reflexions be kept out of our meetings: That all friends be careful to keep out of heats and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and doubtful diſputations; and that we ſuffer no turbulent, contentious perſon amongſt us, in ordering and managing the affairs of truth; but that the ſame be managed in the peaceable ſpirit and wiſdom of Jeſus, with decency, forbearance and love, to each other.</p>

            <p>ADVISED that ſchool-maſters and miſtreſſes, who are faithful friends, and well qualified, be encouraged in all places where there may be need; and that care be taken, that poor friends children may freely partake of ſuch education, as may tend to their benefit and advantage, in order to apprenticeſhip. 1695.</p>
            <p>Quarterly and monthly-meetings are deſired to take care, that in all places where ſchools are ſet up for teaching of friends children, the maſters be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to improve and forward their ſcholars in learning, and to keep them out of every thing that would corrupt good manners. 1697.</p>
            <p>It is the renewed concern of this meeting, to recommend a care for the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ſuch parents, whoſe earnings or income are ſo ſmall, as to render them incapable of giving their children a ſuitable and guarded education, and that eſpecially from home, by which they may be prevented from mixing with others not of our religious perſuaſion, which ſo often leads into hurtful habits, from which they are not afterwards eaſily reclaimed; and as ſome of our members may incautiouſly permit their offspring to ſuffer this great loſs, rather than apply for aſſiſtance from their monthly-meetings, it is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to friends in every monthly-meeting to ſeek out ſuch of their members as may be thus ſtraightened, and adminiſter to their help; and it is deſired that ſuch will receive the ſalutary aid with a willing mind, and thankfulneſs to the great Author of all good. 1777.</p>
            <p>It is adviſed that each monthly meeting appoint a ſolid, judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, whoſe care ſhould be to meet as often as occaſion requires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult together, and aſſiſt friends in procuring friends to teach ſchools, and to adviſe and aſſiſt them in the regulation thereof; and encourage friends to ſend their children to the ſame.</p>

               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:019014_0109_0FA95E585917E788"/>
And it is our advice, that no friend, after the preſent contracts, expire, ſend their children to any other ſchool but ſuch as are kept by a member of our ſociety, and under the regulation of friends, without the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending are ſuch as the ſchool-committee of the monthly-meetings may think it beſt; and particularly the ſchool-committee of friends every where, throughout the yearly-meeting, are deſired to pay ſpecial attention to give the poor of ſociety ſuch an education as may fit them for buſineſs.</p>

            <head>SCRIPTURES.</head>
            <p>RECOMMENDED as an incumbent duty on friends, to cauſe their children to be frequent in reading the Holy Scriptures, and in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the examples of ſuch children, as in Scripture are recorded to have early learned the fear of the Lord, and hearkened to his counſel: Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the fear and dread of the Lord; planting upon their ſpirits impreſſions of reverence towards God, from whom they have their daily ſupport; ſhewing them they ought not to offend him; but love, ſerve, and honour him, in whoſe hand all bleſſings are. 1709.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſeriouſly adviſed, that no friends ſuffer romances, play-books, or other vain and idle pamphlets, in their houſes or families, which tend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the minds of youth; but, inſtead thereof, that they excite them to the reading the Holy Scriptures, and other religious books. Let the Holy Scriptures be early taught our youth, diligently ſearched, and ſeriouſly read by friends, with due regard to the Holy Spirit from whence they came, and by which they are truly opened: For they contain excellent doctrine, rules and precepts, divine and moral. 1720.</p>
            <p>And, dear friends, inaſmuch as the Holy Scriptures are the external means of conveying and preſerving to us an account of the things moſt ſurely to be believed concerning the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, and the fulfilling the propheſies relating thereto; we therefore recommend to all friends, eſpecially elders in the church, and maſters of families <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And in order to render theſe advices more effectual, we further tenderly recommend to all heads of families, that they do frequently call their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants together; and, in a ſolemn way, audibly read, or cauſe to be read, the Holy Scriptures; and in ſo doing that they humbly wait upon God with their families, for inſtruction and counſel to them reſpecting Chriſtian faith and practice, according to the former advices of this meeting.</p>

            <p>THE exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors, of all kinds, having for a long time been ſeen by our ſociety to be a practice tending to lead from calmneſs and innocency, to the many evils which are the conſequences of intemperance; and a concern having aroſe for the ſpreading of this teſtimony, not only to the diſuſe of diſtilled ſpirituous liquors among us, except as medicine, but that others alſo may by our example be encouraged to reſtrain its uſe within the limits of truth: We recommend to all friends every where, carefully to look at the motives of being concerned therewith, not only of uſing but diſtilling, importing, trading in or handing out to others, who from habit may have acquired a thirſt and inclination after it, tending to their hurt. We tenderly adviſe all ſuch as are concerned therein, to center down to the principle leading to univerſal righteouſneſs; and as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a continuance in ſuch practices will, in this day of light, weaken the hands not only of thoſe individuals concerned to further the reformation, but tend greatly to obſtruct ſociety from holding up a ſtandard to this important teſtimony, as becometh our holy profeſſion.</p>
            <p>We entreat therefore thoſe who have began well, and made advances in the way towards their own peace, that as ſoon as may be they forbear the ſaid practices, that a line may in due time be drawn, and the ſtandard raiſed and ſpread to the nations. 1784.</p>

            <p>ADVISED that none launch into trading, and worldly buſineſs, beyond what they can manage honourably and with reputation; ſo that they may keep their words with all men, that their yea may prove yea indeed, and their nay, nay; for whatſoever is otherwiſe cometh of evil; and that they uſe few words in their dealings, leſt they bring diſhonour to God through their forwardneſs; and ſuch as make themſelves guilty, by thus diſhonouring God, and the holy profeſſion of his name and truth, are for judgment, and the judgment of truth ought to be ſet over them, that thoſe who walk and abide in the truth may be clear of their iniquities. 1675, 1688.</p>
            <p>It is adviſed, and earneſtly deſired, that the payment of juſt debts be not delayed by any profeſſing truth, beyond the time promiſed and agreed upon; nor occaſion given of complaint to thoſe they deal with, by their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of payment, where no time is limited; nor any to overcharge themſelves with too much trading, or with buſineſs beyond their capacities and abilities to manage in the truth.</p>
            <p>It is the advice of this meeting, to the ſeveral quarterly-meetings, that care may be taken, that ſubſtantial friends be appointed to viſit every family amongſt us, where they think there is occaſion to ſuſpect they are going backwards in their worldly eſtate, in a manner that may be to the ill example of others, or prejudice of creditors; and to enquire and ſee how things are with them, adviſe them in tenderneſs according to our diſcipline; and if they do not manifeſt a diſpoſition to take ſuch advice, and comply with it, then to give them goſpel order, and proceed therein againſt them.</p>
            <p>And, dear friends, this meeting being under an holy care and deep concern, for the glory of God, the honour of our holy profeſſion, and ſafety and
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:019014_0119_0FA95E6220101588"/>growth of every member of the body; do adviſe and counſel all friends, for their own good, that they keep to ſuch lawful and honeſt employments as they well underſtand, and are able to manage, for a neceſſary ſupport of themſelves and families; and not to launch out beyond their abilities, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon ſuch credit as truth may have given them with their brethren or others, and more at their hazard who truſt them than their own, which is not only a diſhonour to truth, but diſhoneſt as men, and ſuch cannot be owned in ſuch things to have place in the body. 1710.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that ſuch be dealt with as trade by ſea or land, or buy, bargain or contract, beyond their abilities; and ſuch as keep not their words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or engagements, in their dealings; and do not pay or ſatisfy their juſt debts, according to time agreed on. Theſe being a reproach to truth, and a manifeſt injury and injuſtice, advice to all ſuch ſhould be ſpeedily given, and if they do not reclaim, amend and duly anſwer, they are to be further proceeded againſt. 1719.</p>
            <p>It is earneſtly deſired, that all friends every where be very careful to avoid all inordinate purſuits after the things of this world, by ſuch ways and means as depend too much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; but rather labour to content themſelves with ſuch a plain way and manner of living, as is moſt agreeable to the ſelf-denying principle of truth which we profeſs, and which is moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ducive to that tranquility of mind that is requiſite to a religious conduct through this troubleſome world. 1724.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that a conſcientious care dwell on all our minds, not only to be juſt in our trade and dealing, neither deceiving the buyer in what we ſell, or falſifying the balances; but that we keep to our promiſes, and pay our debts in due time; not exceeding our circumſtances or reaſonable expectations in our way of living, nor engaging in hazardous things more out of vanity than neceſſity. And it is our advice, when any profeſſing truth finds himſelf not able to comply with his contracts, that he call his creditors, and declare his condition in time, and by ſhewing the honeſty of his intentions may clear the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:019014_0120_0FA95E62CC9BF378"/>ſociety from any ſcandalous imputations; and where any ſo circumſtanced refuſes to do ſo, let him be duly cenſured. And, on the other hand, we are to remind you to take heed and beware of covetouſneſs; this grand enemy of the love and faith of Jeſus being too apt to prevail in this time and place of outward tranquility, wherein we are a people ſignally bleſſed of God. 1737.</p>
            <p>It is the ſenſe and judgment of this meeting, that no perſons who ſhall fail of paying their juſt debts ought to be admitted to act in meetings for buſineſs, or join with friends in collecting for the poor and the ſervice of the church, until they have made ſatisfaction to the monthly-meeting they belong to, and done what is in their power to take off the reproach they have, by their imprudent conduct, brought on our Chriſtian principle. 1737.</p>
            <p>We are alſo engaged to caution every individual againſt imprudently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into joint ſecurities with others; for, by theſe practices, many innocent wives and children have been inevitably and unexpectedly involved in ruinous and deplorable circumſtances. We therefore earneſtly deſire friends to keep ſtrictly on their guard, that none, through any ſpecious pretences of rendering acts of friendſhip to others with ſafety to themſelves, may riſque their own peace and reputation, and the ſecurity of their families: In order hereunto, we recommend this ſalutary advice of the wiſe man to their eſpecial notice and regard: <q>Be not thou one of them that ſtrike hands, or of them that are ſureties for debts. If thou haſt nothing to pay, why ſhould he take away thy bed from under thee?</q> Prov. xxii. 26, 27. 1771.</p>
            <p>It is earneſtly recommended, that friends frequently inſpect the ſtate of their affairs, and frequently ſettle their accounts; and when any find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable or have not more than ſufficient to pay their juſt debts, that they immediately diſcloſe their circumſtances to ſome judicious friends, or principal creditors, and take their advice how to act, and be particularly careful not to pay one creditor in preference to another. 1782.</p>

            <p>WE have as a people looked upon ourſelves, as well as the primitive Chriſtians, to be included in the notable prophecy, Iſai. ii. 4, <q>They ſhall beat their ſwords into ploughſhares, and their ſpears into prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hooks, and learn war no more;</q> agreeable to the doctrine of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles (to which our ancient friends abundantly bore teſtimony, both in doctrine and practice, and ſuffered deeply for, confirmed and ratified by ſeveral of our yearly-meetings, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the years 1693 and 1730, by their expreſs declarations and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt carrying guns, for defending our ſhips, perſons, and goods) and being under many ſtrong engagements to obſerve the ſame, from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of Providence over ſuch as have been faithful to this our teſtimony, particularly thoſe of our friends in Pennſylvania; nevertheleſs ſome, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be of our ſociety, have ſlighted and neglected this our ancient and Chriſtian teſtimony, to that degree as to be concerned in privateering, or as owners of ſhips going as letters of marque, which is a flagrant and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble departure from our peaceable principle, which hath always been to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the protection and Providence of Almighty God, and not in weapons of war; which practice of theirs may be attended with injuſtice, barbarity and bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>This meeting having taken this ſorrowful and afflicting caſe, and breach of our ancient teſtimony, into our ſerious conſideration, have thought it our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent duty to bear our teſtimony againſt ſuch practices; and it is the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſenſe of this meeting, that all quarterly and monthly-meetings ought ſpeedily to deal with every perſon found in the practice of ſuch things, in the ſpirit of truth and love, in order to bring them to a ſenſe of their error, and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:019014_0122_0FA95E66E8B50158"/>to reclaim them from it; which if they cannot do, then to teſtify againſt them, and let them know we have no unity or fellowſhip with them. 1744.</p>
            <p>We are ſorrowfully affected, by the anſwers to the Queries, that ſome friends have failed in the maintenance of our Chriſtian teſtimony againſt wars and fighting, by joining with others to hire ſubſtitutes, and by the payment of money to exempt themſelves from perſonal ſervice, in the militia; a practice inconſiſtent with the teſtimony to the reign of the Prince of Peace our ancients received, and were concerned to maintain through cruel ſufferings, and which the faithful in this day dare not ſhrink from: Which defection from our Chriſtian teſtimony and general practice having been matter of ſorrow to this meeting, we are concerned ſtrongly to adviſe againſt, and that friends every where ſtand faithful and ſingle in their dependence on the Lord for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who alone is forever able to keep in perfect ſafety. And if ſuffering be the lot which doth reſult from ſuch obedience to the divine requiring, ſuch will, as they abide in the ſimplicity and innocence of truth, reap the fruits of peace in their own boſom. Let therefore the care of friends, in their ſeveral monthly-meetings, be exerted to prevent any contributions for hiring ſubſtitutes, or other methods of exempting themſelves from the militia, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is our ſenſe and judgment, that we cannot, conſiſtent with our well-known principles, actively pay any rate or aſſeſſment on any town or claſs of men which may be impoſed, for not raiſing the quotas or number aſſigned them to raiſe for any military purpoſe; whether it be as a fine for neglect, or an equivalent for ſuch quotas or detachment; nor any rates or aſſeſſments made for the advancing of the hire or inliſting-money of volunteers, or which may be expreſsly therein ordered to be given or paid to military men. 1762.</p>
            <p>We adviſe that all friends carefully avoid cenſuring or judging each other, in reſpect to the payment or non-payment of ſuch taxes, a part whereof goes to the ſupport of war, and a part for civil government.</p>
            <p>And it is recommended to friends every where, to take into their ſerious conſideration the inconſiſtency of any under our profeſſion ſuffering their

            <p>It is the concern of this meeting to recommend to the ſeveral monthly-meetings, that they, conſiſtent with our ancient teſtimony, refuſe the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all taxes, expreſsly or ſpecially for the ſupport of war, whether called for in money, proviſions or otherwiſe; and that accounts of diſtraints for ſuch taxes be ſent up; and that ſuch friends as do actively pay ſuch taxes be dealt with as diſorderly walkers. We alſo deſire, that all friends carefully avoid diſcouraging a tender ſcruple which may ariſe in the minds of our brethren reſpecting the payment of ſuch taxes, a part whereof is evidently for the ſupport of war; and that all be careful to manifeſt, by a ſteady conſiſtent conduct, that they ſingly aim to experience an advancement in the truth. 1781.</p>

            <head>WOMENS MEETINGS.</head>
            <p>OUR womens meetings being ſet up and approved in the love of God, and by his wiſdom and power; and being of manifeſt ſervice, and helpful in the church; it is the earneſt deſire and advice of this meeting, that they may be upheld and encouraged. 1707.</p>
            <p>And in order that the ſervice of womens meetings may be the more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it is recommended that each monthly-meeting of women friends depute repreſentatives to attend the ſervice of their quarterly-meetings; and each quarterly-meeting depute repreſentatives to the yearly-meeting.</p>
            <p>That they proceed in anſwering the queries, appointing all the proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and conducting the buſineſs neceſſary to their meetings, as the mens meetings are adviſed under queries, monthly-meetings, quarterly-meetings and yearly-meetings.</p>
            <p>In regard to the matter of men and womens meetings being united in diſowning and receiving members, it is agreed, when any perſon requeſts the care of friends, and when any friend is taken under dealing in any monthly-meeting, ſuch meeting, whether mens or womens, acquaint the other thereof, in order for their uniting their ſympathy, and help, if they think it beſt; and when the meeting to whom application is made, or by whom the friend may be under dealing, are about to receive, reſtore or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the perſon under care, that both meetings be acquainted therewith, and their concurrence or unity manifeſted before the concluſion be entered; and when the approbation of both men and women be obtained, the ſame be entered on the minutes of each meeting.</p>
            <p>And it is adviſed, that men and women be attentive and ready in their monthly and quarterly-meetings to unite their aſſiſtance to each other, when it appears uſeful and beſt, whether expreſsly deſired or not; and that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of denial be read, approved and minuted, in both meetings, and then be ſigned by the clerk of the mens meeting, if reſpecting a man, and if a woman, by the clerk of the womens meeting.</p>

            <head>YEARLY-MEETING.</head>
            <p>THE good and bleſſed intent and end of this and all our aſſemblies is, with the Lord's aſſiſtance, for his honour, in the promoting and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of our Chriſtian ſociety and religion, in life and practice, in all the parts and branches thereof. 1695.</p>
            <p>It is the fervent deſire of this meeting, that the buſineſs and concerns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be ſolidly, in the fear of God, managed and carried on, without contention or ſtriving; and with as few words, and in as pertinent expreſſions to the matter in hand, as may be, for expediting the affairs thereof without loſs of time, or any ways diſordering the meeting; but one at a time ſpeaking, and ſtanding up, that all things may be done decently, and in good order. 1710.</p>
            <p>That the quarterly-meetings be careful annually to depute ſuch friends to attend the ſervice of the yearly-meeting, as are men fearing God, of good converſation, weighty ſpirits, prudent and ſincere, well acquainted with the affairs of truth, and diligent attenders of meetings for diſcipline at home; whoſe practice and converſation is anſwerable to the teſtimony they profeſs to bear; men known to be faithful and conſcientious. 1714, 1733.</p>
            <p>Adviſed that no repreſentatives withdraw from the meeting before it ends, without leave firſt requeſted and granted, that the ſervice of the meeting may not be neglected. 1709.</p>
            <p>It behoveth us, in all ſuch our aſſemblies, to have our minds ſeaſoned with a ſenſe of the weight of the work we are engaged in, and to exert ourſelves with an holy zeal for the cauſe of God, and the promotion of his truth; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watching againſt an exalted ſpirit, which would ſtrive for maſtery and dominion, labouring in love and meekneſs of wiſdom to be helpful one unto another, that <q>Nothing may be done through ſtrife, or vain-glory; but, in
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:019014_0126_0FA95E6A5FA4B928"/>lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem other better than themſelves.</q> Phil. ii. 3. 1747.</p>
            <p>Agreed that at the cloſe of the yearly-meeting for worſhip all the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives retire, and agree upon a clerk for the preſent year; and when the meeting of buſineſs is entered by the former clerk, or in his abſence the clerk of the meeting for ſufferings, the clerk named by the repreſentatives being approved is to be entered, and then to take his ſeat at the table, and proceed on the buſineſs before the meeting.</p>
            <p>Agreed that all papers that come before this meeting, as well as quarterly and monthly-meetings, except ſuch as are from immediate correſpondents, be firſt examined by a committee, to be from time to time appointed, before they be read up in our meetings.</p>

            <head>YOUTH.</head>
            <p>WE earneſtly beſeech our friends, and eſpecially the youth among us, to avoid all ſuch couverſation as may tend to draw out their minds into the fooliſh and wicked paſtimes with which this age aboundeth (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly balls, gaming-places, horſe-races, and play-houſes) thoſe nurſeries of debauchery and wickedneſs, the burthen and grief of the ſober part of other ſocieties, as well as of our own; practices wholly unbecoming a people under the Chriſtian profeſſion, contrary to the tenor of the doctrine of the goſpel, and the examples of the beſt men in the earlieſt ages of the church. For as "Evil communications corrupt good manners," ſo it is the duty of men profeſſing religion, who live in this world in order to obtain a better, not only to <q>Shake their hands from holding of bribes, and ſtop their ears from hearing of blood,</q> but alſo "to ſhut their eyes from ſeeing of evil." Iſai. xxxiii. 15. 1739.</p>
            <p>And dearly beloved youth, in an humble ſenſe of the continued viſitations of the Father's love, and experience of their bleſſed effects, we entreat you, by the mercies of God receive its holy impreſſions, ſubmit to its diſcipline; this will preſerve you from the deplorable effect of Satan's transformations, inſpire you with holy reſolutions, and enable you to maintain them in all godly converſation, and purity of life and faith, adorning the doctrine of the goſpel by a blameleſs demeanour. True peace will then flow as a river in your own minds; and the fruits of the tree of righteouſneſs be brought forth to your inexpreſſible conſolation in Chriſt, the revival of Zion's beauty, the rebuilding of her deſolations; ſo that, by and through you, ſhe may yet appear beautiful to the ſincere-hearted, but to her enemies terrible as an army with banners. 1751.</p>
