            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>QUESTION I.</head>
               <p>What raiſes your admiration, when grace is in exerciſe in your ſoul?</p>
               <p>ANS. GREAT is the miſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! My admiration often riſes beyond expreſſion. But I will try to expreſs ſome of my ideas as well as I can. I greatly admire I ſhould be made to hear and know the joyful ſound! I, that was far off! I, that was an enemy to <hi>King</hi> JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS! I, that was by nature a child of wrath even as others! Why was it I that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, while others are left! I can't reſolve this miſtery; it ſtill remains a wonder! I muſt leave it with thankſgiving in the hands of GOD, as my bleſſed <hi>Savior</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>Even ſo,</hi> Father, <hi>for ſo it ſeemed good in thy fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT that which raiſes my admiration the higheſt is, the way that mercy reaches ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that GOD ſhould be manifeſt in the fleſh: That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſhould die
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:046575_0004_10219C3C9216EBA0"/>
for his rebellious ſubjects! That the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> ſhould bear the puniſhment due to his poor, ſinful creatures! O this is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and condeſcenſion! I wonder and admire! O this excellent way of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The love of GOD paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. I can ſee and know but little of the love of GOD that paſſes knowledge: But what I ſee thereof looks very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Yet I wonder at my own ſtupidity, that I am ſo little affected with this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love of GOD. Why don't my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration riſe vaſtly higher than ever it did yet? I wonder that my tho'ts are ſo flat and low, while I hope I am redeemed from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death by the precious blood of CHRIST.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Amazing love! Unbounded grace!</l>
                  <l>How bright it ſhines in JESUS' face!</l>
                  <l>Where juſtice ſtern, and mercy free</l>
                  <l>To ſave poor ſinners do agree.</l>

            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>QU. II. What is your ſorrow and mourning?</head>
               <p>ANS. I Mourn that I have ſinned, and am ſtill a ſinner againſt the LORD of GLORY: That I am ſo unlike to CHRIST: That when I would do good evil is preſent with me: That my heart is ſo evil, ſo vain and ſo ſtupid, and that I can do no more ſervice for GOD and his children. It cauſes ſorrow and mourning when I ſee that my ſins have pierced the <hi>Son</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:046575_0005_1021986D88F4C920"/>
GOD. O this is a ſorrowful ſight! What have I done? Did my ſins torment the bleſſed <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Glory?</hi> I can't but mourn to think of this; and that any of my ſins, the murderers that wounded the heart of JESUS, ſhould be entertained in my heart.—I mourn for the precious ſons and daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> when I ſee them mourning under various trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; their ſorrow is my ſorrow. I mourn to ſee the cauſe of GOD wounded at any time by any of its profeſſed friends; and to ſee many going on to all appearance in the broad way that leads to deſtruction, ſlighting the blood of the <hi>Lamb</hi> of GOD. Grace teaches me to mourn for ſin wherever I ſee it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in myſelf or others.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>My ſorrows here are manifold,</l>
                  <l>Which cannot be in order told:</l>
                  <l>But ſoon I hope thro' grace to ſee</l>
                  <l>The end of all that troubles me.</l>

               <head>QUES. III What is your joy and rejoicing?</head>
               <p>ANS. I Rejoice in the LORD, and joy in him who is the rock of my ſalvation. I rejoice in what the LORD hath done. He hath made me glad thro' his work, and I will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the work of his hands. When I have a view of the glorious perfections of GOD, I give thanks at the remembrance of his holineſs. Tho' I am a mourning ſinner, yet I rejoice that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046575_0006_10219C3EB0942C28"/>
the LORD makes me mourn, and that he hath promiſed comfort to thoſe that mourn: Thus I ſee he gives grace for grace. I rejoice in hope of the glory of GOD, and of the fulfilment of all the exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which will be the perfection of holineſs, the deſtruction of ſin, the end of all ſorrow and the perfection of all joy. I rejoice to ſee and hear of ſubjects being born to <hi>King</hi> JESUS: I love to hear them ſpeaking <hi>Canaan's</hi> ſweet lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and their joy is my joy. Grace teaches me to rejoice in the LORD's work wherever I ſee it, and to rejoice in nothing but what is the LORD's. Whatſoever the King does plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all the people that are governed by his grace. My various joys are too numerous to reckon up in order, and I expect they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end, but increaſe and endure forever. My joys are now but juſt budded; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining is ſmall, but the latter end ſhall greatly increaſe. Some drops of joy have now entered into my ſoul; but I hope ſoon to enter into the joy of my LORD.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Glory to GOD for all my joy,</l>
                  <l>O may his praiſe my tongue employ!</l>
                  <l>Now whilſt I live, and when I die,</l>
                  <l>And to a long eternity.</l>

            <div n="4" type="question">
               <head>QUES. IV. What do you hate?</head>
               <p>ANS. I Hate ſin; eſpecially the ſins of my own heart: The pride, unbelief and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:046575_0007_10219C5B94E71EB8"/>
vanity that lurks within are my hateful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. There is nothing ſo hateful as ſin, whether it ſhews itſelf in thought, word or deed. The grace of GOD teaches me to hate whatſoever the LORD hates.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>I hate the vanity and ſin,</l>
                  <l>The fooliſh thoughts that lurk within,</l>
                  <l>And often lead my ſoul aſtray</l>

            <div n="5" type="question">
               <head>QUESTION V. What do you love?</head>
               <p>ANSWER. GRACE teaches me to love whatſoever is like the altogether lovely JESUS; he is the centre of love. GOD is love, and to him all true love will fly. The <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> make one eſſential GOD of love, manifeſted to us in a moſt familiar, condeſcending man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the <hi>Son</hi> of GOD, who became the ſon of man, that we might become the children of GOD. O glorious beauty! Eſſential love! How ſhould my heart forever burn with love to this lovely <hi>One!</hi> Well may it be ſaid, <hi>He is altogether lovely:</hi> The full perfection of all that is excellent ſhines in his lovely face. How ſweet are all his commands! They are a perfect law of liberty, and are very lovely to me. For JESUS' ſake I love my fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though I hate the ways of ſinners. But I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:046575_0008_10219C40D2DCF6D8"/>
have a ſpecial love to the Saints, the excellent, in whom I take delight. They are more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than others, becauſe they have received a meaſure of the lovely Spirit of GOD. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>King</hi> in ſome meaſure: They can talk his language, and the more they are like him the more lovely they are. We ought to love one another as JESUS has loved us, and yet love the LORD our GOD with all our heart, ſoul, mind and ſtrength. All my love to creatures ſhould be for his ſake, from whom all lovelineſs proceeds; ſo that let me love whom or what I will, ſtill all my love ſhould be ſet upon GOD. I ſee here is a ſweet miſtery and loving harmony, which looks very beautiful and lovely to me.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>All glory to the GOD of love,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe love deſcendeth from above!</l>

               <head>QUESTION VI. What are your fears?</head>
               <p>ANS. PErfect love caſteth out fear: But ſtill the fear of the LORD is the begining of wiſdom. I am ſubject to many fears thro' imperfection, and for want of more love; which fears cauſe a degree of torment. When love grows cold I fear I ſhall at laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by my enemies, and that I do not belong to the family of CHRIST; that I do not love
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:046575_0009_10219C5DAE492AB8"/>
him nor his children as true-hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do; that all my love is ſelf-love, and that I ſhall at laſt be forever ſeparated from CHRIST and the Saints, &amp;c. I alſo fear the faces of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. And many outward dangers cauſe fears: Without are fightings, and within are fears. But all theſe fears, and many more of the ſame nature, cannot ſtand before the love of JESUS. Theſe are the fears that perfect love will caſt out; and the true fear of the LORD will baniſh them from the ſoul. Grace teaches me only to fear the LORD, with a pleaſant loving fear: Fearing to ſin againſt GOD, or to break the leaſt of his commandments. The true fear of the LORD is in ſweet agreement with love, and there is no torment therein.</p>

               <head>What enemies have you to fight againſt?</head>
               <p>ANS. THere is a large army encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, who are under three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, the world, the fleſh and the devil: Theſe with all their hoſt I muſt reſiſt with ſpiritual weapons; and it will never be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor prudent for me to yield or flee before the enemy; but as I have liſted in the <hi>King</hi>'s ſervice during life, I muſt fight as long as I remain in the enemy's country.

I muſt not fear them that can kill the body, and do no more. The fleſh is a ſubtle enemy and

pleads hard to be indulged in ſin: But I muſt make no proviſion for the fleſh, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the luſts thereof. Theſe ſelfiſh enemies do me the moſt damage.

The devil like a roaring lion goes about ſeeking whom he may devour; yet every weak lamb is bound to reſiſt this lion ſtedfaſt in the faith. My enemies compaſs me about like bees; an army without, and an army within: They are lively and ſtrong, the weakeſt of theſe enemies are too ſtrong for me. But yet I muſt fight and never yield until they are all overcome. I, that have deſtroyed myſelf, and am weak and faint, and have no ſtrength; I, muſt fight againſt an hoſt that are ſet in battle array againſt me; and I am commanded not to fear, but to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all ſtill I muſt ſtand.

               <p>ANSW. THIS is too hard a queſtion for me to anſwer whilſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the tents of mortality: But I can tell ſome of my weak ideas.

All the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life are uncertain, and may be all ſuddenly taken from me: I can call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing my own, (except it be that good part that <hi>Mary</hi> choſe; if I have got that, it ſhall never be taken from me, for it is an earneſt of the inheritance to which I am going.)

cannot ſatisfy the ſoul: But all things are certain and enduring in the heavenly world; treaſures laid up there are of infinite value, and will fully ſatisfy the deſires of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul.

The preſent life is a ſtate of war, where we ſhould ſhew our valor for our LORD the <hi>King,</hi> in the land where his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies dwell. A ſtate of trial for a long eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; a place for the poor Saints to mourn and weep under the affliction of a body of ſin and death: But the world of glory where all the Saints are going, is a ſtate of triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over every enemy, a ſtate of perfect peace, where all that are here tried and come forth as gold, ſhall need no more trying but ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their <hi>Father.</hi> There ſhall be no mourning, ſorrow nor crying there; no more trouble with a body of ſin and death. There ſhall be given a free reward for all the free grace that the LORD enables his children to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to his glory in time. Here I have ſome deſires to praiſe the bleſſed JESUS; but find I can ſcarce touch upon the notes of that heavenly ſong. But I hope I am going where I ſhall join with all the happy Singers, to praiſe my GOD in a ſweet melodious manner.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046575_0020_10219C4F3060A4C0"/>
Here I go mourning from day to day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my diſtance from the lovely ſpring of all my joys: But I hope I am going where I ſhall be ſatisfied with nearneſs to the lovely JESUS, and with the company of all his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, who are now ſcattered like ſheep in a wilderneſs, but ſoon they will be all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and never be ſcattered again. Here I am greatly troubled with the monſter ſin, who is blowing his poiſon breath upon all I do, ſpoiling my beſt duties: But I hope I am going where ſin can never go. O what a ſhout of praiſe I ſhall ſing to my glorious <hi>Deliverer,</hi> if ever I get perfectly free from ſin! Here I can have but now and then a drop of heavenly pleaſure, juſt enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and ſtrengthen me to preſs forward on my journey: But when I get home I hope my LORD will make me drink of the River of his pleaſure forever. Here I am full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which are not yet ſatisfied. But I hope I am going where I ſhall enjoy more than I can deſire or wiſh for here.—But what can I conceive of the boundleſs joys that GOD has prepared for all that love him? O how dark are all my ideas of the eternal world, to which I am haſtily going! Grace is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte and earneſt of the glorious inheritance, therefore we may know enough thereof in time to raviſh our hearts, and make us long to reach our eternal Home.</p>
