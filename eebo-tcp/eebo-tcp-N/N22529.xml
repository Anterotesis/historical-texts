            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am honoured with yours of Auguſt 30. Mine of the 7th of that month aſſured you that meaſures were taken for excluding from all further aſylum in our ports, veſſels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the reſtoration of the prizes the Lovely Laſs, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that ſhould the meaſures for reſtitution fail in their effect, the Preſident conſidered it as incumbent on the United States to make compenſation for the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>We are bound by our treaties with three of the belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the ſeas near our ſhores, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are uſed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with thoſe nations to make compenſation.</p>
            <p>Though we have no ſimilar treaty with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it was the opinion of the Preſident, that we ſhould uſe towards that nation, the ſame rule, which, under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high ſeas, and brought into our ports: if done by veſſels which had been armed within them.</p>
            <p>Having for particular reaſons, ſorebore to uſe all the means in our power for the reſtitution of the three veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels mentioned in my letter of Auguſt 7th, the Preſident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compenſation for them; and though nothing was ſaid in that letter of other veſſels taken under like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and brought in after the fifth of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the ſame forbearance had taken place, it was, and is his opinion, that compenſation would be equally due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:029752_0037_0FE2528CB37704B0"/>As to prizes made under the ſame circumſtances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Preſident determined that all the means in our power ſhould be uſed for their reſtitution. If theſe fail, as we ſhould not be bound by our treaties to make compenſation to other powers in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> caſe, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But ſtill, if any caſes ſhall ariſe ſubſequent to that date, the circumſtances of which ſhall place them on ſimilar ground with thoſe before it, the President would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nk compenſation equally incumbent on the United States.</p>
            <p>Inſtructions are given to the governors of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates, to uſe all the means in their power for reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prizes of this laſt deſcription found within their ports. Though they will of courſe take meaſures to be informed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the cuſtom-houſe officers for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet you will be ſenſible of the importance of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying the channels of their information as far as ſhall depend on yourſelf, or any other perſon under your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in order that the governors may uſe the means in their power for making reſtitution.</p>
            <p>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot reſtore it. It will always be beſt to give the notice to them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; but any information which you ſhall be pleaſed to ſend to me, alſo, at any time, ſhall be forwarded to them as quickly as diſtance will permit.</p>
            <p>Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the Preſident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates reſtitution or compenſation in the caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 7th of Auguſt; and after that date reſtitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you ſhould ſubſtantiate the fact, that ſuch prizes are in our ports or waters.</p>
            <p>Your liſt of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to loſſes by detention, waſte, ſpoilation ſuſtained by veſſels taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Auguſt 7th, it is propoſed as a proviſional meaſure, that the collector of the cuſtoms of the diſtrict, and the Britiſh conſul, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029752_0038_0FE2528E4CBFE2B0"/>
you pleaſe, ſhall appoint perſons to eſtabliſh the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the veſſel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which ſhe is brought, according to their value in that port. If this ſhall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleaſed to ſignify it to me, with the names of the prizes underſtood to be of this deſcription, inſtructions will be given accordingly, to the collectors of the cuſtoms where the reſpective veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are.</p>

               <head>MR. BURR's MOTION.</head>
               <p>THAT the further conſideration of the Treaty concluded at London the 19th of November 1794, be poſtponed, and that it be recommended to the Preſident of the United States to proceed without delay, to further friendly negociation with his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty, in order to effect alterations in the ſaid treaty, in the following particulars:</p>
               <p>That the 9th, 10th and 24th Articles, and ſo much of the 25th as relates to the ſhelter or refuge, to be given to the armed veſſels of ſtates or ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns at war with either party, be expunged.</p>
               <p>2d Art. That no privilege or right be allowed to the ſettlers or traders mentioned in the 2d Article,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029752_0039_0FE2528FDD61F900"/>
other than thoſe which are ſecured to them by the treaty of 1783, and exiſting laws.</p>
               <p>3d Art. That the 3d Article be expunged, or ſo modified that the citizens of the United States may have the uſe of <hi>all</hi> rivers, ports and places within the territories of his Britannic Majeſty in North America, in the ſame manner as his ſubjects may have of thoſe of the United States.</p>
               <p>6th Art. That the value of the negroes and other property, carried away contrary to the 7th article of the treaty of 1783, <hi>and the loſs and damages ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the United States by the detention of the poſts,</hi> be paid for by the Britiſh government; the amount to be aſcertained by the commiſſioners who may be appointed to liquidate the claims of the Britiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
               <p>12th Art. That what relates to the Weſt India trade, and the proviſos and conditions thereof in the 12th article, be expunged, or be rendered much more favourable to the United States, and without any reſtraint on the exportation in veſſels of the United States, of any articles, not the growth, produce or manufacture of the ſaid iſlands of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty.</p>
               <p>15th Art. That no clauſe be admitted which may reſtrain the United States from reciprocating benefits by diſcriminating between foreign nations in their commercial arrangements, or prevent them from increaſing the tonnage, or other duties on Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh veſſels, on terms of reciprocity, or in a ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ratio.</p>

               <head>MR. TAZEWELL's MOTION.</head>
               <p>THAT the Preſident of the United States be informed, that the Senate will not conſent to the ratification of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, between the United States and his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty, concluded at London on the 19th of November, 1794, for the reaſons following—</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe ſo much of the treaty as was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to terminate the complaints, flowing from the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, contains ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were not rightfully or juſtly requirable of the United States, and which are both impolitic and injurious to their intereſt; and becauſe the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath not ſecured that ſatisfaction from the Britiſh government, for the removal of negroes, in violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the treaty of 1783, to which the citizens of the United States were juſtly entitled.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe the rights of individual ſtates are by the 9th article of the treaty, unconſtitutionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe, however impolitic or unjuſt it may generally be, to exerciſe the power prohibited by the 10th article, yet it reſts on legiſlative diſcretion, and ought not to be prohibited by treaty.</item>
                  <item>4. Becauſe ſo much of the treaty, as relates to commercial arrangements between the parties, wants that reciprocity, upon which alone, ſuch like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements ought to be ſounded, and will operate ruinouſly to the American commerce and navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                  <item>5. Becauſe the treaty prevents the United States from the exerciſe of that controul over their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation, as connected with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which might better the condition of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with friendly nations.</item>

                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029752_0041_0FE2529ACF7C5718"/>6. Becauſe the treaty aſſerts a power in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Senate, to controul and even annihilate the conſtitutional right of the Congreſs of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State, over their commercial intercourſe with foreign nations.</item>
                  <item>7. Becauſe, if the conſtruction of this treaty ſhould not produce an infraction of the treaties now ſubſiſting between the United States and their allies, it is calculated to excite ſenſations, which may not operate beneficially to the United States.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Senate will not conſent to the ratification of this treaty, they adviſe the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States to continue his endeavours by friendly diſcuſſion with his Britannic Majeſty, to adjuſt all the real cauſes of complaint between the two nations.</p>
               <p>Theſe propoſitions were both rejected by a vote of 20 to 10. We are informed that the members who voted in the affirmative were,</p>

            <head>Treaty of Amity and Commerce BETWEEN <hi>His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and the thirteen United States of America.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE moſt chriſtian king, and the thirteen unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States of North America, <hi>to wit,</hi> New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts-bay, Rhode Iſland, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and Georgia, willing to fix, in an equitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the correſpondence and commerce which the two parties deſire to eſtabliſh between their reſpective countries, ſtates, and ſubjects; his moſt chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the ſaid united ſtates, have judged, that the ſaid end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the baſis of their agreement, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe burdenſome preferences, which are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſources of debate, embarraſſment, and diſcontent—by leaving alſo each party at liberty to make, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commerce and navigation, thoſe interior regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which it ſhall find moſt convenient to itſelf—and by founding the advantage of commerce ſolely upon reciprocal utility, and the juſt rules of free intercourſe—reſerving withal to each party, the liberty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, at its pleaſure, other nations to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame advantages. It is in the ſpirit of this intention, and to fulfil theſe views, that his ſaid majeſty having named and appointed for his plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, Conrad Alexander Gerard, royal ſyndic of the city of Straſbourg, ſecretary of his majeſty's council of ſtate—and the united ſtates on their part, having fully empowered Benjamin Franklin, deputy from the ſtate of Pennſylvania to the general congreſs,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029752_0043_0FE2529F12F8D790"/>
and preſident to the convention of ſaid ſtate—Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Deane, late deputy from the ſtate of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, to the ſaid congreſs—and Arthur Lee, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor at law: the ſaid reſpective plenipotentiaries, after exchanging their powers, and after mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have concluded and agreed upon the following articles:</p>
            <p>ART. I. THERE ſhall be a firm, inviolable, and univerſal peace, and a true and ſincere friendſhip, between the moſt chriſtian king, his heirs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and the united ſtates of America, and the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king and of the ſaid ſtates, and between the countries, iſlands, cities, and towns, ſituate under the juriſdiction of the moſt chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian king, and of the ſaid united ſtates, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inhabitants of every degree, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons or places, and the terms herein after-mentioned, ſhall be perpetual between the moſt chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian king, his heirs, and ſucceſſors, and the ſaid united ſtates.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The moſt chriſtian king, and the united ſtates, engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in reſpect of commerce and navigation, which ſhall not immediately become common to the other party, who ſhall enjoy the ſame favour freely, if the conceſſion was freely made—or on allowing the ſame compenſation, if the conceſſion was conditional.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, ſhall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, iſlands, cities, or towns of the united ſtates, or any of them, no other or greater duties or impoſts, of what nature ſoever they may be, or by what name ſoever called, than thoſe which the nations moſt favoured are or ſhall be obliged to pay: and they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether in paſſing from one port in the ſaid ſtates to another, or in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and from the ſame, from and to any part of the world, which the ſaid nations do or ſhall enjoy.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:029752_0044_0FE252A63785F570"/>IV. The ſubjects, people and inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, and each of them, ſhall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, iſles, cities, and places, under the domination of his moſt chriſtian majeſty in Europe, any other or greater duties or impoſts, of what nature ſoever they may be, or by what name ſoever called, than thoſe which the moſt favoured nations are or ſhall be obliged to pay: and they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in paſſing from one port in the ſaid domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Europe, to another, or in going to and from the ſame, from and to any part of the world, which the ſaid nations do or ſhall enjoy.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In the above exemption is particularly compriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the impoſition of one hundred ſols per ton, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in France on Foreign ſhips, unleſs when the ſhips of the united ſtates ſhall load with the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of France, for another port of the ſame domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in which caſe, the ſaid ſhips ſhall pay the duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, ſo long as other nations the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſhall be obliged to pay it: but it is underſtood, that the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them, are at liberty, when they ſhall judge it proper, to eſtabliſh a duty equivalent in the ſame caſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The moſt chriſtian king ſhall endeavour, by all the means in his power, to protect and defend all veſſels, and the effects, belonging to the ſubjects, people, or inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them, being in his ports, havens or roads, or on the ſeas near to his countries, iſlands, cities or towns; and to recover and reſtore to the right owners, their agents, or attornies, all ſuch veſſels and effects, which ſhall be taken within his juriſdiction: and the ſhips of war of his moſt chriſtian majeſty, or any convoy ſailing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his authority, ſhall upon all occaſions take under their protection, all veſſels belonging to the ſubjects, people, or inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them, and holding the ſame courſe, or going the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029752_0045_0FE252A8EBD84DE0"/>
ſame way, and ſhall defend ſuch veſſels as long as they hold the ſame courſe, or go the ſame way, againſt all attacks, force, and violence, in the ſame manner as they ought to protect and defend the veſſels belonging to the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. In like manner the ſaid united ſtates, and their ſhips of war ſailing under their authority, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend, conformably to the tenor of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding article, all the veſſels and effects belonging to the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, and uſe all their endeavours to recover, and cauſe to be reſtored, the ſaid veſſels and effects that ſhall have been taken within the juriſdiction of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The moſt chriſtian king will employ his good offices and interpoſition with the king or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Morocco or Fez—the regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, or with any of them—and alſo with every other prince, ſtate, or power, of the coaſt of Barbary in Africa—and the ſubjects of the ſaid king, emperor, ſtates, and powers, and each of them, in order to provide, as fully and efficaciouſly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the benefit, conveniency and ſafety of the ſaid united ſtates, and each of them, their ſubjects, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and inhabitants, and their veſſels and effects, againſt all violence, inſult, attacks, or depredations, on the part of the ſaid princes and ſtates of Barbary or their ſubjects.</p>

and if any ſhip or veſſel ſhall be found fiſhing, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, the ſaid ſhip or veſſel with its lading (proof being made thereof) ſhall be confiſcated: it is however, underſtood that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtipulated in the preſent article, ſhall take place only ſo long and ſo far, as the moſt chriſtian king or the united ſtates ſhall not in this reſpect have granted an exemption to ſome other nation.</p>

The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being paſſed after the declaration of war, their reſpective ſubjects, from whatever part of the world they come, ſhall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. And that more effectual care may be taken for the ſecurity of the ſubjects and inhabitants of both parties, that they ſuffer no injury by the men of war or privateers of the other party, all the commanders

            <p n="20">XX. For the better promoting of commerce on both ſides, it is agreed, that if a war ſhall break out between the ſaid two nations, ſix months after the proclamation of war ſhall be allowed to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, in the cities and towns where they live, for ſelling and tranſporting their goods and merchandiſes: and if any thing be taken from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or ſubjects of either, full ſatisfaction ſhall be made for the ſame.</p>

            <p n="22">XXII. It ſhall not be lawful for any foreign privateers, not belonging to ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, nor citizens of the ſaid united ſtates, who have commiſſions from any other prince or ſtate in enmity with either nation, to fit their ſhips in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforeſaid parties, to ſell what they have taken, or in any other manner whatſoever to exchange their ſhips, merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes, or any other lading: neither ſhall they be allowed even to purchaſe victuals, except ſuch as ſhall be neceſſary for their going to the next port of that prince or ſtate from which they have commiſſions.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. It ſhall be lawful for all and ſingular the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, and the citizens, people, and inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, to ſail with their ſhips with all manner of liberty and ſecurity, no diſtinction being made who are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of the merchandiſes laden thereon, from any port to the places of thoſe who now are or hereafter ſhall be at enmity with the moſt chriſtian king or the united ſtates.

And it is hereby ſtipulated, that free ſhips ſhall alſo give a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to goods; and that every thing ſhall be deemed to be free and exempt, which ſhall be found on board the ſhips belonging to the ſubjects of either of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, although the whole lading or any part thereof ſhould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is alſo agreed in like manner, that the ſame liberty be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perſons who are on board a free ſhip, with this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ſhip, unleſs they are ſoldiers and in actual ſervice of the enemy.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. This liberty of navigation and commerce ſhall extend to all kinds of merchandiſes, excepting thoſe only which are diſtinguiſhed by the name of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and under this name of contraband or prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed goods ſhall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs, with the fuſecs and other things belonging to them, cannon ball, gunpowder, match, pikes, ſwords, lances, ſpears, halberds, mortars, petards, grenades, ſaltpetre, muſkets, muſket ball, bucklers, helmets, breaſt plates, coats of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming ſoldiers, muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, belts, horſes with their furniture, and all other warlike inſtruments whatever.

            <p n="25">XXV. To the end that all manner of diſſentions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented, on one ſide and the other, it is agreed, that in caſe either of the parties hereto ſhould be engaged in war, the ſhips and veſſels belonging to the ſubjects or people of the other ally, muſt be furniſhed with ſea letters or paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, expreſſing the name, property, and bulk of the ſhip, as alſo the name and place of habitation of the maſter or commander of the ſaid ſhip, that it may appear thereby that the ſhip really and truly belongs to the ſubjects of one of the parties, which paſſport ſhall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty. They ſhall likewiſe be recalled every year, that is, if the ſhip happens to return home within the ſpace of a year; it is likewiſe agreed, that ſuch ſhips, being laden, are to be provided not only with paſſports as above mentioned, but alſo with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, containing the ſeveral particulars of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the place whence the ſhip ſailed, and whither ſhe is bound; that ſo it may be known whether any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

The ſhips of the ſubjects and inhabitants of either of the parties coming upon any coaſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to either of the ſaid allies, but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, they ſhall be treated according to the general rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or to be preſcribed relative to the object in queſtion.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. If the ſhips of the ſaid ſubjects, people, or inhabitants of either of the parties, ſhall be met with, either ſailing along the coaſts, or on the high ſeas, by any ſhips of war of the other, or by any privateers, the ſaid ſhips of war or privateers for the avoiding of any diſorder, ſhall remain out of cannon ſhot, and may ſend their boats on board the merchant ſhip, which they ſhall ſo meet with; and may enter her to the number of two or three men only; to whom the maſter or commander of ſuch ſhip or veſſel ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit his paſſport, concerning the property of the ſhip, made out according to the form inſerted in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treaty: and the ſhip, when ſhe ſhall have ſhewed ſuch paſſport, ſhall be free and at liberty to purſue her voyage; ſo as it ſhall not be lawful to moleſt or ſearch her in any manner, or to give her chaſe, or force her to quit her intended courſe.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. It is alſo agreed, that all goods, when once put on board the ſhips or veſſels of either of the two contracting parties, ſhall be ſubject to no further viſitation; but all viſitation or ſearch ſhall be made beforehand; and all prohibited goods ſhall be ſtopped on the ſpot before the ſame be put on board, unleſs there be manifeſt tokens or proofs of fraudulent practice: nor ſhall either the perſons or goods of the

            <p n="29">XXIX. The two contracting parties grant mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the liberty of having each in the ports of the other, conſuls, vice-conſuls, agents and commiſſaries, whoſe functions ſhall be regulated by a particular agreement.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. And the more to favour and facilitate the commerce which the ſubjects of the united ſtates may have with France, the moſt chriſtian king will grant them in Europe, one or more free ports, where they may bring and diſpoſe of all the produce and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of the thirteen united ſtates: and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will alſo continue to the ſubjects of the ſaid ſtates, the free ports which have been and are open in the French iſlands of America; of all which free ports the ſaid ſubjects of the united ſtates ſhall enjoy the uſe, agreeably to the regulations which relate to them.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. The preſent treaty ſhall be ratified on both ſides, and the ratifications ſhall be exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible.</p>

            <p>THE moſt chriſtian king, and the united ſtates of North America, to wit, New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts-bay, Rhode Iſland, Connecticut, New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Delaware, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, having this day concluded a treaty of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and commerce, for the reciprocal advantage of their ſubjects and citizens, have thought it neceſſary to take into conſideration the means of ſtrengthening thoſe engagements, and of rendering them uſeful to the ſafety and tranquillity of the two parties; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in caſe Great-Britain, in reſentment of that connexion, and of the good correſpondence which is the object of the ſaid treaty, ſhould break the peace with France, either by direct hoſtilities, or by hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her commerce and navigation in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rights of nations, and the peace ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the two crowns.

            <p n="2">II.

            <p n="3">III. The two contracting parties ſhall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, make all the efforts in its power againſt their common enemy, in order to attain the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

The contracting parties agree, that in caſe either of them ſhould form any particular enterpriſe, in which the concurrence of the other may be deſired, the party, whoſe concurrence is deſired, ſhall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpoſe, as far as circumſtances and its own particular ſituation will permit. And in that caſe, they ſhall regulate by a particular convention, the quantity and kind of ſuccour to be furniſhed, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its compenſation.</p>
            <p n="5">V. If the united ſtates ſhould think fit to attempt the reduction of the Britiſh power remaining in the northern parts of America, or the iſlands of Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, thoſe countries or iſlands, in caſe of ſucceſs, ſhall be confederated with, or dependent upon the ſaid u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited ſtates.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The moſt chriſtian king renounces for ever, the poſſeſſion of the iſlands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North America, which before the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great Britain, or to the united ſtates, heretofore called Britiſh colonies, or which are at this time, or
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029752_0058_0FE252D7054A9D40"/>
have lately been under the power of the king and crown of Great Britain.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. If his moſt chriſtian majeſty ſhall think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to attack any of the iſlands ſituated in the gulph of Mexico, or near that gulph, which are at preſent under the power of Great Britain, all the ſaid iſles, in caſe of ſucceſs, ſhall appertain to the crown of France.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Neither of the two parties ſhall conclude ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truce or peace with Great Britain, without the formal conſent of the other firſt obtained: and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms, until the independence of the united ſtates ſhall have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or tacitly aſſured, by the treaty or treaties that ſhall terminate the war.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The contracting parties declare, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fulfil each on its own part, the clauſes and conditions of the preſent treaty of alliance, according to its own power and circumſtances, there ſhall be no after-claim of compenſation, on one ſide or the other, whatever mav be the event of the war.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The moſt chriſtian king and the united ſtates agree to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make a common cauſe with them, and to accede to the preſent alliance, under ſuch conditions as ſhall be freely agreed to, and ſettled between all the parties.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The two parties guarantee mutually from the preſent time and for ever, againſt all other powers, to wit, the united ſtates to his moſt chriſtian majeſty, the preſent poſſeſſions of the crown of France in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, as well as thoſe which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace: and his moſt chriſtian majeſty guarantees; on his part to the united ſtates, their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſovereignty, and independence, abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, as well in matters of government, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce—and alſo their poſſeſſions, and the additions or conqueſts that their confederation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029752_0059_0FE252DA1C3BBCC8"/>
poſſeſſed by Great Britain in North America, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the fifth and ſixth articles above written; the whole, as their poſſeſſions ſhall be fixed and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſaid ſtates, at the moment of the ceſſation of their preſent war with England.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. In order to fix more preciſely the ſenſe and application of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in caſe of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſaid article, ſhall have its full force and effect, the moment ſuch war ſhall break out: and if ſuch rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall not take place, the mutual obligations of the ſaid guarantee ſhall not commence until the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ceſſation of the preſent war, between the united ſtates and England, ſhall have aſcertained their poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The preſent treaty ſhall be ratified on both ſides, and the ratification ſhall be exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>In faith whereof the reſpective plenipotentiaries, to wit, on the part of the moſt chriſtian king, Conrad Alexander Gerard, royal ſyndic of the city of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg and ſecretary of his majeſty's council of ſtate—and on the part of the united ſtates, Benjamin Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, deputy to the general congreſs from the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and preſident of the convention of ſaid ſtate—Silas Deane, heretofore deputy from the ſtate of Connecticut—and Arthur Lee, counſellor at law, have ſigned the above articles both in the French and Engliſh languages; declaring, nevertheleſs, that the preſent treaty was originally compoſed and concluded in the French language; and they have hereunto affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſeals.</p>

And that all diſputes, which might ariſe in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on the ſubject of the boundaries of the ſaid unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtates, may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared, that the following are and ſhall be their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, viz. from the northweſt angle of Nova Scotia, viz. That angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the ſource of St. Croix river to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, along the ſaid highlands, which divide thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that empty themſelves into the river St. Lawrence from thoſe which fall into the Atlantic ocean, to the north-weſternmoſt head of Connecticut river; thence

Eaſt, by a line to be drawn along the middle of the river St. Croix, from its mouth in the bay of Fundy, to its ſource, and from its ſource directly north to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid highlands, which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic ocean, from thoſe which fall into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Lawrence, comprehending all iſlands within twenty leagues of any part of the ſhores of the united ſtates, and lying between lines to be drawn due eaſt from the points where the aforeſaid boundaries between

Nova Scotia on the one part, and Eaſt Florida on the other, ſhall reſpectively touch the bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic ocean, excepting ſuch iſlands as now are, or heretofore have been within the limits of the ſaid province of Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is agreed, that the people of the united ſtates ſhall continue to enjoy, unmoleſted, the right to take fiſh of every kind on the Grand Bank, and on all the other banks of Newfoundland, alſo in the gulph of St. Lawrence, and at all other places in the ſea, where the inhabitants of both countries uſed at any time heretofore to fiſh. And alſo, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the united ſtates ſhall have liberty to take fiſh of every kind on ſuch part of the coaſt of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland, as Britiſh fiſhermen ſhall uſe (but not to dry or cure the ſame on that iſland) and alſo on the coaſts, bays and creeks of all other of his Britannic majeſty's dominions in America; and that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican fiſhermen ſhall have liberty to dry and cure fiſh in any of the unſettled bays, harbours and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen iſlands, and Labrador, ſo long as the ſame ſhall remain unſettled; but ſo ſoon as the ſame or either of them ſhall be ſettled, it ſhall not be lawful for the ſaid fiſhermen to dry or cure fiſh at ſuch ſettlement, without a previous agreement for that purpoſe, with the inhabitants, proprietors, or poſſeſſors of the ground.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It is agreed, that creditors on either ſide, ſhall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in ſterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is agreed, that the congreſs ſhall earneſtly recommend it to the legiſlatures of the reſpective ſtates, to provide for the reſtitution of all eſtates, rights, and properties, which have been confiſcated, belonging to real Britiſh ſubjects: and alſo of the eſtates, rights, and properties of perſons reſident in diſtricts in the poſſeſſion of his majeſty's arms, and who have not borne arms againſt the ſaid united ſtates; and that perſons of any other deſcription, ſhall

And it is agreed, that all perſons, who have any intereſt in confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated lands, either by debts, marriage-ſettlements, or otherwiſe, ſhall meet with no lawful impediment in the proſecution of their juſt rights.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That there ſhall be no future confiſcations made, nor any proſecutions commenced againſt any perſon or perſons for, or by reaſon of the part which he or they may have taken in the preſent war: and that no perſon ſhall, on that account, ſuffer any future loſs or damage, either in his perſon, liberty, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: and that thoſe, who may be in confinement on ſuch charges, at the time of the ratification of the treaty in America, ſhall be immediately ſet at liberty, and the proſecution, ſo commenced, be diſcontinued.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. There ſhall be a firm and perpetual peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Britannic majeſty and the ſaid ſtates, and between the ſubjects of the one, and the citizens of the other; wherefore all hoſtilities both by ſea and land ſhall from henceforth ceaſe: all priſoners on both ſides ſhall be ſet at liberty: and his Britannic majeſty ſhall, with all convenient ſpeed, and without cauſing

            <p n="8">VIII. The navigation of the river Miſſiſſippi, from its ſource to the ocean, ſhall for ever remain free and open to the ſubjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the united ſtates.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. In caſe it ſhould ſo happen, that any place or territory belonging to Great Britain, or to the united ſtates, ſhould have been conquered by the arms of either from the other, before the arrival of the ſaid proviſional articles in America, it is agreed that the ſame ſhall be reſtored without difficulty, and without requiring any compenſation.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The ſolemn ratifications of the preſent treaty, expedited in good and due form, ſhall be exchanged between the contracting parties in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible, to be computed from the day of the ſignature of the preſent treaty. In wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof, we the underſigned, their miniſters ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary, have, in their name, and in virtue of our full powers, ſigned with our hands, the preſent defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive treaty, and cauſed the ſeals of our arms to be affixed thereto.</p>

            <p>I HAVE lately read with attention the treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and the United States, as alſo the reſolution of the ſenate, conditionally conſenting to its ratification—What the ſenate intended by this reſolution is extremely difficult to diſcover. I hope, however, the following remarks will contribute to place it upon the leaſt exceptionable ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029752_0085_0FE25342915A2F38"/>The reſolution is in theſe words—</p>
            <p>"Reſolved that the ſenate do conſent to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the preſident of the United States to ratify, the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, between his Britannic majeſty and the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, concluded at London the 19th of November, 1794, on condition that there be added to the ſaid treaty, an article, whereby it ſhall be agreed to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the operation of ſo much of the twelfth article, as reſpects the trade, which his ſaid majeſty thereby conſents may be carried on between the United States and his iſlands in the Weſt-Indies, in the manner, and on the terms and conditions therein ſpecified.</p>
            <p>"And the ſenate recommend to the preſident to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without delay, to further friendly negociations with his majeſty, on the ſubject of the ſaid trade, and of the terms and conditions in queſtion."</p>
            <p>So much of the twelfth article of the treaty as is not propoſed to be ſuſpended by the foregoing reſolution, is in theſe words—</p>
            <p>"And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the ſaid term, the two contracting parties will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour further to regulate their commerce, in this reſpect, according to the ſituation in which his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may then find himſelf with reſpect to the Weſt-Indies, and with a view to ſuch arrangements as may beſt conduce to the mutual advantage and extenſion of commerce. And the ſaid parties will then alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their diſcuſſions, and endeavour to agree, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any and in what caſes neutral veſſels ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect enemy's property; and in what caſes proviſions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch. But in the mean time their conduct towards each other in theſe reſpects, ſhall be regulated by the articles herein after inſerted on thoſe ſubjects."</p>
            <p>The twenty-eighth article of the treaty is in theſe words—</p>
            <p>Art. XXVIII. "It is agreed, that the firſt ten articles of this treaty ſhall be permanent, and that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029752_0086_0FE253442653D038"/>
the ſubſequent articles, except the twelfth, ſhall be limited in their duration to twelve years, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from the day on which the ratifications of this treaty ſhall be exchanged, but ſubject to this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—that whereas the ſaid 12th article will expire by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the ſigning of the preliminary or other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of peace, which ſhall terminate the preſent war in which his majeſty is engaged, it is agreed, that proper meaſures ſhall by concert be taken for bringing the ſubject of that article into amicable treaty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, ſo early before the expiration of the ſaid term, as that new arrangements on that head, may by that time be perfected and ready to take place. But if it ſhould unfortunately happen, that his majeſty and the United States ſhould not be able to agree on ſuch new arrangements, in that caſe all the articles of this treaty, except the firſt ten, ſhall then ceaſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire together."</p>
            <p>If the treaty had been unconditionally conſeated to by the ſenate and ratified by the preſident, and if no new arrangements in relation to the ſubjects of the twelfth article, could be agreed on between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before or at the expiration of two years from the termination of the preſent war, then at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the whole of the treaty (except the firſt ten ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) would expire together—Except thoſe ten arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the whole treaty is made to depend on the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the twelfth article, or its ſubſtitute. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, therefore, the twelfth article ceaſes to operate, if an agreeable ſubſtitute is not ready to take its place, the whole treaty, except the ten firſt articles, muſt expire with it. It is obviouſly immaterial, whether the determination of the twelfth article is occaſioned by its regular expiration, two years after the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the war, or by the conſent of the contracting nations, at an earlier period.—In either caſe, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt be the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:029752_0087_0FE25346F8582DD8"/>The reſolution of the ſenate makes the ſuſpenſion of the material parts of the twelfth article, a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which they will conſent to the ratification of the treaty. If this condition is not accepted by the Britiſh king, every part of the treaty is without the ſanction of the ſenate. If it is accepted, then the ſubſtantial parts of the twelfth article ceaſe to operate, by the mutual conſent of the contracting nations; and therefore every part of the treaty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the firſt ten articles, muſt expire with it. The foundation being taken away, the ſuperſtructure muſt fall.</p>
            <p>The ſenate, aware of this concluſion, add to their reſolution a recommendation to the preſident, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without delay to procure a ſubſtitute for the twelfth article, by new negociations with the Britiſh king. If ſuch a ſubſtitute can be obtained, ſo as to begin its operation when the ſuſpenſion of the twelfth article takes place, then it may be contrived to give exiſtence to the whole treaty; but without it, the Britiſh king's aſſent to the condition contained in the ſenate's reſolution muſt annihilate the whole of the treaty, or at any rate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whole of it except the ten firſt articles.</p>
            <p>Under this view of the ſenate's reſolution, it may become a queſtion, whether the preſident can conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally complete the final act of ratificaition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out again reſorting to the ſenate for their approbation. If new arrangements are made to ſupply the place of the twelfth article, they muſt form a part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treaty—They do not now exiſt, and conſequently they cannot be ſaid to have obtained the conſent of the ſenate—Without the conſent of the ſenate, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot conſtitutionally be made—If no new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements are agreed on, and the condition upon which the ſenate have conſented to the ratification, is aſſented to, then as the condition itſelf will deſtroy all the treaty, except the firſt ten articles, the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the queſtion, as to the preſident's conſititu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029752_0088_0FE2534E1D1D5E80"/>
power, becomes unimportant, as to all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except the ten firſt articles. The operation of the condition, when aſſented to, upon the preſident's power to ratify the ten firſt articles, is a queſtion I do not now intend to examine, becauſe the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſenate have unequivocally ſhown, amidſt all their perplexity, that they did not intend to ratify the ten firſt articles in the view of a diſtinct ratify the ten firſt articles in the view of a diſtinct treaty with Great-Britain.</p>

The injuries complained of were, principally, 1ſt, The detention of the weſtern poſts—2dly, The delay in compenſating for the negroes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off at the cloſe of the war—and 3dly, The ſpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations committed on our commerce. The remedies propoſed were, principally, 1ſt, The commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of Mr. Madiſon—2dly, The non-intercourſe propoſition of Mr. Clarke—3dly, The ſequeſtration motion of Mr. Dayton—4thly, An embargo—and 5thly, Military preparation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every plan of the legiſlature was, however, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, or rather annihilated, by the interpoſition of the executive authority; and Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> the chief juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the United States, was taken from his judicial
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029752_0089_0FE25350D93CC120"/>
ſeat, to negociate with Great Britain, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the prevailing ſentiment of the people, <hi>for the redreſs of our wrongs.</hi> Query—Are not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and the execution of it, at variance? Is any one of our wrongs actually redreſſed? Is not an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Great Britain, for the injuries which ſhe <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> to have ſuffered, a preliminary ſtipulation?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The political dogma of Mr. Jay are well known; his predilection, in relation to France and Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, has not been diſguiſed; and even on the topic of American complaints, his reports, while in the office of ſecretary for foreign affairs, and his adjudications while in the office of chief juſtice, were not calculated to point him out as the ſingle citizen of America, fitted for the ſervice in which he was employed. Query—Do not perſonal feelings too often dictate and govern the public conduct of miniſters? But whatever may have been his perſonal diſqualifications, they are abſorbed in the more important conſideration of the apparent violence committed by Mr. Jay's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, on the eſſential principles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That topic, however, has already been diſcuſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we may paſs to the manner of negociating the treaty in England, which was at once obſcure and illuſory. We heard of Mr. Jay's diplomatic honors; of the royal and miniſterial courteſy which was ſhewn to him, and of the convivial boards to which he was invited: but, no more! Mr. Jay, enveloped by a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous confidence, in the intuitive faculties of his own mind, or in the inexhauſtible fund of his diplomatic information, neither poſſeſſed nor wiſhed for external aid; while the Britiſh negociator, beſides his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements, entered on the points of negociation, fraught with all the auxiliary ſagacity of his brother miniſters, and with all the practical knowledge of the moſt enlightened merchants of a commercial nation. The reſult correſponds with that inauſpicious ſtate of things. Mr. Jay was driven from the ground of an injured, to the ground of an aggreſſing, party; he
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029752_0090_0FE25352693CF220"/>
made atonement for imaginary wrongs, before he was allowed juſtice for real ones; he converted the <hi>reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the American citizens (under the impreſſions of which he was avowedly ſent to England) into <hi>amity and concord;</hi> and ſeems to have been ſo anxious to rivet a commercial chain about the neck of America, that he even forgot, or diſregarded, a principal item of her own produce (cotton) in order to make a ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice to the inſatiable appetite of his maritime antagoniſt. But the idea of the treaty, given by Mr. Pitt in anſwer to Mr. Fox, who, before he had ſeen, applauded it as an act of liberality and juſtice towards America, was the firſt authoritative alarm to our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and our feelings. "When the treaty is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the parliament (ſaid the miniſter) you will beſt judge, whether any improper conceſſion has been made to America!"</p>
               <p n="5">5. The treaty being ſent hither for ratification, the preſident and the ſenate purſue the myſterious plan in which it was negociated. It has been intimated, that till the meeting of the ſenate, the inſtrument was not communicated even to the moſt confidential officers of the government: and the firſt reſolution taken by the ſenate was to ſtop the lips and ears of its members againſt every poſſibility of giving or receiving inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Every man, like Mr. Jay, was preſumed to be inſpired. In the courſe of the diſcuſſion, however, ſome occurrences flaſhed from beneath the veil of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; and it is conjectured that the whole treaty was at one time in jeopardy. But the rhetoric of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter (not remarkable for the <hi>volubility of his tongue</hi>) who was brought poſt haſte from the country; the danger of expoſing to odium and diſgrace the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed American characters, who would be affected by a total rejection of the treaty; and the feeble, but operative, vote of a member tranſported from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and imbecility of a ſick room, to decide in the ſenate a great national queſtion, whoſe merits he had
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029752_0091_0FE25354003C9F88"/>
not heard diſcuſſed; triumphed over principle, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and decorum!</p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſtill the treaty remains <hi>unratified;</hi> for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Britiſh government ſhall aſſent to ſuſpend the obnoxious twelfth article (in favor of which, however, many <hi>patriotic</hi> members declared their readineſs to vote) the whole is deſtroyed by the terms of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and if the Britiſh government ſhall agree to add an article allowing the ſuſpenſion, the whole muſt return for the re-conſideration of the ſenate. But the forms of myſtery are ſtill preſerved by our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and attempts to deceive the people have been made abroad, upon a rain preſumption, that the treaty could remain <hi>a ſecret,</hi> till it became obligatory as <hi>a law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For inſtance; in <hi>Fenno</hi>'s paper of the 25th of June, it is unequivocally declared, the "the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation was ratified yeſterday by the ſenate of the United States;" and, even while he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects that miſtake in the paper of the following day, he commits <hi>an error</hi> of a more extraordinary kind (particularly when we conſider that he is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential perſon, who printed the treaty for the uſe of the ſenate) by aſſerting, that in the twelfth article, "the United States are prohibited from exporting to Europe from the ſaid ſtates, ſugar, coffee, cotton and cocoa, <hi>the produce of any of the Weſt-India iſlands."</hi> The fact muſt have been known to Mr. Fenno, that the prohibition operates univerſally; whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited articles are the produce of the Weſt-India iſlands, of the Eaſt Indies, of the United States, or of any other part of the world. The next eſſay to render the envelopements of the treaty ſtill more opaque, appeared in the American Daily Advertiſer of the 27th of June. The writer (who is ſaid to be a member of the ſenate) likewiſe regards the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his introduction, as a perfect one; and after giving a gloſs to the general texture of the treaty, he aſcribes the obnoxious principle of the twelfth article,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029752_0092_0FE24BBCB8100918"/>
                  <hi>to an error which, it appears, has been inadvertently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</hi> An error inadvertently introduced into an inſtrument, which was under the conſideration of the chief juſtice of the United States, and the Britiſh miniſter, for a term of eight months! and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced too, into a part of that very article, which is made the ſole foundation of the whole commercial ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure!! Whenever the twelfth article ceaſes, the treaty declares, every other article, except the ten firſt articles, ſhall alſo ceaſe! But the author of that ſketch proceeds one ſtep further—he ſays, "that <hi>every cauſe of offence or colliſion</hi> towards the French, ſeems to have heen ſtudiouſly avoided, in the progreſs of the negociation;" for "no article of the treaty <hi>claſhes in the ſmalleſt degree,</hi> with the obligations and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contracted with that gallant nation!" Let the treaty, ſpeak for itſelf—it is more to be hoped than expected, that the voice of France ſhould not likewiſe be heard in opposition to ſo bold an aſſertion.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The ſecond article provides for the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts in June, 1796; but it ſtipulates, that in the mean time the citizens of the United States ſhall not ſettle within the precincts and juriſdiction of thoſe poſts; that the Britiſh ſettlers there ſhall hold and enjoy all their property of every kind, real and perſonal; and that when the poſts are ſurrendered, ſuch ſettlers ſhall have an election either to remain Britiſh ſubjects, or to become American citizens. Query—Were not the weſtern poſts, and all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts and juriſdiction, the abſolute property of the United States by the treaty of peace? Query—What equivalent is given for this ceſſion of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the United States to a foreign power? Query—How far do the precincts and juriſdiction of the poſts extend? Query—Does not the treaty give an implied aſſent to major Campbell's claim, by adopting its language, as far as the falls of the Miami, and to

               <p n="3">3. The third article likewiſe opens an amicable intercourſe on the lakes; but excludes us from their ſea-ports, and the limits of the Hudſon's bay company; and excludes them from navigating our Atlantic rivers, higher than the higheſt port of entry in each. Query—What are the limits of the Hudſon's bay company? Query—What equivalent do the United States obtain for the general freedom of navigation, portage and paſſage? For it muſt be remembered, that the Britiſh rivers penetrate the heart of the country, but of thoſe we can take no advantage; while Great Britain is in fact admitted to all the advantages of which our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic rivers are ſuſceptible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſixth and ſeventh articles provide for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying every demand which Great Britain has been able, at any time, to make againſt the United States (the payment of the Britiſh debts due before the war, and the indemnification for veſſels captured within our territorial juriſdiction) but the proviſion made for the American claims upon Great Britain, is not equally explicit or efficient in its terms, nor is it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extenſive with the object.—Query—Why is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the negroes, carried off by the Britiſh troops, ſuppreſſed, waved, or abandoned?

The tenth article declares that neither party ſhall ſequeſter or confiſcate the debts or property in the funds, &amp;c. belonging to the citizens of the other, in caſe of a war, or of national differences. Great Britain has fleets and armies; America has none. Query—Does not this, ſupported by other proviſions, which forbid our changing the commercial ſituation of Great Britain, or impoſing higher duties on her than on other nations, deprive the United States of her beſt means of retaliation and coercion? Query—Is it not taking from America her only weapon of defence; but from Great Britain the leaſt of two weapons which ſhe poſſeſſes? What is the relative proportion held by the citizens of the contracting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpectively in the funds, &amp;c. of each other?</p>
               <p n="7">7. The twelfth article opens to our veſſels, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſeventy tons, an intercourſe with the Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands, during the Preſent war, and for two years after: but it prohibits our exporting from the United States, melaſſes, ſugar, cocoa, coffee, or cotton, to any part of the world, whether thoſe articles are brought from Britiſh, French, or Spaniſh iſlands, or even raiſed (as cotton is) within our own territory.—Query—Are veſſels of ſeventy tons equal to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the moſt beneficial part of our trade with the Weſt-Indies, the tranſportation of lumber, &amp;c.?

of the privilege for more than two years after the war, depends on the ſituation in which his majeſty of Great Britain ſhall then find himſelf in relation to the iſlands) enjoy a greater privilege under the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary proclamations of the colonial governors than this article admits? Query—Have not the articles, which we are prohibited from exporting, formed of late a valuable part of our trade? Is not cocoa chiefly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by the Spaniards? Is not cotton a ſtaple of America? Is our own conſumption equal to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, or growth of the prohibited articles? Will not the want of a vent for any ſurplus quantity, affect the other branches of our commerce, diminiſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ſhip building, and injure our agriculture? If we are now thrown out of this branch of the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade, ſhall we be ever able to recover it? and, in ſhort, will not the loſs be of laſting detriment to all our maritime exertions?</p>

The thirteenth article admits us to trade in the Britiſh ſettlements in the Eaſt Indies: but it excludes us from any ſhare in the coaſting trade of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; it forbids our penetrating the interior of the country, or holding an intercourſe with the natives, unleſs under a licenſe from the local Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it compels us to land all the articles that are there ſhipped, in the United State. Is not China the independent territory of the emperor? Is not Canton an open port, acceſſible to all nations? Do we not obtain there, and at independent places in the Eaſt Indies with which we have, at preſent, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted communication, tea, porcelain, nankeens, ſilk, &amp;c. upon the principles of a free trade? Does not a very advantageous part of the trade in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe, conſiſt in the exchange of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and manufactures of the Eaſt Indies for thoſe of China, and <hi>vice verſa?</hi> Do not our importations of Eaſt India goods far exceed our conſumption? Is not the trade which we carry on with thoſe goods in Europe, highly beneficial? Are not ſugar and coffee
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029752_0097_0FE2537015C29268"/>
a part of our importations, from India, and does not the 12th article prohibit our re-exporting them? Does our trade to Europe, founded on the previous intercourſe with India, depend on the Britiſh licenſe; and can it be maintained under the diſadvantage of a double voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? Are we not every voyage making favourable impreſſions on the natives of China? Do we not participate at preſent in the carrying trade of that country? Does not our intereſt in it increaſe rapidly?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſeveral articles that regulate the rights and privileges of the contracting parties within their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective territories, in caſe either of them is engaged in a war, may ceaſe in two years after the preſent war is terminated, and cannot be protracted beyond twelve years. Query—Are not all theſe advantages, in effect, <hi>excluſively favourable to Great Britain,</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal maritime power of Europe; often engaged in wars; and intereſted to obtain for her ſhips, her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and herſelf, the ports and ſupplies of this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive continent?</p>
               <p>Is it probable that during the longeſt poſſible exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this treaty (twelve years) America will be engaged in maritime wars, will want Engliſh ports as a refuge for men of war, or as a retreat for prizes? Or that it will, during that period, be of importance to her objects, to prevent her enemies from arming in Engliſh ports, or ſelling their prizes there?</p>
               <p n="10">10. The twenty-ſecond article provides for ſhips of war being hoſpitably treated in the ports of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective contracting parties; and that officers ſhall be treated with the reſpect that is due to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which they bear? Query—Could not the principle of reciprocity, as well as humanity, ſuggeſt to Mr. Jay, that ſome proviſion ſhould be made to protect our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen ſailors from the fangs of Britiſh preſs gangs in England; and from the horrors of their priſon ſhips in the Weſt Indies? Were the commiſſions of his Britannic majeſty of more regard than the liberties of American freemen? Or, was it unknown that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029752_0098_0FE25371A555C128"/>
of our ſailors have been occaſionally enſlaved by the impreſs tyranny of the Britiſh government? Or that thouſands have loſt their lives in noxious priſons, while their veſſels were carried into Britiſh ports for "LEGAL ADJUDICATION?"</p>
               <p n="11">11. The fourteenth article provides for a perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of commerce and navigation, and for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of traders; but ſubject always to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries reſpectively: Query—Are not the laws and ſtatutes of England in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more rigid on the ſubjects of this article, than the laws and ſtatutes of America?</p>

The diſcuſſions, during the ſeſſion of congreſs, in which Mr. Jay's miſſion was projected, evinced the exiſtence of two parties, upon the queſtion whether it was more our intereſt to be allied with the republic of France, than with the monarchy of Great Britain. Query—Does not the general complexion of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty decide the queſtion in favor of the alliance with Great Britain? Query—Whether that complexion does not manifeſtly ariſe from the proviſions, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a Britiſh colony within our territory in the neighbourhood of the weſtern poſts; for admitting the whole Britiſh nation without an equivalent into a participation of our territory on the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi; for naturalizing all the holders of lands; for opening a general intercourſe with their traders on the lakes in the interior of our country, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering (as it is idly ſaid) the local advantages of each party common to both; for regulating the external trade of the two nations with each other; for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting citizens to be puniſhed as pirates, who take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, &amp;c. from a belligerent power adverſe to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contracting party; for fettering the operations of our treaty with France; for ſurrendering criminals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

The meaſures propoſed by one party to retaliate the injuries offered by Great Britain to our territorial, commercial and political rights, were oppoſed by the other, preciſely as the treaty oppoſes them. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:—</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Mr. Madiſon projects a regulation of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Great Britain, by which the hoſtile ſpirit of that nation might be controuled on the footing of its intereſt. The treaty legitimiſes the oppoſition which was given to the meaſure in congreſs, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in article fifteen, "that no other or higher du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be paid by the ſhips or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid by the like veſſels or merchandize of all other nations; nor ſhall any other or higher duty be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one country on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce, or manufactures of the other, than are or ſhall be payable on the importation of the like articles of the growth, &amp;c. of any foreign country.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Mr. Clarke propoſes to manifeſt and enforce the public reſentment by prohibiting all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two nations. The treaty deſtroys the very right to attempt that ſpecies of national denunciation, by declaring in the ſame article, that "no prohibition ſhall be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties reſpectively, which ſhall not equally extend to all other nations."</item>
                  <item>(3.) But Mr. Dayton moves, and the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives ſupport his motion, for the ſequeſtration of Britiſh debts, &amp;c. to enſure a fund for paying the ſpoliations committed on our trade. The treaty (without regarding the reſpect due to the commiſſion which is borne by our members of congreſs) not only deſpoils the government of this important inſtrument to coerce a powerful, yet intereſted adverſary into acts of juſtice, but enters likewiſe into a commentary, which, conſidering the conduct of one of the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of our legiſlature, Lord Grenville, conſiſtently with

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>es nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war or national difference, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated, <hi>it being unjuſt and impolitic,</hi> that debts and engagements contracted and made by individuals having confidence in each other and in their reſpective governments, ſhould ever be deſtroyed or impaired by national au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on account of national differences and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents." The terms are very ſimilar to thoſe that gave Mr. Dayton offence in a ſpeech pronounced by Mr. Ames; and certainly it will be deemed no mitigation, that the charge of committing "<hi>an unjuſt and impolitic</hi> act," has been wantonly engrafted upon the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn of all inſtruments,—a public treaty! Query:—Would Lord Grenville have conſented to brand his Royal Maſter with the title of <hi>Great Sea Robber,</hi> if Mr. Jay's urbanity could have permitted him to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the epithet from another member of congreſs, in order to inſert it, in the article that relates to the Britiſh ſpoliations on our trade? But perhaps, Mr. Jay forgot, that the commentary operated as a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the government of the United States, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant it as a reproach to Great Britain, for ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering during the late war, and retaining at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the property belonging to Maryland, lying in the bank of England. It might, likewiſe, be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſatire upon the parliamentary ſequeſtration of French property in the famous "Intercourſe Act:" or, perhaps, Mr. Jay anticipated the revolution in Holland, and deſigned his commentary as a warning againſt the ſeizing of Dutch property, public and private; which, however, has ſince taken place, in ſpite of his ſolemn admonition.</item>

The trials that had occurred relative to the equipment of French privateers in our ports; and the enliſtment of our citizens in the ſervice of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, had produced ſome embarraſſment in the courſe of party purſuits. Theſe are obviated by the treaty. The Britiſh nation by which the empreſs of Ruſſia has always been ſupplied with naval officers, and whoſe fleets and armies are always crowded with volunteers from other nations, conſents that her ſubjects ſhall not ſerve againſt us; and ſtipulates that our citizens ſhall not ſerve againſt her. This contract is made with a power actually engaged in a war; and ſeldom more than ſeven years clear of one; by a power at peace, not liable, from her local poſition, and political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to be involved in war, and in ſtrict alliance with the nation againſt whom the ſtipulation will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately operate. Captain Barney and the other Americans, who have joined the arms of France, are thus involved in the moſt ſerious dilemma. If they expatriate themſelves, they may poſſibly eſcape the vengeance of the American government; but will that ſave them from the vengeance of Great Britain, whoſe conceſſions on the doctrine of expatriation are not quite ſo liberal? By the bye, it may here be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably repeated, that while Mr. Jay was ſo willing to prevent American citizens from <hi>entering</hi> into the ſervice of France, he might ſurely have taken ſome pains to ſecure them from being <hi>preſſed</hi> into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of England. He would have found, on enquiry, that the inſtances of the latter kind are infinitely more numerous than of the former. But it is enough that the meaſure will be introductory of a law, favourable to the view of a party which reprobates every idea of aſſiſting the French, and cultivates every means of conciliating the Britiſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It has, likewiſe, been thought by ſome politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the energies of our executive department re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire every aid that can be given to them, in order more effectually to reſiſt and controul the popular
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029752_0102_0FE25380DF9B56D0"/>
branches of the government. Hence we find the treaty-making power employed in that ſervice; and congreſs cannot exerciſe a legiſlative diſcretion on the prohibited points (though it did not participate in making the ceſſion of its authority) without a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of war againſt Great Britain. George the third enjoys by the treaty a more complete negative to bind us as ſtates, than he ever claimed over us as colonies.</p>

               <head>V. The Treaty is a violation of the general principles of neutrality, and is in colliſion with the poſitive previous engagements which ſubſiſt between America and France.</head>
               <p n="1">1. It is a general principle of the law of nations, that during the exiſtence of a war, neutral powers ſhall not, by favor or by treaty, ſo alter the ſituation of one of the belligerent parties, as to enable him more advantageouſly to proſecute hoſtilities againſt his adverſary. If, likewiſe, a neutral power ſhall refuſe or evade treating with one of the parties, but eagerly enter into a treaty with the other, it is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, that amounts to a breach of neutrality. Theſe poſitions may be ſupported by the authority of the moſt eſteemed writers on the ſubject; but it will be ſufficient in the preſent caſe, to cite the conduct of Great Britain herſelf. Thus, it has been adjudged by Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> "that if a neutral ſhip trades to a French colony, with all the privileges of a French ſhip, <hi>and is thus adopted and naturalized,</hi> it muſt be looked upon as a French ſhip, liable to be taken." See <hi>Judge Blackſtone's reports,</hi> I <hi>vol. p.</hi> 315, 314. According to the principle on which this judgment was given, the act of iſſuing the memorable orders of the 6th of November, 1793, and the conſequent ſeizure of all our veſſels, are attempted to be juſtified. Great Britain alleges (when it is injurious to France) that trading with the French iſlands, <hi>on a ſooting not allowed before the war,</hi> is a breach of neutrality, and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029752_0103_0FE253826CECCB20"/>
cauſe of confiſcation: and, therefore, Great Britain muſt alſo admit, at leaſt America will not deny, that trading with the Britiſh iſlands, on a footing not allowed before the war; or, in different words, altering and enlarging the commercial relations of the two countries, is equally a breach of our neutrality towards France. When the, ſword is found to cut both ways, the party who uſes it has no right to complain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we have on the one hand, evaded the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a treaty with France, and on the other hand, ſolicited a treaty from Great Britain, are facts public and notorious. Let us enquire then what Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has gained on the occaſion, to enable her more advantageouſly to proſecute her hoſtilities againſt France.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Great Britain has gained time.</hi> As nothing is ſettled by the treaty, ſhe has it in her power to turn all the chances of the war in her favor; and, in the interim, being relieved from the odium and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of adding America to her enemies, the current of her operations againſt France is undivided, and will of courſe flow with greater vigor and certainty. We have been for ſo many years ſatisfied with <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the treaty of peace,</hi> that Great Britain has cauſe to expect at leaſt an equal period of credit, for <hi>the promiſes of the treaty of amity.</hi> If, indeed, it is true, that the reaſons aſſigned by lord Grenville to Mr. Jay, for declining an immediate ſurrender of the poſts, were, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Britiſh traders might have time to arrange their out-ſtanding buſineſs; <hi>a privilege that is expreſsly granted by the treaty,</hi> and could not, therefore, furniſh a real excuſe for delay; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the Britiſh government might be able to aſcertain what would be the probable effect of the ſurrender, on the Indians; <hi>a reſervation that demonſtrates an intention to be governed by events;</hi> we can very well account for the late extenſive ſhipment of artillery and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Canada; and may eaſily calculate the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029752_0104_0FE2538E912B2C10"/>
of <hi>gaining time,</hi> in order to promote the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, as well as European, objects of Great Britain.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Great Britain gains ſupplies for her Weſt India colonies;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for a period almoſt limited to the continuance of the war, under circumſtances which incapacitate her from furniſhing the colonial ſupplies herſelf; and, indeed, compel her to invite the aid of all nations, in furniſhing proviſions for her own domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſupport. The ſupplies may be carried to the iſlands either in <hi>American</hi> bottoms <hi>not exceeding ſeventy tons,</hi> or in <hi>Britiſh</hi> bottoms of <hi>any tonnage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Great Britain gains an advantage over France, by prohibiting the exportation of ſugar, &amp;c.</hi> in conſequence of which the colonies of France muſt, in a great meaſure, remain unſupplied with proviſions, &amp;c. as they can only in general pay for them in thoſe articles, <hi>whoſe uſe is confined to the American conſumption.</hi> It will be remembered, that the produce of the French iſlands has of late conſtituted a great part of our European remittances. If, therefore, that trade is cut off, and at the ſame time, beſides employing <hi>our own ſmall craft</hi> of ſeventy tons, Great Britain is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, <hi>to any extent of tonnage,</hi> to be our Weſt India factor, it is obvious that our conſumption of ſugar, coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. will be abundantly ſupplied, without maintaining an intercourſe with the French, or even with the Eaſt Indies, to procure any of thoſe articles. Perhaps this method, though leſs bold, will be more effectual to prevent our furniſhing the French iſlands with proviſion, than declaring them to be in a ſtate of blockade, and ſeizing the veſſels that attempt to viſit them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>It is another important gain to Great Britain</hi> (which might, likewiſe, have been adverted to under the feature of reciprocity) <hi>that, to any extent of ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, her veſſels may carry on the Weſt India trade for us,</hi> either to ſupply our domeſtic conſumption, or European engagements, <hi>ſubject to no other or higher duties than our own veſſels,</hi> while our own veſſels are
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029752_0105_0FE253901F5A0810"/>
reſtricted to a pitiful ſize, and circumſcribed to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular voyage. But whatever may be thought of the benefit in acquiring for America even this ſcanty participation in the Weſt India trade, no one (after the rejection of the twelfth article) will deny that the whole meaſure changes the relative ſituation of the two countries, avowedly in favor of Great Britain, and operatively injurious to France; and every ſuch change is derogatory to our boaſted neutral character.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>The admiſſion of Great Britain to all the commercial advantages of the moſt favored nation, and the reſtraints impoſed upon our legiſlative independence,</hi> as ſtated in the <hi>party feature</hi> of the treaty, are proofs of predilection and partiality in the American government, which cannot fail to improve the reſources of Great Britain, and to impair the intereſts, as well as the attachments, of France.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>The aſſent to the ſeizure of all proviſion-ſhips,</hi> and that, in effect, upon any pretext, at a period when Great Britain is diſtreſſed for proviſions, as well as France; and when the ſyſtem of <hi>ſubduing by famine</hi> has been adopted by the former againſt the latter nation, is clearly changing our poſition, as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent republic, in a manner detrimental to our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ally. That our merchants will be paid a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable profit for their cargoes, &amp;c. may render the meaſure more palatable to us; even under the loſs of the return cargo, the derangement of the voyage, and the deſtruction of the ſpirit of commercial enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but that conſideration cannot render it leſs offenſive to France. It may properly be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that Sweden and Denmark have obtained, by a ſpirited reſiſtance, an actual indemnification for the ſeizures which have heretofore taken place, and an exemption from all ſuch outrages in future; while America has only put thoſe which are paſt, <hi>in a train of negociation,</hi> and has given a <hi>legitimate effect</hi> to thoſe which are to come The order, which the Engliſh gazettes ſay, has recently been iſſued for ſeizing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029752_0106_0FE25391AE75C0C8"/>
American proviſion-ſhips, on their paſſage to France, ought not, therefore, to be complained of, as it is merely an exerciſe, by anticipation, of the right granted by the treaty.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) <hi>Great Britain has gained the right of preventing our Citizens from being volunteers in the armies or ſhips of France!</hi> This is not ſimply the grant of a new right to Great Britain, but is, at the ſame time, a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deprivation of a benefit, hitherto enjoyed by France. Neither the laws of nations, nor our muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal conſtitution and laws, prohibited our citizens from <hi>going to another country,</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> either for the ſake of honour, reward, or inſtruction, ſerving in a foreign navy, or army:—Colonel <hi>Oſwald</hi> and many others have done it:—Captain <hi>Barney</hi> and many others are doing it. But a proclamation muſt iſſue to recall all ſuch volunteers, and puniſhment muſt follow diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, if the twenty-firſt article of the treaty is to be effectuated, as the ſupreme law of the land.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Great Britain has gained a right to treat and puniſh as pirates, any of our citizens who ſhall accept, even while they are in France, any commiſſion</hi> to arm a privateer, or letter of marque. It is true, that a ſimilar proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contained in other treaties; but we are now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering <hi>the alterations</hi> which are made by the treaty under diſcuſſion, in favor of Great Britain, and injurious to France. How far there exiſts a power to define piracy, <hi>by treaty,</hi> will be remarked in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neating another feature of Mr. Jay's diplomatic off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) <hi>Great Britain has doubly gained, by obtaining in our ports, an aſylum for her ſhips of war, privateers, prizes, &amp;c. and ſtipulating for an excluſion of thoſe of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, other (it is admitted) than France.</hi> The twenty-fourth and twenty fifth articles of the projected trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are nearly copied from the ſubſiſting treaty with France. It would be curious, however, to reflect on the very different motives, which muſt juſtify (if the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029752_0107_0FE2539341EEE368"/>
idea of a juſtification could in the late inſtance be at all admiſſible) theſe analagous grants. The conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to France was made <hi>when we were at war, and ſhe was not;</hi> it was made upon a certainty of <hi>recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal advantage;</hi> and it was made <hi>as a price</hi> for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aid of <hi>that gallant nation</hi> in the eſtabliſhment of our independence. The conecſſion is made to Great Britain <hi>when ſhe is at war, and we are not;—without any rational proſpect of deriving any reciprocal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from it;</hi> and under ſuch circumſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and inſult, as might have admoniſhed us to <hi>reſerve it as the price for obtaining aid from other nations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting her hoſtilities,</hi> inſtead of paying it for ſmiles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection, and promiſes without ſincerity. When we were making treaties with Holland, Pruſſia, &amp;c. did we not expreſsly exclude them from ſuch import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and as we have already ſeriouſly experienced; ſuch dangerous privileges?</p>
               <p>But it will be aſked, perhaps, what mighty benefit has Great Britain gained in this caſe at the expenſe of France, ſince the prior ſimiler privileges of France are excluſive? <hi>Anſwer:</hi>—That as the privilege of Great Britain will operate againſt every other nation, it will immediately affect the French republic's alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, offenſive and defenſive, with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which preceded the ratification, at leaſt, of the treaty: and it may eventually have the ſame perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence in relation to Pruſſia, Spain and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, whoſe diſpoſition to change ſides, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war, has been unequivocally expreſſed. Thus, though Holland and Pruſſia made treaties with us long before Great Britain would admit the idoa of a negociation, and though Spain and Portugal are the only cuſtomers, who furniſh us with a ready money balance, for the very purpoſe of paying our annual accumulation of debt to Britain, the harbours of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica are open to their veſſels <hi>as prizes,</hi> but ſhut to them as <hi>friends:</hi> They may be brought hither and ſold by their enemies; but if they have captured
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029752_0108_0FE2539E5851E420"/>
their enemy, all, but common neceſſaries, ſhall be denied to them! The habits, bias, and opinions of a people, ought not to be altogether diſregarded is making a treaty. What honeſt, feeling American, could patiently ſee an Engliſhman, <hi>our ſunſhine ally,</hi> bringing into our ports <hi>as prizes,</hi> the ſhips of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>our ally in the times that tried men's ſouls;</hi>—a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, indiſſolubly united with France,—that earlieſt, lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, beſt of friends? What honeſt, feeling American, even ſubmitting to a ſcene ſo painful, would willingly aſſiſt in expelling from our ports the ſhips of Holland, <hi>which had merely retaliated,</hi> by the capture of their foe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But it is time to advert to <hi>the caſes colliſion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two treaties; and theſe are of ſuch in nature as to produce a violation of the ſpirit, though not a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive violation of the words of the previous engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſubſiſt between France and America—They are <hi>cauſes of offence, and claſh in the higheſt degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>By the ninth article of the treaty of alliance with France, we guarantee the poſſeſſions of that nation in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> It is true, that our ſituation is ſuch as to incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and of courſe to excuſe us from a <hi>direct</hi> fulfilment of this guarantee; but it is equally true, that we violate our faith, whenever we do any thing that will, either directly or indirectly, endanger thoſe poſſeſſions.—Query—Whether facilitating the means of ſupplying the Britiſh forces in the Weſt Indies will not be the effect of the arrangements relative to the trade with the Britiſh iſlands? Query—Whether reſtraining our intercourſe with the French iſlands, as a conſequence of the treaty already predicated, will not expoſe them to want, and of courſe to the neceſſity of yielding to their enemies? Does not every ſuch advantage giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Great Britain, <hi>claſh</hi> with our engagements to France?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) By our treaty with France, and indeed with ſeveral other nations, <hi>it is expreſsly ſtipulated, that free
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029752_0109_0FE253A1D3F7CD18"/>veſſels</hi> ſhall <hi>make free goods.</hi> At the time of entering into the ſtipulation, and even at this moment, the maritime ſtrength of France (always ſuperior to that of Denmark and Sweden, which has, under ſimilar circumſtances, been ſucceſsful) could command the reſpect of the world for her engagements. It is true America neither was, nor is, in a ſituation to produce the ſame complaiſance; and on the ground of that weakneſs, France has hitherto candidly diſpenſed with a ſtrict performance of the treaty. But though Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica cannot <hi>enforce,</hi> ſhe ought not to <hi>abandon</hi> her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements: ſhe may ſubmit to imperious neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but <hi>ſhe cannot voluntarily bring into queſtion</hi> the right of protecting, as a neutral power, the property of France; while France is not only ready and able to afford her property the ſtipulated protection, but in conformity to the ſtipulation, actually <hi>allows the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Great Britain to paſs free, under the ſanction of the American flag.</hi> When, therefore, the treaty with Great Britain <hi>agrees,</hi> that within two years after the termination of the exiſting war, <hi>it ſhall be diſcuſſed</hi> "whether in any, and what caſes, neutral veſſels ſhall protect enemies' property"—<hi>does it not claſh with our previous promiſe to France, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods?</hi> And when the treaty with Great Britain, in formal and explicit terms, <hi>further agrees,</hi> "that in all caſes where veſſels ſhall be captured or detained, on ſuſpicion of having on board enemies' property, &amp;c. <hi>the part which belongs to the enemy ſhall be made prize</hi> "—Is not this <hi>an evident colliſion with our previous agreement with France,</hi> and with the ſecurity which Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty enjoys in conſequence of it? While France ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to her treaty, by permitting <hi>Britiſh goods</hi> to be protected by American bottoms, is it honeſt, honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or conſiſtent, on our part, <hi>to enter voluntarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compact with the enemies of France,</hi> for permitting them to take <hi>French goods</hi> out of our veſſels? We may not be able <hi>to prevent,</hi> but ought we to <hi>agree</hi> to the proceeding? Let the queſtion be repeated—Does
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029752_0110_0FE253A361F373B8"/>
not ſuch an <hi>expreſs agreement</hi> claſh with our expreſs, as well as implied, obligations to France?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) By enumerating, as contraband articles, in the treaty with Great Britain, certain articles which are declared free in the treaty with France, <hi>we may, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the latter, ſupply Great Britain; but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the former, we cannot ſupply France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>our treaty with France</hi> (and indeed, every treaty which we have) expreſsly declares, that, "in general all proviſione which ſerve for the nouriſhment of mankind and the ſuſtenance of life; furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, ſail cloths, anchors and any parts of anchors, alſo ſhips, maſts, planks, boards and beams of what trees ſoever; and all other things proper either for building, or repairing ſhips, and all other goods what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which have not been worked into the form of any inſtrument for war, by land or by ſea, <hi>ſhall not be reputed contraband."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The treaty with Great Britain</hi> expreſsly declares, "that timber for ſhip building, tar or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, unwrought iron, and fir planks only excepted, <hi>ſhall be objects of confiſcation, whenever they are attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be carried to an enemy."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this ſtipulation can be conſidered as founded on a principle of <hi>reciprocity,</hi> ſince the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles declared to be contraband are <hi>among our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal exports,</hi> but <hi>among the principal imports of Great Britain,</hi> might have been adverted to, in tracing a former feature of the treaty; but let it be now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly anſwered, whether it is not <hi>in colliſion</hi> with our previous engagements with France? The <hi>right</hi> to make ſuch a ſtipulation, is not, at preſent, controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but only the aſſertion, that <hi>exerciſing the right does not claſh in any degree</hi> with the terms and ſpirit of the French treaty. France exempts thoſe important materials of our commerce from confiſcation, in favor
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029752_0111_0FE253A4F08FB788"/>
of all the world: Great Britain condemns them to confiſcation whenever they ſhall be carried to her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and the compact is made, while France is one of her enemies!!</p>

               <head>VI. The Treaty with Great Britain is calculated to injure the United States, in the friendſhip and favor of other foreign nations.</head>
               <p n="1">1. That the friendſhip and favor of France will be affected by the formation of ſo heterogeneous an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with her moſt implacable enemy, cannot be doubted, if we reaſon upon any ſcale applicable to the policy of nations, or the paſſions of man. From that republic, therefore, if not an explicit renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all connection with the United States, we may at leaſt expect an alteration of conduct: and finding the ſucceſs which has flowed from the hoſtile treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Great Britain has ſhown towards us, ſhe may be, at length, tempted to endeavor at <hi>extorting from fear,</hi> what ſhe has not been able to obtain <hi>from affection.</hi> She will, probably, declare Great Britain in a ſtate of blockade, for the purpoſe of ſeizing our veſſels in Europe; and ſhe may inſtitute courts for "legal adjudication," in order to confiſcate our veſſels in the Weſt Indies. <hi>Great Britain will then chuckle at the ſcene.</hi> No one can doubt that our embarraſſments will gratify, not only the avowed objects, but the latent reſentments, of that nation. Even if ſhe could obliterate the memory of our revolution, ſhe cannot, with pleaſure, behold the ſucceſsful experiment of a republican ſyſtem of government; nor the rapid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of a commercial competitor. The moment ſhe has produced a quarrel between America and France, ſhe may exclaim, <hi>"Delenda eſt Carthago!"</hi> America is again a colony! How different were the intereſts and diſpoſitions of our tried friend! That our government ſhould preſerve its purity and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence—that our commerce and agriculture ſhould

attain their zenith—were views <hi>once</hi> congenial with the policy and affections of the French nation: Heart, head, and hand, ſhe would have joined in promoting them, againſt the arts and enmities of all the reſt of the world! What a change, then, have we made!</p>

During the war, we, likewiſe, formed a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſerviceable treaty with the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; and, ſhortly after the war, treaties were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with Sweden, Pruſſia, &amp;c. But in order to avoid <hi>even the appearance of claſhing or colliſion</hi> with the French treaty, the powers, thus early in courting our alliance, were not allowed thoſe privileges of aſylum for themſelves, and of excluding their enemies from our ports, which are conceded in the projected treaty to Great Britain. Have thoſe nations no cauſe for jealouſy and reproach? What principle of policy or juſtice can vindicate the partiality and predilection, that has been thus ſhown?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the projected treaty (after an affected recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or pre-exiſting public treaties) declares, that while Great Britain and America continue in amity, no future treaty ſhall be made, inconſiſtent with the articles, that grant the high and dangerous privileges, that have been mentioned. Every nation of the earth (except France) is thus ſacrificed to the pride and intereſt of Great Britain. And with what motive, or upon what conſideration, is the ſacrifice made? It has been ſtated in a former, and will be more fully ſhewn in a future, feature of Mr. Jay's treaty, that the United States do not enjoy any equivalent for this, nor for any other, conceſſion which is made to Great Britain: But the miſchief does not end with the folly of a lop-ſided bargain. By granting theſe excluſive privileges to Great Britain, by declaring that no commercial favor ſhall be conferred on other
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029752_0113_0FE253B0D7830718"/>
nations, without her participating in them, we have thrown away the ſureſt means of purchaſing, on any emergency, the good will and good offices of any other power: We cannot even improve the terms of our old treaty with France. For all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of trade that Spain, Portugal, Holland, &amp;c. might, and probably would, upon a liberal footing of reciprocity, have given us,—what have we now left, to offer as the baſis of negociation and compact?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The alteration which the treaty makes in the relative ſituation of ſeveral nations with America, and the conduct, that is likely to be purſued by thoſe nations, in order to counteract its effect, merit ſerious reflection. Will Spain ſee, without ſome ſolicitude, the partition which we have made with Great Britain, of our territory on the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſipi? How would our projected treaty work, if France ſhould recover Pondicherry, &amp;c. in the Eaſt Indies; ſhould ſubdue and retain the Weſt India iſlands; ſhould ſtipulate with Spain for the ceſſion of Louiſiana; and ſhould conquer Nova Scotia? The curious <hi>cordon,</hi> with which we have allowed Great Britain to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us (and of which more will be ſaid hereafter) being thus broken, how are we to calculate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſidering the Indians as a foreign nation, is not the treaty calculated to exalt the character of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to depreciate the character of America, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſavage world? What right has Great Britain to negociate for Indians, within the limits of our juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Suppoſe the exiſting weſtern poſts ſurrendered, may not Great Britain eſtabliſh other poſts in a contiguous or more advantageous ſtation? Is ſhe not left at liberty to purſue the fur trade in our territory as well as her own? Will not her enterprize in traffic, ſuperior capital and experience, enable her to monopolize that trade? And will ſhe not in future have the ſame motives, and the ſame means, to foment Indian hoſtilities, that have hitherto been indulged and employed, at the expenſe of ſo much American blood and treaſure?</p>

               <head>VII. The Treaty with Great Britain is impolitic and pernicious, in reſpect to the domeſtic intereſts and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the United States.</head>
               <p n="1">1. If it is true, and incontrovertibly it is true, that the <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of America, conſiſt (as our patriotic preſident, in his letter to Lord <hi>Buchan,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares) <q>in being little heard of in the great world of politics; in having nothing to do in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intrigues, or the ſquabbles of European nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but, on the contrary, in exchanging commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and living in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; and in doing juſtice to, and in receiving it from, every power we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with;</q> it is likewiſe manifeſt, that all the wiſdom and energy of thoſe who adminiſter our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould be conſtantly and ſedulouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve, or to attain, for the United States, that enviable rank among nations. To <hi>refrain from forming haſty and unequal alliances;</hi> to let commerce flow in its own natural channels; to afford every man, whether alien or citizen, a remedy for every wrong; and to reſiſt, on the firſt appearance, every violation of our national rights and independence, are the means beſt adapted to the end which we contemplate. It may be objected, that we are already involved in ſome alliances, that have had a tendency rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our public tranquility, than to promote our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt. But a difference of circumſtances will require and juſtify a difference of conduct. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—it was neceſſary and politic, in the ſtate of our affairs at the commencement of the revolution, to pay a premium for the friendſhip and alliance of France: we could not have inſured ſucceſs without the co-operation of that nation: and as <hi>the price</hi> that we paid for it was not greater than <hi>the benefit</hi> that we derived from it, we cannot now, with juſtice, cavil at our bargain.

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029752_0115_0FE253B3FA53EA50"/>
with Great Britain of a nature equally moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Is the advantage flowing from the ſacrifices that are made, equally compenſatory? Why ſhould we, at this auſpicious ſeaſon of our affairs, venture to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the fundamental maxim of our domeſtic hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, <hi>by wilfully obtruding on the great world of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; or wantonly involving ourſelves in the political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and the ſquabbles of European nations?</hi> Suppoſe (as it is often alleged and ſometimes proved) that our treaty with France is productive of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; will it happen in the political, any more than in the phyſical or moral world, that by multiplying the ſources of evil, we ſhall get rid of the evil itſelf? If, according to the <hi>quondam</hi> opinion of the friends of a Britiſh alliance, our commerce has been reſtrained in its operations; or if our government has been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced in its peace and ſtability, by a practical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velopement of <hi>the terms</hi> of our treaty with France, ſhall we better our ſituation, becauſe we make <hi>another</hi> treaty <hi>upon the ſame terms</hi> with Great Britain; and furniſh <hi>two</hi> nations, inſtead of <hi>one,</hi> with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to perplex and diſtreſs us in purſuing our natural and laudable policy—<hi>the policy of exchanging commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and living in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; doing juſtice to, and receiving it from, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power we are connected with!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But even if the queſtion was at large, and we were now <hi>under a neceſſity</hi> of deciding, for the firſt time, whether we would be allied to the monarchy of Great Britain, or to the republic of France, how would a rational eſtimate of <hi>the intereſts and happineſs</hi> of the United States (the true and only touchſtone for ſolving, <hi>in the mind of an American,</hi> ſuch an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) lead us to decide? To <hi>thoſe members of the ſenate,</hi> who could regard <hi>the twelfth article</hi> of the treaty <hi>as a mark of parental care and wiſdom, by which Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was fondly deſirous of reſtraining the exceſſes of our commercial ardor; exceſſes that might eventually and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely debilitate and deſtroy us!</hi> To <hi>thoſe members of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029752_0116_0FE253C008496DF0"/>
the ſenate,</hi> who could, with filial gratitude, declare, <hi>that an alliance with Great Britain was natural; that an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with France was artificial; ſince, although we were partially indebted to France for our independence, we were entirely indebted to Great Britain for our being!</hi> To all who can cheriſh ſuch ideas, or utter ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, theſe ſtrictures will be ungracious and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: but they claim a candid attention from <hi>the patriot,</hi> who remembers, that when <hi>the parent</hi> ſought to deſtroy, <hi>the friend</hi> interpoſed to ſave; and from the <hi>ſtateſman,</hi> who poſſeſſes too much wiſdom to be influenced by prejudice, and too much fortitude to be controuled by fear.</p>
               <p>Are the <hi>intereſts and happineſs</hi> of the United States involved in the permanent eſtabliſhment of a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government? Yes:—Then ſhe ought rather to cultivate the friendſhip of a republic, actuated by a fellow feeling; than the alliance of a monarchy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with jealouſy and apprehenſion. Are <hi>the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States connected with her territorial and political independence? Yes:—Then ſhe ought rather to fortify herſelf by an alliance with a nation, whoſe territorial juriſdiction, and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical characteriſtics, preclude the poſſibility of colliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; than attach herſelf to a nation whoſe language, manners and habits, facilitate the execution of every attempt to encroach; and whoſe territorial poſſeſſions are in an irritating and dangerous contact with our own. Are <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of America to be promoted by an active employment of the vaſt ſtore of <hi>materials of the firſt neceſſity,</hi> which nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on her; by the extenſion of her commerce; and by the freedom of her navigation? Yes:—Then ſhe ought rather to court the countenance and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a nation, whoſe occaſions of envy are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively few;—whoſe temptations are to foſter, not to counteract, our ſchemes of commercial opulence and enterprise:—and whoſe imperial glory and exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance do not depend upon a claim of univerſal mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029752_0117_0FE253C2150800B0"/>
ſuperiority;—rather than conſent to balk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the baneful ſhade of an alliance with a nation, whoſe very exiſtence is, probably, the tremendous ſtake in oppoſition to our proſperity: and whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, like the embraces of the tyrant's image, may be rendered the moſt effectual inſtruments of torture and deſtruction. Are <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States dependant on the cordiality of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the permanency of their government? And again—Do that cordiality and that permanency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the confidence and mutual good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which ſubſiſt between the people who form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the government, and the officers whom the people have appointed to adminiſter it? Yes:—Then it would be the part of duty, as well as policy, in thoſe officers to follow <hi>the unanimous ſentiment of the people,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a liberal and faithful alliance with France, to a conſtrained and hypocritical alliance with Great Britain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt ſtriking effect of the treaty, <hi>to endanger the intereſts, and diſturb the happineſs</hi> of the United States, may be detected by a geographical ſketch of the <hi>cordon, or line of circumvallation, with which it enables Great Britain to fetter and encloſe us.</hi> The proximity of Canada and the weſtern poſts, has here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been a cauſe of great uneaſineſs; but that is a trifling ſource of vexation, compared with what we ſhall have in future to encounter. Suppoſe ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>radii</hi> were drawn diverging from the centre of the United States; not one of them could eſcape the conventional circle of Britiſh territory, juriſdiction and occupancy. Has an American occaſion to travel to the eaſt or the north? <hi>The barriers of Nova Scotia and Canada</hi> preſent themſelves. Is it his wiſh to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the great weſtern wilderneſs? <hi>A new ſet of Britiſh poſts</hi> will intercept his progreſs, even if he ſhall be allowed peaceably to paſs <hi>the Britiſh colony</hi> within the precincts and juriſdiction of Detroit. Does buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs require him to croſs, or float down, the Miſſiſſippi?
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029752_0118_0FE253C3AA79FE30"/>
He may evade the vigilance of the Spaniard, but he will find the eaſtern bank of the river monopolized by Britiſh traders, and probably protected by Britiſh gun boats. He is in hopes, however, to avoid all difficulty by a paſſage on the ocean? Alas! our Atlantic har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are crowded with prizes to Britiſh privateers, and our ſea coaſt is lined with Britiſh cruiſers! Yet, let us for a moment imagine, that this ill fated traveller has ſurmounted his <hi>domeſtic</hi> obſtacles, whither can he fly, to be emancipated from the <hi>foreign</hi> juriſdiction of Great Britain? In the Weſt Indies, his <hi>cock boat</hi> is meaſured and ſteered, according to the ſcale and courſe preſcribed by the treaty. In the Eaſt Indies he can hardly exchange a commodity, or make a ſingle acquaintance, without the Britiſh licenſe. In Europe, if, during a Britiſh war, he carries goods belonging to an enemy of Great Britain, they will be ſeized as prize; if he takes ſhip-timber, tar, rozin, &amp;c. they are liable to be confiſcated as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband; and if his cargo conſiſts of proviſions, the Britiſh may take it, <hi>by treaty, at their own market price!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One idea more about the boundary of the United States. Before the revolution, Great Britain had projected that general arrangement and diviſion of her colonial poſſeſſions in America, which ſhe has ſince, upon a ſmaller ſcale, carried into execution with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Canada. The territory then intended to be allotted to the government of the Canadas, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a line running along the northern bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the eaſtern colonies, along the weſtern boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of Pennſylvania, and along the courſes of the Ohio, into the Miſſiſſippi. Since we are left at a loſs for a poſitive definition of <hi>the precincts and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the weſtern poſts, as ceded by the treaty to the ſettlers under Britiſh titles,</hi> may we not conjecture, that Great Britain contemplates the territorial extent of her original project? Does not major Campbell's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029752_0119_0FE253C53A0D9A50"/>
pretenſion, and the conſtant claim of the Indians, <hi>at the inſtigation of the Britiſh,</hi> to eſtabliſh the Ohio as a boundary between them and the United States, give ſome countenance to ſuch a conjecture?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſhould an American, not ſtimulated by the deſire of travelling into foreign countries, be content to proſecute the objects of his honeſt induſtry within the Britiſh territorial circle, bounding and conſtituting <hi>his own home,</hi> will his condition be much better than the condition of his itinerant fellow citizen? What with the eſtabliſhment of Britiſh colonies and Britiſh warehouſes; the naturalization of Britiſh land-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and, in ſhort, the <hi>unqualified admiſſion</hi> of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen, owing allegiance to the Britiſh crown, throughout our lakes, rivers and territory, while we are <hi>excluded</hi> from their ſea-ports, company lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. an American will hardly be able to find elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room for himſelf and his family. Their pecuniary capital being larger; their means being eaſier; their experience being greater; they moſt inevitably, under ſuch circumſtances, become our merchants, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, farmers, &amp;c. &amp;c. They will import for us, <hi>in their veſſels,</hi> all the products and fabrics of Europe, Aſia and Africa: They will export for us, <hi>in their veſſels,</hi> every article that our ſoil can furniſh; our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants will dwindle into clerks: our huſbandmen will degenerate into the condition of the feudal villienage; and thus, in a ſhort courſe of years, <hi>America will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably exhibit the aſtoniſhing ſpectacle of a country poſſeſſed, cultivated, and enjoyed by aliens!</hi> The ancient inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Great Britain, in a ſimilar manner, invited thoſe Saxons to their iſland as <hi>friends and allies,</hi> who ſoon afterwards became their <hi>conquerors and maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſuch a ſtate of things, <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States muſt languiſh and expire! At firſt the American mind will be corroded, by contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the elevation of <hi>the gueſt</hi> with the depreſſion of <hi>the hoſt.</hi> A ſtruggle will probably enſue; but the influence of wealth, and the patronage of extenſive
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029752_0120_0FE253D181B122D0"/>
commercial and manufactural inſtitutions, &amp;c. <hi>will even divide the Americans themſelves;</hi> and <hi>by dividing,</hi> capacitate the Britiſh ſettlers to rule them. Is this an idle phantom—a viſionary ſuggeſtion? No!. For. is not a great part of our trade, at this moment, mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized by Britiſh ſubjects, under <hi>the maſk</hi> of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizenſhip? Has not the influence of Britiſh credits, and Britiſh politics, already formed a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party in our government, and among our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants? Diſguiſe it as you will—let pride deny, and ſhame ſuppreſs the ſentiment—ſtill, it is too evident to every candid and diſcerning obſerver; that the only ſubſiſting difference in the opinions and conduct of the citizens of America, ariſes from this fatal cauſe. Why, at the moment of reprobating <hi>ſelf-created ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for civil purpoſes,</hi> do we gladly ſee the formation of <hi>ſelf-created ſocieties for military purpoſes;</hi>—the city cohorts and Praetorian bands? Why are our merchants, who ſo anxiouſly called forth the voice of their fellow citizens in applauding the proclamation of neutrality, ſo circumſpect and ſo torpid in giving their teſtimony about the treaty? How comes it, that amidſt the acclamations of the fourth of July, the treaty is <hi>toaſted</hi> in the little circle of Engliſh munufacturers, on the banks of the Paſſayik; and at the convivial ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Engliſh emigrants on the plains of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſee? How comes it that every man who prefers France to Great Britain—republicaniſm to monarchy,—is denominated <hi>Antifederaliſt Jacobin, Diſorganizer, Miſorea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let every honeſt American reflect ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably, upon the means of promoting <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States, and he will diſdain, as well as dread, to augment, by the adventitious force of treaties, that paramount intereſt, which Great Britain has already inſidiouſly acquired in our commerce, navigation, manufactures, territory, and government.</p>

Beſides the injury eventually to be apprehended from theſe cauſes, the treaty is calculated to impair <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an immediate and violent concuſſion in the federal atmoſphere. For,</p>
               <p>It ranſacks the archives of our revolutionary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions; and rejudges the ſolemn judgments of our courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>It condemns individuals to the payment of debts, from which they had previouſly been diſcharged by law.</p>
               <p>It makes the government of the union reſponſible for the contracts of private citizens, and the defalca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of bankrupts.</p>
               <p>It diſregards the freedom of our commerce and navigation; and it reſtrains the uſe of our ſtaple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> exact a juſt indemnification for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the weſtern poſts.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> require the payment, ſtipulated by the preceding treaty, <hi>for the value</hi> of the negroes carried off at the cloſe of the war.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> provide for the freedom and ſafety of our ſeamen, in their intercourſe with the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>Let any one of theſe propoſitions be ſeparately analyſed, and ſufficient cauſe will be found to excite and juſtify popular diſſatisfaction; but view them combined, and the mind is ſhocked with an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that <hi>the ratification of the treaty, may be the death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrant of the union!</hi>

So, likewiſe, without open aſſault or poſitive violence, the ſources of animal life may be poiſoned, by the imperceptible contaminations of a luxurious habit: ſo, without the aid of terror or force, the legitimate foundations of government may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by the inſidious encroachment of the rulers, and by the ſedative acquieſcence of the people. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, indeed, have too generally proved to be a kind of <hi>political chryſalis,</hi> paſſing, by progreſſive tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations, from the grub of pure democracy, to the butterfly of abſolute monarchy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But it will not <hi>yet</hi> be denied in America, that as the people have the ſole right to conſtitute their government, the rule of <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> requires, that the government ſhould be maintained, in practice as well as in theory, <hi>ſuch as they have conſtituted it.</hi> To render it, by any conſtruction of the written articles of our ſocial compact, <hi>other than a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> would be as fatal a ſubverſion, as daring uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or military conqueſt, could atchieve. For, what real difference does it make to a nation, whether its conſtitution is <hi>ſeized upon</hi> by an enterprizing indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, as in the Swediſh revolution of 1770; or <hi>overthrown</hi> by a triumphant warrior, as in the recent extinction of the Poliſh monarchy; or <hi>voted out of doors,</hi> as in the diſorganizing edicts of the long par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England? Thus, likewiſe, for one depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the government to aſſume the authority of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029752_0123_0FE253D636E592D8"/>
another; or, by conſtructive amplifications of its own juriſdiction, ſo to monopolize the attributes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as to render the other departments uſeleſs and inefficient, muſt ever be deemed an effectual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of any conſtitution. The mode of diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and organizing the powers of government, as well as the conſideration of the nature and extent of the powers to be delegated, eſſentially belongs to the people; and in the body politic, as well as in the body natural, whenever any particular member abſorbs more than its allotted portion of the aliment, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to vivify and invigorate the whole, debility and diſeaſe will infallibly eaſue. After the emperors had uſurped the functions, privileges and powers of the ſenate, and of the popular magiſtrates of Rome, they preſerved the formalities of the Commonwealth, but they trampled on the liberties of the people. Though the parliaments of France had long been deprived of every deliberative faculty, as the repreſentatives of the people, they were ſummoned to the laſt, as the miniſterial officers of the monarch, for the purpoſe of regiſtering his edicts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The government of the United States, being then theoretically a <hi>republican government,</hi> and with great propriety denominated <hi>a government of departments,</hi> let us proceed to examine how far <hi>the principles of ſelf-preſervation,</hi> and the duty of <hi>purſuing the perfection</hi> of our political ſyſtem, are involved in the ratification of the projected treaty with Great Britain.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſection of the ſecond article of the conſtitution ſays, that "The preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the ſenators preſent concur."</p>
               <p>To the exerciſe of this power no immediate qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, or reſtriction, is attached: but muſt we therefore ſuppoſe that the juriſdiction of the preſident and ſenate, like the juriſdiction aſcribed to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament, is omnipotent? To place the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029752_0124_0FE253E139E895C0"/>
of our preſident and ſenate on the ſame footing with the prerogative of the king of Great Britain, will not be commenſurate with the objects to which the treaty extends. It muſt be remembered, that the treaty of peace, by which the rights of ſovereignty and ſoil were ceded by the king of Great Britain to the United States, was negociated and ratified under the poſitive ſanction of an act of parliament: And it is expreſsly ſtated in <hi>Vattel,</hi> that the king of Great Britain cannot, by <hi>treaty,</hi> confer the rights of citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on an alien, B. I. c. 19. ſ. 214. Now, Mr. Jay's treaty does both theſe things (as will be hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated) without the intervention of the legiſlative authority of the union.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The conſequence of admitting this unqualified claim to omnipotence, in tranſacting the buſineſs of the nation, would be ſo hoſtile to the principle and preſervation of our government, that it is an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duty (<hi>obſla principiis</hi>) to contravert and reſiſt it. Whenever the preſident and two-thirds of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſhall be deſirous to counteract the conduct of the houſe of repreſentatives; whenever they may wiſh to enforce a particular point of legiſlation; or whenever they ſhall be diſpoſed to circumſcribe the power of a ſucceeding congreſs; a treaty with a foreign nation, nay, a talk with a ſavage tribe, affords the ready and effectual inſtrument for accompliſhing their views; ſince the treaty or the talk will conſtitute the ſupreme law of the land. That <hi>ſuch things may happen,</hi> let the hiſtory of Mr. Jay's miſſion and negociation teſtify.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If the extraordinary <hi>treaty-making power</hi> is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to the ordinary <hi>legiſlative power</hi>—ſuperſedes its exerciſe—and embraces all its objects; let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to trace whither the propoſition will carry us.</p>
               <p>The fifth article of the conſtitution veſts a power in two-thirds of both houſes of congreſs, to <hi>propoſe amendments to the conſtitution.</hi>

               <p>By the eighth ſection of the firſt article, <hi>congreſs</hi> is empowered to <hi>borrow money</hi> on the credit of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it was deemed expedient to ſubſidize Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, inſtead of building frigates, to keep the Alger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines within the ſtreights of the Mediterranean:—Could two-thirds of the ſenate and the preſident, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borrow, or guarantee a loan for that porpoſe <hi>by treaty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame ſection empowers <hi>congreſs</hi> to eſtabliſh uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form laws on <hi>the ſubject of bankruptcies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe Great Britain had remarked, that, as her ſubjects were conſtantly the creditors of the citizens of the United States, ſhe was deeply intereſted in our ſyſtem of bankrupt laws:—Had the preſident and two-thirds of the ſenate, a right to incorporate ſuch a ſyſtem with the projected treaty?</p>
               <p>The ſame ſection empowers <hi>congreſs</hi> to <hi>coin money,</hi> to regulate the value thereof, and of <hi>foreign coin,</hi> and fix the <hi>ſtandards of weights and meaſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Birmingham manufacturers offered, on a cheap plan, to ſupply us with coin? Suppoſe Great Britain were pleaſed to inſiſt upon our receiving her guineas at their Engliſh value, and upon our promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to ſweat, deface, or clip them, according to the current practice of the union? Suppoſe France were deſirous that we ſhould adopt the fanciful project of that republic, reſpecting weights and meaſures?—Could all, or any, of theſe propoſitions be acceded to and eſtabliſhed <hi>by treaty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth ſection of the ſame article declares "that the migration or importation of ſuch perſons as the

ſtates now exiſting ſhall think proper to admit, ſhall not be prohibited by the congreſs <hi>prior</hi> to the year eighteen hundred and eight."</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Mr. Wilberforce had negociated on the part of Great Britain, inſtead of Lord Grenville, and had made the prohibition of the importation of ſlaves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the United States, in the year eighteen hundred and eight, a <hi>ſine qua non:</hi>—Could the preſident and two-thirds of the ſenate admit and legitimize the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation <hi>by treaty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the conſtitution <hi>congreſs</hi> has the power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute tribunals inferior to the ſupreme court.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Great Britain deſired, for the future, as well as for the paſt, to eſtabliſh a tribunal of her own judges in America, for deciding controverſies between Britiſh ſubjects and American citizens:—Could this be accompliſhed through the medium of a treaty?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution <hi>congreſs</hi> is endowed with the power of declaring war.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Lord Grenville had inſiſted, and Mr. Jay had approved, that the treaty ſhould be an offenſive and defenſive alliance; and that we ſhould forthwith join Great Britain in her hoſtilities againſt France:—Could the preſident and ſenate thus <hi>negociate</hi> us into a war?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution it is declared, "that no perſon holding any office, &amp;c. under the United States, ſhall, without the conſent of congreſs, accept of any preſent, emolument, office or title of any kind whatſoever, from any king, prince, or foreign ſtate."</p>
               <p>Suppoſe our envoy had been offered a preſent or a title by the Britiſh monarch—would the conſent of the treaty be tantamount to the conſent of congreſs, for the purpoſe of approving and juſtifying his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution it is provided that all bills for raiſing revenues, ſhall originate in the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; and that no money ſhall be drawn from
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029752_0127_0FE253E77AAAC0C8"/>
the treaſury, but in conſequence of appropriations made by law.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Great Britain had ſtipulated, that as ſoon as the commiſſioners have fixed the ſum due to her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for old debts, the preſident ſhould draw a warrant for the amount, and that the ſame ſhould be paid out of all public monies in the treaſury of the United States, prior to the payment of any antecedent appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation by law:—Would this be the proper ſubject for a treaty, or for an impeachment?</p>
               <p n="8">8. But fatigued and diſguſted with diſplaying, thus hypothetically, the monſtrous conſequences, which will inevitably flow from <hi>the juriſdiction, claimed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the preſident and ſenate, to bind the United States by any treaty, and in all caſes whatſoever;</hi> let us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examine <hi>the numerous and extravagant infractions</hi> of the conſtitution, <hi>which the projected treaty actually commits.</hi> Recent as is the eſtabliſhment of the federal conſtitution, it is, indeed, to be lamented, that the poſſibility of violating it, is not a matter of floating and fluctuating popular opinion; but a matter ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of fixed and poſitive proof. For, who does not recollect, that a bill touching the fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the government (its repreſentative quality) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having paſſed both houſes of congreſs, was declared by the preſident to be unconſtitutional; and, therefore, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of his official approbation and ſignature?</hi> Who can forget that a law touching the eſſential properties of the judicial department of our government, <hi>after being ratified by every organ of legiſlative authority</hi> (the preſident, ſenate, and houſe of repreſentatives) <hi>was declared by chief juſtice Jay, and his aſſociate judges, to be unconſtitutional; and, therefore, incapable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted and enforced?</hi> With ſuch authoritative prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dento (and there are many others that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the tranſactions of individual ſtates) of the poſſibility of deviating from the rule and meaning of our conſtitution, are we to be damned for political he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, merely becauſe we doubt, or deny <hi>the infallibility
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029752_0128_0FE253F56C347F70"/>
of Mr. Jay's negociating talents?</hi> And muſt every man be <hi>accurſed</hi> (to uſe for a moment the intolerant language of the late ſecretary of the treaſury, in his character of <hi>the New York Camillus</hi>) who thinks that <hi>the American envoy and the Britiſh miniſter were at leaſt as likely to miſtake, or miſconſtrue, the conſtitutional boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the American government, as the preſident, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and houſe of repreſentatives of the United States?</hi> It is certainly, upon the whole, more candid, and more convincing, to put "the defence" of the treaty upon the <hi>true trading ground,</hi> taken by the New York chamber of commerce;—to wit,—<hi>"that we have made as good a market at ſuch pedlars had a right to expect on the royal exchange; and that we cannot afford to fight, though we muſt ſubmit to be plundered."</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Let us proceed, however, in examining the points on which <hi>the Britiſh treaty is at war with the American conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>By the conſtitution of the United States, the JUDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAL POWER</hi> is veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as <hi>the congreſs</hi> may from time to time eſtabliſh; and its juriſdiction embraces, among other things, <hi>"controverſies between a ſtate, or citizens thereof, and foreign ſtates, citizens, or ſubjects."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the treaty a tribunal, other than the ſupreme court, or any inferior court eſtabliſhed by congreſs,</hi> is erected, with a juriſdiction to aſcertain the amount of any loſſes or damages ſuſtained "<hi>by divers Britiſh</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others, his majeſty's ſubjects, <hi>on account of debts,</hi> &amp;c. that ſtill remain owing to them <hi>by citizens or inhabitants</hi> of the United States:" And it is agreed, that in all ſuch caſes where full compenſation for ſuch loſſes and damages cannot, <hi>for whatever reaſon,</hi> be actually had and received by the ſaid creditors, in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, the United States will make full and complete compenſation, for the ſame, to the creditors," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> I. It is the right of every independent nation to eſtabliſh and maintain a judicial authority,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029752_0129_0FE253F7845B2C60"/>
co-extenſive with its territorial poſſeſſions. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is indiſputable, and it is incidentally recognized by Lord Mansfield and other great lawyers, in the celebrated controverſy between the king of Pruſſia and Great Britain, relative to the <hi>Sileſia loan.</hi> 2. The conſtitutional tribunals of the United States were adequate to the adminiſtration of complete juſtice, in the very caſes for which the treaty provides a ſpecial tribunal. 3. If it is poſſible in any caſe, with any nation, and at any time, to ſtipulate, <hi>by treaty,</hi> for the erection of a tribunal, in order to aſcertain and liquidate debts due from citizens to foreigners, may it not be done in every caſe, with every nation, and at every time? 4. Is not <hi>the court of commiſſioners,</hi> in effect, <hi>an high court of errors and appeals</hi> for the United States, with power to reviſe and reverſe every judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that has been given ſince the year 1783, <hi>either in a federal or a ſtate court,</hi> in every cauſe between a Britiſh ſubject and an American citizen? 5. Wherever the recovery of the principal debt has been protracted by <hi>the forms of law</hi>—wherever there has been <hi>as abatement of intereſt,</hi> by the compromiſe of the parties, or the verdict of a jury—wherever <hi>the debtor has become inſolvent; this high court of commiſſioners may ſuſtain an appeal,</hi> and can award damages for the detention or loſs of the debt. It is true, the treaty adds, that "this proviſion is to extend to ſuch loſſes only as have been occaſioned <hi>by lawful impediments,"</hi> but <hi>the extent of the diſcretion</hi> of the commiſſioners, in adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what conſtitutes <hi>a lawful impediment,</hi> is without limitation or controul; and <hi>the nature of the evidence,</hi> by which their minds are to be informed, is without rule or definition; ſince (in the language of the treaty) it may be "either according to the legal forms now reſpectively exiſting in the two countries, <hi>or in ſuch other manner as the ſaid commiſſioners ſhall ſee cauſe to require or allow."</hi> Thus, not only erecting a court un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our conſtitution, but admitting <hi>a ſpecies of proof, not recognized by the legal forms of our country.</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:029752_0130_0FE253F916723F10"/>
6. Let us appeal to Mr. Jay himſelf, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionality of ſuch proceedings. <hi>By an act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,</hi> the judges of the circuit courts were required to take, and report to the ſecretary at war, certain proofs in the caſe of invalids and penſioners. The judges refuſed (as we have already noticed) to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the act, declaring it to be <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> as well on account of the nature of the duty impoſed upon them, as on account of the reviſionary power, which was veſted in the ſecretary at war. <hi>By the treaty,</hi> the preſident and ſenate will appoint commiſſioners, in conjunction with the king of Great Britain, <hi>to hold a court of appeals from every court in the union;</hi> and to determine <hi>judicial queſtions, upon private controversies,</hi> between Britiſh ſubjects and American citizens. Now, let us aſk, whether it is more unconſtitutional <hi>for the legiſlature</hi> to impoſe new and extraordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon a court, <hi>exiſting according to the conſtitution,</hi> than <hi>for the executive</hi> to create a new and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tribunal, <hi>incompatible with the conſtitution;</hi> inaſmuch as it can only act upon the alienation of the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>previouſly and excluſively</hi> veſted in our domeſtic courts;—the juriſdiction of hearing and deciding <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial queſtions, upon private controversies, between Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects and American citizens?</hi> 7. But this is not the only infraction of the conſtitution, involved in the arrangement alluded to—<hi>the obligation of private contracts is transferred from individuals to the public.</hi> The framers of the conſtitution, in declaring that "all debts contracted and engagements entered into, before its adoption, ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under tne conſtitution, as under the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration," could hardly anticipate, that they charged the treaſury of the union with the payment of all the outſtanding debts of the individual citizens of America! And when congreſs was veſted with a power "to lay and collect taxes, <hi>to pay the debts</hi> and provide for the common defence and general welfare
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029752_0131_0FE253FAA76870A0"/>
of the United States;" it certainly was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated, that the government of America became the inſurer of every Britiſh merchant, againſt litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delays, and fraudulent or accidental bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies! It cannot be ſuggeſted that Great Britain acts in a ſimilar manner upon our complaints of the ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations on our trade. For, the injury that we have ſuſtained, originated <hi>in an act of government;</hi>—the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured individuals are, <hi>in the firſt inſtance,</hi> bound to apply <hi>to the Britiſh courts of juſtice;</hi>—and the public are only reſponſible <hi>in the laſt reſort,</hi> for the individual aggreſſors,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>By the conſtitution of the United States,</hi> congreſs is empowered to eſtabliſh <hi>an uniform rule of naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and that power has accordingly been exerciſed in an act that provides, among other things, that "no perſon heretofore proſcribed by any ſtate, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a citizen, except by an act of the legiſlature of the ſtate in which ſuch perſon was proſcribed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the treaty,</hi> all the Britiſh ſettlers and traders, within the precincts or juriſdiction of the weſtern poſts, are allowed an election either to remain Britiſh ſubjects, <hi>or to become citizens of the United States:</hi> And it is agreed, "that <hi>Britiſh ſubjects</hi> who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, may hold, grant, ſell or deviſe the ſame, to <hi>whom they pleaſe,</hi> in like manner <hi>as if they were natives;</hi> and that neither they, <hi>nor their heirs or aſſigns,</hi> ſhall, ſo for as may reſpect the ſaid lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded <hi>as aliens."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> Is not <hi>the treaty at war with the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this great and delicate point of <hi>naturalization? A Britiſh colony</hi> is, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by the magic of Mr. Jay's pen, converted into an <hi>American ſettlement!</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Britiſh ſubject,</hi> who now holds lands (and when we recollect the recent ſpeculations for the ſale of lands, how can we calculate the extent of the adoption?) is, without ordeal or reſtraint, endowed with all the rights of a <hi>native American!</hi> If it is poſſible <hi>by treaty</hi> to give the rights of property to <hi>aliens,</hi> may not <hi>the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029752_0132_0FE25405EAA0AC88"/>
rights</hi> of the community be diſpoſed of by the ſame potent inſtruament? If it is poſſible <hi>by treaty</hi> to confer citizenſhip on the Britiſh garriſon at Detroit, and its contiguous ſettlers, why may we not, <hi>by treaty,</hi> alſo confer an inſtantaneous citizenſhip on <hi>every ſlight of emigrants,</hi> that ſhall haſten to our ſhores from Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many or Ireland? It may not be amiſs here to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a doubt of <hi>the power</hi> of the federal government to regulate <hi>the tenure of real eſtates:</hi> it is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly given, and therefore, cannot be conſtitutional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied; and it ſeems to be among the neceſſary and natural objects of ſtate legiſlation. But let us preſume (what is highly probable) that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſettlers within the precincts or juriſdiction of the weſtern poſts, certain <hi>proſcribed perſons;</hi>—can <hi>the treaty,</hi> in ſpite of <hi>the law,</hi> reſtore them to the rights of citizenſhip, without the authoritative aſſent of the ſtate that proſcribed them? Again:—Is every man whoſe eſtate was liable to confiſcation <hi>as a traitor,</hi> or <hi>as an alien,</hi> in conſequence of the revolution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>now to bold lands as a native?</hi> The Fairfax claim in Virginia; the claim of the Penns in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania; and the claims of Galloway, Allen, &amp;c. &amp;c. may hence derive a dangerous principle of reſuſcitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Look to it well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>By the conſtitution, congreſs</hi> is empowered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate <hi>commerce with foreign nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the treaty,</hi> the commerce of the United States, not only directly with Great Britain, but incidentally <hi>with every foreign nation,</hi> is regulated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> There is not a ſource of <hi>legiſlative juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> upon the ſubject of commerce, which is not abſorbed by this <hi>executive compact.</hi> The power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating commerce with foreign nations, is expreſly and ſpecifically given <hi>to congreſs:</hi> Can a power ſo giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to one department, be diveſted by implication, in order to amplify and invigorate another power, given in general terms to another department?

               <p>
                  <hi>By the treaty,</hi> it is agreed that "it ſhall at all times be free to Britiſh ſubjects, &amp;c. <hi>and alſo to the Indians dwelling an either ſide of the boundary line of the United States,</hi> freely to paſs and repaſs by land or inland na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America, &amp;c. <hi>and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other." The treaty,</hi> likewiſe, provides, that "<hi>no duty</hi> of entry ſhall ever be levied by either party <hi>on peltries</hi> brought by land, or inland navigation into the ſaid territories reſpectively; <hi>nor ſhall the Indians paſſing or repaſſing with their own proper goods and effects, of whatever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pay for the ſame any impoſt or duty whatever."</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> It is eaſy to perceive that the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>in favour of the Indians,</hi> were introduced at the inſtance of Great Britain; and her motives are not even attempted to be diſguiſed. Her traders will boast of the favor and ſecurity, which ſhe has compelled Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to grant to the Indians; and ſo engage their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and attachment; while the privilege of free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and the exemption from duties, will inevitably throw the whole fur trade into the hands of the Britiſh. <hi>The ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, under ſuch circumſtances, can produce no loſs to Great Britain, and will certainly be of no advantage to America:</hi> It will not add a ſhilling to the profits of our Indian traffic; nor inſure us a moment's ſuſpenſion of Indian hoſtilities! But to proſecute our <hi>conſtitutional</hi> enquiry—what right is these by <hi>treaty</hi> to regulate our commerce with the Indian tribes? Whenever a treaty of peace and amity has <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore</hi> been concluded with the Indians, it has been <hi>the conſtitutional practice of the preſident, to call on congreſs to regulate the commerce with them.</hi> Such calls were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unneceſſary, if the ſame thing might as well and as lawfully be done <hi>by treaty;</hi> and if it could not be done <hi>by treaty in the caſe of the Indians,</hi> neither could it be done <hi>by treaty in the caſe of a foreign nation:</hi> For,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029752_0134_0FE2540968DF0340"/>
both are expreſſed <hi>in the ſame terms,</hi> and included <hi>in the ſame member</hi> of the ſection. "Congreſs ſhall have power (ſays the conſtitution) to regulate commerce <hi>with foreign nations,</hi> and among the ſeveral ſtates, and <hi>with the Indian tribes."</hi> What right is there by <hi>treaty</hi> to declare, that <hi>no duty</hi> of entry ſhall ever be levied by either party <hi>on peltries, &amp;c.</hi> (and a ſimilar promiſe is made in caſes that more immediately affect Great Britain) ſince <hi>congreſs</hi> has the ſole power to lay and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect taxes, <hi>duties,</hi> &amp;c. to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States? If we may, <hi>negatively</hi> ſay, <hi>by treaty,</hi> that certain duties ſhall not be laid, may we not, <hi>affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively,</hi> ſay, <hi>by treaty,</hi> that certain other duties ſhall be laid?

Let Mr. Randolph's letter to Mr. Hammond, on the conduct of General Simcoe and Major Campbell be referred to, as an anſwer to this queſtion. It is not, at preſent, within reach to be quoted; but its contents were too important to have already eſcaped the memory of any reflecting American.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> To define crimes, and apportion puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is the peculiar province of <hi>the legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of every free government: but it is obvious from the foregoing recapitulation, that <hi>the executive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> has likewiſe encroached upon that province, by the inſtrumentality of its <hi>treaty-making</hi> power. Can a citizen be ſurrendered <hi>by treaty</hi> to all the pains and penalties of <hi>piracy?</hi> Then <hi>by treaty,</hi> he might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to all the pains and penalties of <hi>treaſon.</hi> It is true, that the conſtitution reſerves to itſelf <hi>the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right</hi> of declaring what ſhall conſtitute <hi>treaſon;</hi> but it is equally true, that it beſtows <hi>on congreſs the excluſive right</hi> to define and puniſh <hi>piracy:</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of <hi>the right to define</hi> in one caſe, is as unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutitonal as the invaſion of <hi>an actual definition</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what legitimate authority can <hi>a treaty</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, in order to juſtify the reſtraint upon that right of expatriation, which congreſs itſelf has not ventured to reſtrain, while legiſlating on ſubjects of a ſimilar claſs? It is not intended to convey the ſlighteſt doubt of the power and propriety of controuling our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in their conduct towards <hi>foreign nations,</hi> while they are within the reach of <hi>domeſtic coercion:</hi> but to prohibit an American freeman from going whither he pleaſes, in queſt of fortune and happineſs—to reſtrict him from exerciſing, <hi>in a foreign country, and in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſervice,</hi> his genius, talents and induſtry; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029752_0136_0FE254172F15E0F8"/>
him for ſeeking honor, emolument or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by enliſting <hi>within the territory and under the banners</hi> of another nation;—to do ſuch things, is to condemn the principle of our own policy, by which we invite all the world to fill up the population of our country: To do ſuch things is, in fact, to proſtrate the boaſted rights of man. It it hardly worth a pauſe to aſk, <hi>what proportion of respect is due to the commiſſion of a Britiſh officer?</hi> and <hi>what degree of puniſhment</hi> the refuſal or neglect to pay it, may deſerve?</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>By the conſtitution</hi> it is declared, that "no tax or duty ſhall be laid <hi>on articles exported from any ſtate."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the treaty</hi> "it is expreſsly agreed and declared that the United States will prohibit and reſtrain the carrying any melaſſes, ſugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton, in American veſſels, either from his majeſty's iſlands, <hi>or from the United States,</hi> to any part of the world."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> This is an extract, it is true, from the twelfth article of the treaty; but it equally ſerves to ſhow the probability of attempts to violate the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Beſides, the advocates for the treaty are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and premature, when they deſire to throw the twelfth article entirely out of conſideration: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, by that propoſition, <hi>though they ſhould ſave the treaty, they effectually deſtroy its author.</hi> They are haſty and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature for another reaſon: the twelfth article is to be <hi>ſuſpended for the declared purpoſe of negociating ſomething as a ſubſtitute;</hi> and, therefore we muſt confider its principle, in order to aſcertain, how far <hi>any modification</hi> of it could be rendered palatable. But, <hi>on conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ground,</hi> when it is declared, that <hi>no duty</hi> ſhall <hi>by law</hi> be laid on articles exported from any ſtate, is it not abſurd, or wicked to ſuppoſe, that <hi>by treaty</hi> the exportation of <hi>the articles themſelves</hi> can be prohibited? The obvious intention of <hi>the conſtitution</hi> is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>our export trade;</hi>—the immediate effect of <hi>the treaty</hi> is to obſtruct and annihilate it.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) There are many other points in which <hi>a colliſion occurs between the conſtitution and the treaty,</hi> but to which
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029752_0137_0FE25418C74F6DF0"/>
the ſcope and nature of theſe ſtrictures wil not admit a full attention. It may be curſorily remarked, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that a ceſſion of territory, which will, probably, be the conſequence of <hi>ſettling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If a part of the United States may be ceded—if a whole ſtate may be ceded, what becomes of the guarantee of a republican form of government to every ſtate? The propriety of preſenting this conſideration to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind, will be allowed by thoſe who know, that, <hi>in the courſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="8">(8.) It may not be amiſs, likewiſe, to add, that our government has no more right to <hi>alienate powers that are given,</hi> that it has to <hi>uſurp powers that are not given.</hi> For instance, <hi>an act of congreſs</hi> could not (and <hi>can a treaty?</hi>) ſurrender the right of ſequeſtering the property of a hoſtile nation—the right of giving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial preferences to a friendly nation—and the right of ſuſpending a ruinous intercourſe with any nation? Great clamor; have been raiſed againſt <hi>the exerciſe</hi> of theſe rights; and, undoubtedly, they ſhould only be uſed <hi>in the laſt reſort;</hi> but they are rights <hi>recognized by the law of nations;</hi> and they are rights often eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the duties of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> and ſometimes neceſſary to the accompliſhment of <hi>reciprocal juſtice.</hi>

This fatal effect, however, of converting our government from the ſyſtem which the people <hi>love,</hi> to a ſyſtem which they <hi>abhor,</hi>—from what it was made in theory, to what it was never intended to be made by practice—can only proceed from <hi>error</hi> or <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It would ill become the writer of theſe ſtrictures, who ſo freely, but it is hoped, ſo fairly, expreſſes an opinion, to impute to any man or ſet of men, a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and traiterous deſign againſt the conſtitution of our common country. The denunciations fulminated by <hi>the New York Camillus,</hi> and his ſmall circle of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors, harmleſsly expend themſelves in the violence of their exploſion: like the denunciations of <hi>the Tiara,</hi> they ſpring from <hi>an arrogant claim of infallibility;</hi> and like them too, will only excite <hi>the deriſion or the diſguſt of an enlightened nation.</hi> Is it credible, that every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of the United States, from Georgia to New-Hampſhire, who reprobates Mr. Jay's treaty, muſt either be <hi>an enemy to our government,</hi> or <hi>a rancorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary?</hi> Is it to be preſumed that no man can utter a ſentence of diſapprobation reſpecting <hi>the principles</hi> of the treaty, without feeling a ſentiment of animoſity, reſpecting <hi>the perſon</hi> of the negociator?

               <p>If it could be thought a convenient, a reputable, or a neceſſary taſk, how ſucceſsfully might <hi>the argument of recrimination</hi> be employed! Who, it could be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are <hi>the perſons</hi> that ſupport the treaty? What are <hi>the motives</hi> that actuate them?

Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, indeed, that <hi>Camilius</hi> himſelf, by confining his "Defence" <hi>to the treaty as adviſed to be ratified by the ſenate,</hi> virtually abandons the treaty <hi>as negociated and concluded by Mr. Jay:</hi>—and alſo, conſidering that a part of <hi>Camillus's</hi> defence of the <hi>preſent treaty</hi> ariſes from the <hi>ambiguity</hi> that Mr. Jay had left in the <hi>former treaty</hi> with Great Britain (upon which, however, his character as a negociator was founded) we might be led to ſuppoſe, that Mr. Jay's pretenſions to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a ſtateſman, and to the ſtation of a preſident, were not deemed, <hi>even by his own party,</hi> to be any longer tenable; but that <hi>Camillus</hi> ſtill condeſcends, on the obvious preſumption of a ſubſiſting rivalſhip, to impeach the miniſterial character, and to depreciate the official performances, of Mr. Jefferſon.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould we arbitrarily <hi>abuſe,</hi> inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring rationally to <hi>convince</hi> each other? We all have the ſame right, from natural and from ſocial law, <hi>to think and to ſpeak:</hi> it is true, that we do not all poſſeſs the ſame powers of reaſon, nor the ſame charms of eloquence; but when men are on <hi>an equality in the poſſeſſion,</hi> as well as in <hi>the right of exerciſing,</hi> thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, there can be no amicable way of adjuſting a difference of opinion, but that which is adopted for adjuſting all the other differences of a free people—<hi>an appeal to the voice of the majority!</hi> Now, let it be allowed (and ſo far ought to be allowed, but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that Mr. Jay, who negociated the treaty; the twenty members of the ſenate, who aſſented to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ratification; and Mr. Hamilton, and the New York chamber of commerce, who have appeared in ſupport of it (an enumeration that compriſes, it is believed, all that have hitherto <hi>avowed a perfect appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>) are in the poſſeſſion of as great a portion of information, integrity and talents, as <hi>a like number</hi> of citizens, ſelected for their approved wiſdom, virtue and patriotiſm, from the aggregate of thoſe who have

publicly condemned the treaty; and then let it be candidly anſwered, which ſcale in the balance muſt, of right, preponderate? After ſuch a ſelection, there will ſtill remain the great body of the community in oppoſition to a ratification; and, as members of that community, thouſands of individuals who honorably ſerved during the late war, in the field and the cabinet, and many of whom at this moment ſerve with zeal, fidelity and wiſdom in the various departments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Is it not then the ſymptom of an arrogant vanity;—of a tyrannical diſpoſition;—to ſtigmatize ſuch an oppoſition to <hi>a projected meaſure,</hi> with the name of <hi>"Faction?"</hi> The violence offered to Mr. Hamilton's perſon in New York, and to Mr. Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's houſe in Philadelphia, have juſtly excited the indignation of every ſincere republican: but even that reprehenſible and odious conduct is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the enormous guilt of endeavouring <hi>to force the opinion of a few individuals upon the people,</hi> as the ultimate teſt of political truth; <hi>and to caſt an odium upon the late, conventions, in which</hi> (according to the language of the conſtitution) <hi>"the people were peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſembled, to petition the government for the redreſs (or rather the prevention) of a grievance."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let the pardon of the reader be granted for <hi>this digreſſion;</hi> and we will return to a delineation of the feature that lies before us.</p>
               <p n="12">12.

               <p>Our government, therefore, being <hi>a government of departments,</hi> it is (as we have already obſerved) incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>the duty of ſelf-preſervation;</hi> or, in other words, it muſt proceed from <hi>an error in conſtruction;</hi> that <hi>one</hi> department ſhall aſſume and exerciſe all, or

any, of the powers, of all, or any, of the other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. "The departments of government (to adopt the elegant figure uſed by an excellent judge in a late admirable charge to a Philadelphia jury) are planets that revolve, each in its appropriate orbit, round the conſtitution, as the fun of our political ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem." Thus, if the legiſlative, executive, or judicial departments ſhall encroach, one upon the orbit of the other, the deſtruction of the order, uſe, and beauty of the political ſyſtem, muſt as inevitably enſue, as the deſtruction of the order, uſe and beauty of the planetary ſyſtem would follow, from a ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the eſſential principles of attraction, repulſion and gravity.</p>

It was neceſſary, however, that the power of making treaties with foreign nations, ſhould be veſted in one of the departments of the government: but <hi>the power of making treaties is not, in its nature, paramount to every other power; not does the exerciſe of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er naturally demand an excluſive juriſdiction.</hi> A nation may carry on its <hi>external commerce</hi> without the aid of <hi>the treaty-making pówer;</hi> but it cannot manage its <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concerns</hi> without the aid of the <hi>legiſlative power:</hi> the legiſlative power is, conſequently, of ſuperior im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and rank to the treaty-making power. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:—<hi>The legiſlative power, exerciſed conformably to the conſtitution,</hi> muſt be direct, univerſal, and concluſive in its operation and force upon the people; but <hi>the treaty-making power</hi> is ſcarcely in any inſtance inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of legiſlative aid to effectuate its efforts, and to render its compacts obligatory on the nation. A memorable occurrence in the Engliſh hiſtory will ſerve to illuſtrate both of theſe poſitions: It is the fate of <hi>the commercial part of the famous treaty of Utrecht,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between France and England in the year 1712. "The peace (ſays Ruſſel in his "hiſtory of modern Europe," vol. 4. P. 457) was generally diſliked by the people, <hi>and all impartial men reprobated the treaty of

commerce with France, as ſoon as the terms were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi> Exception was particularly taken againſt the 8th and 9th articles, importing <hi>"That Great Britain and France ſhould mutually enjoy all the privileges its tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with each other, which either granted to the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored nation; that all prohibitions ſhould be removed, and no higher duties impoſed on the French commodities than on thoſe of any other people."</hi> The ruinous tendency of thoſe articles was perceived by the whole trading part of the kingdom. It was accordingly urged, when a bill was brought into the houſe of commons for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them, that the trade with Portugal, the moſt beneficial of any, would be loſt, ſhould the duties on French and Portugueſe wines be made equal, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe and ſimilar arguments <hi>induced the more moderate tories to join the whigs, AND THE BILL WAS REJECTED BY A MaJORITY OF NINE VOTES."</hi> In relating the ſame tranſaction, Smollet's hiſtory of England (vol. 2. p. 242, 246) contains ſome paſſages too remarkable to be omitted on the preſent occation. "Againſt the 8th and 9th articles (ſays the hiſtorian) <hi>the Portugueſe miniſter preſented a memorial,</hi> declaring, that ſhould the duties on French wines be lowered to the ſame level with thoſe that were laid on the wines of Portugal, <hi>his maſter would renew the prohibition of the woolen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed, all the trading part of the nation exclaimed againſt the treaty of commerce, which ſeems to have been concluded in a hurry, before the miniſters fully underſtood the nature of the ſubject.</hi> This precipitation was owing to the fears that their endeavours after peace would miſcarry, from the intrigues of the whig faction, and the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate oppoſition of the confederates." "Another bill (continues the ſame writer, in a ſubſequent page) being brought into the houſe of commons, for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the treaty of commerce effectual, <hi>ſuch a number of petitions were delivered againſt it,</hi> and ſo many ſolid arguments advanced by the merchants, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined on the ſubject, that <hi>even a great number of tory

               </p>
               <p>Perhaps there cannot, in the annals of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth, be found two caſes more parallel than the one which is thus recorded in the Engliſh hiſtory, and the one which at preſent agitates the American <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation.—1. All impartial men reprobated both treaties as ſoon as the terms were known. 2. The admiſſion of the oppoſite contracting party to an unqualified participation in trade, with the moſt favored nation, is, in both caſes, a principal ſource of complaint. 3. The removal of all prohibitions, and the ſurrender of the right to impoſe higher duties on the commodities of the oppoſite contracting party, than on thoſe of any other people, are, in both caſes, condemned. 4. The good and the intelligent of all parties have united their influence, in both caſes, to prevent a confirmation of articles of ſo ruinous a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. 5. The whole nation, in both caſes, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the treaty. 6. Both treaties were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a hurry, before the miniſters fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the nature of the ſubject. 7. Innumerable peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (and who will NOW deny the propriety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the American right to petition?) were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered againſt both treaties. 8. And the Portugueſe miniſter declared in effect, of the treaty of Utrecht (<hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) what the miniſter of France will, probably, declare of the treaty of London (but what America ſurrenders the right of ſaying at any time to Great Britain) "If you ratify your alliance with the British, you muſt ſurrender your alliance with France." If ſuch a wonderful ſimilarily of circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur <hi>in the negociation, terms, and reception</hi> of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable inſtruments, let us hope that the guardian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of American liberty and proſperity, has, alſo, doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them finally to experience a <hi>merited ſimilarity of fate!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. But having thus ſhown, that <hi>even in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the treaty-making prerogative is <hi>neither paramount
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029752_0145_0FE2543AD17AEA20"/>
nor excluſive</hi> (though <hi>the generality</hi> of judge Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's expreſſions on the ſubject would, perhaps, lead to that prepoſterous concluſion) we might be ſatisfied to preſume, on general principles, that ſo high a claim of juriſdiction could not be maintained, at leaſt, on the part of our preſident and ſenate. Yet, let us endeavour, by the infallible teſt of the conſtitution, to put the matter, if poſſible, beyond doubt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; and having eſtabliſhed that each department of the government ſhould be confined to its proper orbit, let us endearour to aſcertain, what that orbit is, in relation to the <hi>treaty-making power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The power of the preſident and ſenate to make treaties, is given (as we have already ſtated) <hi>in general and unreſtricted terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the powers given to congreſs (except in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be hereafter noticed) <hi>are definite in their terms, and appropriated in their objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us aſk, then, by what rule of conſtruction a power <hi>primarily and ſpecifically</hi> given to one body, can be aſſumed and exerciſed by another, to which, <hi>in a ſubſequent clauſe,</hi> a mere <hi>general</hi> authority is given?</p>
               <p>Upon the common law principles of conſtruction, <hi>the ſpecific powers</hi> would clearly, in ſuch a caſe, be deemed a reſervation and exception out of <hi>the general grant.</hi> But even according to a rule furniſhed by the conſtitution itſelf, the ſame reſult will be produced. Thus, the twelfth ratified amendment declares, "that the powers not delegated to the United States by the conſtitution, are reſerved to the ſtates reſpectively, or to the people." Now, if the general power granted for the purpoſe of making treaties, can ſet at nought the juriſdiction ſpecifically given to congreſs for the purpoſe of making laws, may it not, with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and effect, overleap the boundary thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed between popular rights and conſtituted powers? In the one caſe, the reſervation is expreſsly declared—in the other, it is neceſſarily implied.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:029752_0146_0FE2543C63E70A40"/>(2.) But if the delegation of <hi>a general power</hi> does, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> convey a right to embrace, in the exerciſe of that power, every authority not incompatible with its objects, the conſequence will be that <hi>congreſs may enter into treaties as well as the preſident and ſenate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, congreſs is veſted with a juriſdiction "to make all laws, which ſhall be neceſſary and proper for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into execution their own powers:" and what laws are, in that reſpect, neceſſary and proper, they muſt, from the nature of the thing, be the judge.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, therefore, that congreſs was deſirous of forming <hi>an alliance, offenſive and defenſive, with France,</hi> but could not obtain the conſtitutional number of two-thirds of the ſenate for accompliſhing the meaſure <hi>by treaty,—an act of congreſs in order to regulate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that nation,</hi> would afford as effectual a mode (according to the new doctrine) ſince the act, on the pretext of an equivalent for commercial advantages, might <hi>legiſlate</hi> us into the coveted alliance. The temptation and facility of proceeding in this way is obvious;—the paſſing of a law requiring but a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſenate; whereas the ratification of a treaty requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of that body.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is not, however, neceſſary to mingle and confuſe the departments of our government, contrary to the firſt principles of a free republic; not to make <hi>a part</hi> of our political ſyſtem <hi>equal to the whole,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſoundeſt axioms of demonſtrative philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, in order to give a juſt, efficient and ſalutary effect to the treaty-making power of the preſident and ſenate. For although,</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the <hi>treaty-making</hi> power cannot bind the nation by <hi>a deciſion</hi> upon any of the ſubjects, which the conſtitution expreſsly devolves upon the <hi>legiſlative power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, the treaty-making power may <hi>negociate conditionally,</hi> reſpecting the ſubjects that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029752_0147_0FE2543DF5A9B390"/>
conſtitutionally belong to <hi>the deciſion of the legiſlative power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in the <hi>third</hi> place, <hi>every other ſubject,</hi> proper for the national compact of a republic, may be <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated and abſolutely concluded by the treaty-making power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That ſuch a diſtinction was intended by the framers of our preſent excellent conſtitution, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have been glanced at, muſt, it is thought, ſufficiently prove to every ingenuous mind: But let one argument more be adduced.</p>
               <p>By the ninth article of the old confederation it was declared, "That the United States, in congreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, ſhall have <hi>the ſole and excluſive right and power of determining on peace and war."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the exiſting conſtitution of the United States, it is provided, "That congreſs ſhall have power <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war,</hi> grant letters of marque and repriſal, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now, it it evident, that by omitting to depoſit <hi>with congreſs</hi> the power of <hi>making peace,</hi> in addition to the power of <hi>declaring war,</hi> the framers of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, had in full view the diviſion of its departments, and the correſponding diſtribution of its powers.</p>
               <p>Congreſs, <hi>under the confederation,</hi> was a <hi>ſingle</hi> body, and therefore, neceſſarily poſſeſſed of all the little le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, executive, and judicial authority, which <hi>the ſtates</hi> had been pleaſed to delegate <hi>to the union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The government of the United States,</hi> on the contrary, is a compound ſyſtem, of which the congreſs is only <hi>the legiſlative department:</hi> and, therefore, the executive and judicial functions are elſewhere to be ſought for and exerciſed.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that although the power of <hi>declaring war is</hi> (as it ought to be) <hi>left with congreſs,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>making peace is</hi> (as it ought to be) <hi>transferred to the executive;</hi> being a natural appendage of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power of <hi>making treaties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deduction ſerves likewiſe to demonſtrate, that the framers of the conſtitution, did not intend to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029752_0148_0FE254492156F538"/>
leave the powers that are <hi>ſpecifically</hi> given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, at the mercy of the power that is <hi>generally</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the preſident and ſenate. By expreſſing a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juriſdiction in favor of the former, it excludes a claim of juriſdiction in favor of the latter.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Nor is it in <hi>the power of making treatieſ only,</hi> that the conſtitution has abridged <hi>the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of its cuſtomary attributes, in order to augment the ſources of <hi>legiſlative juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Great Britain</hi> (for inſtance) <hi>the executive</hi> poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the power of making peace; of granting letters of marque and repriſal; of regulating weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; of coining money, regulating the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of foreign coins; of erecting courts of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; of conferring the rights of deni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On reviewing the various poſitions that have been taken in the courſe of theſe ſtrictures, a deſire is felt to exhibit the corroborative opinions of men who have been juſtly valued by the public: It will be uſeful to the reader, as well as pleaſing to the writer, to indulge the diſpoſition in a few inſtances, and in a brief manner.</p>

afterwards it was carried by a majority as it ſtands.

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt:</hi> That the legiſlative, executive and judicial departments are each formed <hi>in a ſeparate and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent manner;</hi> and that the ultimate baſis of each is the conſtitution only; <hi>within the limits of which each department can alone juſtify any act of authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> That the legiſlature, among other important powers, unqueſtionably poſſeſs that of eſtabliſhing courts, in ſuch a manner as to their wiſdom ſhall appear beſt, <hi>limited by the terms of the conſtitution only;</hi> and to whatever extent that power may be exerciſed, or however ſevere the duty they may think proper to require, the judges, <hi>when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in virtue of any ſuch eſtabliſhment,</hi> owe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and unreſerved obedience to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly:</hi> That at the ſame time ſuch courts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be warranted, as we conceive, by virtue of that part of the conſtitution delegating <hi>judicial power,</hi> for the exerciſe of which any act of the legiſlature is provided, in exerciſing (even under the authority of another act) any power not in its nature <hi>judicial,</hi> or if <hi>judicial,</hi> NOT PROVIDED FOR UPON THE TERMS THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly:</hi> That whatever doubts may be ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>whether the power in queſtion is properly of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial nature,</hi> yet inaſmuch <hi>as the deciſion of the court is not made final,</hi> but may be, at leaſt, ſuſpended in its operation by the ſecretary at war, if he ſhall have cauſe to ſuſpect impoſition or miſtake, <hi>this ſubjects the deciſion of the court to a mode of reviſion, which we conſider to be unwarranted by the conſtitution:</hi> For, though <hi>congreſs</hi> may certainly eſtabliſh in inſtances, not yet provided for, <hi>courts of appellate juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> yet, <hi>ſuch courts muſt conſiſt of judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the manner the conſtitution requires, and holding their offices by no other tenure than that of their
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029752_0152_0FE25457CBEC1408"/>
good behaviour;</hi> by which tenure the office of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary at war is not held. And, we beg leave to add, with all due deference, that <hi>no deciſion of any court of the United States can, under any circumſtances, in our opinion, agreeably to the conſtitution, be liable to a reverſion, or even ſuſpenſion, by the legiſlature itſelf,</hi> in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be veſted, but the important one relative to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Extract from the opinion of <hi>judges</hi> WILSON, BLAIR, and PETERS.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The people of the United States have veſted in congreſs all <hi>legiſlative</hi> powers, granted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>They have veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as the congreſs ſhall eſtabliſh, the <hi>judicial</hi> power of the United States.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy of remark, that, in congreſs, the <hi>whole</hi> legiſlative power of the United States is not veſted: an important part of that power was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by the people themſelves, when they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>This conſtitution is the ſupreme law of the land: This ſupreme law, all judicial officers of the United States are bound, by oath or affirmation, to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>It is a principle important to freedom, that in government, the <hi>judicial</hi> ſhould be diſtinct from, and independent of, the legiſlative department. To this important principle the people of the United States, in forming their conſtitution, have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the higheſt regard.</p>
                  <p>They have placed their <hi>judicial</hi> power, not in congreſs, but <hi>in "courts."</hi> They have ordained, that <hi>"the judges"</hi> of thoſe courts ſhall hold their offices "during good behaviour;" and that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their continuance in office, their ſalaries ſhall not be diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="unknown:029752_0153_0FE2545A99D25DE8"/>Congreſs have lately paſſed an act "to regulate (among other things) the claims to invalid pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>Upon due conſideration, we have been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly of opinion, that under this act, <hi>the circuit court,</hi> held for the Pennſylvania diſtrict, could not proceed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the buſineſs directed by this act is not of a judicial nature. It forms no part of the power <hi>weſied by the conſtitution in the courts of the United States;</hi> the circuit court muſt, conſequently, have proceeded <hi>without conſtitutional authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe, if, upon that buſineſs, the court had proceeded; ITS JUDGMENTS (for its <hi>opinions</hi> are its judgments) MIGHT, UNDER THE SAME ACT, HAVE BEEN REVISED AND CONTROUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED BY THE LEGISLATURE, AND BY AN OFFICER IN THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. <hi>Such reviſion and controul we deemed radically inconſiſtent with the independence of that judicial power, which is veſted in the courts;</hi> and, conſequently, with that important principle, which is ſo ſtrictly obſerved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the United States.</p>

               <p>Extract from the opinion of <hi>chief juſtice</hi> JAY, and <hi>judges</hi> CUSHING and DUANE.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"The court were unanimouſly of opinion,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That by the conſtitution of the United States, the government thereof is divided into <hi>three</hi> diſtinct and independent branches; and THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF EACH TO ABSTAIN FROM, AND OPPOSE ENCROACHMENTS ON, EITHER.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That neither the <hi>legiſlative</hi> nor <hi>the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive branches,</hi> can conſtitutionally aſſign to the <hi>judicial</hi> any duties, but ſuch as are properly judicial, and to be performed in a judicial manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the duties aſſigned to the circuit court by the act in queſtion, are not of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; and that the act itſelf does not appear to contemplate them as ſuch; <hi>in as much as it ſubjects
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029752_0154_0FE2545C2A58CA30"/>
the deciſions of theſe courts, made purſuant to thoſe duties,</hi> firſt to the conſideration and ſuſpenſion of the ſecretary at war, and then to the reviſion of the legiſlature; WHEREAS BY THE CONSTITUTION, NEITHER THE SECRETARY AT WAR, NOR ANY OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NOR EVEN THE LET GISLATURE, ARE AUTHORISED TO SIT AS A COURT OF ERRORS ON THE JUDICIAL ACTS OR OPINIONS OF THIS COURT.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Such, upon the whole, are <hi>"THE FEATURES OF MR. JAY's TREATY."</hi> It was not intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this ſketch of them to ſo great a length; and yet more circumſtances are recollected, that might have been inſerted, than could, upon a fair reconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, be retrenched. If it ſhall, in any degree, ſerve the purpoſes of truth, by leading, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of a candid inveſtigation, <hi>to a fair, honourable, and patriotic deciſion,</hi> the deſign with which it was written will be completely accompliſhed, <hi>whether RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIFICATION or REJECTION, is the reſult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, before the ſubject is cloſed, let the citizens of the union be warned from too credulous an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>their prejudices</hi> and <hi>their fears.</hi> The diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant cry of party is loud; and the phantoms of war aſſail the imagination: yet, let us not be deluded by ſtratagem, nor vanquiſhed by terror. The queſtion is not a queſtion between party and party, but between nation and nation:—it is not a queſtion of war or peace between military powers; but a queſtion of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and intereſt between commercial rivals. The ſubject is too momentous to be treated as the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball of contending factions;—it appeals from the paſſions to the judgment; from the ſelfiſhneſs to the patriotiſm of every citizen!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:029752_0155_0FE2545DBAEC4E08"/>That <hi>the Britiſh treaty, or a Britiſh war, is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alternative,</hi> will be more fully controverted, the writer's preſent intention of delineating <hi>"THE FEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES OF THE DEFENCE,"</hi> ſhall be carried into effect. But, in the mean time, let a few ſelf-evident propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions contribute to relieve the public mind, from the weight of that apprehenſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>diſpoſition of Great Britain,</hi> manifeſted by the order of the 6th of November 1793, by the ſpeech of Lord Dorcheſter to the Indians, and by the repeated invaſions made, under General Simcoe's authority, upon our territory, <hi>is naturally hoſtile to the United States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Even if the United States could by any means ſoothe and convert that diſpoſition into amity and peace, <hi>the projected treaty is too high a price to pay for ſuch a change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The refuſal to enter into the projected treaty with Great Britain, is <hi>not a juſt cauſe of war;</hi> and and if a <hi>pretence,</hi> only, is wanting, it may be found in the toaſts at our feſtivals, as well as in the acts of our government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the ratification of the treaty will aſſuredly give umbrage to <hi>another nation</hi>—to an ancient ally.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If war is inevitable <hi>either with great Britain, or with France,</hi> it would be more politic for the ſtate, more congenial to the ſentiments of the people, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the former, than the latter, power.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In caſe of a war with Great Britain, we have aſſurance, <hi>that France will aid us with all the energy of her triumphant arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In caſe of a war with France, we ought not to count upon <hi>the affections,</hi> and we cannot rely upon the power, of Great Britain, to befriend us.</p>

            <head>RESOLUTIONS Of the Citizens of <hi>Boſton,</hi> at a Meeting legally conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſelectmen, on the 13th of July, <hi>1795,</hi> reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Treaty lately concluded between Lord Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and Mr. Jay.</head>
            <p>RESOLVED, as the ſenſe of the inhabitants of this town—That the aforeſaid inſtrument, if ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, will be highly injurious to the commercial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the United States, derogatory to their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal honor and independence, and may be dangerous to the peace and happineſs of their citizens.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which have induced this opinion are as follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this compact proſeſſes to have no refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the merits of the complaints and pretenſious of the contracting parties: but in reality the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and pretenſions of Great Britain are fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, while a part only of thoſe of the United States have been brought into conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe, in the ſtipulation which ſurrenders <hi>our</hi> poſts on the weſtern frontier, no proviſion is made to indemnify the United States for the commercial and other loſſes they have ſuſtained, and the heavy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes to which they have been ſubjected in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of being kept out of poſſeſſion, for twelve years, in direct violation of the treaty of peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe no indemnification is to be made to the citizens of the United States, for property taken from them at the cloſe of the war, the reſtitution of which is provided for in the ſame treaty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the capture of veſſels and property of the citizens of the United States, made under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the government of Great Britain, is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concern, and claims ariſing from ſuch captures ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of their admiralty courts, as the United States are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

precluded from having a voice in the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuch caſes.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the indemnification propoſed to be made, is to be ſought by a proceſs, tedious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, in which juſtice may be delayed to an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time; and eventually loſt to many of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, from their inability to purſue it; and becauſe this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the ſummary method adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe this compact admits Britiſh ſubjects to an equal participation with our own citizens, of the interior traffic of the United States with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Indians, through our whole territorial domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; while the advantages oſtenſibly reciprocated to our citizens, are limited both in their nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe the alien duty upon merchandiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the United States by Britiſh ſubjects, in their own bottoms, is, if not wholly ſuſpended, at leaſt contracted not to be increaſed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Becauſe the commerce we have hitherto enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in India, in common with other nations, is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted, that in future it will be of little or no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial benefit to our citizens.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Becauſe in every stipulation reſpecting our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the colonial poſſeſſions of Great Britain, the whole commerce of the United States, in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, is <hi>colonized</hi> in return.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Becauſe the clauſe by which the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſerves to itſelf the right of impoſing on Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſels, entering Britiſh ports in Europe, a duty which ſhall countervail the difference of the duty payable on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods into the United States in Britiſh or Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can bottoms, places it in the power of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enable Britiſh ſubjects to become the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Aſiatic and European goods into the United States, to the excluſion of our own citizens.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:029752_0163_0FE2547A281E5ED8"/>10. Becauſe although the terms of ſaid treaty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be reciprocal in many inſtances, yet from the local ſituation, and exiſting circumſtances of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and the pacific ſyſtem of policy they have adopted, that reciprocity is merely nominal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Becauſe it prevents the United States from impoſing any further reſtrictions on the Britiſh trade <hi>alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, becauſe it is ſtipulated that neither the debts due from individuals of one nation to individuals of the other, nor ſhares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in any public or private banks, ſhall ever in any event of war or national differences, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated.—It is far from being impoſſible that the exerciſe of this right may in the opinion of the national legiſlature contribute to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſteem it highly impolitic that the public faith ſhould be pledged that it ſhall never be exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any circumſtances whatever.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Becauſe it concedes a right to the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to ſearch and detain our veſſels in time of war, under frivolous and vexatious pretexts.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Becauſe it agrees, that ſhip-timber, tar, hemp, ſails and copper, ſhall be conſidered contraband of war, which articles are expreſsly ſtipulated to be free by the treaties already ſubſiſting between the United States and all other nations, with whom they are in compact.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Becauſe it ſurrenders all or moſt of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a commercial nature, which we had a right to expect from our neutrality in the preſent war.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Becauſe it precludes the hope of receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantage from the modern law of nations, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to in the preſident's proclamation of neutrality; adopted by moſt of the nations of Europe, in the laſt
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029752_0164_0FE25482310BF820"/>
war, and which we then acceded to and have ſecuted in our treaties with all other nations.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Becauſe it not only ſurrenders the right of carrying the property of any nation at war with Great Britain, in our veſſels, freely; but abandons all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions even to the freight.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Becauſe it permits the Britiſh nation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert proviſions, deſtined to other nations at war with them, to their own uſe, on payment of what they may deem reaſonable profit—a meaſure, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the intereſt of the American merchant, but which will prevent our citizens from carrying thoſe ſupplies to other countries, which, by the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and nations, they have a right to do, without moleſtation.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Becauſe it limits the power of congreſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to them by the conſtitution, "to regulate our commerce with foreign nations," by preſcribing conditions, and creating impediments to the exerciſe of that "power."</p>
            <p n="19">19. Becauſe it expoſes the United States and their commerce to ſimilar embarraſſments from other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial nations, all of whom will probably regulate our trade by this partial ſtandard.</p>
            <p>And laſtly—</p>
            <p>Becauſe, in the opinion of the inhabitants of this town, the nature and extent of the exports of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States are ſuch, that in all their ſtipulations with foreign nations they have it in their power to ſecure a perfect reciprocity of intercourſe, not only with the home dominions of ſuch nations, but with all their colonial dependencies.</p>
            <p>It is further reſolved—That a copy of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceedings, atteſted by the town-clerk, be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tranſmitted to the preſident of the United States, that they may be reſpectfully ſubmitted to his conſideration. And we earneſtly hope, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rely, that his prudence, fortitude and wiſdom, which have more than once been eminently inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:029752_0165_0FE25484E7552338"/>
in the ſalvation of his country, will be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous on the preſent occaſion; and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have aſſigned will have their influence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to withhold his ſignature from the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this alarming inſtrument.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Auſtin, a vote of thanks was paſſed to Stephens Thompſon Maſon, one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators for Virginia, for his patriotiſm, in publiſhing the treaty, which had afforded the town an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of uſing their exertions in endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ratification of an inſtrument ſo evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the intereſts of our nation at large.</p>

            <head>ADDRESS Of the Citizens of <hi>Portſmouth (New Hampſhire)</hi> agreed upon at a Meeting held the 17th of July, <hi>1795.</hi> TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, Preſident of the United States of America.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>CONVINCED of your inviolable attachment to the intereſt and happineſs of the ſtates over which you preſide, and your readineſs on all occaſions to attend to the juſt complaints of the people—We, the citizens of Portſmouth, conſtitutionally aſſembled in public town meeting, to ſignify our opinions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the treaty between Great Britain and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States of America, conſented to by a majority of the ſenate, and recommended for your ratification, having taken the ſame into our moſt ſerious conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, beg leave to expreſs our moſt hearty diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof—for the following general reaſons, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that part of the treaty of 1783, ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the payment of debts due to Britiſh ſubjects, is rigorouſly enforced; while an important article in the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029752_0166_0FE2548676F369D0"/>ſame treaty, requiring compenſation for negroes and other property unjuſtly removed, is placed wholly out of view.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the 9th article confers a privilege on Britiſh ſubjects, which, though expreſſed in terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, yet from the different circumſtances of the two nations, not only wants an equivalent, but is a direct invaſion of the rights of individual ſtates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the bonds required of commanders of privateers, are wholly inadequate to the purpoſes for which ſuch proviſion was made.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the regulations of trade, commerce and navigation, between the two parties, contained in the 3d, 13th, 15th and 17th articles, hold out the moſt decided advantages to Britiſh ſubjects, and muſt in their operation prove deſtructive to American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe by the 18th article, many articles of export are admitted as contraband of war, which, by our treaties with France, Holland and Sweden, are declared free; by which means a diſpoſition to aid the Britiſh in the deſtruction of the natives of thoſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is fairly implied.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe all the eſſential advantages reſulting to the United States from a ratification of the treaty are ſuch as they have a right to demand either by virtue of the treaty of 1783, or from the principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juſtice, while many important privileges are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Britiſh, without a counter part.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſir, we have ſtated a few of the many objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that might be oppoſed to the treaty; we forbear entering into a more particular detail, as it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be a repetition of thoſe, which we preſume muſt flow in to you from every quarter, as the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and protector of our rights and liberties, and who alone in the preſent inſtance can avert the many evils that threaten our ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="unknown:029752_0167_0FE254880B88BE58"/>We therefore moſt fervently requeſt, that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between Great Britain and the United States, may not receive your ratification until it undergo ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations as ſhall render it conducive to the intereſt, honour and laſting peace of our country.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="resolutions">
            <head>RESOLUTIONS Of the Citizens of <hi>New York,</hi> agreed upon at a Meeting held on Monday the 20th of July, <hi>1795.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>RESOLVED, as the ſenſe of this meeting, That the treaty lately negociated between this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Great Britain, in the particulars herein after mentioned, is injurious to the agriculture, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and commerce of the United States, derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from their national honor, and dangerous to their welfare, peace, and proſperity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In terminating the differences between the two countries, without reference to the merits of their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective complaints and pretenſions, the vague and ill-founded claims of Great Britain are placed upon the ſame footing as the numerous, important, and juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the United States: and while the former, unſupported as they were, are amply provided for, many of the latter are either entirely overlooked, or placed upon a footing, from which no adequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs or compenſation can reaſonably be expected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As his Britannic majeſty is bound by the treaty of peace to withdraw his garriſons from the United States with all convenient ſpeed, it was unjuſt, after twelve years delay, to allow above eighteen months longer to complete an evacuation which might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into effect in a few weeks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As no enumeration is made of the poſts and places from which the Britiſh troops are to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, but generally from the boundary lines aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029752_0168_0FE254919F783A88"/>
by the treaty of peace; and as it appears by the ſame inſtrument that theſe boundary lines are, in part, at leaſt, to be adjuſted hereafter, it is highly probable if ſuch adjuſtment does not take place by June, 1796, that it will be made an excuſe for detaining the poſts yet longer. Beſides, by placing at ſo great a diſtance the contemplated evacuation, it is alſo much to be feared, that an immediate peace in Europe will induce Great Britain to diſregard this ſtipulation altogether.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All ſettlers and traders within the precincts or juriſdictions of theſe poſts, may remain there, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move with their effects; they cannot, however, be compelled to become citizens of, or to take the oath of allegiance to the United States; but they may do so if they think proper, and they ſhall make and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their election within one year after the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And all perſons who continue there after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of a year without having declared their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of remaining ſubjects of his Britannic majeſty, ſhall be conſidered as having elected to become citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States. Hence it appears, that all the ſettlers, if they arrive but the day before the evacuation, will be entitled to become American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, contrary to the act now in force reſpecting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization, and contrary to the conſtitution of the United States, under which that act was paſſed; or if they prefer to continue under their preſent allegiance, we may have a Britiſh colony in the heart of our country.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Although his Britannic majeſty agrees to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the poſts within our boundary lines, no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made for the heavy loſſes and expenſes which have been incurred by the United States in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their paſt detention. Among the former, may be included a long deprivation of an extenſive and valuable territory, and of a lucrative branch of trade. Among the latter, the burdens which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon our citizens to ſupport a ruinous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive Indian war—to ſay nothing of the lives which
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029752_0169_0FE25493B20B95A0"/>
this detention has coſt the United States of America.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By the treaty of peace, Great Britain was to cauſe no deſtruction, nor to carry away any negroes, or other American property. In direct violation of this promiſe, ſeveral thouſand negroes were carried off long after the treaty was known. Many of thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes were regiſtered with a view to future compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The claim, on this account, which amounted to at leaſt two millions of dollars, although hitherto a matter of extreme ſolicitude with America, has not only been abandoned and conſigned to oblivion, but Great Britain is thereby juſtified for her inexecution of the treaty of peace, and an indelible ſtain is fixed upon our national faith; nor is any proviſion made for leaving in thoſe garriſons, the American artillery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the treaty of peace.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Many of our ſeamen have, during the preſent war, been impreſſed into the Engliſh ſervice, and compelled to engage on board of ſhips of war or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, againſt a nation connected with us by a treaty of alliance. Although this grievance was univerſally known and reprobated, the aggreſſion is paſſed over in ſilence, nor is even care taken to guard againſt the repetition of ſo atrocious an outrage.</p>
            <p n="8">8. While the ſubjects of Great Britain are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into, and have the uſe of <hi>all</hi> the rivers, ports, and places within the United States, our citizens are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from a reciprocal uſe of thoſe within the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh territories in North America, by reaſon of which inequality, it is probable, the whole of the for trade will continue in the hands of Britiſh traders.</p>
            <p n="9">9. No duty is ever to be laid by either party on peltries brought by land or inland navigation. From this article Great Britain alone will derive an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for, as the clauſe which regulates the interior traffic and inland navigation of this country is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and taking into conſideration the nature and extent of the limitations on the ſide of America, it may be expected that conſiderable quantities of this
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029752_0170_0FE2549548353240"/>
article will be carried by Britiſh traders through the United States, while little, if any, will be carried by our citizens through the Britiſh territory.</p>
            <p n="10">10. As it appears from the correſpondence between Mr. Jefferſon and Mr. Hammond, that no lawful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments exiſt in any ſtate, to the recovery of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh debts contracted before the peace; it was not only improper, but a reflection on our public faith, to make any proviſion, contrary to the ordinary way of judicial proceeding, for aſcertaining the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to this deſcription of creditors. Moreover, if this clauſe is carried into effect, the burden of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe debts will be ſhared very unequally by the United States. Thoſe of them, whoſe citizens have paid their Britiſh creditors, will be bound to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the payment equally with thoſe whoſe citizens are delinquent, if any ſuch there be; whereas, by purſuing the common legal remedy, the debtor alone would be ſubject to the burden. Nor is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conceived to be competent to pledge the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States to pay the ſum awarded by the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who are to liquidate thoſe claims;—the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having expreſsly declared, that no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations made by law, by which it is preſumed muſt be intended an <hi>act</hi> of the legiſlature, not a <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of commerce.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The claims of American citizens for loſſes ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by reaſon of illegal captures, are to be taken into conſideration at too great a diſtance of time, and are placed upon a footing too precarious to expect any compenſation. It appears evidently to have been the policy of Great Britain to procraſtinate the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all her differences with America, until ſhe was at peace with France; and it has excited general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that ſhe has been ſo ſucceſsful in this part of her negociation. It was expected, that the American envoy was charged to demand ſatisfaction from the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, among other things, particularly for
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029752_0171_0FE25496D8AFD6E8"/>
their wanton and unjuſt depredations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Theſe ſpoliations being made in virtue of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders iſſued by the king in council, and being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly illegal and unjuſt, reſtitution became a national concern. It was well known, that, by the ordinary courſe of proceeding in the admiralty, compenſation could not be obtained for national injuries—Yet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of inſiſting upon a ſummary compenſation from the Britiſh government, in the ſame mode which had been adopted for ſatisfying the Britiſh creditors, the American claimant muſt firſt undergo a tedious and expenſive proceſs, in order to aſcertain a thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy known, that the ordinary courſe of juſtice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to afford him redreſs.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The treaty pledges the United States to the payment of loſſes ſuſtained by reaſon of certain cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures within the limits and juriſdiction of the United States, and brought into the ports of the ſame, or made by veſſels originally armed in our ports.</p>
            <p>The ſum which may be claimed by Great Britain on this account, cannot fail to be very conſiderable: But it may well be doubted, whether the United States are not hereby pledged beyond the obligation which the laws of nations impoſe upon a neutral country.</p>
            <p n="13">13. By permitting Britiſh ſubjects to hold lands which they have already purchaſed within the United States, a right is aſſumed by the executive, of depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral ſtates of the forfeitures which may have already accrued to them by the alieniſm of ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers; and even of diveſting American citizens of the land which they may have purchaſed, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch forfeitures. The policy, alſo, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting aliens to hold real property, may be doubted—Nor is there any real reciprocity in this permiſſion, none, or very few American citizens having bought lands on ſo precarious a tenure in England.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The ſame want of reciprocity may be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that clauſe of the treaty which interdicts the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029752_0172_0FE254A0DBEE6BD0"/>
confiſcation or ſequeſtering of debts due to individuals, or monies held in the public funds, and in banks: However impolitic or unjuſt it may be, in ordinary caſes, to exerciſe this power, yet, as it is ſtrictly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the laws of nations, and may ſometimes be exerted for the prevention of a war, by deterring a nation from further aggreſſion, or to bring an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to reaſonable terms of accommodation, and has been actually exerciſed by Great Britain in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conteſt, it is impolitic, in the extreme, to pledge the public faith never to exerciſe it upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or under any circumſtance whatſoever, eſpecially to a nation who can give us no equivalent for conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this reſtriction, and which, of all others, might be the moſt ſenſibly affected by the uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Our commerce to India is much circumſcribed by the treaty. We are excluded altogether from the coaſting trade, and laid under other unuſual and new reſtrictions. It is true, that this commerce has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been carried on only by permiſſion—But it is preſumed, that the advantage which Great Britain has experienced during twelve years, will induce her to permit its continuance without our unneceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to theſe reſtraints. And if we are excluded altogether from the Britiſh ſettlements in India, other ports, equally advantageous, are open to us.</p>
            <p n="16">16. By the conſtitution, congreſs are to regulate our commerce with foreign nations. This treaty, if ratified, will not only infringe this power, but very greatly ſhackle our government, in their future regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of trade.</p>
            <p>It muſt always have been a matter of much ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with Great Britain, to prevent us from paſſing ſuch diſcriminating acts as circumſtances might render proper—And America, ſituated as ſhe is, ſhould not lightly part with ſuch an invaluable prerogative.</p>
            <p n="17">17. As a neutral and commercial people, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with common prudence, to continue at peace with all the world, the United States ſhould never volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029752_0173_0FE254A26C58BCC8"/>
conſent to any article prohibiting free veſſels from making free goods. This is the caſe with the preſent treaty—by this conceſſion we not only depart from a principle adopted by ſeveral maritime powers, and which congreſs, under this conſideration, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recognized and always purſued, in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other nations; but we put it out of our power to receive any advantage from the modern law of nations referred to in the preſident's proclamation of neutrality, and are even precluded from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the contrary ſtipulations which have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſerted in our treaties with other nations.</p>
            <p n="18">18. In aſcertaining what articles ſhall be deemed contraband, ſeveral are comprehended which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deemed, and are expreſsly declared not to be ſo, in our treaties with other nations, particularly ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timber, tar, hemp, ſails, and copper. Indeed it is difficult to ſay what will not be deemed contraband, as, after a very long enumeration, it is added, that generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſſels, unwrought iron and fir-planks only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall be conſidered in that light. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here, that Great Britain, in her treaty with France, has declared theſe very articles NOT to be contraband.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Veſſels, laden with proviſions, may be ſeized under the frivolous pretext of the difficulty of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the preciſe caſes in which they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as contraband. It is true that a reaſonable mercantile profit is to be allowed; but independent of the difficulty of aſcertaining what ſuch a profit is, of which the Britiſh muſt judge, all the profits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated on the return-cargo, will be loſt; and our citizens, to the great injury of agriculture, will be diſcouraged from the exportation of grain and other proviſion, which, in time of war, muſt be an object of the firſt magnitude.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Great Britain being actually at war, derives an immediate benefit from all thoſe articles which refer to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029752_0174_0FE254A4009C1120"/>
that condition, while it is problematical, whether the United States, even when at war, can at all be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by theſe ſtipulations. Some equivalent might, therefore, reaſonably have been expected for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant advantages which reſult to Great Britain from thoſe parts of the treaty, which contemplate a war between either party and ſome other power.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The treaty is principally calculated to promote the intereſts of Great Britain, pending her preſent conflict with France, to increaſe her reſources, and enable her to proſecute the war with greater vigor and ſucceſs. The citizens of America are thus expoſed to the imputation of the baſeſt ingratitude, if not breach of ſaith, towards a generous and gallantally, to whom they are largely indebted for their freedom and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and to whoſe victories is to be aſcribed the peace which they now enjoy.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The whole treaty may be regarded as peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoſtile to the French republic, and unleſs thoſe who are at the head of her affairs, conduct themſelves with uncommon moderation, a war with France can hardly fail to be one of the conſequences of a ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The reſtraint upon our citizens not to accept commiſſions in the army or navy of foreign powers is impolitic, as it deprives them of a mean of acquiring military knowledge, and that in a way which has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been eſteemed illegal or diſreputable. It is alſo unprecedented; for nothing is more common than for the citizens of one country to ſerve in the army or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of another, for the ſake of honor, inſtruction or reward. The United States, in particular, ſhould encourage ſuch of their youth as are ambitious of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary glory, to a ſervice of this kind. In time of war it is not eaſy to calculate the advantages which might be derived from it.</p>
            <p n="24">24. However proper it may be to diſcourage neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral citizens from engaging on board of the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029752_0175_0FE254A594345918"/>
it may certainly be queſtioned, whether the right of defining and puniſhing piracy does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long excluſively to the legiſlature of the United States. Although a ſimilar proviſion is found in our treaties with other nations, it will be recollected, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at that time, and not in the executive, was veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the right of making treaties.</p>
            <p n="25">25. This treaty would be dangerous as a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for other nations, with whom we may wiſh to make commercial compacts, will expect us to ſubmit to ſimilar embarraſſments, and to have our trade regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by this partial ſtandard.</p>
            <p n="26">26. There is good reaſon to believe, that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is diſagreeable to a very great majority of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the United States; and that even thoſe who do not publicly remonſtrate againſt its ratification, from an opinion that it is the proper province of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to determine on it, ſincerely wiſh it may not take place.</p>
            <p n="27">27. The diſadvantages already enumerated are the more ſtriking, becauſe, from the nature and extent of their exports, the United States have it in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in all their commercial arrangements with foreign nations, to ſecure a perfect reciprocity, not only with their European, but alſo with their foreign, poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as has indeed been offered to them on the part of the French republic.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Beſides the objections already ſtated, it muſt be remarked that the whole treaty abounds with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences whoſe meaning is equivocal, and that too much room is left for doubt, conſtruction and future diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; whereas every ambiguity in an inſtrument of this kind, with ſo powerful a nation, ought to have been ſtudiouſly avoided.</p>
            <p>Reſolved further, that a copy of the preceding reſolutions be ſigned by the chairman, and tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by expreſs to the preſident of the United States, who is hereby informed, that the citizens of New York, aſſembled upon this occaſion, reſpectfully hope,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029752_0176_0FE254B0146855B0"/>
that he will pleaſe to take the ſame into his moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration—they aſſure him that they rely with great confidence on his known patriotiſm, wiſdom, and independence, in the exerciſe of the prerogative veſted in him, and that nothing but the importance of the occaſion ſhould have induced them to obtrude their ſentiments on him. Influenced by no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than a zeal for their country's good, they ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope that the reaſons herein aſſigned, with thoſe which may be offered by their fellow citizens of other ſtates, added to ſuch as his own good ſenſe will not fail to ſuggeſt, will prevail upon him to withhold his aſſent from an inſtrument which has ſpread a general alarm throughout the United States, as invading the conſtitution and legiſlative authority of the country; as abandoning their important and well-founded claims againſt the Brtiſh government; as impoſing unjuſt and impolitic reſtraints on their commerce; as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to agriculture; as conceding, without an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent important advantages, to Great Britain; as hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and ungrateful to France; as committing our peace with that great republic; as unequal in every reſpect to America; as hazarding her internal peace and proſperity, and as derogatory from her ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and independence.</p>

            <p>That, under theſe preliminary acknowledgments of the duty and of the deſign of your memorialiſts, the following objections to a ratification of the treaty lately concluded between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay, are ſubmitted with implicit confidence, to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>The treaty is objected to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it does not provide for a fair and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſettlement of the differences that previouſly ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the United States and Great Britain—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it poſtpones the ſurrender, and affords no compenſation for the detention, of the weſtern poſts—inaſmuch as it cedes, without any equivalent, an indefinite extent of territory to the ſettlers under Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh titles, within the precincts and juriſdiction of thoſe poſts—inaſmuch as it waves a juſt claim for the value of the negroes who were carried off at the cloſe of the war, in violation of a poſitive compact—and inaſmuch as it refers all the hopes of indemnity, for the recent ſpoliations committed on the commerce of the United States, to an equivocal, expenſive, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and uncertain proceſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe by the treaty, the federal government accedes to reſtraints upon the American commerce and navigation, internal as well as external, that embrace no principle of real reciprocity, and are inconſiſtent with the rights, and deſtructive to the intereſts, of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> independent nation—inaſmuch as it unreaſonably fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the intercourſe with the Weſt Indies, with India, and with the American lakes, by means of the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable rivers belonging to the Britiſh—inaſmuch as, in many inſtances, it circumſcribes the navigation of the United States to a particular voyage—and, inaſmuch as ſome of our ſtaple commodities (exempted by the
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029752_0179_0FE254B60C6825C0"/>
treaties with France, Holland, Pruſſia, and Sweden) it makes liable to confiſcation, as contraband; and others (exempted by the law of nations) it makes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſeizure, upon payment of an arbitrary price, as articles uſeful to the enemies of Great Britain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Bccauſe the treaty is deſtructive to the domeſtic independence and proſperity of the United States—inaſmuch as it admits aliens, profeſſing a foreign alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, to the permanent and tranſmiſſible rights of property, peculiarly belonging to a citizen—and inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it enables Great Britain to draw an invidious and dangerous line of circumvallation round the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the union, by her fleets on the Atlantic, and by her ſettlements from Nova Scotia to the mouth of the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the treaty ſurrenders certain inherent powers of an independent government, which are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, in the circumſtances of the United States, to their ſafety and defence; and which might, on great emergencies, be ſucceſsfully employed to enforce the neglected claims of juſtice, without making the laſt, dreadful appeal to arms;—inaſmuch as the right of ſequeſtration; the right of regulating commerce, in favor of a friendly, and againſt a rival, power; and the right of ſuſpending a commercial intercourſe, with an inimical nation, are voluntarily abandoned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe the treaty is an infraction of the rights of friendſhip, gratitude, and alliance, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of France may juſtly claim from the United States; and deprives the United States of the moſt powerful means to ſecure the good will and good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of other nations;—inaſmuch as it alters, during a war, the relative ſituation of the different nations, advantageouſly to Great Britain, and prejudicially to the French republic;—inaſmuch as it is in manifeſt colliſion with ſeveral articles of the American treaty with France;—and inaſmuch as it grants to Great Britain certain high, dangerous, and excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>

               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:029752_0180_0FE254BFB6E9E838"/>And your memorialiſts, having this, upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ground, conciſely, but explicitly, avowed their wiſhes and opinions; and forbearing a minute ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the many other objections that occur;—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with an aſſurance, that by refuſing to ratify the projected treaty, you will, according to their beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and judgment, at once evince an exalted attachment to the principles of the conſtitution of the United States, and an undiminiſhed zeal to advance the proſperity and happineſs of your conſtituents.</p>

               </gap>ipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which ought to be the baſis of all contracts—that it contains no proviſions in favor of the United States, in any manner proportionate to the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions made to Great Britain; and reſtricts congreſs in the exerciſe of its conſtitutional power of regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade, and making ſuch diſcriminations in favor of other foreign nations, as may be moſt beneficial.</p>
            <p>From many well-founded objections, your commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee beg leave to ſelect and ſubmit the following:</p>
            <p>The firſt article, though uſual in treaties, would be particularly miſchievous in this, inaſmuch as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the unconditional return, to our country, of all perſons who were proſcribed during the late war, though their return is repugnant to our laws, and to the feelings of our injured fellow citizens, and though the ſtate legiſlatures have already proceeded as far in re-admitting ſuch perſons, as they judged conſiſtent with good faith, or ſound policy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond article ſanctions the continuance of an injury, which, in violation of the treaty of peace, has already exiſted eleven years: it either eſtabliſhes a Britiſh colony within our limits, with peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, or, in caſe the inhabitants of ſuch colony chuſe to become citizens of the United States, it gives the privileges of citizens of theſe ſtates to a number of men, who have been their moſt bitter and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enemies; who, in conjunction with the ſavages, have lately waged war againſt us, and who, from their local ſituation in the vicinity of the Indian tribes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently may, and from their diſpoſition (as far as we can judge from their paſt conduct) would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to join with them, in acting againſt us on any favorable emergency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:029752_0182_0FE254C2D9DBD3C8"/>The third article gives to the Britiſh, what to them, with their capital, will be nearly equivalent to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of the trade with the Indians, and with our weſtern territories, and opens a door for ſmuggling on an extenſive ſcale, to the great injury of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
            <p>By the ſixth article, the United States undertake to make good ſuch loſſes on debts, to Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as have been occaſioned by legal impediments, to their recovery, created by any of the ſtates, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation (as is alleged) of the treaty of peace; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the firſt infraction of that treaty, was made on the part of Great Britain, by carrying away from theſe ſtates many thouſands of negroes, and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of valuable property, whereby indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals were deprived of the means of diſcharging their debts; although the United States have incurred an immenſe expenſe in maintaining an army for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their northern and weſtern territory; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe actually occaſioned in conſequence of the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the weſtern poſts; and although no compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is ſtipulated to be made to the citizens, whoſe negroes, and other property, have been illegally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off; their right of recovery being paſſed over in ſilence. Thus the United States are compelled to make ample reparation, for the only infringement of the treaty, which is charged on any of their citizens; whilſt neither the union, nor its citizens, have even a promiſe of compenſation, for the many injuries ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by violations of the ſaid treaty, on the part of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>This article, moreover, erects a tribunal new and unknown to our conſtitution, inaſmuch as it transfers the right of deciding on the claims of Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, from the courts and juries of America, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; a majority of whom may be Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and by their deciſions, tax the revenue of theſe ſtates at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:029752_0183_0FE254C4670A9160"/>The ſeventh article makes reſtitution for the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpoliations lately committed on our commerce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, expenſive and uncertain; though juſtice, and the circumſtances of our injured citizens demanded that it ſhould have been immediate and complete; while, on the other hand, full compenſation, on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fixed principles, is ſtipulated to be made by the United States, for all property which has been taken by privateers, equipped in our ports, or which has been captured within our limits.</p>
            <p>The twelfth article gives us no other privilege than that of carrying in American veſſels (not exceeding ſeventy tons burden) ſuch articles of the growth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, or production of theſe ſtates, as are not, and ſhall not be prohibited by Great-Britain, from being carried to her Weſt-India Iſlands, and of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, in ſuch American veſſels, ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of thoſe iſlands, as may be carried from thence to the United States in Britiſh veſels:—In return for this privilege (which, reſtricted as it is, is of no value) we are made to ſurrender the right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting in our own veſſels, to any part of the world, melaſſes, ſugar, coffee and cocoa, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Britiſh iſlands, or of any other place, whilſt the Britiſh, and all other foreign powers, have a right to ſend thoſe very articles, in their veſſels, from our ports.—We are precluded from exporting in our own veſſels, not only foreign cotton, but the cotton of our own growth, although the privilege of exporting that article, from hence, in their own veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is given to the Britiſh. It precludes us from ſupplying our allies, the French, with ſeveral articles, which they conſider as of prime neceſſity, and which, in the exiſting ſtate of things, they cannot (without great riſk and difficulty) obtain from their Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia iſlands, but through the medium of neutral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, more particularly the United States. In fact, it has placed the commodities, above mentioned, on a footing far worſe for us than if they were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029752_0184_0FE254CD4CDDB380"/>
of war; inaſmuch as contraband articles are only prohibited from being carried to powers at war: but theſe articles cannot, under the reſtrictions of the treaty, be carried by veſſels of the United States, to any nation, either in time of war, or of peace.</p>
            <p>Although it is recommended, that a ſuſpenſion of this article ſhould precede the ratification of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet it having been alſo recommended to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to proceed, without delay, to further negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations with his Britannic majeſty, on the ſubject of trade to his Weſt-India iſlands, and on the terms and conditions mentioned in this article, your committee have, therefore, thought proper to ſubmit theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on it.</p>
            <p>The ſeventeenth article, makes a formal recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the right of Great-Britain to ſearch Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels, for property on board ſuch veſſels, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to belong to any power, with which ſhe is at war: it authorizes her to carry into her ports, every American veſſel, which the officers of her men of war, and privateers, may ſuſpect to have ſuch property on board: and engages to deliver up all ſuch property, though of our friends and allies, which ſhall be on board: whereas France, and every nation, with which we have a treaty, have expreſsly declared, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, and protect property on board of them, to whomſoever it may belong.</p>
            <p>By authorizing ſuch ſearches, a general ſearch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is given to Britiſh privateers. This article eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes principles as the law of nations, which juſtify many of the late ſpoliations committed by Britiſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of war, on the commerce of theſe ſtates; and of courſe authorize the repetition of ſuch ſpolia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on, which would be extremely detrimental to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> commerce. The capture and detention of American, by Britiſh veſſels, under the authority of this article, will put American ſeamen wholly in the power of the Britiſh; yet no proviſion is made to protect and ſecure them
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:029752_0185_0FE2537337718310"/>
from being impreſſed into the Britiſh ſervice, though daily experience evinces the neceſſity of requiring a clear and unequivocal ſtipulation for the protection and ſecurity of that valuable claſs of men.</p>
            <p>By the firſt ſection of the eighteenth article, all timber, for ſhip building, tar, roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp, cordage, and in general whatever may ſerve directly for the equipment of veſſels (unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted) are declared to be contraband, and juſt objects of confiſcation—whereas thoſe articles, in all our other treaties, are expreſsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged not to be contraband, but free. Thus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica concedes to Great Britain. what ſhe has never conceded to any other power.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the ſecond ſection of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth article, an attempt is made to bring even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions under the head of contraband. This, if effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in conjunction with the preceding clauſe, will comprehend as contraband, almoſt all the important ſtaples of theſe ſtates. Such an extenſion of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band muſt prove ruinous to our commerce, eſpecially as Great Britain affects to hold whole countries in a ſtate of blockade.</p>
            <p>The twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth articles, have a tendency to embroil us with the French republic, and in the exiſting ſtate of things, to make our ſea port towns ſcenes of riot and bloodſhed. Theſe articles alſo tend to make a common cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and Great Britain, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and diſtreſs our allies.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, your committee apprehend that great evils would reſult to theſe ſtates from this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if ratified, they therefore, recommend that an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs be prepared, and preſented to the preſident of the United States, praying that he will not ratify the ſaid treaty.</p>
            <p>The above report was agreed to, and tranſmitted to the preſident.</p>

            <p>WE perceive, with pain and regret, that you are urged, with much intemperance and heat, to meet to-morrow, not to conſider and diſcuſs the treaty lately negociated with Great Britain, and to expreſs the conviction which ſhall ariſe from a fair examination of its merits, but to condemn and oppoſe it as a thing prejudged.</p>
            <p>You are told that it is ignominious and diſgraceful; that it <hi>ſurrenders rights and privileges ruinous to our commerce—that it yields advantages which we ought never to part with but with our lives;</hi> that it makes ſacrifices for which we have no equivalent; in ſhort, that it ſettles principles dangerous to the liberties and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people, and deſtructive of our freedom and independence.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſtrong charges indeed againſt the treaty—If they can be made out, it certainly deſerves the reprobation of every good citizen; and no man, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the intereſts of his country, ought to withhold the expreſſion of his abhorrence of it.</p>
            <p>But ought we haſtily to believe that ſuch charges can be well founded? Can we eaſily be perſuaded, that the citizen who negociated the treaty, and who on all former occaſions has given decided proof of fidelity and patriotiſm, could of a ſudden become ſo baſe a betrayer of the rights and intereſts of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Can we imagine that two-thirds of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the United States, in their ſenate, would have ſanctioned ſo foul a treaſon? Can we think our interpoſition neceſſary to prevent the ratification of ſuch a treaty by that wiſe and virtuous man, that long and well-tried ſervant of his country, in whom the executive authority of the United States is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:029752_0193_0FE254EDBA421BB8"/>No, Fellow citizens! it is impoſſible that the frightful picture given of the treaty can be a juſt one.—Such charges are better proofs of the intemperance of thoſe who make them, than of the defects of the treaty.</p>
            <p>You cannot but be ſenſible that the treaty, if ſuch as it is repreſented, muſt affect deeply the intereſts of the mercantile claſs. You cannot doubt that the merchants are attentive to their intereſts, and you can hardly ſuppoſe that they are ignorant of them.</p>
            <p>For our part, we proſeſs to you frankly, that we have not yet been able to diſcover in the treaty, thoſe hideous features which are alledged to exiſt; yet we are diſpoſed to meet the reſt of our fellow citizens and to promote with them a fair and rational diſcuſſion of the ſubject. We truſt, however, that they reſpect themſelves too much not to make this a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary to their pronouncing an opinion—and that they will unite with us in rejecting any propoſitions which ſhall be attempted to be impoſed upon them without due inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>Meeting them on this baſis, our ears will be open to truth, and we ſhall be ready, according to the beſt of our underſtandings, to concur in any meaſures which can be ſhown to be conſiſtent with the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of our country. We doubt not, you will all bring with you the ſame diſpoſitions, and we earneſtly recommend a general attendance upon the occaſion, in order that the true ſenſe of the city may appear.</p>

            <head>At a ſpecial Meeting of the Corporation of the <hi>New York</hi> Chamber of Commerce, held at the Tontine Coffee-Houſe, on Tueſday the 21ſt of July, <hi>1795,</hi>—The late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation having been previouſly read, the following Reſolutions, with the Preamble thereto, were propoſed, and adopted, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS, the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, lately ſanctioned by the ſenate, has been made the ſubject of public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, in the warmth of which, miſconſtructions and miſrepreſentations have contributed to excite and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the public mind.</p>
            <p>And, Whereas a diſpoſition has appeared, in certain inſtances, to influence the executive againſt the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſaid treaty, whereby the tranquillity and proſperity of our country may be endangered:—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>Reſolved, as the opinion of the corporation, That the ſaid treaty, collectively conſidered, contains as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny features of reciprocity, as, upon contemplating the relative intereſts of the reſpective countries, could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably have been expected. And that the precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous privileges of the American trade to Great Britain and her colonies, are, by this treaty, changed into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent rights.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, That the proviſions in the ſaid treaty, for a quiet ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, and an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adjuſtment of the Britiſh debts, a fair compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſpoliations upon our commerce, and for the prevention of future depredations, are wiſely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged for the great purpoſes of national juſtice, and to preſerve the bleſſings of peace.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, That if the treaty ſhould fail to be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, we ſhould apprehend a ſtate of things which might lead to hoſtilities; in which event, our navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (now diſperſed in all quarters of the globe) may be intercepted, our under-writers injured, our commerce abridged, our produce reduced to little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:029752_0195_0FE254F1F89FA6B8"/>
our artizans, mechanics and labourers deprived of employment, our revenue diminiſhed, and the lives of our fellow citizens ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, That although the ratification of this treaty, for the foregoing reaſons, appears to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all circumſtances, expedient; yet we cheerfully reſt it where it is placed by the conſtitution: in full confidence, that the wiſdom and firmneſs under which our independence has been atchieved, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to wealth, power, and reſpectability promoted beyond a parallel, will, in this inſtance, determine for the beſt intereſts of this country.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, That the preſident of this chamber cauſe a copy of theſe reſolutions to be certified by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and tranſmitted without delay to the preſident of the United States.</p>

            <p>I OBSERVE in the newſpapers, that it ſeems to be univerſally taken for granted, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident has a negative on the proceedings of the ſenate, reſpecting the treaty with Great-Britain. We are informed, that petitions are framing, to be preſented to him, to withhold his aſſent to the treaty; and that wagers, to a conſiderable amount, have been actually laid, that he will accede to it, or reject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:029752_0196_0FE254F9DAA4B590"/>
according as the wiſhes or principles of perſons have preponderated on the ſubject. I confeſs, ſir, I have been a little ſurpriſed at all this; becauſe I by no means think the poſition an obvious and undeniable one, that the preſident has a controuling power, in the <hi>preſent ſtage</hi> of the buſineſs, on what the ſenate have done.</p>
            <p>The words of the conſtitution are, "he (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident) ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the ſenators preſent, concur; and he ſhall nominate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, ſhall appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments are not herein otherwiſe provided for, and which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law."</p>
            <p>From theſe expreſſions it is clear, the preſident can make no treaty, nor appoint an ambaſſador, without the conſent and advice of the ſenate. It is, therefore, of great importance to aſcertain the <hi>time when</hi> this <hi>conſent and advice</hi> of the ſenate is to be given, and the force and meaning of the expreſſions. In the uſual and ordinary method of appointing officers, the moment the ſenate conſent to the nomination made by the preſident, and adviſe him to make the appointment, it is allowed, on all hands, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally obliged to appoint ſuch officer. The ſenate indeed make uſe of the words, "<hi>conſent and</hi> adviſe," in reply to the preſident's nomination of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to fill offices. But theſe words are the technical and conſtitutional language preſcribed to them; and while they deprive <hi>him</hi> of all option as to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do clearly imply an obligation to appoint on <hi>the part</hi> of the preſident. In the caſe of a treaty being laid before the ſenate, and their giving their conſent, and adviſing the preſident to ratify it, I can ſee no reaſon why a ſimilar conſtruction ſhould not be adopted. The words are the ſame in both caſes,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029752_0197_0FE254FB6A5B8568"/>
except that in the appointment of officers, the word "nominate," is neceſſarily introduced. The treaty, in the <hi>firſt inſtance,</hi> is made by the preſident—and he may therefore be conſidered as having conſtitutionally uſed that <hi>power of making treaties,</hi> with the conſent and advice of the ſenate, which the conſtitution has given him. His laying it afterwards before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for their advice and conſent, is not merely with a view to conſult them or take their opinion. If this were the caſe, the ſenate of the United States would be a collection of mere cyphers. If the preſident can, in this manner, put his veto on their "advice and conſent" (words which I apprehend are equivalent to an order or command) it is evident, that inſtead of the ſenate having any real power in the making of treaties, they will not have even the ſhadow of it. The preſident will be the <hi>ſole maker</hi> of all treaties: and ſhould it happen, which is very poſſible, that the ſenate unanimouſly conſent to a treaty and adviſe the ratification of it, ſtill the preſident may refuſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their advice and over-rule the opinion of the whole ſenate. However clearly and unanimouſly they may concur in the idea, that the treaty is highly benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to their country, yet the opinion of a ſingle man is ſufficient to outweigh the united judgment of the whole ſenate on this moſt intereſting queſtion. This doctrine does not look very republican; and ſeems to claſh with the general principles of the conſtitution, which has guarded, with extreme caution, againſt truſting power in the hands of <hi>one,</hi> in oppoſition to the wiſhes and opinions of <hi>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be ſuppoſed, the preſident receives a treaty from a foreign miniſter, and that he cordially diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it. The ſenate, however, on his laying it before them, think quite differently, and <hi>unanimouſly</hi> give their conſert to it, and adviſe him to ratify it.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, pray, Mr. Brown, whoſe opinion is to decide the queſtion? Is the preſident, by refuſing to ratify the treaty, to defeat the wiſhes of the United
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029752_0198_0FE254FCFACE4E58"/>
States, as expreſſed by the united voice of the whole national body? I confeſs, ſir, I extremely doubt whether this be the genuine conſtruction of the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution—it would rather ſeem, the <hi>power</hi> he has of making treaties, with the advice and conſent of two-thirds of the ſenators, ſhould be deemed to extend no further than his making them, in <hi>the firſt inſtance,</hi> through the medium or channel of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign minſter, and that, when laid before ſenate, their opinion is <hi>final</hi> thereon.</p>
            <p>This conſtruction will ſatisfy the words of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, without making a cypher of the preſident on the one hand, or of the whole ſenatorial body on the other. The preſident, according to this idea, will poſſeſs the <hi>power of making treaties,</hi> but not to the excluſion of the ſenate. And the ſenate, by their <hi>"conſent and advice,"</hi> will poſſeſs the ultimatum on the ſubject of foreign treaties, which the conſtitution has veſted in them.</p>
            <p>What are the forms of making treaties by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive of the United States, I am not certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but have underſtood, he ſends abroad the miniſter, without <hi>previouſly</hi> communicating to the ſenate the inſtructions given to him. A treaty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, made under ſuch circumſtances, may, with great propriety, be viewed as one <hi>made</hi> by the preſident within the words of the conſtitution. And it would be ſtrange to ſay, that he ſhould not only have the firſt concoction of the treaty, but the ultimate power of rejecting it, in oppoſition to the ſenate; making them a parcel of non-entities. And on the other hand, even if the inſtructions for the uſe of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, down up by the preſident, are laid before the ſenate, and approved of by them, I do not ſee how, this could alter the caſe; becauſe the preſident, by ſuch act, has exerciſed his <hi>power in making the treaty,</hi> and therefore can never afterwards controul the vote of the ſenate, approving or rejecting ſuch treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:029752_0199_0FE25620A7624E50"/>In ſhort, Mr. Brown, the conſtruction that will be moſt agreeable to the ſcope, ſpirit, and genius of the conſtitution, and <hi>at all times hereafter</hi> ſafe for the United States (for too much power cannot be truſted to the preſent illuſtrious character who fills the office of the executive) will be, to conſider the preſident's laying a treaty before the ſenate, in the ſame light as his nominating a gentleman to an office. In this latter caſe, their conſent and advice is equivalent to a command, and carries with it a <hi>conſtitutional obligation</hi> to appoint the perſon nominated. In like manner, their conſent to a treaty made by the preſident, and their advice to him to ratify it, are final, concluſive, and obligatory upon him. In both caſes, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated by the conſtitution as the agent, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or prime mover in the buſineſs. But it is the ſenate, <hi>ſtrictly ſpeaking,</hi> who <hi>make</hi> the treaty, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the officer, <hi>through the means</hi> and by the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the preſident; who poſſeſſes the <hi>power</hi> indeed of bringing the objects into the view and contemplation of <hi>that</hi> body—and <hi>that</hi> is <hi>all.</hi>

               <p>THE treaty between Great Britain and America has been a matter of great public expectation, and it has been rendered more intereſting by the time and manner in which the negociation originated.</p>
               <p>Before the revolution in America, the people of the then colonies were under the government of Great
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029752_0200_0FE24BCFD29362E8"/>
Britain; they conſidered themſelves as children of the ſame family; their trade was almoſt limited to the Britiſh dominions; the Americans had eſtates in Great Britain, and monies in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> funds; an extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce had created innumerable debts and connections between the two countries, which could not be at once diſcharged and diſſolved.</p>
               <p>A long, expenſive, and bloody war, to reſiſt the unjuſt claims of the Britiſh parliament, attended with many inſtances of atrocious cruelty and perfidy on the part of the Britiſh governors and commanders, alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the affections of the great body of Americans from the mother country. On the reſtoration of peace, however, and the acquiſition of independence, the enmity of the Americans gradually ſubſided; and the uſefulneſs of the commerce of England to theſe ſtates, being every where experienced, ſoon revived the habits of friendly intercourſe between America and Great Britain, which had been interrupted by the war—an intercourſe which was not much affected by the controverſies between the two governments on account of the inexecution of the treaty of peace. Almoſt as ſoon as the acceptance and organization of a conſtitution for the United States had given them a national capacity, it was the wiſh and deſire of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to form a commercial treaty with Great Britain; and Mr. Jefferſon, in a letter to Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, requeſted to know, whether he was authorized to enter into a negociation for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances which operated to defeat the attempts of our executive, and the controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the governments of the two countries, relative to the non-fulfilment of the treaty on one ſide and the other, are in every man's recollection;—it is needleſs to mention them here. It is ſufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the preſident was authorized by the public wiſhes, to negociate a commercial treaty with Great
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029752_0201_0FE24BD1F1A3EE78"/>
Britain; and he is veſted with full powers for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The uinform deſire of congreſs on this ſubject, is a complete anſwer to all cavils about the exertion of the preſident's conſtitutional powers. It was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the United States, that requeſted and urged for a negociation.</p>
               <p>This alſo is an anſwer to the men who ſay, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America ſuppoſed the appointment of Mr. Jay as envoy extraordinary, was intended only to demand and procure a redreſs of wrongs, and indemnification for ſpoliations on our trade; and not for the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of a commercial treaty.—Whatever opinion peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple formed of the embaſſy, the inſtructions given to the envoy were in purſuance of conſtitutional powers; and if the people are ſurprized with a treaty of amity and commerce, before they expected it, this forms no objection to the treaty itſelf.</p>
               <p>The time ſelected for this negociation, and the exerciſe of the preſident's powers, at the critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the public mind in America was in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flame, on account of the ſeizure of our veſſels by Britiſh privateers, and when hoſtilities were expected between the two countries, however offenſive to a party in America, are among the moſt fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this whole buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The ſequeſtration bill, then before congreſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in it the events of peace or war. The bill, had it paſſed, would have been conſidered by Great Britain equivalent to iſſuing letters of marque and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, and tantamount to a declaration of hoſtilities; and probably that act, had it been ſanctioned by the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature, would have plunged us into the preſent moſt calamitous war.</p>
               <p>Such a conſequence was conſidered by the preſident as little leſs than inevitable. As a conſtituent branch of the legiſlature, and chief magiſtrate of the nation, he had a right to exert the powers he poſſeſſed—and if he thought the houſe of repreſentatives were raſh
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029752_0202_0FE254FE8D561FA0"/>
in their meaſures, it was his <hi>duty,</hi> as the chief guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the public ſafety, to exert any of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional powers for the purpoſes of arreſting thoſe meaſures. It was as much his right and his duty to interpoſe negociation as a means of checking any meaſures that he deemed inconſiſtent with our national intereſt, if he judged that the beſt means, as it is to give his negative to a bill that has paſſed the other branches of the legiſlature, when he judges the bill unconſtitutional or inexpedient.</p>
               <p>The <hi>right</hi> of the preſident to interpoſe negociation, at the time he did, cannot be diſputed. The <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of the meaſure will perhaps never be admitted by its oppoſers; but every ſubſequent event has ſerved to convince the friends of our preſent adminiſtration, that the meaſure was highly expedient and the time well choſen.</p>
               <p>That the preſident was right in reſorting to a <hi>peaceable demand</hi> of indemnification for ſpoliations on our commerce, is capable of the higheſt proof. The law of nations makes it a duty, on the part of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus injured, to make a peaceable requiſition of damages or reſtoration of property, from the aggreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nation, before the commencement of hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>Vattel, book 3, chap. 3, lays it down in the moſt unequivocal language, that an injured nation has no right to reſort to force for ſatisfaction, until other means of obtaining it have proved fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>In conformity with this principle of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is often ſtipulated by treaty, that letters of marque and repriſal ſhall not be granted by an injured nation, until means of redreſs have been ſought in the ordinary courſe of juſtice. Of this tenor is the third article of the treaty of navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Great Britain and Spain, dated 1713.</p>
               <p>It was in pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ce of this moſt ſalutary principle, that the preſident appointed an envoy extraordinary at the time he did; and it was undoubtedly, in other
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029752_0203_0FE255064975A180"/>
reſpects, highly expedient; as no moment could be more eligible for a negociation with England, than when ſhe was engaged in an expenſive and unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful war: a war that entrenches deeply on her reſources, and demands a minute attention to her commercial intereſts.</p>
               <p>But my oppoſers will ſay, "We admit the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, of negociation, before the commencement of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities; but we contend that our envoy ſhould have been reſtricted to a demand of the weſtern poſts, and indemnification for loſſes by illegal captures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of our veſſels and property. It was never underſtood, that Mr. Jay had inſtructions to make a commercial treaty."</p>
               <p>This objection amounts to nothing, and deſerves no anſwer. The preſident had as good a right to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize Mr. Jay to conclude a treaty of amity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce as any other man; and he had the ſame right to chooſe one time as another.</p>
               <p>Having made theſe preliminary remarks on the origin of this negociation and treaty, I will proceed to anſwer ſuch objections to the treaty as have come to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The daily invectives of newſpaper paragraphiſts will be paſſed without notice. This is treating them as they deſerve to be treated, and as they are in fact treated by the public.</p>
               <p>A writer in a morning paper under the ſignature of <hi>Decius,</hi> appears to have aſſailed the treaty with more ingenuity than any other writer whoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have read; and it is probable that his writings compriſe the amount and force of all the objections that are made to it. I ſhall therefore take his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the order they are publiſhed, and endeavour to prove them of little weight, or wholly unfounded.</p>
               <p>The firſt remarks of this writer are aimed at the candour and integrity of the twenty members of the ſenate, who, he inſinuates, ratified the treaty from <hi>motives of party ſpirit.</hi> He does not indeed exempt
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029752_0204_0FE25508F4CB9C18"/>
the minorty from the ſame cenſure of their conduct. But what refutes the inſinuation is, the rejection of the twelfth article by the men thus criminated. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſpirit of party was not the governing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; for party-ſpirit is unconceding and goes all lengths to carry its points. The rejection of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, becauſe it entrenches too much on our carrying trade, in the opinion of thoſe gentlemen, is a proof that the <hi>intereſt of commerce and the public good</hi> were the motives of their conduct in aſſenting to every other part of the treaty.</p>
               <p>His next remark is levelled at the ſecrecy of the ſenate, in conducting the debates on the treaty. "Is not this ſecrecy alone, ſays <hi>Decius,</hi> "a proof that the ſenate conceived it diſgraceful and prejudicial to the United States?"</p>
               <p>Let me aſk that writer a candid queſtion: Has not every treaty which we have made with other nations been concluded and ratified in ſecret? And is there one of thoſe treaties diſgraceful or prejudicial to our nation? No objection was formerly made to theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ratifications. Why ſhould reaſons now exiſt for opening the diſcuſſion of treaties to the people, which did not exiſt in 1783 and 1785? The reaſon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious: Americans were formerly under no influence but that of propriety; they acted themſelves—Now a party of them have deſerted the principles which formerly guided our councils, and appear to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious only of finding opportunities to rail at all ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wiſdom, and to commit our intereſts to paſſion and party.</p>
               <p>The ſecrecy of negociations with foreign powers, through every ſtage of the buſineſs, is dictated by ſound policy. By making treaties public before they are ratified, advantages would often be loſt, and by deſtroying confidence and freedom of communication, the buſineſs would be often impeded or wholly defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nothing marks the ſenſe of mankind on this ſubject, better than the practice of individuals, who
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029752_0205_0FE2550A893302D0"/>
generally uſe ſecrecy in all important contracts of their own. This common practice is a proof of its utility. Much more neceſſary is it in treaties, which are nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal contracts or conventions.</p>
               <p>Another remark of <hi>Decius,</hi> worthy of notice, is, that the "firſt impreſſions made by the treaty were unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable—all men and all <hi>ranks</hi> [what ranks? this writer has certainly forgotten one article of democracy—equality] united in condemning it."</p>
               <p>This remark has ſome foundation, and the fact is eaſily accounted for. The firſt impreſſions on the minds of the public were made by an abſtract of the treaty, which was publiſhed incorrectly, and there are ſtrong ſuſpicions that it was done with the inſidious view of exciting improper impreſſions. The abſtract was ſaid to have been made from memory. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true. It is not in the power of man, after the moſt careful peruſal, to make out ſo large an abſtract, without the help of notes, of twenty eight articles of a treaty, without intermixing the articles in the ſketch. The buſineſs muſt have been done with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and it was inexcuſable in any man to offer to the public a <hi>ſketch,</hi> much more an <hi>incorrect</hi> one, of ſo important an inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Theſe unfavorable impreſſions, however, anſwered the views of men who perfectly well underſtood the importance of <hi>prepoſſeſſing</hi> the public mind They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a temporary clamor, and have perhaps made a few weak friends to an expiring cauſe.</p>
               <p>But the clamer of the moment ſubſided on reading a correct copy ot he treaty—men all agreed it was not ſo bad as they expected. Still many well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people do not underſtand it; and every poſſible effort is uſed to diſtort and miſconſtrue ſome paſſages of the treaty which affect the commerce of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</p>
               <p>The violent cenſure of the treaty which prevailed on its firſt publication, in ſkeleton, and the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the clamor on further peruſal of it, inſtead of
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029752_0206_0FE2550C1946FA50"/>
being a proof that the treaty is in itſelf bad, is a ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial argument in its favor—it is a proof that it bears examination—and it is a proof, further, of what we ſhould all regret, that the <hi>paſſions</hi> of men outſtrip their <hi>judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should the final reſult of the buſineſs prove to be, what I am confident it will be, a general conviction that the treaty is, on the whole, a favorable one for the United States, and the moſt favorable of any treaty we have yet formed; the public will view with indignation, the inſidious attempts that have been made to excite a ferment, and oppoſition to its ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as well as to load with unmerited cenſure the able miniſter who conducted the negociation.</p>

               <head>No. II.</head>
               <p>THE preamble of the treaty, ſays <hi>Decius,</hi> is not free from objections. It ſtates that the differences; between the countries are to be terminated "without reference to the merits of their complaints." <hi>Decius</hi> ſays, the merits of the controverſy ſhould never be loſt ſight of. But when this expreſſion is explained, I believe every candid man will juſtify it in the preſent inſtance. The <hi>merits of the complaints,</hi> in this inſtance, refer ſolely to the queſtion, "which party firſt violated the treaty of peace." On the firſt opening of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation between the miniſters of the, two countries, this became an important point of diſcuſſion. The American envoy alleged the firſt breach of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be on the part of Great Britain, and mentioned the carrying away of the negroes.</p>
               <p>The English miniſter maintained that this was a violation of the treaty. As this ſubject has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned as much altercation as any point between the two countries, and as the ſilence of the present treaty on that ſubject, is the ground of violent clamor, I will anticipate a conſideration of this point, which would more properly fall under a ſubſequent; article.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:029752_0207_0FE255159C62D880"/>Whenever our miniſters have urged the claim of reſtitution or compenſation for the negroes, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh miniſtry have, invariably, anſwered them with the following remarks:</p>
               <p>"The negroes carried from America by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh armies, were taken by the troops an their march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es through the country, or came in, by proclamation and put themſelves under our protection.</p>
               <p>"The clauſe of the treaty on which you ground your claim is in theſe words—"his Britannic majeſty ſhall, with all conveinient ſpeed, and without cauſing any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> eſtruction, or carrying away <hi>any negroes</hi> or <hi>other proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of the <hi>American</hi> inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>"By the laws of the American ſtates negroes are conſidered as <hi>property</hi> as much as cattle; you claim them as <hi>property</hi> for the men who were their proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. By the laws of war, univerſally admitted, every ſpecies of moveable property found and taken in an enemy's country, becomes the property of the captors. By the ſeizure and poſſeſſion of the negroes, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh armies became the rightful owners; the negroes were <hi>booty,</hi> as much as the horſes and cattle taken by the ſame troops.</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe an American boat loaded with goods, to be taken, on one of your rivers in the time of war, would not that boat and goods bt a fair prize? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a horſe to ſtray into the Britiſh lines and be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, would not that horſe belong to the captors? Could a claim be reaſonably interpoſed for reſtitution or compenſation in theſe caſes? Whether they were ſeduced or forced from the plantations, if they were <hi>property,</hi> that property, on their coming into poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Britiſh army, was changed, according to all ihe laws of war.</p>
               <p>"The clauſe of the treaty contemplates negroes which were <hi>American property</hi> at the date of the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. "Negroes or <hi>other</hi> property" are the words. But the negroes which our troops had taken in their
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029752_0208_0FE255184DFEE6A8"/>
marches, or which had put themſelves under their protection, were not, at that time, the <hi>property</hi> of Americans.</p>
               <p>"On this conſtruction, which we hold to be the only rational one, that clauſe of the treaty will not maintain your claim. The treaty may include ſlaves which were within the Britiſh lines, in poſſeſſion of their American maſters; but there is no pretence that ſuch were carried away by the Britiſh troops.</p>
               <p>"Beſides, we cannot ſurrender negroes which came into our lines on the faith of proclamations, without a violation of that faith; which cannot be done. We promiſed them freedom and protection—we gave them that freedom, and we muſt protect them."</p>
               <p>Such is the ſubſtance of the miniſtry's reply, to the claims of our envoy, which were repeatedly urged without ſucceſs.—And the Britiſh miniſtry have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably put the ſame conſtruction on that clauſe of the treaty of peace. Indeed it ſeems difficult to anſwer this reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Either the negroes were <hi>ſlaves</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> or they were not. If they were ſlaves and property, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the laws of moſt of the American ſtates, the Britiſh had the ſame right to ſeize and carry them away as booty, as they had to ſeize and carry away horſes and cattle; a right of war that was never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. In this caſe, the property was changed the moment they came into the poſſeſſion of the Britiſh armies, and at the date of the treaty, they were <hi>not</hi> American property, and conſequently <hi>not</hi> included in the ſtipulation of the treaty.</p>
               <p>If, on the other hand, the negroes were <hi>freemen,</hi> they had a right to put themſelves under Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and we have no ſhadow of claim to reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or compenſation.</p>
               <p>I am one who believe that no property can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in human ſleſh, and any law authoriſing the purchaſe and detention of a human being, as <hi>property,</hi> is, ipſo facto, void.—Should this poſition be well
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029752_0209_0FE25519DBEE4C90"/>
founded, we have not a ſhadow of pretenſion to the negroes carried away by the Britiſh troops.</p>
               <p>But the laws of many of the ſtates do conſider them as property: whether rightfully or wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not now the queſtion. If we conſider them as <hi>property,</hi> they are to be ranked among <hi>perſonal</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, for they certainy are not <hi>real</hi> eſtate.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Jefferſon, a man of eminent talents, and the oracle of my antagoniſts, admits, in the fulleſt extent, the doctrine, that all perſonal eſtate is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeizable by enemies in war. The following are his words:—</p>
               <p>"It cannot be denied, that the ſtate of war ſtictly admits a nation to ſeize the property of its enemies, found within its own limits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exiſts—whether in action or poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on."</p>
               <p>In confirmation of this, he quotes Bynkerſhoek, l. 1. c. 7. who is clear and explicit on the ſubject. See papers relative to Great Britain, publiſhed by order of congreſs, p. 29. This doctrine is the univerſal law of nations.</p>
               <p>"As the towns and lands taken from the enemy, are called conqueſts, all <hi>moveable things</hi> conſtitute the <hi>booty.</hi> The booty belongs to the ſovereign." Vattel, b. 3. c. 9.</p>
               <p>In the interpretation of treaties where there are two conſtructions, the one favorable, the other odious, that which is odious is always to be rejected: and what can be more odious than to conſtrue this article of the treaty, ſo as to violate faith towards the wretched blacks, and render them back to the whips and ſcourges of ſlavery?</p>
               <p>At any rate, this point of the buſineſs the Britiſh miniſtry will not yield, as the firſt infraction of the treaty.</p>
               <p>Then came the detention of the weſtern poſts, which our miniſter alleged to be a breach of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, anterior to any violation on the part of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029752_0210_0FE2551B6AFD5F00"/>
States.—Here was introduced the correſpondence between Mr. Jefferſon and Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Jefferſon's reaſoning on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>To this the Britiſh miniſter anſwered, by referring to dates of tranſactions.</p>
               <p>The proviſional articles between Great Britain and America, were ſigned, November 30th, 1782, at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris; and notice of this was officially received by Sir Guy Carleton, April 5th, 1783. But the definitive, treaty was not ſigned till September 3d, 1783, and the ratifications were not finally exchanged, till ſome time in 1784, though I do not know the day and month.</p>
               <p>A treaty is binding on a nation from the moment of ſignature; but its ultimate validity depends on its paſſing through all the uſual forms. According to the modern practice, the exchange of ratifications puts the ſeal to the validity of a treaty, and gives it an effect from the time of ſignature.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh miniſtry ſtate that, ex gratia, or as a matter of convenience to the nation, orders were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Sir Guy Carleton to evacuate New-York, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on ſigning the proviſional articles in 1782. But they allege they were not bound to do this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had been notified of the ratification of thoſe articles by congreſs, which could not have been till the middle of the year 1784.</p>
               <p>The demand made by the Baron Steuben, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of General Waſhington, of the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, and the firſt demand made, was by his letter to General Haldimand, dated Auguſt 2, 1783. At this time the Britiſh miniſter could ſcarcely have heard whether congreſs had agreed to the treaty or not; much leſs could any orders have been ſent from them to Canada, for withdrawing the troops from the garriſon.</p>
               <p>Admitting this fact, that the Britiſh miniſtry were not <hi>bound</hi> by treaty to give orders for the troops to
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029752_0211_0FE25526120EF0A8"/>
withdraw, until the treaty had gone through its uſual forms, then the detention of the poſts, till long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been demanded by Baron Steuben, and perhaps as late as the demand of Colonel Hull, in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1784, was juſtifiable and authorized by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of nations.</p>
               <p>But long before this, congreſs had declared the carrying away of the negroes, an infraction of the treaty; and in May 1793 had ſent orders to our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters to remonſtrate againſt this meaſure and demand reparation.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of New-York, ſo early as March 17, 1783, paſſed an act authorizing any citizen to bring actions of treſpaſs againſt any perſon who had occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, or injured his eſtate, real or perſonal, within the power of the enemy. This was an expreſs violation of the 6th article of the treaty, which declares that no perſon ſhall ſuffer any loſs or damage, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, on account of the part he had taken during the war. And Virginia, in December, 1783, paſſed an act, ſuſpending executions on certain judgments, which materially affected Britiſh creditors. South Carolina in March 1784 followed, and paſſed an act ſuſpending all actions, both Britiſh and American, for nine months.</p>
               <p>Theſe legal impediments to the recovery of old Britiſh debts, determined the miniſtry <hi>not</hi> to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poſts, but to hold them as a ſecurity for theſe debts. And whatever clamor we may raiſe about this buſineſs, we may be aſſured, that the weſtern poſts will never be delivered peaceably, until the payment of thoſe debts has been amply ſecured.</p>
               <p>I have been thus full in explaining what is meant by the <hi>merits of complaints,</hi> in tne preamble of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſhow, that our miniſter was juſtifiable paſſing over the diſcuſſion of a point of extreme difficulty—a point which would have waſted time and embarraſſed, perhaps defeated, the negociation. The queſtion of the <hi>firſt infraction</hi> of the treaty of peace had been ably
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029752_0212_0FE25527D509E8F8"/>
discuſſed before; and at the cloſe of the controverſy, the parties were as remote from the probability of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement as when they began.</p>
               <p>Neither party would yield the point to his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. The Britiſh miniſtry, it is evidently known, are determined never to admit the carrying away the negroes to be an infraction of the treaty, and they are equally determined not to ſurrender the weſtern poſts without a guarantee for the payment of old debts.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, was it not prudent and wiſe to paſs over the firſt ſubjects of crimination, and proceed to an amicable adjuſtment of all differences, if it could be done, without attempting to decide who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed the treaty? I am perſuaded that every candid man who reads this explanation of the buſineſs, will be fully ſatisfied with the conduct of our envoy.</p>
               <p>[Note. I generally uſe the word envoy or miniſter, in the ſingular, as referring to Mr. Jay, the principal in the negociation. But it is proper to obſerve once for all, that Mr. Jay, by order, communicated his inſtructions to Mr. Pinckney, conſulted him on every point, and that the treaty end every article of it had the approbation of that gentleman.]</p>

                  <head>Article 2.</head>
                  <p>The firſt objection made to this article is the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitneſs of it. It is ſaid that the article ſhould have defined from <hi>what places</hi> his majeſty was to withdraw his troops.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer to this objection is, that there is not any diſpute about the boundary line of the United States, except at the north eaſt extremity, on St. Croix river. The poſts which we claim are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in the United States. It is poſſible,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029752_0213_0FE255296562B590"/>
that Britiſh officers at ſome of thoſe places, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for ſome purpoſes of their own, may have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were on their own ground; but I never heard it ſuggeſted that the miniſtry diſpute the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary line, at or near any of the garriſoned places.</p>
                  <p>The time aſſigned for the evacuation, is ſaid to be too diſtant. But if we calculate, we ſhall find no ground for this objection. There was required time to exchange ratifications, and then for orders to be diſpatched from England, to the fartheſt poſt weſt-ward. If we allow a reaſonable time for theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, it will require the whole period aſſigned by the treaty.</p>
                  <p>The juriſdiction of a military poſt will doubtleſs be conſidered, the reach of a cannon ſhot, or a league.</p>
                  <p>"Laſtly," ſays <hi>Decius,</hi> "as the treaty of peace gave us theſe poſts, what great benefit is obtained by this article? Who would regard the ſecond promiſe of a man, who had already; without an excuſe, violated the firſt?"</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Decius</hi> will pleaſe to remember, that there are two ſides to a queſtion—The legal impediments to a collection of old debts were an excuſe for the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poſts which they deemed ſufficient. If we comply with the ſixth article, Great Britain will conſequently comply with the ſecond.</p>

                  <head>Article 3.</head>
                  <p>Even this article of the treaty, which breaks down the barriers which have hitherto obſtructed our trade to Canada, and opens a general intercourſe upon moſt liberal principles, has not eſcaped criticiſm and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Decius</hi> ſays, the advantages in this article are on the ſide of Great Britain; and the reaſon aſſigned is, that the extent of the United States, is greater than that of the Britiſh territories. Now this is the very reaſon why the advantages of this article are in ſavor of the United States.</p>
                  <p>What is the preſent ſtate of trade between Canada and the United States? and what will its ſituation be
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029752_0214_0FE2552AF3B4EC58"/>
under the treaty? This is a fair way of determining the goodneſs of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent ſtate of things, almoſt all trade is prohibited on the part of Canada.—Not a ſkin in the fur trade can be brought into the United States except by ſtealth. This prohibition makes the little trade in peltry, now actually carried on, very harard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and raiſes the article to a very high price. The peltry, it muſt be admitted, is almoſt <hi>all</hi> collected within the Britiſh territories; the Britiſh have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it by right; and the removal of thoſe garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the other ſide of the lakes, without a removal of the prohibition on the peltry trade, would not have been of much advantage to the United States.</p>
                  <p>We have then every thing to gain by a free inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe—the Britiſh, every thing to loſe, ſo far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>that trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decius</hi> ſays, "the fur trade will probably fall alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the hands of Britiſh traders." This is a moſt extraordinary ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, the peltry trade now is all IN their hands—What we want is to get that OUT of their hands. That is, we want to obtain a ſhare of that trade on equal terms with Britiſh ſubjects. This we have obtained by the article under conſideration.</p>
                  <p>What right, what pretence have we to a monopoly of that trade? Do we expect that Great Britain would permit us, as <hi>Decius</hi> ſays, "to ſecure to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the whole fur trade?" To demand ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege on our part would be extravagant and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>The trade by the third article of the treaty, is placed on a fair and liberal footing.—Both parties are free to uſe all the rivers and lakes for the purpoſe of inland navigation, ſubject only to the common tolls and ferriages. The exception of the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company is of no importance at preſent to the United States; and the exception was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

But <hi>Decius</hi> will pleaſe to recollect, that this privilege enjoyed by Britiſh ſubjects, and the reſtriction of American ſubjects, are not created by the preſent treaty. In this reſpect the parties are as they were before. American veſſels have never been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carry on the coaſting trade of the Britiſh poſſeſſions in America; and therefore we ſuffer no new abridgment of buſineſs by this article. On the other hand, Britiſh veſſels are <hi>now</hi> admitted into all our harbours, and to the higheſt port of entry for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign veſſels, ſo that this article gives no new privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to ſuch veſſels. But we have obtained by the treaty a <hi>fret inland trade with Canada.</hi> We can na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate all the rivers and lakes—we can go down the St. Lawrence to Quebec. Articles are to be carried from the United States to Canada, and vice verſa, ſubject to the loweſt duties ever paid on theſe articles;—and peltry pays no duty at all.</p>
                  <p>This free intercourſe will be highly advantageous to our citizens on the frontiers. They will be deeply concerned in the fur trade, and we ſhall obtain furs much lower than formerly. At the ſame time the inhabitants on our frontiers will find a market at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal or Quebec, and bring back in return ſuch heavy articles as will come cheaper, through the St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and the lakes, than through the Atlantic ports.</p>
                  <p>This trade is extremely wanted by our frontier ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, which are every day increaſing. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Atlantic lays them under heavy diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which the treaty before us alleviates, as much as poſſible, by taking off all reſtrictions on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land trade. And juſt in proportion to the numbar
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029752_0216_0FE255365DBAEA88"/>
of people in the United States, who are to carry on and partake of that free trade, will be the benefits of this article of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould be conſidered further, that the citizens of the United States are taking up large tracts of land in Canada, and emigrating to that province.—This buſineſs is encouraged by the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But while the people who ſettle in Canada, for the purpoſes of trade or agriculture, become ſubjects of Great Britain, they retain their attachment to the United States; and from this circumſtance important and beneficial conſequences may hereafter be expected.</p>

                  <p>This is a moſt important article. It involves in it the primary and principal cauſes of all the differences now exiſting between the two countries.</p>
                  <p>Before the war, moſt of the trade of Virginia, and a great portion of that of the ſtates to the ſouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ard, was carried on by foreigners. I am well aſſured that it was eſteemed in Virginia, diſreputable for planters and their ſons to engage in trade. This prejudice, which was, like a thouſand follies adopted by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, introduced from Europe, and a remnant of the aristocracy of the feudal ſyſtem, operated powerfully to keep trade in the hands of foreigners.</p>
                  <p>The Britiſh merchants availed themſelves of the prejudice. They were the agents or factors for the pianters, and gave extenſive credit. The confidence created by this friendly intercourſe, together with the prodigal habits of many planters, extended this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a very large amount.</p>
                  <p>The war neceſſarily ſuſpended the payment of theſe debts. The treaty of peace provided that no lawful impediments ſhould be interpoſed to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029752_0217_0FE25537EB132920"/>
of thoſe debts. The carrying away of the negroes by the Britiſh, when they left New York, exaſperated the ſouthern ſtates: they conſidered it as an infraction of the treaty, and, as ſuch, an excuſe for violating it on their part. They paſſed laws which ware impediments to the recovery of old debts. The Britiſh miniſtry, on their part, detained the weſtern poſts, as ſecurity for thoſe debts, and damages <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Britiſh merchants, in conſequence of thoſe legal impediments. Here the parties are at iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue here are differences between the two nations which can be ſettled only by the ſword or amicable adjuſtment.</p>
                  <p>This is preciſely the ſituation of the parties.—Neither party will yield the point of <hi>firſt infraction;</hi> and paper, correſpondence, to prove the point, has been exhauſted, without giving any ſatisfaction to either.</p>
                  <p>The iſſue then is, the alternative of <hi>war</hi> or <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</hi> But if we enter into a war, will this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the points in diſpute? Not at all. A ten years war, and a waſte of half the blood and treaſure of the United States, would leave the cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>erſy juſt where it now is—to be ſettled by negociation.</p>
                  <p>It is no anſwer to theſe remarks, to make outcries about Britiſh injuſtice. Admitting this in the fulleſt extent, that injuſtice is to be reſtrained only by the ſword, or amicable agreement—we have our choice.</p>
                  <p>Is it not prudent and wiſe to make an effort to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt all differences by a reference to equitable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? What better mode could be deviſed to ſettle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſo numerous, ſo complicated, as thoſe which exiſt between the two countries, than by commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fairly and impartially appointed? This is the mode which has been practiſed for centuries, in like caſes. In looking into collections of treaties, I find the ſame mode preſcribed in all caſes of difficult diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between nations; and the univerſal practice of
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029752_0218_0FE255398B049E20"/>
reſorting to this mode, is a proof that none better has yet been deviſed.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid, "this mode of adjuſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> due to Britiſh creditors, is unjuſt towards thoſe ſtates which have interpoſed no lawful impediments in the way of recovering ſuch debts; as they muſt bear a part of the burden, and thus ſuffer for the delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of others."</p>
                  <p>This objection is ſuſceptible of a very ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Our capacity, as a nation, ariſes from the union of the ſtates under the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>All our intercourſe with foreign nations is conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>United States,</hi> in that national capacity. Foreign nations cannot negociate with any of our individual ſtates; and the ſtates are expreſsly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, by our conſtitution, from entering into any treaty, compact, or agreement, with any foreign power.</p>
                  <p>The moment our union took place, the United States became, to a certain degree, reſponſible for acts done by ſtates or individuals towards foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This reſponſibility reſults from the national capacity derived from the union.</p>
                  <p>Whatever hardſhips this may impoſe on particular ſtates, it is a neceſſary conſequence of the character we have aſſumed among the powers of the earth; and indeed it is much more than counterbalanced by the protection and ſecurity derived from the ſame nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al capacity.</p>

                  <p>THIS article is ſaid to be wholly exceptionable, becauſe it places at too great a diſtance, compenſation to which our citizens are entitled, for the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acts of piracy.</p>
                  <p>I will admit what my antagoniſts pleaſe to allege againſt the injurious treatment of our veſſels at ſea by Britiſh privateers. I know that the right which the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029752_0219_0FE25541E009A130"/>
law of nations gives to powers at war, of ſtopping and examining neutral veſſels, and ſeizing them when they have contraband goods on boards, has been abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that great injuries and inſolence have been ſuffered by our ſeamen; and great loſſes have been incurred by our merchants by illegal detention and condemnation. My own feelings are keenly alive to ſuch abuſes, and I wiſh we had the means of vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our rights in a more ample manner.</p>
                  <p>But let me obſerve, that theſe injuries do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite greater reſentment in the breaſts of Americans, than laws of our ſtates, ſuſpending the recovery of old debts, or making lands, goods and depreciated paper currency, a legal tender for theſe debts, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the breaſts of the Britiſh nation. As to é<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing of this nature, anger, reſentment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt are reciprocal: and ill uſage alleged on one part, is retorted with ill uſage in ſome other particular on the other part. There is no common tribunal, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this queſtion, Who has been guilty of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt outrage on faith and honeſty? We are ſatisfied that the charge belongs to Great Britain—<hi>they</hi> are as confident the blame is on our ſide. It is idle to waſte time in criminating each other—Our intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and thoſe of Great Britain, demand an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable accommodation, and to that point all our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſhould be directed.</p>
                  <p>The time which will be required to examine the claims of American merchants for loſſes, is certainly to be regretted. But how cau this delay be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented?</p>
                  <p>If we admit the right of powers at war to ſtop neutral veſſels and examine them, a right which has never been diſputed, do we not admit the right of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining whether ſuch veſſels have contraband pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty on board or not? How ſhall this point be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, where ſuſpicion occurs? The papers of neutral veſſels are not always to be relied on. We all know that ſubjects of nations at war, procure neutral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

We all know that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband goods are often concealed in bales or caſks of goods not contraband. We all know that maſters, ſupercargoes and ſeamen, will evade direct anſwers, equivocate, and ſometimes men are abandoned enough to perjure themſelves in a court, to ſave property of their own or their friends.</p>
                  <p>What ſays the law of nations on this ſubject? Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, b. 3. ch. 7. lays it down with great preciſion. "Without ſearching neutral ſhips at ſea, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of contraband goods cannot be prevented. There is then a right of ſearching. At preſent a neutral ſhip refuſing to be ſearched, would from that proceeding alone be condemned as lawful prize. But to avoid inconveniencies, violence, and every other ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, the manner of the ſearch is ſettled in the treaties of navigation and commerce. According to the preſent cuſtom, credit is to be given to certificates and bills of lading, produced by the maſter of the ſhip, <hi>unleſs any fraud appear in them, or there be very good reaſon to ſuſpect their validity."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mode of ſearching neutral veſſels is regulated by our treaties, with the States General, with Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and France, in which it is ſtipulated that credit ſhall be given to the ſhips' papers. But we have had no ſuch treaty with Great Britain, and the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our veſſels depends on the law of nations, or the licentious will of the maſters of privateers.—Wherever there is ſuſpicion of fraud in the papers, the veſſels may, by the law of nations, be carried into port for examination and trial; and it is probable, this licenſe has been carried to a moſt unwarrantable length, during the preſent war. The general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>cauſe of ſuſpicion,</hi> gives an almoſt unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed latitude to thoſe unprincipled men, who are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in the deteſtable buſineſs of privateering. Such is the ſituation of our trade, in the preſent unhappy war. But making every allowance for ill
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029752_0221_0FE255461B4DCAB8"/>
uſage, it muſt be admitted that great numbers of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican veſſels have, according to the laws of nations, been juſtly ſeized, and carried into port for trial.—When this is the caſe, what mode of proceſs muſt be had to determine what property is liable to confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what is not?</p>
                  <p>Our exiſting treaties with other nations admit the right of trial in the admiralty courts of the nation capturing the neutral veſſels; and in theſe treaties, there are ſtipulations that bulk ſhall not be broke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the cargo has been landed in preſence of proper officers, and no part of the cargo ſold, till legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſhall have been had, and ſentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the goods liable to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Muſt not the ſame proceſs be had in the Britiſh courts, though we have had no treaty with the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Where is the ground for maintaining a different doctrine?</p>
                  <p>We muſt then admit the principle, that American veſſels ſeized and carried into port, with prohibited goods on board, or on ſuſpicion of fraudulent papers, are ſubject to the uſual legal proceſs of Britiſh courts of admiralty. However hard this may appear, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect flows directly from the ſtate of war and the law of nations.</p>
                  <p>If we admit this principle, we admit all its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. If our veſſels are liable to legal proceſs, it is neceſſary that all the documents relative to the queſtion of <hi>legal capture or not,</hi> ſhould be produced and examined. And when we conſider the diſtance from which many of theſe documents are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the numerous caſes that have ariſen, who can ſay that final deciſions can be had on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can claims in a moment? And in caſes which involve equitable conſiderations, not proper for the deciſion of courts of law, what mode could be deviſed, more eligible for the claimants, than that of commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Is the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> is favorable for the claimants.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that the Britiſh government ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a ſum on account, to be diſtributed among the ſufferers. This ſuggeſtion ſeems to be grounded on an idea that has prevailed, that ſuch a ſum has been advanced by Great Britain to Denmark and Sweden—an opinion which, I have authority to ſay, is not well founded.</p>
                  <p>But to this meaſure there are inſurmountable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. The impracticability of doing even partial juſtice, before it is aſcertained who are the objects of it, is merely chimerical.</p>
                  <p>Many of my countrymen are great ſufferers, and I truſt their juſt claims will be ſupported, and their juſt damages paid. But a ſummary trial might do great injuſtice—the innocent might ſuffer, and the guilty obtain reparation.</p>
                  <p>On the whole, the time and mode appear as eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as juſtice and the nature of the caſes will admit.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the ſtipulation in the laſt clauſe of the 7th article, that engages payment for certain veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels taken by privateers within our juriſdiction or by veſſels armed in our ports, I truſt no man, who has a regard for honeſty or national character, will ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it. I am one of thoſe American citizens, that hold it as a duty for us to preſerve a ſtrict neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in the preſent war, and honorable in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to make indemnification for every illegal proceeding of the nation and of individuals, towards foreign nations. Let him who demands juſtice, do juſtice himſelf. The amount of the ſums to be paid, does not vary the principle, nor ſhould it vary our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as a nation. I hope and truſt the character of the United States, will never be ſtained with a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and juſtice, even towards the conſairs of Barbary. Self-defence, only, will authorise any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in arreſting or withholding the property of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:029752_0223_0FE255520E087010"/>
even of an enemy nation. To withhold or to authorize the withholding of private property, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law, is to degrade our nation to the rank of Algerines.</p>

                           <pb n="219" facs="unknown:029752_0224_0FE25553D6688E98"/>I requeſt of you at the ſame time, Sir, to permit me to make two general obſervations on the whole of this buſineſs; one of which applies to the organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other to the proceedings, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial tribunals. The referring of queſtions on ſea prizes, to theſe tribunals, appears to me dangerous ſince they involve the interpretation of the Treaties, and the application of the law of nations: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of peace and of war. Now we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to entertain ſome doubt as to the knowledge of the judges, and we ought beſides to fear, leſt they may be intereſted, as owners of privateers, in the queſtions which are ſubmitted to them.</p>
                        <p>But whatever may be the organization of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, it appears to me eſſential, Sir, that in their proceedings they ſhould receive all the claims which may be made to them; that they ſhould even invite without waiting for the authority of the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, who are often at the diſtance of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand leagues. The juriſdiction of the tribunals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whoſe cognizance are the queſtions of prize, is in rem. They take poſſeſſion of the things, and by that means render themſelves reſponſible for it. Now as the tribunal, which is the depoſitory of the thing, ought not to diſpoſſeſs themſelves of it, without a formal authoritative act of the true proprietor, it is their duty, not only to admit, but alſo to ſeek proofs, which may eſtabliſh to whom the property truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. This is a double duty towards the neutral proprietor, and towards their own nation: for every government which permits its citizens to fit out pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, arms with the deſtructive ſword of war, hands which are intereſted to extend its ravages, and renders itſelf reſponſible for the abuſes which reſult from ſo dangerous a delegation of ſovereignty. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of repoſſeſſing them, the admiralty tribunals have been eſtabliſhed throughout the different nations of Europe. In theſe tribunals, the government furniſhes the means of information, by the facility with which
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029752_0225_0FE2555565B532C0"/>
it admits therein every ſpecies of claim. It preserves, by appeals, the right of deciding, in the laſt reſort, on the conteſts which ſhall therein ariſe: and it gives the neceſſary time to enlighten its conſcience on thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtions, before the pronouncing of a ſentence, which might extend or prolong the horrors of war.</p>
                        <p>Theſe, Sir, are the queſtions which experience has dictated to me. They daily make on me a more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſion on account of the claims addreſſed to me by my countrymen, of which I have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to you a very ſmall part. I always ſend to the tribunals the injured perſons, by giving them the moſt poſitive aſſurances that they will there obtain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and prompt juſtice.</p>

I have uſed among others, all the means with which your letters furniſhed me, to have reſtored the ſhip Laurens; but I have met with inſurmountable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, in the eſtabliſhed laws, and in the opinion of the commercial tribunal at Havre. The tribunal has neglected nothing to render juſtice to the owners of this veſſel. It has conſented among other things, to have tranſlated 361 letters, merely to prove in the moſt authentic manner, the property of the cargo. The intereſted have, beſides, avowed themſelves, that they had neglected an eſſential formality required by our laws.</p>

It muſt perceive how difficult it is, to contain within juſt limits, the indignation of our marines, and in general of all the French patriots, againſt a people who ſpeak the ſame language, and have the ſame habits, as the free Americans. The difficulty of diſtinguiſhing our allies from our enemies, has often been the cauſe of offences, committed on board your veſſels; all that the adminiſtration could do, is to order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification to thoſe who have ſuffered, and to puniſh the guilty."</p>

                  <p>This article gives the preſent holders of lands in the two countries the right of diſpoſing of them, &amp;c. without being conſidered as aliens.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt abſtract of the treaty which was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this article was erroneouſly ſtated, as extending
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029752_0227_0FE255611FB460F8"/>
to give the rights of citizens to any and all Britiſh ſubjects purchaſing lands hereafter in the United States. The truth is, the article extends only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons holding lands at the time the treaty was ſigned, and ſome proviſion of this kind was neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand this article, it muſt be remembered, that the United States were ſettled from the Britiſh dominions, and till lately remained a part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some perſons in the United States now hold lands in England, which they inherit from branches of their families which are extinct in that country. Great numbers in the Britiſh dominions hold lands which they formerly enjoyed as inhabitants of the colonies, and which were not confiſcated. Others have been compelled to take lands in payment of debts.</p>
                  <p>The circumſtances of theſe two countries differ from thoſe of all other countries. They were formerly <hi>one country,</hi> and linked together by a variety of individual intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe private intereſts have been moſtly created un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one common government. They originated, when the two countries were one in empire, and without any fault on the part of the perſons intereſted. Was it not reaſonable and juſt, that intereſts thus created ſhould be ſecured by the proviſions of a treaty which was to adjuſt all old differences? Moſt certainly it was.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid that this article infringes the rights of the ſtates. As I have never ſeen any argument to prove this aſſertion, it will be ſufficient to anſwer it by another aſſertion, and ſay it does <hi>not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid alſo that this article impairs the obligation of private contracts. As this is aſſerted without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation or proof, it wili be paſſed without notice.</p>
                  <p>The danger of aliens holding real eſtate in any country, is an idea that was propagated ever Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in feudal times, and modern writers on law have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to tranſcribe the reaſoning on that ſubject, from
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029752_0228_0FE25562B060A0D8"/>
one generation to another, as they have on uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerance, natural allegiance, and many other ancient errors, without allowing for the ameliorated ſtate of ſociety and civil policy. The danger, however, is now a mere bug bear, and deſerves notice. Men may hold real eſtates, without the other privileges of citizens; and it tends to promote commerce to admit foreigners to this privilege, under ſuitable reſtrictions.</p>
                  <p>The only danger that now exiſts in an unlimited privilege of this kind is, that perſons might poſſeſs themſelves of large eſtates, and ſpend the income abroad, as is the caſe with the planters in the Weſt Indies and the Iriſh nobility. Should this ever become an evil of extent, it will require legiſlative remedies.</p>
                  <p>But it is an important idea which the United States ſhould cheriſh, that men are never enemies to a free country. Men may ſcramble for offices, and oppoſe the adminiſtration of a government from ſelfiſh views—but if foreigners find peace, liberty, and ſafety in our country, they will hardly give themſelves the trouble of ſubjecting us to other governments. A liberality in our meaſures towards foreigners, ſtrict juſtice and impartiality in our laws, will make all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties our friends, and this is one great object of the preſent treaty.</p>

                     <hi>Decius</hi> attempts to make an invidious compariſon between this article of the treaty, and the eleventh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our treaty with France, which, he ſays, is all in ſavor of the Americans, becauſe it aboliſhes the droit d'aub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

mean chattels real, but not eſtates in ſee, and quotes Sir Edward Coke and Blackſtone.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Decius</hi> is a lawyer of great ingenuity, as he doubtleſs is, he ought to be very cautious to conceal his ſubtilties. His far-fetched arguments to make the French treaty a mere act of benevolence on the part of Louis XVI. and the preſent <hi>treaty</hi> a mere ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice on our part, will not, ultimately, ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>The explanation given by <hi>Decius</hi> to the terms <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable goods</hi> is unequivocally wrong. Does not <hi>Decius</hi> know, that a treaty with France is not to be interpreted by the common law of England? Does not he know that the terms <hi>bona immobilia,</hi> immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods, are borrowed from the <hi>civil law,</hi> that the civil law is the baſis of almoſt every municipal conſtitution in Europe? Does he not recollect that the municipal laws of France were derived from that ſource, and that terms uſed in that country are to be explained by the civil law? Is not a treaty with France to be interpreted according to the legal import of the words in that country?</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Decius</hi> then be apprized, that <hi>bona immobilia</hi> is a technical phraſe as old as the civil law, and that it comprehended formerly and ſtill comprehends, in moſt countries of Europe, real eſtate, that is, a freehold eſtate, and lands in fee, as well as chattels, real. When uſed by writers on the law of nations, the phraſe has that ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>"Every ſtate has the liberty of granting or refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreigners the power of poſſeſſing lands or other <hi>immoveable goods,</hi> within its territory."—Vattel, b. 2. ch. 8. In the ſame page are theſe expreſſions: "If the ſovereign does not permit aliens to poſſeſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveables, no one has a right to complain of it, as the ſovereign may refuſe ſtrangers the power of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing immoveables." So alſo in b. 3. ch. 5. ſec, 76.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing paragraph relates to moveable goods, but the rule is different with regard to <hi>immoveables,</hi> to <hi>ſtates in lands,</hi> as they all in ſome meaſure belong to
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:029752_0230_0FE25565CFEB8FC0"/>
the nation, are part of its domain, &amp;c. and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor being always a ſubject of the country as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of a parcel of <hi>land,</hi> and <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>this nature</hi> do not ceaſe to be the enemy's goods, though poſſeſſed by a neutral ſtranger. "Nevertheleſs, war being now carried on with ſo much moderation and indulgence, ſafe-guards are allowed to <hi>houſes and lands</hi> poſſeſſed by foreigners in an enemy's country. For the ſame reaſon, he who declares war does not confiſcate the <hi>immoveable goods</hi> poſſeſſed in his country by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſubjects. In permitting them to purchaſe and poſſeſs <hi>thoſe goods,</hi> he has, in this reſpect, admitted them into the number of his ſubjects. But the income may be ſequeſtrated, for hindering the remittance of it to the enemy's country."</p>
                  <p>Bynkerſhoek, Queſt. Jur. Pub. 1. c. 7. uſes the word <hi>immobilia</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, and lays down the doctrine above quoted from Vattel.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt direct authority in point, is from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat's Civil Law, Preliminary Book, title 3. ſect. 1.—the following paſſage is expreſs: "Immoveables are all the parts of the ſurface of the earth, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever they are diſtinguiſhed, whether into places for buildings, or into woods, meadow, arable lands, vineyards, orchards, or otherwiſe, and to whomſoever they belong."</p>
                  <p>In ſect. 2. of the ſame title, Domat expreſsly enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates lands, whether <hi>allodial</hi> or charged with quit rents, among <hi>immoveables.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">It deſerves remark, that the French word <hi>biens,</hi> goods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends eſtate in land. This ſenſe is borrowed from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</note> As this writer was a French civilian, he doubtleſs uſed the word in its tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſenſe, as underſtood in France, and by this ſenſe muſt our treaty with France be interpreted. Indeed, whatever may be the opinion of lawyers here, I have no doubt that, by the 11th article of that treaty, French citizens are fully entitled to hold real eſtate law.

in the United States, and American citizens, in France.</p>
                  <p>In all our other treaties, the article in queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts the ſubjects of the two countries, to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>perſonal eſtate or effects,</hi> in the juriſdiction each of the other. Moſt nations retain the old feudal jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy reſpecting foreigners poſſeſſing lands in their countries. But the liberality of France, in her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with America, ought to be an example to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the United States, of all countries on earth, ought to reject all ſuch remains of feudal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. I truſt the explanation before given of the terms <hi>immoveable goods,</hi> will be ſatisfactory; and will evince the truth of what was advanced by the writer of "Candid Remarks on the Treaty," that the 11th article of our treaty with France amounts to a <hi>total abolition of ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE 10th article of the treaty provides that "nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor ſhares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public banks, ſhall ever in any event of war or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal differences be ſequeſtered or confiſcated," The faithful observance of the reſtriction contained in this article is ſo much for our intereſt as well as honor, that we ſhould naturally have concluded, the moſt determined enemies to any good underſtanding with Great-Britain, would at leaſt have paſſed it by in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

an equal condemnation. Decius has complained of this article as being, like many others, excluſively advantageous to England, and as arreſting from our government a lawful and powerful weapon of war. I am greatly miſtaken, however, if it is not completely defenſible againſt every part of this accuſation.</p>
               <p>It is true that by the law of nations, as exiſting a century ago, the debts owing from one nation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were legal objects of ſequeſtration in war. "But ar preſent (to uſe the language of Vattel, b. 3. ch. 5. ſec. 77.) in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigor.—And as this <hi>cuſtom has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received,</hi> he who ſhould act contrary to it would <hi>injure the public faith;</hi> for ſtrangers truſted his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects only from a firm perſuaſion that the <hi>general cuſtom</hi> would be obſerved. The ſtate does not ſo much as touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in caſe of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confiſcation and ſeizure." This clear explanation of the modern law of nations, as far as it relates to the public funds, is alſo to be found in a report of the Engliſh judges in the year 1753, in anſwer to the Pruſſian memorial; a report of much authority, which Vattel does not ſcruple to call an excellent piece on the law of nations. "It will not be eaſy, ſay the judges, to find an inſtance where a prince has thought fit to make repriſals upon a debt due from himſelf to private men. There is a confidence that this will not be done. A private man ſends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to a prince upon the faith of an engagement of honor, becauſe a prince cannot be compelled, like other men, in an adverſe way, by a court of juſtice, So ſcrupulouſly did England, France and Spain adhere to this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith, that, even during the war, they ſuffered no enquiry to be made whether any part of the public debts was due to ſubjects of the enemy, though it is certain many Engliſh had money in the French funds and many French had money in ours."</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:029752_0233_0FE255734E051898"/>But theſe principles have received ſanction from a ſource, which the adverſaries of the article will be diſpoſed to admit as of ſtill greater authority and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability, I mean from the proceedings and deciſion of the French convention. It appears from Paris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which in April laſt were tranſlated and republiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Aurora,</hi> that in the ſitting of the convention, Dec. 29, 1794, after the houſe had paſſed to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the day, "Johannot read the following articles of the projected decree, which were as follow—(here follow five articles.)</p>

               <p>"The decree concerning the ſequeſtration of the property of the ſubjects of the powers at war with the Republic is annulled. Such ſums as have been paid by French citizens into the treaſury in conſequence of thoſe decrees, will be reimburſed." This article occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſome debate. Gaſton was againſt it. Cambon obſerved, that the law of ſequeſtration was extorted from the convention by the faction of Fabre d'Eglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Danton, but ought you to return the property of the Spaniſh to the deſpot of Madrid? Thiriot agreed with Cambon. Colombel deſired the aſſembly to annul only the ſequeſtration of the ſums due for commercial relations. Ramel ſhewed that the law of ſequeſtration had been urged by the foreigners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſtockjobbers, <hi>that it had prepared the ruin of commerce, and broken off, againſt the right of nations, the obligations of merchants in different ſtates;</hi> though the powers at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I have thought it not uſeleſs to give a brief ſketch of this very intereſting proceeding in the French con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, becauſe it not only eſtabliſhes what I contend to be the law of nations, but expoſes the injury and injuſtice of departing from this part of it even in the midſt of the moſt violent war.

remarked to the honor of our country, that during the courſe of our revolution, notwithſtanding the warm reſentments it called forth, we never attempted to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul the Britiſh debts, but finally agreed to the 4th ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the treaty of peace, "That creditors on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſhould meet with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> loans, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſtipulated, that they ſhould not be impaired on the event of a future war between the two countries.</p>
               <p>I think it will be evident from the authorities which I have adduced, that the ſequeſtration and confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of debts and public ſtock, are not <hi>now</hi> the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and admiſſible weapons of war. The ancient max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims on this head are juſtly and generally exploded by civilized nations, and the intereſts of commerce in this, as in many other inſtances, have happily ſet bounds to the intemperance of Gothic rage. In ſtipulating to a formal renunciation of this mode of warfare, we have done no more than what we were bound to do by the acknowledged dictates of good faith. We have renounced a weapon which our own ſenſe of right and policy had before forbidden us to uſe. If howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhould be ſuppoſed that occaſions may ſometimes ariſe in which it would be expedient for the purpoſe of more effectually wounding our enemies, to attack public or private contracts, then let me aſk, what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty has the treaty thrown in the way? The ſame fierceneſs of character which would lead us to violate the received maxims of war and national duty, would readily ſet aſide the moral obligation of this article. Its only effect ariſes from laying down in the rational ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of peace, the rule of conduct in war, and by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding an expreſs, to the implied, ſanction of good faith.</p>
               <p>But it is alleged that this article has no actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity, becauſe all the debts are due from us either as a nation or as individuals, and that our citizens
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:029752_0235_0FE2557E8BFDAFD8"/>
hold no Britiſh ſtock, and have few or no demands upon their ſubjects. If, however, this ſpecies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation be really repugnant to the preſent uſage of nations, and is unjuſt and impolitic, the renunciation was equally fit and proper, whether it was mutual or not, and in proportion to the means we had of uſing this mode of warfare, does the ſacrifice redound to our credit and character. But the truth is, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial operation of this article is principally on our ſide. It is much more ſatisfactory and neceſſary to us, than it is to Great Britain, becauſe it tends directly to foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtrengthen the credit of the United States, both public and private, a circumſtance of the utmoſt moment to our proſperity as an infant nation.</p>
               <p>It is by force of public credit, that our government has attained to its preſent ſtability, and has ſo many competent means of acting with efficacy whenever the public exigencies require it. Credit, as a good judge of our intereſt has obſerved, is <hi>the invigorating princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this country.</hi> Any addition to it, however ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, will give much greater power of ſelf-defence, than the little perſidious and exploded reſource of confiſcating debts or violating the pledged negociability, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of public ſtock. Nor is private credit of much leſs utility in a country which has ſo little capital, in proportion to the extent and variety of the demands for it. We have immenſe territories of waſte land to clear and ſettle; and abundance of raw materials for nouriſhing the manufacturing and mechanic arts: but to anſwer theſe ends, requires an unceaſing ſupply of capital, or credit, which in moſt caſes is its eligible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute. In ſhort there are no people upon earth who have ſo many inducements as the United States, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unequivocally to the world, that the claims of their creditors ſhall always be deemed ſacred in peace and in war.</p>
               <p>After taking ſuch a full view of the ſubject, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withhold our aſtoniſhment that Mr. Burr, and Mr. Tazewell, ſhould each of them, in the ſenate, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:029752_0236_0FE25580552FA138"/>
propoſitions of amendment, ſingle out this article, among others, as a proper object of cenſure and repeal.</p>
               <p>There is one more objection to this article, which merits ſome attention for its ſingularity; and becauſe it places in a ſtrong light, the extreme jealouſy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination to condemn, with which every part of the treaty has been read. It is apprehended or rather pretended to be, that the king of Great Britain will engroſs all the ſhares of our ſeveral American banks, and thereby obtain the entire controul of them and fill them with Britiſh directors. It is juſt as rational to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he will buy up all our goods and chattels, and thereby put a total ſtop to agriculture and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If the king of Great Britain is diſpoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his money for the diſturbance of our government, there are much more effective methods of doing it than by the indirect means of our banks. Such an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ridiculous in the extreme, and cannot ſurely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on the moſt credulous mind, eſpecially when it is known that the ſeveral bank charters expreſsly provide that <hi>all the directors ſhall be American citizens,</hi> and that no ſtockholder ſhall be entitled to vote for a director unleſs he either <hi>attends in perſon or reſides within the Untied States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have now finiſhed an examination of the firſt ten articles of the treaty, and which form the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent part; for the commercial articles which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low being of more difficult adjuſtment, and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not being ſo eaſily aſcertained by theory as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, were wiſely limited to a ſhort period. It has often been aſked, and with an air of conſcious triumph, what ſingle equivalent have we got for ſo many and great conceſſions on our part? Let us review for a moment the ground we have gone over, and ſee if an anſwer cannot be given which will ſatisfy all the real friends to the intereſt of our country.</p>
               <p>We have gained all the weſtern poſts without bloodſhed—we have obtained a promiſe of complete
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029752_0237_0FE25581E576F910"/>
indemnity for all unlawful ſpoliations on our trade, as ſoon as an impartial tribunal ſhall have aſcertained the amount of our loſſes—We have obtained a liberal and permanent commerce between our frontiers and the whole frontier of the Britiſh provinces in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and we have by theſe means removed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſources of national complaint againſt Great-Britain, and ſecured to our country the continuance of the bleſſings of peace. And what have we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded on our part? We have promiſed to pay ſuch loſſes only as Britiſh creditors have ſuffered in their debts, by occaſion of legal impediments in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as ſoon as an impartial tribunal ſhall have aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the amount of ſuch loſſes, and to pay for ſuch Britiſh veſſels only as we have ſuffered, without uſing the means in our power to prevent it, to be captured within our territory, contrary to the law of nations. And we have alſo allowed a liberal and permanent commerce between Canada and our interior poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe are the material parts of the permanent treaty, and it appears that both nations have conceded, in thoſe inſtances, what in juſtice and equity they ought to have done, and to have manifeſted a mutual diſpoſition to forget paſt animoſity, and to live upon friendly terms hereafter.</p>

               <p>IN examining the commercial part of the treaty, we are not to enquire, as we have heretofore done, into matter of ſtrict right. Arrangements of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce muſt depend upon the good will and pleaſure of the contracting parties. They are things of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obligation only, and cannot be peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Every nation will accommodate ſo far, and ſo far only, as ſuits her intereſts or policy, and it will always be a queſtion to be determined in ſound diſcretion by other powers, how far <hi>their</hi> intereſt or policy will admit of a connexion, on ſuch terms as can
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029752_0238_0FE25583731652C8"/>
be obtained. Commercial propoſitions may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acceded to, or rejected by either party, without affording to the other any juſt cauſe of war. It is therefore a matter for conſideration, how far the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining articles of the treaty are admiſſible or not, upon the principles of public expediency.</p>
               <p>Although the 12th article may now very properly be left out of diſcuſſion, yet ſince it is the faſhion to reprobate it in the moſt unqualified terms, and to uſe it as an inſtrument for inflaming the public paſſions, as well as to carry diſgrace to the other parts of the work, it may not be amiſs to give it ſome examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is well known that every European nation has endeavoured, more or leſs, to monopolize to itſelf, the commerce of its colonies, and upon that account pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the ſhips of foreign nations from trading to them, and has prohibited them from importing Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean goods from any foreign nation.—This has been the caſe with Denmark, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, although the manner in which this monopoly has been exerciſed in thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations, has been very different. Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has been as much diſtinguiſhed as any of her neighbours, during a century paſt, for a pertinacious adherence to the monopoly ſyſtem, and it has become one of the rivetted maxims of her policy, to regard the excluſive enjoyment of her colony trade, as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nurſery of ſeamen, and a conſtant ſupport of her naval power. So late as the year 1783, Lord Sheffield gave his ſanction to this ancient doctrine, and ſaid, that it would be impolitic in Great Britain to admit American veſſels into the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands, and we ſee with what great allowance we ought to compare the privileges conceded in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, with the theory of an unlimited commerce.</p>
               <p>The French convention, during their preſent revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, have recognized and adopted the Engliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:029752_0239_0FE2558B574D2238"/>
This appears from the eloquent report of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, upon their navigation act, which is intended for perpetuity, and is declared to be the baſis of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and commerce. The act ordains, that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſhall be imported into France, but in French veſſels, or in thoſe of the country which produced the commodity; and that foreign veſſels ſhall not tranſport from one French port to another, any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the growth or manufactures of France or her colonies.—And, notwithſtanding the neceſſities of the war may have induced the French to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary departure from this act, we may be aſſured, the principles advanced in the report, are too generally and powerfully felt, not to induce them to adhere to it on the return of peace, as the ſure baſis of their maritime ſtrength. "The prohibitions of a naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion act," ſays Barrere, "ſhould be as extenſive as they could be made, for without them it would be a mere illu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ory meaſure. The Engliſh," continues he, "from whom we borrow this ſyſtem, have given it that extenſion, and, indeed, they are to be applauded for it."</p>
               <p>When we conſider the value that is attached to the carrying trade, in the opinion of the European nations, we have no reaſon to be diſappointed that Mr. Jay could not get acceſs to the Britiſh Iſlands on better terms. It was to have been wiſhed that he could have got the admiſſion of veſſels of any burden into this trade, but this was undoubtedly beyond his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. While Great Britain conſented to admit us to trade to her iſlands in our own bottoms, we may be aſſured ſhe was determined to do it in ſuch a manner as not materially to affect her carrying trade, the ſource of her ſecurity and greatneſs. This muſt have been the reaſon with her for reſtricting our veſſels to 70 tons and under (and indeed it is underſtood that the treaty was kept open for ſome time on the part of Mr. Jay, while he was endeavouring to extend this clauſe) and from carrying any molaſſes, ſugar, coffee,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:029752_0240_0FE2558E04C90578"/>
cocoa or cotton, either from her iſlands in veſſels of the United States, to any where but this country. It will be aſked why Great Britain ſhonld wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from carrying any of theſe articles to Europe, provided they are not the growth of her iſlands? the anſwer is, that nothing ſhort of a total prohibition, would in her opinion, effectually ſecure her carrying trade, ſince her own and foreign ſugar or coffee would not eaſily be diſtinguiſhed, and any modification would have opened a wide door to elude the whole intent of the reſtraint, would have rendered the whole prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to uſe the words of Barrere, <hi>a mere illuſory meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not my intention to vindicate either the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or liberality of this policy on the part of Great Britain. It is ſufficient to ſay that it appears to have been her inflexible policy, and to which ſhe thought herſelf bound in duty to adhere. The only queſtion is, whether there was any reaſonable proſpect at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of our obtaining better terms; and if not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not upon the whole for our intereſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the trade upon thoſe terms? This may yet be a doubtful point, though I acknowledge a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable objection to the 12th article as it now ſtands, that is, the prohibition to carry melaſſes, ſugar, cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp;c. to Europe, is ſo general as to include thoſe articles even of our own production. This prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with reſpect to coffee and ſugar in particular, it is ſaid, would be very inconvenient to us during the preſent war, though in time of peace it would be of no conſequence.—The 12th article does not prohibit us from exporting any of thoſe articles from the other Weſt India iſlands to any part of the world. We are only reſtricted from exporting them from the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands (except to the United States) in order to preſerve to the Engliſh their carrying trade, and from the United States in order to preſerve the other reſtraint from evaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:029752_0241_0FE2558F937425F8"/>It ought not to be forgotten that this article was limited to two years from the concluſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war, and then the contracting parties were to endeavour to regulate this trade, with a view to their mutual advantage, and <hi>the extenſion of commerce;</hi> and if they ſhould not agree on new arrangements, all the articles of the treaty, except the firſt ten, were to fall to the ground. At the end of the two years we ſhould moſt probably have entered on the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with much leſs difficulty than at preſent.—The Britiſh Weſt-Indies would have been for ſome time accuſtomed to the benefits of our trade, and have got into the habit of placing their dependence as well as their affections upon it; while the mother country would have been a little familiarized to our trade with her colonies, and her jealouſies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices would probably have greatly diminiſhed with regard to it. We ſhould have renewed the diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all thoſe advantages which we now want, and the chance is, that the intercourſe would not only have been continued but been attended with a favorable enlargement. And if eventually the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation ſhould have failed and left only the ten firſt articles of the treaty remaining, yet thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as we noticed in the laſt number, are well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the miſſion, ſince they reſtore tranquillity and juſtice to our country.</p>
               <p>The 13th article of the treaty relates to our commerce with the Britiſh Eaſt-Indies, and all the advantages which art conceded to us by this article, are without the ſmalleſt pretended equivalent on our part. The privileges of this article are not denied by thoſe who have been moſt diſtinguiſhed for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate condemnation of the whole treaty. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> complains, however, that our commerce was on a better footing before, by the mere permiſſion of the Britiſh government. It is ſufficient to obſerve in anſwer to this, that the ſame permiſſion can ſtill be continued: there is nothing in this article which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:029752_0242_0FE255912668EA90"/>
the India coaſting trade. It would have been unneceſſary, for ſuch prohibition exiſted before. The article barely declares, that none of its privileges ſhall be conſtrued to extend to the coaſting trade. In other reſpects it leaves that trade juſt as it found it, under the precarious pleaſure of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But prior to this article, our whole inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Britiſh Eaſt-India was a matter of favor, and ſurely it is a very important conſideration that we can now claim it as a matter of right. Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon, in his report on the privileges and reſtrictions of our commerce in foreign countries, ſeems to have thought very differently from <hi>Decius</hi> on the ſubject of a precarious trade. He conſidered a commerce depending on the ſole diſcretion of a foreign power, as a real inconvenience. "The diſadvantage (he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) of a tenure which may be ſuddenly diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, was experienced by our merchants on a late occaſion. The embarraſſments of the moment were great, and the poſſibility of their renewal lays our commerce to England under a ſpecies of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The diſtinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of fixed laws, while that ſecurity is given to the navigation of others."</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks of Mr. Jefferſon are ſolid; and they out-weigh a thouſand town-meeting reſolves. <hi>Without this treaty our trade to every British port can be interdicted by a nod of the Britiſh executive.</hi> But by this treaty, our commerce to England and the Eaſt-Indies, which now reſts on the will of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry or the colonial government, is placed on the footing of permanent right. In this reſpect we gain an immenſe advantage—an advantage that we do not enjoy to the ſame extent, with any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon earth.</p>
               <p>The commercial conceſſions on the part of Great-Britain, which we have been juſt reviewing, are not only equal, but ſuperior to thoſe which are to be met
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:029752_0243_0FE2559B639158C0"/>
with in the commercial treaties between her and othe powers, for more than a century paſt.</p>
               <p>The treaty between Great-Britain and Spain, in 1667, and which for its advantages in matters of trade, was confirmed in 1713, takes ſpecial care to limit the commerce of the two nations to the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, provinces and iſlands, <hi>to which trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce had before been accuſtomed.</hi> And yet two years afterwards his Catholic majeſty, as an evidence of his inclination to cultivate friendſhip, does indeed allow the Engliſh to gather ſalt in the iſle of Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas, <hi>becauſe they had enjoyed that liberty in the reign of Charles II.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the treaty of commerce and navigation between Great-Britain and Ruſſia, which was made in the year 1766, the friendly privileges of trade between the two powers, were confined to ſuch places <hi>where leave in granted to the ſubjects of other nations.</hi> In the ſame ſpirit of jealouſy and colony monopoly, which appears but too prevalent throughout Europe, Ruſſia takes care in her treaty of amity and commerce with Denmark, in the year 1782, to except from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial grant, her ports of the Black and Caſpain ſeas, and all her other poſſeſſions in Aſia—and the king of Denmark, on his part, excepts alſo his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in America, and elſewhere out of Europe. Nay, in the more recent treaty between France and England in 1786, and which was made with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs view of promoting a more liberal intercourſe, the trade is limited to each other's territories <hi>ſituated in Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor have our own treaties of commerce with the powers of Europe been more favored in this reſpect. In the treaty with France, on which ſo much unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified applauſe has been beſtowed by the enemies of the inſtrument under conſideration, there is no very extenſive admiſſion to her colonial poſſeſſions. France indeed grants us as a matter of favor, one or more free ports in Europe, and <hi>the free ports which have
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:029752_0244_0FE2559D2B8213A8"/>
been end are open in the French iſlands in America.</hi> And in our treaty of commerce with Holland, we expreſsly ſtipulate to leave to the Dutch the <hi>peaceable enjoyment of their rights in the countries, iſlands, and ſeas, in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, without any hindrance or moleſtation.</hi> This is, indeed, ſtipulating for the per petuity of their monopoly. On the other hand, Great Britain, by the 13th article of the preſent treaty, gives us a free and liberal admiſſion into all her terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in the Eaſt Indies; on immenſe country, which contains more than twenty millions of inhabitants, is guarded by an army of above 70,000 men—and yields an annual revenue of more than eight millions ſterling. And the only reſtriction to which we bind ourſelves, in return, is not to carry <hi>her</hi> Eaſt India commodities to any country but America, where they ſhall he unladen—a reſtriction which Britain could very reaſonably aſk as a ſecurity to her carrying trade.</p>
               <p>I cannot but conclude, that every reaſonable man will ſee in this article, ſome evidence of a ſpirit of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation on the part of Great Britain, and much proof of influence and ability in our negociator.</p>

                  <p>One would think that this article was ſo recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as to admit of no ground of cenſure.

                  <p>The reflection of <hi>Decius,</hi> that our "envoy has, in this place, brought the principles of inequality into conſpicuous action, as if anxious to circumſcribe our commerce, and that he loſes no opportunity of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrictions on it," has not a ſhadow of foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—it is the fabrication of a moſt malignant mind. The whole article is founded on moſt equal and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal principles, ſo far as regards Great Britain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of her colonies: but in proportion to the extent of the manufactures and export of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is moſt advantageous to America.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid we are not admitted into all the Britiſh colonies. True; but ſuch admiſſion would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to us without an equivalent, for we have no colonies to exchange the benefit.</p>
                  <p>Let us contraſt this article with the privileges ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the treaty with France, negociated by the "Venerable Franklin." By the 30th article of that treaty, "The moſt chriſtian majeſty will grant the ſubjects of the United States <hi>one or more free ports in Europe,</hi> and the free ports which have been and are
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:029752_0246_0FE255A0504A5D48"/>
open in the French iſlands." Since the revolution, neceſſity has compelled the convention to open all the ports in France: but which nation was moſt liberal in times of peace, or moſt jealous of its trade?</p>
                  <p>Great Britain opens <hi>all</hi> her ports in Europe—all her ports in the Eaſt Indies—and all her ports in the Weſt Indies, to veſſels of ſmall burden, reſtricting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the direct carrying trade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> her colonies to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. France opened one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> ports in Europe, ſome of her ports in the Weſt Indies, and not one in the Eaſt Indies.</p>
                  <p>This is a fair ſtatement of the advantages of trade with the two countries, as we enjoyed them with France before the revolution, and as we ſhould enjoy them by the preſent treaty with Great Britain; and let any man decide, which treaty is the moſt liberal, in reſpect to opening the ports of the two countries and their colonies. The advantage is infinitely on the ſide of the preſent treaty with Great Britain.</p>

                  <head>Article 15.</head>
                  <p>This article ſtipulates that each nation ſhall be treated by the other, on the footing of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored nation. So far the article correſponds exactly with all our other treaties: viz. with France, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Holland and Pruſſia. The ſecond clauſe of the article, reſerving to Great Britain the right of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties on our tonnage, equal to what we impoſe on Britiſh tonnage in our ports, concedes nothing but what Great Britain now enjoys; that is, the right of treating our trade as we treat hers. And the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the laſt clauſe that the United States will not for a certain period increaſe the duties on Britiſh ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, is a reſtriction that cannot injure our trade.</p>
                  <p>Indeed no objection ſeems to be made to this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, except that it binds the United States to treat Great Britain as well as we treat other nations. This, with men of party ſpirit, who ſuffer their paſſions to lead their opinions, is a moſt unpardonable crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="unknown:029752_0247_0FE255AA9DC10CD8"/>
I truſt, however, that the government of America will regulate its meaſures, even towards Great Britain, with juſtice and impartiality. I am perſuaded it is not only moſt honorable, but moſt expedient; and that juſtice and a ſpirit of accommodation will procure more advantages than a revengeful, retaliating, hoſtile diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>The 16th, reſpecting conſuls, is probably not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionable.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Article 17.</head>
                  <p>This is one of the articles which has excited the moſt violent clamors. Indeed we cannot but obſerve, that ſuch articles as may affect the French, are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with more warmth than thoſe which affect ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the intereſts of the United States. It would ſeem by the zeal diſcovered on this occaſion, that this treaty ought firſt to have conſulted the wants and wiſhes of France; and the intereſts of the United States ought to have been only a <hi>ſecondary</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is certainly a precept of high authority, "that we ſhould love our neighbour as ourſelves;" but I know of no rule that requires one nation to love another <hi>better</hi> than itſelf.</p>
                  <p>I am diſpoſed to treat the French nation with the utmoſt impartiality, juſtice and friendſhip; and in our compacts with their enemies, we ought to make no ſacrifices of their intereſt, and yield no points to their enemies, which the neceſſity of the caſe and the eſſential intereſts of our own country do not require.</p>
                  <p>By this maxim let the articles which may affect France be fairly examined.</p>
                  <p>The great objection to the 17th article is, that it "has ſolemnly relinquiſhed a point, which to us was of more value than the amount of all the depredations on our trade, the ſums due to us for negroes, and loſſes by detention of our poſts." Now, what is the point relinquiſhed? The anſwer is, nothing which was our own; nothing which we could command: nothing which the Britiſh nation did not enjoy before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="unknown:029752_0248_0FE255AC2D294F50"/>
The article ſtipulates, that veſſels captured on ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of having enemies' property on board, or of carrying contraband articles to an enemy, ſhall be brought into the neareſt or moſt convenient port, and if any property of an enemy is found on board, that part only which belongs to the enemy ſhall be made prize. This is ſaid to be a relinquiſhment of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant point on our part. This is a groſs miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>
                  <p>Relinquiſhment implies an abandonment of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſſeſſed. If we never had a right to prevent the capture of our veſſels, on ſuſpicion of having ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies property on board, and to prevent the ſeizure of that property, then we have not relinquiſhed it. But that right, with reſpect to nations not in treaty with us, we never poſſeſſed; we, therefore, have yielded nothing that we before enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>By the law of nations, any neutral veſſel may be ſtopped and ſearched, and any property of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my found on board, may be ſeized. This law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altered but by conſent of the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Great Britain has that right confeſſedly, and ſhe will not at preſent conſent to relinquiſh it. She <hi>will</hi> exerciſe that right—ſhe <hi>does</hi> exerciſe it—and where is the power to compel her to abandon it?—<hi>We</hi> have no ſuch power, nor is there a power on earth that has a right to demand it, or authority to enforce ſuch a demand. If that is ever ſurrendered, it muſt be by voluntary conſent.</p>
                  <p>This being the true ſtate of things, what has the article of the treaty ſtipulated? Obſerve the trade. It is not ſaid the property of an enemy <hi>may</hi> be taken—but, taking the right for granted, it ſays, the <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's property, only, ſhall</hi> be made prize.</p>
                  <p>The article further ſtipulates, and this was obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the main purpoſe of inſerting it in the treaty, that the veſſel ſhall be ſuffered to proceed with the reſt of her cargo, without impediment—that there
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:029752_0249_0FE255ADC18DF6E8"/>
ſhall be no delay in deciding on ſuch caſes and in the payment or recovery of indemnification by the owners or by the maſters of the veſſels.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the whole amount of the article is, that the practice of ſtopping and examining ſhip for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's property—a practice authorized by the law of nations—a practice which Great Britain will not reſign, and which we cannot perſuade or compel her to reſign—that this practice ſhall be rendered as little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to our trade as poſſible. The article was intended to reſtrain, as far as poſſible, the abuſes of this practice by licentious privateers.</p>
                  <p>There are many men, who, without any rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct preſcribed to them, would behave with unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed licentiouſneſs; but if a national compact is before their eyes, they will reſpect the rules preſcribed. So far, therefore, as the article goes, it can do no harm; but it may and often will do good.</p>
                  <p>But to exhibit this thing in ſtill ſtronger light, I will give the whole of Mr. Jefferſon's letter on the ſubject. It is an anſwer to a remonſtrance from Mr. Genet to the preſident, reſpecting the ſeizure of French property on board of American veſſels, dated July 9, 1793. It is the very point in queſtion, and as the reaſoning of Mr. Jefferſon is, in the preſent caſe unanſwerable, it is proper the public ſhould have the letter entire.</p>

                        <p>YOUR favor of the 9th inſt. covered the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Silvat Ducamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Gaſton de Nogere, and G. Beuſtier,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:029752_0250_0FE255AF4FC94E38"/>
that being on their paſſage from the French Weſt-Indies to the United States, with ſlaves and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of their property, theſe veſſels were ſtopped by Britiſh armed veſſels, and their property taken out as lawful prize.</p>
                        <p>I believe it cannot be doubted, but that by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral law of nations, the goods of a friend found in the veſſels of an enemy, are free, and the goods of an enemy, found in the veſſel of a friend, are lawful prize. Upon this principle, I preſume, the Britiſh armed veſſels have taken the property of French ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens found in our veſſels, in the caſes above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and I confeſs I ſhould be at a loſs on what principle to reclaim it. It is true, that ſundry na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſirous of avoiding the inconvenience of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their veſſels ſtopped at ſea, ranſacked, carried into port, detained, under pretence of having ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's goods on board, have, in many inſtances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by their ſpecial treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms ſhall make ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much leſs embarraſſing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain and loſs; but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling, in ſpecial caſes, the general principle of the law of nations, and therefore taking effect between ſuch nations only as have ſo agreed to cantroul it. England has generally determined to adhere to the rigorous principle, having, in no inſtance, as far as I recollect, agreed to the modification of letting the property of the goods follow that of the veſſel, except in the ſingle one of her treaty with France. We have adopted this modification in our treaties with France, the United Netherlands, and Pruſſia; and therefore, as to them, our veſſels cover the goods of their enemies, and we loſe our goods when in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of their enemies. Accordingly, you will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recollect, that in the late caſe of Holland and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:029752_0251_0FE255B98D4EB148"/>
Mackie, citizens of the United States, who had laden a cargo of flour on board a Britiſh veſſel, which was taken by the French frigate Ambuſcade, and brought into this port; when I reclaimed the cargo, it was only on the ground that they were ignorant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of war when it was ſhipped.</p>
                        <p>You obſerved, however, that the 14th article of our treaty had provided that ignorance ſhould not he pleaded beyond two months after the declaration of war, which term had elapſed, in this caſe, by ſome few days; and finding that to be the truth, though their real ignorance was equally true, I declined the reclamation, as it never was in my view to reclaim the cargo, nor in yours to offer to reſtore it, by queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the rule eſtabliſhed in our treaty, that enemy bottoms make enemy goods. With England, Spain, Portugal and Auſtria, we have no treaties; therefore we have nothing to oppoſe to their acting according to the general law of nations, that enemy goods are lawful prize, though found in the bottoms of a friend. Nor do I ſee that France can ſuffer, on the whole, for though ſhe loſes her goods in our veſſels, when found therein by England, Spain, Portugal or Auſtria, yet ſhe gains our goods when found in the veſſels of England, Spain, Portugal, Auſtria, the United Netherlands or Pruſſia; and I believe I may ſafely affirm, that we have more goods afloat in the veſſels of theſe ſix nations, than France has afloat in our veſſels, and conſequently, that France is the gainer, and we the loſer, by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our treaty; indeed we are loſers in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that principle; for when it works in our favor, it is to ſave the goods of our friends; when it works againſt us, it is to loſe our own; and we ſhall continue to loſe while the rule is only partially eſtabliſhed. When we ſhall have eſtabliſhed it with all nations, we ſhall be in a condition neither to gain nor loſe, but ſhall be leſs expoſed to vexatious ſearches at ſea. To this condition we are endeavouring to advance; but as it depends on the will of other nations, as well as our
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029752_0252_0FE255BB4E1AC760"/>
own, we can only obtain it when they ſhall be ready to concur.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, therefore, but flatter myſelf, that on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing the caſes of Ducamp and others, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that their loſſes reſult from the ſtate of war, which has permitted their enemies to take their goods, though found in our veſſels, and conſequently, from circumſtances over which we have no controul.</p>
                        <p>The rudeneſs to their perſons practiſed by their enemies, is certainly not favorable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as much as for the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it to our own citizens, their companions, and find in it a motive for requiring meaſures to be taken, which may prevent repetitions of it.</p>

                  <p>I beg the reader to note the following clauſe of the foregoing letter: "To this condition, we are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to advance; but as it depends on the <hi>will of other nations</hi> as well as our own, we can only obtain it, when THEY ſhall be ready to concur."</p>
                  <p>I will cloſe with remarking, that by our treaty with France, it is expreſsly ſtipulated, that <hi>free</hi> ſhips ſhould make <hi>free</hi> goods. The convention, however in 1793, ordered veſſels, laden with proviſions, to be carried into their ports, in violation of that treaty. They afterwards revoked the decree with reſpect to American veſſels. They afterwards extended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to American veſſels, in defiance of the treaty. A few months ago, they relented, confeſſed they had ill-treated their allies, and annulled the decree a ſecond time. A ſtatement of theſe facts was made by the preſident to congreſs, Dec. 5, 1793. See his addreſs

                  <p>Such unſteadineſs in public meaſures operates pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to the prejudice of trade. The merchant, if he knows enemy's property is liable to ſeizure, may avoid riſk by declining to take it on board. But when a nation is changing its regulations on this head, the merchant is expoſed to vexations, without the power of avoiding the evil.</p>

                  <head>Article 18.</head>
                  <p>THIS is one of the articles in the treaty which gives great offence. The objections to it are—"That it enumerates among contraband goods, timber for ſhip building, tar and rozin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſſels, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted; and that it admits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in certain caſes to be contraband," contrary to all our other treaties, and even contrary to the treaty of 1786, between Great Britain and France.</p>
                  <p>I frankly acknowledge that no part of the treaty is more vulnerable than this:—no part can furniſh more ſubſtantial grounds of complaint.</p>
                  <p>This article proceeds from a ſtrict adherence on the part of Great Britain, to every part of the law of nations, which favors her ſuperiority as a great mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time power; and its defence reſts on the inability of our envoy to procure a relaxation of thoſe laws.</p>
                  <p>The time for negociating this article was unfavora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as in moſt other reſpects it was favorable. Great Britain, always anxious to preſerve her naval ſtrength, the great and only bulwark of the nation, is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a moſt inveterate war with France, a war on which her very exiſtence depends, and at this time, will not yield one clauſe of the law of nations, to
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:029752_0254_0FE255BE6A1208E8"/>
abridge her own power of crippling the naval force of her enemy. This is a ſixed point; and our envoy could only admit the article in that form.</p>
                  <p>There were but two alterations; both of which would reſult in the <hi>ſame conſequences to our trade.</hi>—This idea is an important one. If the article had been rejected by our miniſter, Great Britain <hi>has,</hi> and actually <hi>exerciſes,</hi> the right by the general laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to conſider all thoſe articles contraband, and to declare them ſuch, when ſhe judges that by theſe means ſhe can reduce her enemy. If the article was received, it could give no greater latitude to Great Britain than ſhe enjoyed before. Whichever alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive our envoy might chooſe, our trade muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the exerciſe of the ſame right and to the ſame embarraſſments.</p>
                  <p>If the right of treating all the articles mentioned as contraband, reſults from the law of nations, and if Great Britain will not abandon that right, is it not better, in a treaty of a temporary nature, to accede to the right, and enumerate the articles which are liable to ſeizure and confiſcation, that our merchants may know the law, and avoid loſſes, than to ſuffer that right to ſtand on the law of nations, which is leſs known and which might expoſe our citizens to heavy loſſes.</p>
                  <p>Every liberal man muſt wiſh to ſee the field of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations in war narrowed as much as poſſible: but if we cannot circumſcribe that field, is it not of great importance to our citizens, to mark out the ground with diſtinct lines, that every man may diſtinguiſh it and ſhun the danger?</p>
                  <p>Every rational perſon will ſay, <hi>it is;</hi> and this is the effect of this article of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>I know it has been contended that timber and proviſions are not, by the law of nations, contraband. But Vattel, a modern French writer, of the higheſt authority, includes them among contraband goods.
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:029752_0255_0FE255C776798A98"/>
His words are, "Commodities particularly uſed in war, and the importation of which to an enemy is prohibited, are called contraband goods. Such are arms, military and naval ſtores, timber, horſes, and even proviſions, in certain junctures, when there are hopes of reducing the enemy by famine." Book 3. ch. 7. Sect. 112.</p>
                  <p>The words, naval ſtores, includes cordage, hemp, tar, rozin, and every thing that ſerves for the equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſhips of war. In the treaty of 1786, Great-Britain and France had excepted naval ſtores and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from the liſt of contraband articles. That treaty is annulled by the preſent war; and in a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous collection of treaties now before me, I find no inſtance of an enumeration of naval ſtores, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from contraband, by Great-Britain. But naval ſtores are generally left by that nation, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband by the general law of nations. The right to conſider them ſo, can be abridged only by treaty; and Great-Britain, at this moment, will conſent to no ſuch abridgment.</p>
                  <p>Some people ſay, it is better to let this point reſt on the law of nations, than to admit it in a treaty. This is merely a matter of expedience; but if the ſafety of the merchants' property is conſulted, it is unqueſtionably better to have the contraband articles enumerated.</p>
                  <p>The ſtipulations in the 2d and 3d clauſe, of the 18th article, are in favor of neutral veſſels. The agreement, that when proviſions are regarded as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband, they ſhall be paid for to their full value, with a mercantile profit, freight and demurrage, is a rule of direction to the captors, that may prove favorable to a neutral trade, ſubject to be embarraſſed by powers at war. And the proviſion of the laſt clauſe, that neutral veſſels entering a blockaded port, not knowing it to be blockaded, ſhall not be ſeized and
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029752_0256_0FE255C92A16E318"/>
confiſcated for the firſt attempt, is equally ſalutary and favorable.</p>

                  <p>This article provides againſt the ill uſage which the ſubjects of neutral powers are liable to receive from the commanders of ſhips of war and privateers. This article is common in treaties—it is in nearly the ſame words, as in all our other treaties with foreign nations.</p>
                  <p>But it will be of much more uſe between Great Britain and America, as It will operate as a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt impreſſing American ſeamen on board of Engliſh ſhips. It has been objected to the treaty, that no proviſion of this kind is included in it. But the 19th article is a direct prohibition of this practice.</p>
                  <p>On account of a ſameneſs of language, it is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that ſome effectual mode might be deviſed to diſtinguiſh American from Britiſh ſeamen. It might be of importance that American ſeamen ſhould be provided with certificates of their citizenſhip, under the ſeal of ſome public officer. This doubtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the attention of our executive, perhaps of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as not only Britiſh commanders, but French alſo, have miſtaken American ſeamen for Britiſh, and our citizens are thus expoſed to injuſtice from both parties.</p>
                  <p>It has been objected that the bonds required of the commanders of privateers to indemnify perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, are not large enough—the ſums being limited to 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling for ſmall privateers, and 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, in caſe the privateer carries more than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men. It is ſufficient to ſay, in anſwer to this, that few caſes can occur, where damages to a greater amount will be incurred: and where the bonds do not ſecure the damages, a complaint to government will inſure any further claims founded in juſtice.</p>
                  <p>It may be obſerved, that this clauſe of the article is copied nearly from a ſimilar one in the treaty of 1786, between Great Britain and France. The ſums
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:029752_0257_0FE255CABA055908"/>
limited by that treaty are the ſame; and will probably be found equal to all neceſſary purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt clauſe obliges judges of admiralty, in caſe any ſentence of condemnation has been pronounced againſt veſſels or goods, to deliver on demand authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic copies of the proceedings to the maſter, he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the legal fees. A ſtipulation of this kind was neceſſary; as inſtances of delay and refuſal of ſuch cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es have been experienced by our citizens during the preſent war.</p>
                  <p>The 20th article is uſual in all treaties. It makes proviſion for guarding property from pirates, or reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to its proper owners—a proviſion of mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to the contracting parties, and liable to no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

                  <p>THIS article prohibits the ſubjects of the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, to commit acts of hoſtility againſt each other—to accept commiſſions from a foreign prince or ſtate, enemies to the other party—to enliſt them into military ſervice, &amp;c. and declares that the laws againſt ſuch offences ſhall be punctually executed. The law of the United States, paſſed in June 1794, enacts the penalty of a fine, nor exceeding 2000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and impriſonment for the foregoing offences.</p>
                  <p>The ſame article of the treaty makes it piracy to accept a foreign commiſſion or letter of marque, for arming any privateer to act against the other party. This is prohibited alſo by the ſome law of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, under a penalty of impriſonment, at the diſcretion of the court, and a fine not exceeding 5000 dollars.</p>

When the treaty firſt appeared, this article ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited much acrimony. It was conſidered as pointed at the military manoeuvres of a late French mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who had attempted to excite Americans to war againſt the Spaniſh ſettlements, and to priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teering againſt Great Britain. It was ſuppoſed to reſtrain the right of <hi>expatriation;</hi> a doctrine firſt propagated by the ſame Frenchman, to evade the law of nations and a doctrine which never would have entered the heads of our citizens, had it not been taught by that artful ſophiſt. In giving their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided opinion againſt this article of the treaty, many raſh men found themſelves in a dilemma, when they were informed that the article was in our treaty with France.</p>
                  <p>So eager were people of a certain faction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole treaty, that they would not give themſelves time to be informed whether it was right or wrong. But when they came to be told that they were reſtrained from taking foreign commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to act againſt a power at peace with the United States, by the acknowledged laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by an expreſs ſtatute of the United States, and by an article in all our other treaties, they began to bluſh for their haſte in giving opinions on what they did not underſtand. No article in the treaty is more requiſite for the peace of our nation, and none more conformable to the principles of juſtice between governments.</p>
                  <p>Vattel ſays, "a nation ought not to ſuffer the citizens to do an injury to the ſubjects of another ſtate, much leſs to offend the ſtate itſelf. If you let looſe the reins of your ſubjects againſt foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theſe will behave in the ſame manner to you; and inſtead of that friendly intercourſe which nature has eſtabliſhed between all men, we ſhould ſee nothing but one nation robbing another." B. 2. ch. 6.</p>
                  <p>"I account aſſociates of an enemy, thoſe who

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. ch. 6.</p>
                  <p>A nation is not accountable for every act of an individual citizen; but if a ſtate or nation openly permits the citizens to take part with the enemies of a third nation, that third nation has a right to conſider that ſtate as making a common cauſe with its enemies, and to declare war againſt it of courſe. The peace of neutral nations depends on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of this article of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>It has been objected to this article, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional, as it creates the crime of piracy, when the power of defining piracy is veſted in congreſs. But the act of congreſs before mentioned, admits the right of the preſident and ſenate to define piracy in treaties; as the 9th ſection enacts, "that nothing in the act ſhall be conſtrued to prevent the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or puniſhment of treaſon or <hi>a piracy defined by a treaty,</hi> or other law of the United States."</p>
                  <p>Nothing marks the partiality of a certain faction more diſtinctly than their objections to this article. We have had a ſimilar article in our treaty with France more than ſeventeen years: and in our treaties with Sweden, Pruſſia, and the States General, more than ten years, and not a ſyllable of objection was liſped againſt the principle. People did not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally know that ſuch an article exiſted. But the moment our government treats Great Britain with the ſame meaſure of juſtice, as we had before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved towards other nations, our Jacobins begin to clamor.</p>
                  <p>It is this popular partiality for France; this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to favour every thing French, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of every principle of juſtice and equity, which occaſions all the difficulty our executive has encountered in preſerving our peace, and in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating our differences with Great Britain. Nay more; this partiality diſplayed on all occaſions, and to a degree highly improper for a neutral nation,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029752_0260_0FE255D7936B7F20"/>
has been a principal cauſe of the abuſive treatment our ſeamen have received from Britiſh privateers.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed on all hands, that our intereſt as a nation is ſuper-eminently concerned in preſerving peace. But how can peace be ſecured unleſs we treat the powers at war with impartiality and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? Vattel obſerves, "A neutral nation deſirous ſafely to enjoy the conveniences of that ſtate, is in all things to ſhew an exact impartiality between the parties at war; for ſhould one nation favour another to its detriment, that nation cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain if the other treats it as an adherent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate of his enemy."</p>
                  <p>Our people have indeed a fine apology for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preference to France; that of favouring liberty and republicaniſm. So far as the French fight for national independence againſt the combined powers, they are engaged in a juſt and neceſſary war, and the wiſhes of all Americans muſt be with them. But people who think France has a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other free government, are egregiouſly miſtaken. Nor is there as great a proſpect of her eſtabliſhing a republic, as there is that ſhe is doomed to deſpotiſm, or to be ſplit into a multitude of ſmall factious democracies, perpetually at war with each other.</p>
                  <p>People are, therefore, in every view, unjuſtifiable in aiding any of the powers at war, in a manner not warranted by the laws of neutrality. As we value our own government, and the proſperity of the country, we are to avoid every act which can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a breach on our public peace. It is raſhneſs and madneſs to combine our intereſt with any Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean power in ſuch a manner, as to be drawn into their political contentions. The pretence of aiding the <hi>cauſe of liberty</hi> is a mere artifice to catch our paſſions. If the nations of Europe cannot defend their liberties, we cannot be anſwerable for their ill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ucceſs. We aid them beſt by our peace and our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The 22d article of the treaty ſtipulates, that in caſe of injuries or damage on one ſide or the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party will authoriſe repriſals, until a ſtatement of the ſame, verified by proof, ſhall be preſented to the other, and ſatisfaction demanded. This ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation is in exact conformity with the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is ſupported by principles of policy and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The proviſions in the 23d article are well adapted to advance the intentions of the contracting parties, and are reciprocally beneficial. The permiſſion of American veſſels to enter prohibited ports in caſe of diſtreſs, is a conceſſion conformable to the laws of hoſpitality.</p>
                  <p>The objection to the clauſe which enjoins a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be paid to officers according ſo their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, can be raiſed only by men who are deſtitute of the civility, which enjoins that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The 24th article prohibits foreign privateers with commiſſions, from a prince or ſtate in enmity with either nation, to arm or ſell prizes in the ports of the parties.</p>
                  <p>The 25th article makes it lawful for the ſhips of war and privateers of either party to enter the ports of the other, without being liable to be ſearched, ſeized, or detained, or to pay admiralty fees.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtipulations are alſo in our treaty with France; and no well grounded objection has been made to them. Some ſuperficial people have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they claſh with our treaty with France. But there is an expreſs declaration that theſe ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſhall not be conſtrued to operate contrary to former exiſting treaties. And if no ſuch caution had been taken, the treaty with Great Britain could not have operated to the prejudice of France: for it is an expreſs law of nations. "That a ſovereign (or ſtate) already bound by a treaty, cannot make others contrary to the firſt. The things about
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:029752_0262_0FE255DAB40206A0"/>
which he has entered into engagements, are no longer at his diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>"If it happens that a poſterior treaty is found, in ſome point, to contradict one that is more ancient, the <hi>new treaty is null with reſpect to that point</hi>—This relates to treaties with different powers." <bibl>Vattel, B. 2. Ch. 12. Sect. 165.</bibl>
                  </p>
                  <p>So far the fears of people are totally groundleſs. But the following clauſe has excited acrimonious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. "The two parties agree, that while they continue in amity, neither of them will in future make a treaty that ſhall be inconſiſtent with this and the preceding article." What can be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecton to this clauſe? The laws of nations, and the rules of moral juſtice, forbid a ſtate to make a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent treaty to infringe a prior one. No nation can do it. The paſſage juſt quoted from Vattel is expreſsly to this purpoſe: and the clauſe has done nothing more than convert a moral obligation into a contract, a law of nations into a conventional law between the parties. Stipulations of this kind, like ſtatutes in affirming of common law, add the ſanction of a poſitive contract to an implied one. No new obligation is created; an agreement of this ſort may be conſidered as ſtrengthening the old one.</p>
                  <p>The 26th artitcle provides, that in caſe of war, merchants may continue to reſide in the reſpective dominions, behaving peaceably—and in caſe their conduct ſhall render them ſuſpected, the term of twelve months is allowed to ſettle their accounts and remove their families and effects. This is a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proviſion, and highly neceſſary, between coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſo extenſively connected in commerce. The term of 12 months for removal, is longer than is uſually allowed; the term generally aſſigned in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is 6 or 9 months.</p>
                  <p>To the two laſt articles, I preſume, no objections are made.</p>

               <p>THUS having attempted to remove every objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſequence that has been urged againſt the treaty, I will lay before the public a general view of our trade with the different countries of Europe, Aſia and the Weſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>It has been ſtated by the oppoſers of the treaty that the commercial arrangements want reciprocity—that we concede much, and gain nothing which we did not before enjoy.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the inland trade to Canada, the converſe of the propoſition is the truth. The United States <hi>gain</hi> a free trade to Canada, on equal terms with Britiſh ſubject, which we did <hi>not</hi> before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Britiſh ſubjects gain little or nothing by the ſtipulation, which they did not before enjoy. In this part of the treaty, the advantage is on the ſide of the United States.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to our foreign commerce, it depends on the will of nations over whom we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. All nations claim the right of admitting ſhips and goods into their ports, or prohibiting them at pleaſure; or of burdening our commerce with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy duties. This right is abſolute, and when we obtain any privilege in their trade, it is by way of grant or conceſſion. The United States have the ſame right as to their own ports; but they have not ſeen fit to exclude the ſhips of any nation from a free participation of their trade.</p>
               <p>The maritime powers of Europe find a navy ſo neceſſary to their ſafety, amidſt the contending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the different nations, that every meaſure is taken to multiply their ſeamen, and increaſe their ſhipping. Great-Britain is the nation moſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in this ſyſtem. From her inſular ſituation, a navy is her only defence—to man a navy, ſhe muſt raiſe ſeamen—to ſecure a ſupply of ſeamen ſhe muſt extend her commerce and her carrying trade as far as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="unknown:029752_0264_0FE255E5D8FF4EA8"/>
In purſuance of this ſyſtem of defence, originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her navagation act, in 1660, which reſtricts her trade to Britiſh veſſels, and manned moſtly with Britiſh ſeamen. That act has been in operation from its firſt paſſing to the preſent day; and to prevent temporary or local inconveniences, from a rigid execution, the parliament have empowered the king and council to diſpenſe with it on occaſion, and open the ports of Great Britain, or her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at ſuch times and to ſuch nations, as neceſſities may require</p>
               <p>All the nations of Europe have laws reſpecting their trade, which operate more or leſs to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their own commerce, and lay that of their neighbors to their own dominions under reſtrictions.</p>
               <p>A view of the privileges and reſtrictions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, was offered to Congreſs, Dec. 16, 1793, by Mr. Jefferſon, which, though not ſufficiently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or comprehenſive, throws much light on the ſubject. Theſe general facts will be ſufficient for my purpoſe in this place.</p>
               <p>The admiſſion of our veſſels into the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in Europe, reſts now on an annual procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the king and council. Although intereſt and expedience may operate to continue the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of entering thoſe ports at all times, and with veſſels of any burden, yet the tenure of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is precarious.</p>
               <p>By the preſent treaty, this precarious privilege becomes a right, which cannot be abridged by the executive of the Engliſh nation. This is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and Mr. Jefferſon, in his Report, admits it to be ſuch. It was an objection he urged againſt our former ſtate of commerce to Great Britain, that it was precarious—That objection by the treaty is removed.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to her colonial poſſeſſions, Great Britain has obſerved the jealous policy common to all the nations of Europe. The ſhips of all nations
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:029752_0265_0FE255E765A1FCC8"/>
are excluded from her colonies, unleſs it may be a port in the Weſt Indies, where the Spaniards are permitted to enter with logwood.</p>
               <p>In opening her Weſt Indies to American veſſels of 70 tons burden, and her Eaſt India ports to American-veſſels of any burden, ſhe has conceded a privilege, which ſhe grants to no other nation on earth. The ſacrifice of the carrying trade on the part of the United States, to obtain admiſſion into the Engliſh Weſt Indies, is deemed more than equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and that ſtipulation will fall to the ground. But the direct trade to the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, is generally admitted to be highly beneficial.</p>
               <p>Let us contraſt theſe advantages in trade with thoſe we enjoy with other nations.</p>
               <p>Our navigation to Spain and Portugal is free: but many of our exports are prohibited, as tobacco, and rice and whale oils to Portugal. The American trade however to Spain and Portugal is highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous in a number of articles. But both theſe countries prohibit all intercourſe with their colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial poſſeſſions. The ports of Sweden and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark are open; but the duties paid on moſt of the American productions amount to a prohibition.</p>
               <p>Our navigation to the United Netherlands is free; but ſome of the moſt material articles of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as beef, pork and bread-ſtuff, are prohibited, as well as by Great-Britain. We can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with their poſſeſſions in the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
               <p>France, before the war, guaranteed to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, one or more free ports in Europe, and ſuch ports in the Weſt-Indies as were free. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, her Weſt-Indies were open by an arret of the king. Even the coaſting trade in France was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally carried on by foreign veſſels.</p>
               <p>The revolution has ſenſibly varied the whole ſcene of commerce. Neceſſity has opened all French ports to neutral nations. But a navigation act, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that of Great-Britain, was decreed, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:029752_0266_0FE255EA1A684100"/>
2, 1793, to take place January 1, 1794. This, with a long ſpirited report of Barrere, was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Congreſs, and publiſhed by their order in February, 1794. This act is ſuſpended only on account of the ncceſſities of France, her commerce being wholly dependant on neutral bottoms. The moment this act ſhall take place, we ſhall be cut off from all right to the trade of France, except what is guaranteed by treaty, that is, <hi>one or more free ports;</hi> and ſuch privileges as we ſhall be able to obtain by future ſtipulations.</p>

               <p>On the whole, it is demonſtrated that no country on earth yields more extenſive privileges to the American merchant, than Great Britain. It is alſo equally demonſtrable that Great Britain yields more privileges in her trade with the United States than ſhe grants to any other nation.</p>
               <p>It has been objected to ſeveral articles of the treaty, that they are <hi>not reciprocal,</hi> becauſe from the circumſtances of the two countries, Britiſh ſubjects will be principally benefited. Thus the 9th and 10th articles are ſaid to yield advantages to Great Eritain, without <hi>an equivalent,</hi> becauſe her ſubjects hold large tracts of land in the United States, and have debts due them to a great amount: whereas American ſubjects hold little or no land, and have no debts or monies, in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Objections of this kind muſt proceed from a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh captious diſpoſition. It may juſt as well be objected that we ſhould have no trade with Great Britain at all, becauſe her exports to this country exceed her imports from it—or becauſe her domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contain double the number of people, that are in the United States. Nay, it may juſt as well be aid that every man has not an <hi>equal right</hi> to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:029752_0268_0FE255F48145AB18"/>
becauſe ſome uſe the highway ten times as much as others.</p>
               <p>In all conventions between ſtates, an <hi>equality in principle conſtitutes an equivalent.</hi> If an article of any treaty gives to both parties a right of doing the ſame things, and under the ſame advantages, that article is reciprocal, though one of the parties never make uſe of the right.</p>
               <p>Thus in our treaty with France, we permit French armed veſſels to bring their prizes into the ports of the United States. The French alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the American veſſels to carry their prizes into French ports. The French are in a condition to uſe the privilege and do uſe it every day—We are not at war, and do not uſe the privilege. But will any man ſay, that article of the treaty is not <hi>mutual?</hi> Will any man deny that we have an <hi>equivalent</hi> for the right conceded to France?</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo with reſpect to our commerce with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or any other power. Suppoſe a nation to have but a ſingle port for ſhipping and commerce, and the United States to have a thouſand. Each party agrees to open all their ports, and admit the other to a free trade; will it be denied that this is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal? Certainly not. It is <hi>equality in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> not in the amount or extent of its operation, which conſtitutes <hi>reciprocity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If people are diſpoſed to cavil at <hi>inequalities of condition,</hi> as well as of <hi>principle,</hi> they may find as many cauſes of diſcontent, in all other treaties, as in this with Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>The truth is, when our other treaties were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Americans had confidence in the conſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of our country. They believed men, who had made commerce, treaties, and the laws of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a ſtudy and matter of contemplation, were beſt capable of negociating treaties. They truſted to the men appointed for this purpoſe. The great maſs of people are not competent to decide what is,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:029752_0269_0FE255F60F3C5460"/>
or is not for our public intereſts, in complicated negociations and national compacts; and unleſs they repoſe confidence in public characters, we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be embroiled with factions.</p>

               <p>HAVING in the preceding papers, anſwered ſuch objections to the treaty, as appear to have any weight, 'I will cloſe this vindication, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing to my fellow citizens, ſome conſiderations of a more general nature.</p>
               <p>It was the public opinion the laſt year, and it is an opinion ſtill maintained among one deſcription of Americans, that Great Britain has been ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by France, that ſhe will conſent to make great ſacrifices for the purpoſe of ſecuring peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with this country. It is alſo believed by many people, that the kingdom is upon the point of an internal revolution: and that holding in our hands the power of ſequeſtrating the debts of her citizens, we may command, at all times, peace and favorable treatment.</p>
               <p>All theſe opinions, though unqueſtionably erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, have contributed to raiſe the public expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpecting the ſucceſs of the treaty, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable pitch.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the humble condition of Great Britain, where are the proofs? That her land forces were defeated and cut to pieces, the laſt cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, is undeniable; and there is no queſtion that any combat by land, would be decided in favour of of France. The numbers, the diſcipline, and the enthuſiaſm of the French forces on land render them irreſiſtible. But the beſt troops and the beſt diſcipline, without other reſources, will not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the greatneſs of a ſtate or kingdom, for any glenth of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:029752_0270_0FE255F79E769580"/>France now ſupports her armies moſtly upon her conquered countries. Her finances are exhauſted; and what is, if poſſible, a more ſerious calamity, her internal diſſentions debilitate her force, diſtract her councils, and diſconcert her operations.</p>
               <p>The plan of Robeſpierre was a ſyſtem of deſpair. By putting every thing in requiſition, the perſons of men, their goods, proviſions, and money, the whole force of France was collected to a point, and the whole energy of that force was exerted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the moſt formidable combination ever raiſed againſt the independence of a nation.</p>
               <p>This meaſure was perhaps indiſpenſable in the criſis when it was adopted. But unfortunately vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exertions in the body politic, as well as in the human body, are ever followed by debility and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor. The ſyſtem of requiſitions and the maximum, were calculated to deſtroy the capital of a country, which, in all caſes, ought to be left untouched, as a ſource of further productions. The intereſt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only of a country can be ſafely uſed for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional purpoſes; and when a ſtate is compelled to ſeize the capital ſtock, though its exertions may be great, they muſt certainly be of ſhort duration.</p>
               <p>But this is not the only calamity incurred by the ſyſtem of terror. To enforce ſuch an arbitrary ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, recourſe muſt be had to violent puniſhment, for refuſals to comply with it; and the ſummary mode of condemning, as well as the ſanguinary proceſs of executing, tend to excite all the malicious and revengeful paſſions of men. The guillotine of France has left every deadly and rancorous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, waiting only for a favourable moment for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. The ſurviving friends of thoſe who fell victims, to the ſyſtem of terror, will not eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or forgive the injuries they ſuffered; and thus that terrible deſpotiſm, which for a few months, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all men to unite to defeat foreign foes and to cruſh internal inſurrections; that ſyſtem has
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:029752_0271_0FE256025219A6D8"/>
ſpread over France the ſeeds of faction and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will afflict the country and weaken al its exertions, for at leaſt a generation to come. Thus the laſt ſeaſon, the victories of France by land, aſtoniſhed all nations, and ſpread diſmay through Europe, while her frigates ſcoured the ocean, and marred the commerce of her enemies. But the preſent ſeaſon, her armies and her fleet are inactive, her reſources fail, and all is debility and languor.</p>
               <p>Great Britain, on the other hand, though her army was deſtroyed in the Netherlands, retains all her activity and reſources. Her territories have not been the ſeat of war; her land has been under full cultivation, her manufactures have been carried on as uſual, her goods are exported nearly as cheap, and in nearly the ſame quantities, as in time of peace; her government retains its vigour, and her fleet, notwithſtanding a ſcarcity of ſeamen, ſtill rides miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the ocean. The commerce of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though a little impaired, ſtill exceeds that of any other country; and the government has not been compelled to diſtreſs her trade to man her navy. Were there a preſſing neceſſity for ſo violent a ſtep, that country, by ſtripping her merchantmen for a time, would bring upon the ocean a fleet ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any that has ever appeared under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But Great Britain has not yet been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to adopt this ruinous expedient; ſhe has not materially impaired her commerce by impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſeamen—ſhe has not entrenched upon the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtock of her huſbandmen and manufacturers. Her debt has indeed been augmented; but ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſums of money are offered, and the only queſtion, with government is whoſe money ſhall be received on loan; for the competitors, are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Such is the monied capital of that country, and ſuch the reſources that Great Britain will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:029752_0272_0FE256041716E768"/>
be able to carry on the war longer than any other power.</p>
               <p>Nor is the idea of an approaching revolution, well founded. Ireland may perhaps give trouble: but the government of England has ſeldom ever been ſupported by a more numerous and powerful majority of the people. The private aſſociations in England and Scotland, gave ſome uneaſineſs for a time; but the moment government called for a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the <hi>habeas corpus</hi> act, it was granted, and the executive diſſipated all private ſocieties, with their plans of revolution. The eaſe with which this whole buſineſs was conducted, certainly does not mark either fear or weakneſs in the adminiſtration of the government of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Where, then, is the ground for ſuppoſing Great Britain in a diſtreſſed ſtate of humiliation, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her to make ſacrifices to the United States?</p>
               <p>On the contrary, Great Britain at this moment, maintains as commanding an attitude among the powers of the earth, as at any former period. All the hopes of Americans, founded on an opinion of the depreſſed ſtate of that nation, are wholly delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory. Nor can we expect any thing from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity or good will of the Britiſh, or any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. National generoſity is a mere phantom of the imagination. It is to the intereſt, or, at moſt, to the jaſtice of a nation we muſt addreſs ourſelves; and no nation will make conceſſions beyond what theſe require. We are not in a ſituation to <hi>command</hi> any foreign nation, to <hi>enforce</hi> our claims, or to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> the exerciſe of juſtice.</p>
               <p>If our ſanguine enthuſiaſts are miſtaken totally as to the preſent power of Great Britain, they are equally ſo, as to the force and effect of ſequeſtration. The injuſtice of attacking private debts for national wrongs, is generally admitted; but many people contend that it may be neceſſary at times to reſort to this meaſure, as the only effectual weapon in our
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:029752_0273_0FE25605A6529F88"/>
power, to terrify Great Britain, a perfidious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a ſenſe of juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is ſurpriſing how ſuch reaſoners miſtake the real and certain effects of ſuch a ſtep. Any man who will give himſelf time to reflect on the pride of nations, and eſpecially of the Engliſh nation, muſt be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the uſe of this weapon, inſtead of inducing conceſſions on the part of Great-Britain, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite every hoſtile feeling, not only in the government, but in the very creditors whoſe debts ſhould be ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Such a violation of all good faith, ſuch an attack upon commercial confidence, as the ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of private debts, to avenge national injuries, would put it out of our power to accommodate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences but by the ſword. It would provoke a war of double ſury; and the very man whoſe debts ſhould be detained, would be the firſt to encourage and the laſt to abandon the conteſt.</p>
               <p>All the high raiſed expectations of our citizens of obtaining from Great-Britain in her preſent ſtate, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating conceſſions which her pride would forbid her to yield in time of peace, are ſupported by not one circumſtance of rational probability. People who dwell on ſuch proſpects of ſucceſs, are groſsly deceived, both as to facts, and as to the character of the Engliſh nation.</p>
               <p>But Judge Rutledge of South Carolina has, on this ſubject, uttered the ſillieſt expreſſions that ever fell from human lips. "England (ſays he) is hoping for peace on whatever terms France may grant it: ſhe is reduced to the laſt gaſp, and were America to ſeize her by the throat, ſhe would expire in agonies at her feet."</p>
               <p>A man muſt be little leſs than inſane, to utter ſuch abſurd ideas, eſpecially at a moment when Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poſſeſſes more actual reſources, the ſinews of war, than all the other powers at war, even France included. And no man, but an inſolvent debtor, who hates his creditor, becauſe he has injured him, would wiſh to
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:029752_0274_0FE25607357C4E78"/>
ſee a great agricultural, manufacturing, and commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial nation <hi>expiring in agonies.</hi> Whatever be the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries Great-Britain has done this country, it is not for the intereſt of mankind, that ſhe ſhould be blotted out of exiſtence. In no country on earth do the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can merchants find more good faith, fair dealing, aad convenient credit, than among Britiſh merchants—no creditors are more indulgent to debtors than the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh—and no country on earth finds extenſive credit more uſeful than the United States.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the reſentments of our citizens tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Great Britain, they may reſt aſſured of one fact, and it is of no ſmall moment to ſome of the United States, that the treatment Americans will receive from that country will be <hi>more friendly,</hi> when the conduct of American debtors is more <hi>juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another objection to the treaty, or to any treaty with Great-Britain, is, that it begets an unnatural alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between a monarchy and a republic. This is clearly the moſt trifling objection ever offered, and is beneath a ſerious anſwer. And thoſe who make it, ought to bluſh at their inconſiſtency, eſpecially as theſe very men are rejoicing at the late treaty between France and the monarch of Pruſſia, and earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every day, to hear of a treaty between France and Spain.</p>
               <p>On the whole, let me aſk my fellow citizens what ſacrifices we may make by the treaty?</p>
               <p>We have old inveterate diſputes with Great-Britain, which muſt be terminated. War or accommodation are the alternatives. If we wiſh a war, we waſte the blood and treaſure of America, without an object: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or at the cloſe of the war, the old diſputes will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and new ones be originated. Inſtead of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our condition, we render it infinitely worſe by hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>Is it not wiſe, therefore to compromiſe theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? And though conſiderable time and expenſe, perhaps ſome ſacrifices of juſt claims, ſhould be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:029752_0275_0FE25610C4DEEED8"/>
on our part, yet between theſe evils, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of inveterate enmity and hoſtile views, on which ſide does the balance lie? Every reflecting man muſt ſay. <hi>on the ſide of accommodation and peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The commercial part of the treaty is of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary nature; and even if ſome ſacrifices were to be made, theſe will not come in competition with the other great and important objects of the treaty. But it is not true that any material ſacrifice is made in the commercial part of this compact. We do not cede <hi>one material privilege</hi> which Great Britain does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by the laws of nations or the laws of the United States. I am bold in the aſſertion, and call on my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers to name the part in which ſuch ſacrifice is made.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, ſome <hi>material conceſſions</hi> on the part of Great Britain, are made to the United States by the treaty.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, Great Britain may enter with her ſhips into <hi>all</hi> the ports of the United States.—True; but ſhe enjoys that privilege <hi>without</hi> this treaty. She gains nothing in this reſpect except that ſhe changes a <hi>precarious privilege</hi> for a <hi>right;</hi> juſt as we do, in the trade to the Britiſh <hi>European</hi> dominions.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, we bind ourſelves not to increaſe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Britiſh tonnage and goods imported in her ſhips beyond what we lay on thoſe of other nations.—True; we agree on this head, to treat Great Britain as well as the moſt favoured nation. If this is a conceſſion on our part, it cannot be a <hi>material ſacrifice,</hi> for we have an equivalent in this, that Great Britain ſtipulates the ſame thing to the United States.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>we cede</hi> to Great Britain the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing duties on our tonnage to equal our preſent duties on hers and on goods imported in Britiſh bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Nothing can be more puerile than ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation. In this reſpect we <hi>cede</hi> nothing.—Great Britain had that right before the treaty; and her right is preciſely the ſame as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="unknown:029752_0276_0FE256125A42ABE8"/>It has been ſaid, we <hi>cede</hi> to Great Britain the right of ſeizing our veſſels and taking the enemy's proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that we have <hi>made</hi> naval ſtores and proviſions contraband by treaty.</p>
               <p>Theſe charges have been proved <hi>not true.</hi> Great Britain enjoys theſe rights by the <hi>law of nations,</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of all treaties.</p>
               <p>We have therefore made very few ſacrifices in this part of the treaty; but we have gained ſomething. We have obtained a permanence of trade to Great Britain. We have gained a free trade to Canada and the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, without any conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and what is more, we have preſerved the BLESSINGS OF PEACE.</p>
               <p>Why then, my fellow Citizens, will you not leave the management of this treaty where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has placed it? What ground have you to ſuppoſe, that the Preſident, our late Envoy and the majority of the Senate, have, in a moment and on this ſingle occaſion, deſerted the intereſt of our country? What reaſon have you to believe that old tried patriots have renounced the uniform prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their lives, and turned apoſtates? Is there a ſhadow of reaſon to believe, that men grown grey in the ſervice of their country, whoſe patriotiſm and virtue were never ſuſpected, have now in the evening of life, and at the cloſe of all their active public ſcenes, commenced traitors? You cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve inſinuations of this kind. The ſuggeſtion of Britiſh gold and undue influence, is the work of dark malicious hearts, deteſted by all good men, and diſcredited by the very children in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>No, my countrymen, you have been deceived. Your paſſions have been taken by ſurpriſe; you have been precipitated into ruſh opinions, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meaſures, by a ſet of men who are the foes of our preſent free and happy government and its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. You may be aſſured, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation of characters, from New-Hampſhire to
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:029752_0277_0FE25613E93CF608"/>
Georgia arrayed in oppoſition, either to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States, to its adminiſtration or to particular men in office. The oppoſition of the principal men in this confederacy can be traced to ſome known cauſes, originally of a perſonal nature. Diſappointment in application for ſome office, or the failure of ſome favourite ſcheme in their political ſyſtem, has converted many of the friends of our late revolution, into determined oppoſers of the general ſyſtem of the preſent adminiſtration. Theſe men will never be contented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill they can diſplace the preſent officers of government, and introduce themſelves, their friends, and their meaſures, into our councils. You may reſt aſſured, that moſt of the ſerment raiſed againſt the Treaty, originated with men of this deſcription.</p>
               <p>This confederacy was formed and is ſtill maintained and ſtrengthened, by ſpreading jealouſies and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions among the people, who, tho' honeſt in their views, are very liable to be miſled by artful men. One of the moſt ſucceſsful weapons ever wielded by this coalition of diſappointed men, is furniſhed them by the preſent war in Europe. The combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of powers againſt France, which we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, is ſaid to be a combination againſt <hi>liberty in general.</hi> and if France ſhould fail of ſucceſs, it is ſaid we ſhall be the next object of attack.</p>
               <p>This is a mere ſuggeſtion of our reſtleſs men, to alarm your fears, and drive you, if poſſible, from your neutral ground into hoſtilities. The ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was firſt made by the late French miniſter, whoſe miſſion to this country was for the <hi>expreſs purpoſe of ſlattering, intriging, or forcing you into the war.</hi> His inſtructions are clear and explicit on this point.</p>
               <p>That miniſter was diſplaced, and his views coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by the firmneſs of our Preſident, ſeconded by the northern ſtates. But the party which ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally rallied under that man, ſtill exiſts, and forms
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:029752_0278_0FE25615766621D8"/>
a league, co-extenſive with the United States con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in all its parts and acting by a ſingle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe.</p>
               <p>Thus, in the infancy of our empire, the bane of all republics, is already diffuſed over our country, and poiſons the whole body politic. Faction is a diſeaſe which has proved fatal to all popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; but in America it has aſſumed an aſpect more formidable than in any other country. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient republics, popular commotions were ſudden things, excited by the emergencies of the moment, burſting inſtantly on the exiſting government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a revolution, baniſhing a tyrant who was powerful, or a patriot who was popular, and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of jealouſy to ſome ambitious competitor.</p>
               <p>But in America, faction has aſſumed conſiſtency and ſyſtem—it is a <hi>conſpiracy perpetually exiſting</hi>—an oppoſition organized and diſciplined, for the purpoſes of defeating the regular exerciſe of the conſtitutional powers of our government, whenever a meaſure does not pleaſe the ſecret leaders of the Confederacy:—</p>
               <p>My countrymen, be watchful of the progreſs of the aſſociations, formed on the plan of the Jacobin Society in France. That ſociety was a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the work of demoliſhing the monarchy; but on the ruins of monarchy, it raiſed the moſt frightful deſpotiſm recorded in hiſtory. Leagued with ſiſter ſocieties in every village and city of France, the Jacobins governed the Convention, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and all France for a long time, and filled it with blood, confiſcation and ruin. So terrible was the tyranny of theſe aſſociations, that the Convention were compelled to prohibit their meetings; but ſo numerous are the members, and ſo active the ſpirit of revenge, that two or three inſurrections have been raiſed by the Jacobins in Paris, blood has been ſhed in various parts by that faction, they have been in poſſeſſion of Toulon, a civil war is often excited
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029752_0279_0FE24BC315AD6870"/>
and it ſeems yet doubtful whether the <hi>national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, ex private unauthorized clubs</hi> ſhall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern France.</p>
               <p>My countrymen, you are threatened with a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larevil. Under the pretended maſk of <hi>patriotiſm and watching over our liberties,</hi> private aſſociations are formed and extending their influence over our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The popular Societies of Francedid the ſame. The cry of <hi>patriotiſm</hi> was forever on their tongue: but when they became ſtrong enough, they ruled with a rod of iron. Fire, ſword and the guillotine were inſtrments of their adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>Be not deceived into a belief that our citizens are incapable of ſimilar outrages. Violent men may be found in every country, and already are the heads of our government denounced as traitors; already is our country threatened with blood and civil war.—If men who regard their rights, and who believe the conſtitution and laws alone to be the guarantee of thoſe rights, do not unite and ſhow a formidable countenance againſt all irregular oppoſition to thoſe laws, our whole country will be ſpeedily ſubject to a confederacy of men, a ſmall minority indeed, but bold, though ſecret in their machinations, indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in their meaſures, and determined on ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>It is not the treaty alone which is oppeſed; this is a convenient inſtrument for them to wield; but the cauſes of oppoſition lie deeper. The treaty is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If laſt to go peaceably into operation, it would have no general effect on buſineſs which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large could feel—agriculture would ſtill ſlou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; trade would be carried on as uſual with little variation; national diſputes would be in a train of adjustment, and peace and tranqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity would reign throughout our happy land. But if the oppoſers of the treaty can poſſibly embroil our country in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

war, it will be effected—From ſuch a frightful calamity, may your good ſenſe, my fellow citizens, preſerve us!</p>
               <p>Should the treaty, not be ratiſied, and ſhould the conſequences be foreign war, the <hi>people, not the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of America,</hi> muſt be anſwerable for all its melancholy conſequences.</p>
               <p>No period of our political life has been more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical—or deſerving of more temper on the part of the people and of more prudence and firmneſs on the part of our executive.</p>
               <p>One party wiſhes to <hi>dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our government and its ſupporters wiſh for prefect neutrality towards all the powers at war—they wiſh for ſtrict juſtice and impartiality to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved towards all parties, and they wiſh for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourſe with all—in fine, they wiſh for unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted peace.</p>
               <p>When parties are thus marſhalled, it behoves all good men to determine on which ſide, they will range themſelves. One or the other muſt prevail; and on the final prevalence of one or the other of theſe parties, are ſuſpended the peace, proſperity and happineſs of the United States.</p>

               <hi>Children,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You remind me of what paſſed at the council fire at Quebec, juſt before my laſt departure for England, when I promiſed to repreſent their ſituation and wiſher to the king their father, and expreſſed my hope that all the grievances they complained of, on the part of the United States, would ſoon be done away, by a juſt and laſting peace.</p>

               <hi>Children,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember all very well; I remember that they pointed out to me the line of ſeparation, whieh they wiſhed for between them and the United States, and with which they would be ſatisfied and make peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Children,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was in expectation of hearing from the people of the United States what was required by tham; I hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſhould have been able to bring you together, and make you friends.</p>

            <p>I flattered myſelf with the hope that the line, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the year eighty-three, to ſeparate us from the United States, which was immediately broken by themſelves as ſoon as the peace was ſigned, would have been minded, or a new one drawn in an am cable manner; here alſo I have been diſappointed.</p>
