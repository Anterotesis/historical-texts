            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>

            <p>THE hearty Thanks you were pleaſed to return me for my Sermon preached by your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire at the Opening of the Academy in <hi>January</hi> laſt, gave me a very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pleaſure; nor had I then declined complying with your Requeſt to make it publick, had I not been of Opinion that my Mind, which was about that
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006754_0003_10298CC49CBCB080"/>Time much engaged in the neceſſary Buſineſs of my Station, was not vacant enough to permit me to treat the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with due Solidity and Correctneſs; and eſpecially as I had not of late been uſed to this Sort of Compoſition. But when I came to conſider that a Detail was made of the Riſe of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and of the ſeveral Matters propoſed to be taught therein, and that it might be of great Service to publiſh this, in order to remove Miſtakes, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Publick to judge of its Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Seaſonableneſs, I no longer heſitated to gratify you in the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confident that your Adoption and Patronage will procure it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Reception with my Fellow Citizens; and the Piety and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Deſign recommended in it, will prevail with others into whoſe Hands it may come to overlook its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Defects.</p>
            <p>IT affords no ſmall Delight to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who has the Succeſs of this Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy at Heart, that though many
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:006754_0004_10298CC86178A250"/>Things promiſed in this Diſcourſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be done, yet there is already much more effected than in ſo ſmall a Space of Time could have been reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expected. The <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Maſters give entire Satisfaction; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Progreſs made by the Boys in both Schools is truly ſurprizing; each has now the Aſſiſtance of an Uſher, made neceſſary by the Number of Boys, who, notwithſtanding the Prevalence of the Small-Pox in Town, amount to above an Hundred. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are providing for teaching Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and <hi>French.</hi> The Mathematical School is daily increaſing. A Charity School is eſtabliſhed. Proper Prayers are compoſed for the Schools, and uſed every Morning and Evening.</p>
            <p>I muſt do you the Juſtice to ſay that much of this is owing to your Care, and the Regularity of your Viſitations; and I have no ſmall Satisfaction in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be thus particular, ſince it muſt needs be agreeable to the Publick to know that the moſt neceſſary and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006754_0005_10298CC9E8095038"/>uſeful Parts of the Scheme are in ſuch Forwardneſs; and that there are in the Academy two good Grammar Schools, one in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Latin</hi> Language. No ſmall Benefit this to the Province! as in theſe are laid the proper Foundations for the higher Attainments in Learning, which will likewiſe be gone into, when the Difficulties of the Maſters, ariſing from the preparing and claſſing ſo many Boys as are daily admitted from different Schools, of different Proficiencies, and taught by different Methods, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>THO' a good Beginning does not inſure Succeſs in the Progreſs and Cloſe of the Work, yet it gives good Hopes that every one of the uſeful Purpoſes of the Inſtitutors will be gradually and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily executed, and that in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfectly conſiſtent with, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to, the Circumſtances of the Province; ſo that thoſe who have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to entertained a Notion of the Unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the Inſtitution to the Infant
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:006754_0006_10298CD28DD828B0"/>State of the Colony, being now ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Contrary, will go, Hand in Hand, with you heartily, in one of the moſt rational and well judged Charities that can be deviſed.

                  <bibl>St. JOHN viii. 32.</bibl>

               </q>

            <p>IF Slavery be deſervedly eſteemed the worſt and Liberty the beſt State Mankind can be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, and Ignorance certainly leads to the the one, and Knowledge to the other: If, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the univerſal Acknowledgment of this Truth, publick Foundations for the Advancement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been inſtituted by wiſe Men in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and theſe Friends to Science have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the moſt diſtinguiſhing Honours: Then, my Fellow Chriſtians and Fellow Citizens, you have the greateſt Reaſon to expect the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Thanks of all good Men, on the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Academy for the Inſtruction of Youth in Piety, Virtue, and uſeful Knowledge.</p>
            <p>AND ſeeing our bleſſed Saviour, who underſtood the Connection of Things perfectly well, has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put his Seal to the Truth of theſe Sentiments, by joining Knowledge and Liberty ſo cloſely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Words of my Text, you may, with an humble Confidence, entertain favourable Hopes, that the Almighty will accept and hearken to your devout Prayers for his divine Bleſſing and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on your charitable Undertaking.</p>
            <p>WHEN our Lord ſpoke theſe Words, <hi>Ye ſhall
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006754_0008_10298CD5AFBA46E8"/>know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free,</hi> he was in the Execution of an authentick and well evidenced Commiſſion from the God and Father of all, to publiſh his laſt and greateſt Diſpenſation; wherein Remiſſion of Sins, Reconciliation with his offended Majeſty, Immortality and endleſs Glory, were promiſed to all penitent Believers, in and thro' the Merits and Expiation of his Son's Death. This is the Truth, or Syſtem of Truths, referred to in the Text, and by Chriſt more emphatically applied to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as what did completely ſuperſede the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Religion, and was of the moſt certain Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to free them from the Servitude of Sin. But the Spirit of the Text reaches all Men, as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> implying thus much, That the Chriſtian Religion calls upon its Profeſſors to conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Children of God, and Members of Chriſt, and as ſuch placed in this lower World in various Ranks and Stations of Life, and with different Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Talents, that each learning and doing his Duty here, might be advanced to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven hereafter; and if the Truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Man thus placed, and forming a Society, whoſe Intereſts in Chriſt Jeſus are the ſame, be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, and have their proper Influence, then, and then only, is Man in Poſſeſſion of true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, can any Thing more effectually prove the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of Education than this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our Saviour? Will not the Syſtem of Truths contained the Goſpel remain ſtill in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs the Knowledge of them be carefully taught, and the Minds of Youth early and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſtructed in them? Is it not clear, from this Revelation, that Men, by doing their reſpective Duties in this World, afford God the moſt pleaſing Proof of their Regard for his Laws, and make it
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006754_0009_10298CDB6F601510"/>evident that the Goſpel has had its full Force and Effect upon their Souls? And pray, how can they be enabled rightly to diſcharge the ſeveral Duties, Offices, Profeſſions and Employments, made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the Circumſtances in which the wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has put Matters here below, without an early Improvement of their Underſtandings, and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Stock of Reading? Is the Knowledge of religious or civil Truths born with us; or does it come of itſelf? Muſt it not be obtained with much Care and Labour; and, conſidering that we ſtand in need of good Inſtructors, with no inconſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence?</p>
            <p>THESE Queſtions anſwer themſelves, and ſhew that Thoſe will beſt act up to the Spirit of the Text, and become the trueſt Imitators of Chriſt, who employ their Wealth, Power and Influence, in the Eſtabliſhment of Schools for the more eaſy and general Propagation of Knowledge; ſince, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, they do all in their Power that their Fellow Chriſtians may know the Truth, and that the Truth may make them free.</p>
            <p>AND ſurely there was never more Occaſion to ſhew ourſelves worthy Chriſtians in this Senſe than now; for whoever is in ſuch a Station of Life, as requires frequent Intercourſe with our Inhabitants, muſt every Hour ſee the deplorable Conſequences of a low and defective Education; and notwithſtanding all our Boaſts of the Goodneſs of our civil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Liberty allowed conſcientious Men in the Exerciſe of divine Worſhip, the Accommodation of our Laws to the Circumſtances of the Colony, the Mildneſs and Lenity of the Government, the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soil, the Extent and flouriſhing Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Commerce; all which deſervedly make us a conſpicuous People; yet it does not require a more than ordinary Penetration to foreſee, that if ſome Methods be not taken of giving a proper Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006754_0010_10298CDF3A259AD8"/>to our Youth, theſe very Advantages and Privileges, for want of Knowledge, and a Capacity of exerciſing the Offices neceſſary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo populous and indulged a Country, will run Things into Anarchy and Confuſion; and, in a very little Time, perhaps ſome of us may live to ſee it, our Superiors may be forced to make Alterations in our Laws and Conſtitution. Theſe Conſiderations gave Birth to the Deſign of this academical Inſtitution, or rather Collection of ſeveral Schools, under the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of one Maſter, and the Inſpection of a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the moſt ſubſtantial Freeholders and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City; not ſo much to teach the learned Languages, for this is a ſmall Part of Education, as to impart, in the leaſt expenſive Manner, and in the beſt Order and Method, the Knowledge of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, moral and civil Truths, to all the Members of the Community, without Partiality or Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>AND if the Execution be equal to the good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truſtees and Contributors, we may be juſtly excuſed, if we apply to the People of the Place theſe Words of our Saviour, tho' they were ſpoke by him on a much greater Occaſion, <hi>Ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus evinced the Neceſſity of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation from the Meaning of my Text, and the preſent Situation of the Colony, I ſhall, in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proſecution of my Subject, obſerve the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall point out what Evils may be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Education.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew that this Academy is well calculated to remedy theſe Evils.</p>
            <p>AND, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall beſpeak your Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt then,</hi> I have undertaken to point out what Evils may be remedied by Education. To make you ſenſible of theſe, be pleaſed to conſider, that the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006754_0011_10298CE0C4F349C8"/>Mind of Man, when he enters the World, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored with Knowledge; that he may, thro' Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, acquire none, or a bad Sort; and that tho' he ſhould be ſo fortunate as to lay in even a good Sort, yet it does not follow of Courſe, that he will make uſe of his Acquirements, ſince his Temper may be bad, or he may be ſo much indulged, and ſo imprudently managed in his Youth, as not to profit by Inſtruction. Now, in all theſe Caſes, as Happineſs reſults from knowing Perſons and Things to be what they are, and treating them accordingly, if we miſs in either, we muſt become unhappy. Inſtruction then is abſolutely neceſſary; but this alone will not do; the Temper muſt be diligently obſerved, and diverted from the Evil it inclines to, which requires much Skill and Prudence; beſides, the leading Inclinations or Genius of an opening Mind, ought to be as narrowly watched, as the Capacity, Memory and Judgment, and a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kind of Inſtruction adapted to them: Again, the State of the Affections, or what is in Scripture and common Language called the Heart, as well as the Head, muſt be ſtudied, and theſe in Conjunction ſo regulated, that a good and uſeful Character may be formed out of them. It ought not to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Concern of a Perſon entruſted with Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to ſhew to the World ſhining Parts, ſo much as to inſure to the riſing Generation the Exerciſe of the good Affections under the Direction of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Underſtanding. Now, in Proportion, as any of theſe are neglected, a Sett of Evils will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſpring out of ſuch Neglect. It ſhall be my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs therefore to ſet theſe Evils to View with all the Clearneſs I am able, ſo as from thence to evince the Neceſſity of committing Children to the Care of Men of Knowledge, Prudence and Skill, independent of Parents and Relations, whoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Indulgence render them unfit to be truſted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006754_0012_10298CE461833D28"/>with the ſole Care of their Childrens Education: And I chuſe to take this Method rather than any other; becauſe Evils, juſtly repreſented, make ſtronger Impreſſions, and ſtimulate the Mind to an immediate Application of the proper Remedies.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Train of Evils, which preſents itſelf to my examining View, flows from <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which muſt inevitably be the State of an uncultivated Mind. Methinks I ſee one of this Claſs with great Simplicity entering upon the Stage of Buſineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with himſelf, his Neighbours, and the World. He makes but a very flow Progreſs, ever timorous and diffident of himſelf, and jealous of every Body elſe. He ſoon comes to one of thoſe material Occurrences of Life, where it is neceſſary to come immediately to ſome Determination, and act with Spirit, or the Opportunity ſlips, and never comes again. Methinks I behold him ballancing, and in Diffidence: Letting the golden Opportunity ſlip: Taking Things by the wrong Handle: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking his Intereſt: Purſuing the worſt Courſe, and merely thro' want of Knowledge falling into a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Evils, one Diſaſter bringing on another: And ſo blundering on to the very End of his Life. I perceive many inclinable, and making ſundry At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to employ him, but ſoon, very ſoon, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Ignorance, they withdraw or grow diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, till at laſt he becomes perfectly inſignificant, and falls into abſolute Contempt. Favour me with your Attention, whilſt I enter a little deeper into the Miſchiefs attending Ignorance. If Perſons of this Claſs have no Property, they are only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as other Animals, and no other Eſtimate is put upon them, than according to the Strength of their Sinews, and the Profit that may be made of it. If they have Property, they ſoon confound it by ill-judg'd Purſuits, or fall a Prey to the firſt Man who has Diſhonour enough to take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006754_0013_10298CE84C0E1328"/>of their Ignorance. But ſuppoſe, thro' the Pride of Parents, or the Affluence of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſuch ignorant Perſons take upon them the Profeſſions and Offices, by the undue Execution of which, Mens Lives, or Health, or Properties, may be greatly affected; what a ſad Scene of Confuſion is here! What terrible Effects enſue! Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Ruin are in the End! But that is not all; before this juſt Fate overtakes them, they have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd all about them; their Relations, Friends and Acquaintance, fall the firſt Victims to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and then others promiſcuouſly, as they have the Misfortune to fall in their Way.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, in a State of Ignorance the rational Faculties of the Soul, for want of Uſe, may be ſo extremely weakened, as not to exert themſelves whilſt in Union with the Body. As Exerciſe gives Strength to the Nerves, and preſerves the Health, ſo Thinking ſtrengthens the Powers of the Mind, and promotes the Health of the Soul; but if Knowledge, its natural Food, be with-held, it falls into a paralytick State, and becomes unable to make any vigorous Efforts. All that magnetical Force in the Affections and Paſſions, by which the Soul is with Violence carried towards Information, Merit, Excellence, Virtue, Goodneſs, Elegance, Decorum, find no Place in an ignorant Mind; but in their Room one has the Mortification to behold a perfect <hi>Vis Inertiae,</hi> or inert Power. And when the Spirituality, Vigour and Emulation of the Soul is gone, to what a low State is the human Form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded? The divine Image is then ſo impair'd, that the Soul can't be diſtinguiſhed to be of celeſtial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and an Ally of the angelick Order.</p>
            <p>THIS naturally brings me to the Caſe of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Man with reſpect to Religion, and with it I ſhall cloſe this Branch of Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006754_0014_10298CF04842CEA0"/>
RELIGION being a Tranſaction between the Soul and its Creator, neceſſarily requires a well informed Judgment. Here more than in any other Matter: <hi>The Eyes of the Underſtanding</hi> (as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) <hi>muſt be opened, that we may ſee what are the Hopes of our Calling, and what are the Riches of the Glory of our Inheritance in the Saints.</hi> Here all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul are to be exerted, and ſhould therefore be well adviſed. Here, as the Affections are to be in their moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and ſprightly Exerciſe, the Excellencies and Perfections of the Supreme Being, towards whom they are to be exerciſed, ſhould be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perceived by the Mind. Here a great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Truths offer for our cloſeſt Examination, founded on as great a Variety of Evidence: From whence a Sett of Principles muſt be drawn, that muſt appear indubitably concluſive, and by careful and frequent Meditation ſo firmly rivetted in the Mind, as to ſerve with Readineſs on all Occaſions to combat the Diverſity of religious Opinions em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in the World, or the Impotency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of our own Minds, ariſing from our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct. If this be done with Care, and on the beſt Inſtruction, whilſt young, how many unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Comforts will iſſue from it; and from how many ſad Evils ſhall we be delivered? But if this is not done at all, or careleſly, which muſt be the Caſe, where Men are ignorant, what Pleaſure do they loſe, all of the beſt and moſt affecting Sort! and to what an Abyſs of Unhappineſs may they be plunged! I ſhall inſtance only in two Paſſions, and thoſe no inconſiderable Ones in the human Frame: I mean Hope and Fear. Hopes an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Man can have few or none, or at beſt of an unentertaining Kind. Hopes have for their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enlarged Views of Men and Things, they reach forward by the Stretch of a well exerciſed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006754_0015_10298CF1D13E8148"/>into future and inviſible Worlds, concluding, by Parity of Reaſon and Affection, corroborated by Revelation, that the ſeveral Ranks of intelligent Beings, up to the moſt High JEHOVAH, love and eſteem good and virtuous Souls; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be finally rewarded, tho' for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent placed in this inferior World.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the ignorant Man, from what has been ſaid of the Nature of Religion, will want the Chain of Reaſoning on which to ſix well grounded Hopes; yet his Fears remain entire, and will prove a Source of endleſs Uneaſineſs. There is a Gloom and Diſſatisfaction ever hanging on the Souls of ignorant Men; they may not indeed often think on religious Subjects, tho' this will depend much on Conſtitution; but whenever they do, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually repreſenting the Almighty in an angry and diſpleaſed Form; and indeed there is too much Reaſon for this, where Ignorance is a Man's own Fault. Well, what Remedy do they apply? Why, for want of Judgment to diſcern what is the proper Object of the divine Diſpleaſure, inſtead of forſaking their Sins, the only Things that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a righteous Governor, and becoming regularly pious and good in their Lives, the only Thing to which are annexed the Benefits of the Expiation and Reconciliation of our bleſſed Saviour, they want to pacify their incenſed Judge, by inflicting unworthy and prepoſterous Puniſhments on themſelves, or making a Compenſation, if they are wealthy, by large Donations to pious and charitable Uſes; and ſo fall a Prey to avaritious and ambitious Paſtors.</p>
            <p>THE next Sett of Evils which occurs to me in the Examination of an uncultivated Mind, ariſes from the <hi>Miſapplication of the Genius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are mighty apt to arraign Providence for the numerous Calamities with which this mortal Life abounds; would we, however, but think ever ſo
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006754_0016_10298CF35932F168"/>little, we ſhould ſoon diſcern how much this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is to be laid at our own Door. Scarce a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon comes into the World without a viſible Index to his Diſpoſition, without a Pointer to his Genius. The Bent of the Soul diſcovers itſelf in the very Dawn of Life; the Exerciſes, Entertainments, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Diverſions of the Child, indicate plain enough the Delight of his Underſtanding, and the State of his Affections. <hi>Achilles,</hi> whilſt a Child, to have conceal'd himſelf, might have put on the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Dreſs, and aſſociated with <hi>Virgins;</hi> but had any one thrown amongſt them in the Midſt of their Play the leaſt Part of military Armour, the Eyes of the Infant would have ſparkled, his Cheeks glow'd, and his Soul would have been all on Fire; and any Byſtander, even the little Maids themſelves, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, would have diſcovered the Heroe as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as certainly as the ſagacious <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROVIDENCE ſhews to the diſcerning Eye his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the Formation of every Individual, and how he ought to be treated, in order to anſwer the particular Purpoſe he created him for. And if this was attended to, with the Care it deſerves, what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Progreſs might be made in every Art and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What eminent Men ſhould we ſee in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Occupations? To what an Height would Knowledge, Virtue, Fortitude, Piety, publick Spirit, be carried? Little, very little do we ſee of what the human Capacity could do, when aided with all that Quantity of Study, Deſire, Aſſiduity and Love, which the Genius, in the Enjoyment of its proper Object, always brings along with it. I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, much longer indulge you in this pleaſing rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous View of the Soul's Capacity, and ſet before you a thouſand Excellencies and Accompliſhments attainable by it; but my Subject calls me to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Taſk of ſhewing what Men are for want of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006754_0017_10298CF4F15DEC98"/>Culture, or from a wrong Culture, not what with proper Culture they might riſe to.</p>
            <p>THE Multitudes of Geniuſes, forming in this new World, may be compared to Seeds of the fineſt Flowers, thrown at a Venture into the Ground, where they no ſooner take Root, and begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand and ſtretch their tender lengthening Fibres; where they no ſooner aſpire, and with an erect Straightneſs puſh for the open Sky; but they find either the Earth hard and unyielding, or covered with Thorns, Briars and noxious Weeds, which hinder their vigorous Efforts. Is there no Lover of Nature near, to help to ſoften and temper the Soil, and take away the hard obſtructing Cruſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable Earth, that they may put forth their rich variegated Colours, and fill the Air with their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive Fragrance? Alas, moſt of them diſappear! and thoſe which come up, diſcover faint and foreign Colours, nor diſplay their native Beauty, nor emit their aromatick Odour!</p>
            <p>THUS, my fellow Citizens, ought you to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to yourſelves the State of the Infant Geniuſes of the Place: How many are totally loſt thro' Idleneſs and Inactivity? How many are forced, as it were, in Oppoſition to their natural Temper and Genius, into wrong Trades, Offices, Profeſſions and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, by theſe Means, become Objects of Want, Wretchedneſs and Miſery? What Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers offer to the ſearching Eye, ever peeviſh and fretful, a Torment to themſelves and to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, always uneaſy, and perpetually ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ground? Their undiſcerning Neighbours can aſſign no Cauſe for it; or if they do, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to a Perverſeneſs of Temper. Alas! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine cloſe, and you will find the Man is put to a wrong Buſineſs; he hates his Profeſſion; he likes ſome other much better, and his Soul is perpetually hankering after the abſent Object of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006754_0018_10298CFDB4EF0A68"/>his Genius; no Wonder then he is ſo often out of Humour, and neglects his Calling; and that Family Diſquietudes, Broils and Oppoſitions, are ſo frequent.</p>
            <p>WITH what Acuteneſs may one obſerve ſome very young Folks view, admire and criticiſe on the Figure and Qualities of Plants? With what a piercing Eye do they look into the human Frame? How ſenſibly do they talk of the little Ails and Pains of their Play-fellows? What Tenderneſs in their Soul? What ſympathizing Pearls fill their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid Eyes, when any of their little Companions are indiſpoſed? What does this beſpeak? Does not the Voice of God, the Voice of Nature, cry aloud, <hi>Teach him the ſanatory Art of Medicine, and he will be eminent in his Profeſſion, and a Bleſſing to the Place where he lives.</hi> Again, another Boy diſcovers a reaſoning, inquiſitive Mind, thirſting after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and at his Book, when others are at Play; he is ſingularly Good-natured, with an inflexible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and has an innate Love of Truth and Right. Does not this point out the Profeſſion of the Law, as if a Voice from Heaven ſhould call out, <hi>Improve that Mind, ſtore it with the beſt Principles, and with proper Knowledge. Let him ſtudy the Syſtems of Law, natural, national, civil, municipal, and as far as his Influence reaches, Juſtice and Right will be well defended and adminiſtred.</hi> Now, if inſtead of heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to theſe unerring Voices, thro' the Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome particular Humour or Fancy of thoſe who have the Care of theſe Children, they are not educated agreeable to their Genius, what a moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Collection of noble Materials, richly provided by Nature, is here loſt to the World, and to their Families? But what it, beſides this ineſtimable Loſs, they are put to Profeſſions or Employments oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Bent and Love of their Minds; what an endleſs Fund is here laid up for Vexation and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment? The Expences of their Education are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006754_0019_10298CFF40527D30"/>thrown away, and, if they are not ruined before they come to Manhood, by indulging themſelves in Pleaſures, rather than adhere to diſagreeable Studies; there is an high Probability that they prove a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to their Calling, and an Injury to the whole Neighbourhood, who are ſo unfortunate as to be placed near them.</p>
            <p>INCONCEIVABLE are the Miſchiefs which ariſe from the Neglect and Miſuſe of natural Talents and Endowments. But I muſt quit a more particular Detail of them, as many Evils in an uncultivated Mind, ariſing from other Cauſes, remain to be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated.</p>
            <p>FOLLOW me with your cloſeſt Attention, my dear Brethren, whilſt, in the next Place, I ſet before you the Accumulation of all Evils, an undiſciplin'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a bad Temper unreſtrain'd, a way-ward Will, a marr'd, indulg'd Child, the Sport of Folly, Wantonneſs, Paſſion, and every Vice.</p>
            <p>I AM loth to turn my Eyes to the diſagreeable Sight, the Figures ſtand before me in ſo ſtrong a Light. Bleſſed God, what a dreadful Train of Evils may be brought on the riſing Generation by our own Caprice, Humour, Careleſſneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs! The Infant enters the World, the Creator pointing out by the Lines of his Face, the Tone of his Voice, the State of his Spirits, the Quickneſs of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that the ruling Paſſions, and the leading Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Soul are of the impetuous and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Kind, commands Parents, Nurſes and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to ſeaſon the Soul with Inſtructions, and a Diſcipline ſuited to this Diſpoſition. <hi>Be ſure,</hi> (ſays the Author of this Frame) <hi>to keep a ſtrict Hand over him, reprove, chaſtiſe, correct, uſe Severity, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but let this be ſeldom, and when the Fault is glaring; nor give over when you have begun, till you have quelled the tyrannical Spirit.</hi> If this be done, all thoſe inflammatory Materials will turn out for the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006754_0020_10298D00C838B898"/>Service of Mankind: When advanced to mature Years, he will not be afraid to oppoſe and pull down the Enemies of his Country: He will, with a juſt Boldneſs, reprove Vice, and defend oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Innocence and Virtue againſt lawleſs Pride, and over-bearing Wealth. This Advice is neglected.— What is that which paints the incenſed Countenance of the Infant with ſo triumphant a Red? The Face of his vigilant and tender Nurſe is of a gore Blood, tore to Pieces with his entrenching Nails. Now he is a little older, I ſee his Play-mates fly the Room, not one without ſome Hurt or Disfigurement. Is he corrected? No.—He is taken into the Arms of his Mother, tenderly careſſed, and commended for a Boy of Spirit. Unhappy Woman, little does ſhe think what numerous Evils will flow from this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Indulgence!—This uncorrected Spirit, as he advances into Years, will make him the Dupe of all his angry Paſſions, troubleſome and injurious to all about him.—But what ails the Mother? Why does ſhe heave her Boſom, and throw her Hands about her with ſuch a melancholy and deſpairing Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? It ſeems ſhe has juſt heard that her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Son, in one of his Paſſions, by an unlucky Blow, has killed his Boſom Companion, his intimate Friend,—is ſeized by the Hands of Juſtice, and going to receive an infamous, tho' well deſerved Exit.</p>
            <p>BLESSED and gracious God, avert theſe Evils from thy People, and ſanctify THIS INSTITUTION for the Purpoſes of thy holy Religion and Virtue.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt Place, Abundance of Evils, which may be remedied by Care in Education, ariſe from want of Method in the ordering of our Studies, and in the Choice of Authors; and from want of due Care of Diet, Health, Exerciſe, Temperament of the Body, and the Accommodation of the Degree, as well as Quality of Knowledge to the State of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Memory, Humour and Conſtitution: But,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006754_0021_10298D028DE718E8"/>above all, from the Number of bad Books, and bad Examples, bad Morals, and bad Principles, every where to be met with; all which deſerve Conſideration, but muſt, however, be paſt over, to make Room for an Account of this preſent Mode of Education, in which every one will expect that I ſhall be diſtinct and particular.</p>
            <p>I therefore proceed to my ſecond general Head, to ſhew that the preſent Academy is well calculated to remedy theſe Evils.</p>
            <p>THERE have, of late, been ſeveral Things of a publick Nature projected, and Companies form'd for carrying them into Execution within this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, all under better Regulations, and attended with better Succeſs, than Schemes of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in other Places; and what is remarkable, they have all taken their Riſe from the Citizens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have been brought to Perfection at their own Expence: Nor ſhould it be concealed, that this preſent Inſtitution, tho' one of thoſe Kinds which generally have for their Founders ſovereign Princes, or Branches of Royal Families, or Nobles of the firſt Rank and Dignity, owes likewiſe its Being to a Sett of private Men, who, from a Senſe of the Neceſſity of ſuch a Seminary of Learning, ſet themſelves, at the Cloſe of the War, ſeriouſly to think about One: Frequent were their Conſultations, and various were their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; at laſt they agreed on the general Heads, and confident of the Continuance of the publick Spirit of their Fellow Citizens, they ventur'd to publiſh their Propoſals relating to the Education of Youth in this Province; therein enumerating, by a Variety of Hints, the ſeveral Branches of Science, which, in their Opinions, might be comprehended in ſuch an Inſtitution, ſo as to make it abundantly more uſeful than any which had come to their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: At the ſame time, having a Diffidence of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006754_0022_10298D0C52805018"/>their own Judgment and Ability, they placed in the Front of theſe Propoſals an Invitation to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Learning, Underſtanding and Experience, to favour them with their Sentiments and Advice, as to the Parts of Learning to be taught; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Study; the Method of Teaching; the Oeconomy of the School; or any other Matter of Importance to the Undertaking. This no ſooner appeared, than the Generality of the People, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Neceſſity and Advantages of ſome ſuch Inſtitution, became ſollicitous that one ſhould be attempted; whereupon a Form of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was immediately framed, ſuch as was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be beſt ſuited to the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Colony, with Liberty to alter, abſtract or enlarge, as upon Trial it ſhould be found moſt ſerviceable; Experience ſhewing Defects and Miſtakes in the beſt concerted Schemes, and the Mutability of human Affairs ſometimes rendering it neceſſary to make Alterations. After theſe were found to give general Satisfaction, Twenty-four Truſtees, without Regard to Difference in religious Perſuaſions, were appointed to carry them into Execution; Merchants, Artificers, ſome likewiſe of the learned Profeſſions. On the Publication, all was ſo well approved, that in a very ſmall Space of Time the Subſcriptions aroſe to <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds</hi> a Year for five Years; a Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity truly amazing, and what muſt convey a mighty advantageous Idea of the good Diſpoſition of all Orders of Men amongſt us to promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, whenever a fit Occaſion preſents.</p>
            <p>THUS ſucceſsful, it became a Matter of Debate where to place the Academy, and many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were offered for ſome Village in the Country as beſt favouring the Morals of the Youth, too apt to be corrupted by the bad Examples abounding in populous Cities: But when it came to be conſidered
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006754_0023_10298D0DD969FF28"/>that it would take a large Sum to erect proper Buildings at a Diſtance from the City; that the Circumſtances of many of the Citizens would not admit of a diſtant Place on Account of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; that the Truſtees were Men of Buſineſs, who could not be abſent from their Habitations without much Inconvenience; and that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the whole, under God, would, in a great Meaſure, depend, whether in Town or Country, on the perſonal Care and Attendance of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Management, it was thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to fix it ſome where within the City; and the more ſo, when the Minds of the Truſtees of the Building, where we are now aſſembled, came to be imparted. Theſe thoughtful Perſons had been for ſome Years ſenſible that this Building was not put to its original Uſe, nor was it in their Power to ſet forward a Charity School, which was alſo a Part of the firſt Deſign; and that it was more in the Power of the Truſtees of the Academy than in theirs to do it; they therefore made an Offer to transfer their Right in it for the Uſe of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; provided the Debts, which remained unpaid, might be diſcharged, and the Arrears of Rent on the Lot paid off. This was thankfully accepted, and a Conveyance executed; and on the Settlement of the Monies due on account of the Building, ſome of its Truſtees even generouſly forgave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of their juſt Demands. Whilſt I am acknowledging their Merit, let me not forget to do Juſtice to their abſent Co-truſtee for his ready and hearty Concurrence, ſignified in his Letter to the Preſident on that Subject. How peculiarly fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was this, ſince, by the Largeneſs of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Academy is furniſhed out of one Part of it only, and that the ſmalleſt, with as many handſome and well proportioned Rooms for all the Schools, as if they had been built for the Purpoſe; and there
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006754_0024_10298D0F7B908518"/>is ſtill left as much of that Part, where divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is performed, as will anſwer the original De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and as it is ready ſeated, and adorned with a beautiful Roſtrum or Pulpit, it will likewiſe make a ſpacious Oratory or Hall for publick Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To add ſtill to our good Fortune, ſome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Lots, and ſmall Buildings on them, have fallen into the Truſtees Hands, by Purchaſe, ſince the Conveyance of the large One; and with a little Alteration, one of the Edifices can be turned into a Charity School. Theſe furniſh a large and unincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered Area for the Childrens Exerciſe, and on which, in Time to come, as the Academy Funds encreaſe, and when a regular College may be thought to ſuit the Circumſtances of the Colony, there is Room to erect a commodious Square of Buildings to accommodate the Students with Apartments for Lodgings, and all other Conveniencies.</p>
            <p>ON this advanced Situation of the Scheme, the Corporation taking into Conſideration the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Advantages the City would reap by this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Learning, to their Honour be it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have voted <hi>Two Hundred Pounds</hi> to be paid to the Truſtees in Hand, and <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> a Year for five Years; <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have appropriated to the Uſe of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity School, for inſtructing poor Children <hi>gratis</hi> in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and in Reading, Writing and Arithmetick; which School the Truſtees intend to open the enſuing Year, not doubting but by the divine Bleſſing on their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the further Encouragement of good People, they ſhall be enabled to carry it on to the great Advantage of the Publick, and Benefit of the poorer Sort. One of the moſt promiſing Children is to be yearly choſen out of the Charity School by the Corporation, and educated <hi>gratis</hi> in higher Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Academy.</p>

THE ſetting out only with a temporary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, was by many at firſt diſliked, not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there could be found any Maſters of ſufficient Abilities, who would be willing to ſerve on theſe Terms, but the Authors of the Propoſals judged otherwiſe of the Diſpoſition of Men of Letters, and were ſanguine enough to pronounce, that when ſuch ſhould come to hear of the Spirit exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this Occaſion, they would not be diſcouraged by the Limitation of Time; but would natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be led to think, if ſo handſome a Sum, as <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds</hi> a Year, could be ſo readily rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under ſuch an Uncertainty of the Scheme's ſucceeding, there could be no Doubt, but if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould favour it with Succeſs, there would at the End of the Term, be a much better, and more durable Fund. Excluſive of this Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was judged that the Love of Mankind, ever inſeparable from ſolid Knowledge, and true Learning, would engage the Perſons poſſeſſed of them in its Favour. It fell out accordingly. A Gentleman of a neighbouring Province, when it was moved to him, as he was known to be well qualified to fill the Place of Rector, and <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Maſter, generouſly cloſed with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal without any Objection to the Limitation of Time, or Stipulation for a preciſe Sum to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a Salary, which could not then be fixed. This was a great deal, but ſtill much more was wanting. The Place of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſter was thought to be of as much, if not more Conſequence, and it was not probable that any one equal to the Taſk, and at the ſame time diſengaged, could be found in <hi>America:</hi> This made the Truſtees uneaſy, as they could not think of running the Riſque of Recommendations of Perſons from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where, tho' the fitteſt Men might be procured, yet in caſe of a Diſappointment, the Inconveniency
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006754_0026_10298D1980485788"/>would not eaſily be remedied. Whilſt under this Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, two of the Truſtees took a Journey to the Eaſtern Provinces, and being favoured with the Converſation of an eminent and learned Perſon, well known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men of Letters for ſeveral Improvements on the Method of Study, and acquiring the liberal Arts, he gave them Hopes of his perſonal viſiting the Academy, which if he had done, they flattered themſelves that this Difficulty might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; but Indiſpoſition, and ſome other unforeſeen Accidents, deprived them of his Aſſiſtance. In this Situation, Affairs remained till the other Day; when a Gentleman ſaid to be an experienced Inſtructor of Youth, and practically acquainted with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods uſed in the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Schools and Academies, arrived in this City; and on an accidental Relation made to him as a Stranger by one of the Truſtees, of the State of the Academy, and of the Diſtreſs occaſioned by the Diſappointment as to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſter, he offered his Service to ſupply the Place, till one could be provided. This made ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Truſtees, that they recommended it to the Rector to examine into his Abilities, and on his Report that he thought him well qualified, they engaged him for a certain Time.</p>
            <p>The Maſter employed to teach the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and the Sciences uſually taught with them, is well known, having, for many Years, had a large School in Town. His School is furniſhed by the Truſtees with a very valuable Sett of Mathematical Inſtruments of all Sorts, for the better Inſtruction of the Scholars in the Uſe of them. The <hi>Grammar</hi> Schools are alſo provided with a Collection of the beſt <hi>Claſſicks,</hi> for the Uſe of the Maſters.</p>
            <p>Thus the Academy opens with a Rector, and Maſters in the Schools, that are the moſt material, and of the moſt immediate and general Uſe. One
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006754_0027_10298D1CC2B855B8"/>Tutor is already provided in Aſſiſtance of the Rector on the Recommendation of a good Judge. More Tutors and Uſhers will be added, as the Scholars encreaſe.</p>
            <p>THO' it has been thought proper to give this Seminary of Learning the Name and Title of an Academy, yet it is more properly a Collection of Schools under one Roof, and the Inſpection of the Truſtees. And tho' only ſuch Branches of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as are perfectly adapted to the Circumſtances of the Province, are for the preſent propoſed to be taught in it, in which Reſpect its Advantage muſt be conſiderable, ſince, if the Plan be ſucceſsfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, theſe will be taught in a much quicker and better Method, and at a much leſs Expence: Yet it is ſo ordered, that with ſuch Additions, as on Experience of its great Uſe and Benefit may be reaſonably expected will be made to the preſent Fund, it may be improv'd into a Collegiate Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and every Kind of Knowledge be taught in it, that the moſt reputed Univerſities lay Claim to.</p>
            <p>IT is no inconſiderable Part of the Plan, that whilſt the Pupils in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Schools are taught the grammatical Conſtruction of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, it is intended Lectures ſhall be read to thoſe who are forward enough in their Learning, wherein the Subject Matter of each Author will be explained and illuſtrated, and his Style, Spirit and Elegance, pointed out; ſo that they may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, taſted, admired, and, it is hoped, well imitated by the Pupils in their Compoſitions.</p>
            <p>NOR is it propoſed in the Childrens Exerciſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by the Methods in ordinary Uſe, which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral only conſult the making <hi>Latin</hi> according to Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Rules, or the right Conſtruction of an Author by them: But that Exerciſes, adapted to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Proficiency of the Scholars, ſhall be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006754_0028_10298D1E4B5A8E20"/>by the Maſters, and conſiſt of Hiſtory, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and the plain Parts of Natural Philoſophy; all which may, by theſe Means, be taught along with the Languages. Nor will this appear too difficult to them, who know what amazing Progreſs Boys may be brought to make in Knowledge, by proper Methods, and due Care on the Part of the Maſters. For Inſtance, if before an Exerciſe be put into their Hands, the Subject be fairly opened, its ſeveral Parts explained, and then Queſtions propoſed in the Preſence of the Claſs, to one or more of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt Boys, to try whether the Matter of the Exerciſe be clearly underſtood, or it may want to be ſtill further explained; if this is affectionately and judiciouſly done beforehand, it is not to be imagined how much the Apprehenſion may be quickened, the Memory aided, the Judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and, in a ſmall Time, all the Faculties improved. The learned <hi>Tanaquil Faber</hi>'s Son, is an Example of this; for he, at fourteen Years of Age, had read moſt of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Claſſicks, and underſtood them perfectly well, as well as ſeveral other Parts of Learning. In the <hi>Latin</hi> School, the Maſters will likewiſe have it particularly in Charge to correct, refine and beautify our Mother Tongue, to the End that their Scholars may be enabled to underſtand it perfectly well, and to write it with Purity and Elegance. How much this is wanted, may be eaſily judged, if it be conſidered, what a mean Figure many, who underſtand the learned Languages, make when they come to write in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi> how aukward is their Mode of Expreſſion; how forced and inelegant are their Compoſitions; and how difficult to be underſtood; tho' all the Rules of Grammar have been accurately obſerved?</p>
            <p>THIS Academy has this further Advantage; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language is propoſed to be taught in a <hi>Grammatical Manner,</hi> and in a ſeparate School, for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006754_0029_10298D2476876190"/>the Uſe of thoſe who may not be inclined to learn <hi>Latin.</hi> The great Neceſſity and Uſe whereof will appear, if one conſiders to what an infinite Pain ingenious Perſons, who ſpeak only their Mother Tongue, but are unacquainted with Grammar, and Propriety of Expreſſion, are put, to write even on the moſt common Subjects? It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that many Diſcoveries have been made of equal Importance, perhaps, with any known, and yet dropped or concealed by the Diſcoverers, from their Apprehenſions of incurring the Cenſure of the World, and being put to Shame, for want of juſt and proper Expreſſions, thro' their Ignorance of Language to clothe their Sentiments; and tho' this is a falſe Shame, yet ſince the Pain ariſing from it, is as exquiſite as the Pleaſure felt on the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations given to any One for a fine Style and juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it is not to be wondered that it ſhould take Place, eſpecially as the Minds of truly ingenious Men are generally very delicate on this Point.</p>
            <p>As a further Proof of the Benefit of ſuch a School, let it be conſidered, that was the Mind uſed to form Words, and make written Deſcriptions of Things as ſoon as the original Truths were impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the Brain, the Attention would be mightily quickened, the Judgment aſſiſted, and the Memory greatly corroborated. Be pleaſed to aſk yourſelves, how much oftener Names bring Perſons and Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Minds than their Preſence? Juſt ſo it would be were general Propoſitions and uſeful Truths well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the Deſcriptions carefully lodged in the Memory, which they would be much oftener than they are, did Men know how to commit them early and properly to Writing. A Man in Buſineſs, who makes Memorandums of what he does, has a vaſt Advantage of the beſt Memory; it would be even ſo, if he was to make Memorandums of the Truths proper to be known, or that come to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006754_0030_10298D27BAA7DE80"/>he would here alſo have the Advantage of the greateſt Readers of Books, who don't take this Method.</p>
            <p>THIS is however what People in general think may be done by learning <hi>Latin,</hi> and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, perhaps, as much as for the Advantage of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Language, give their Children a <hi>Latin</hi> Education; but it is really not ſo, or not ſo much ſo as they imagine: For tho', when a Perſon learns <hi>Latin,</hi> the Rules of Grammar may be applied to his native Tongue, and in Effect a Man does, whilſt learning <hi>Latin,</hi> throw his Mother Tongue into grammatical Order, yet he does not gain a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, much leſs a Propriety of Expreſſion: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how ſhould he, ſince every Language has its own Idioms, its own Phraſes, its own Copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Beauties and Elegance? The native Force and Energy of every Language is ſo peculiar to itſelf, that it cannot be transferred into any other Language, without the Loſs of the ſpecifick Spirit. Make <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Tully Greek,</hi> and you will ſoon diſcover this. Try to turn <hi>Milton,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Swift,</hi> into <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> or any other Language. Let the <hi>Spectators</hi> be put into <hi>French</hi> by the firſt Profeſſor of Eloquence in the Royal College, and you will not know them to be the ſame. 'Tis as impoſſible as the Tranſmutation of Metals; and, as I apprehend, for this Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mother Tongue takes its Riſe from Things themſelves, and from the different Lights in which Objects or Truths make their firſt Entrance into the Mind. It is the firſt and pureſt Tranſcript of Nature, which is ever conceived better from the Originals, as they firſt appear to the Senſes or the Mind on the Spot, and raiſe the Virgin Affections and Paſſions, than as they are apprehended by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of other Countries, and clothed in foreign Expreſſions. The Originals, whether the Works
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006754_0031_10298D2946641FA8"/>of Nature or Art, Action, Character, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome or all of them, raiſe the Ideas quicker and ſtronger in the Brain, and conſequently their Impreſſions are more natural and durable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what is called Humour, that is, each Man's particular Mode of conceiving and telling Things, or of acting and behaving in the grave or lighter Concerns of Life, can be taken into the Mind no where but upon the Spot; and as there is a national as well as perſonal Humour, and this mixes more or leſs in almoſt every Narration, whether in Proſe or Verſe, and as <hi>Engliſh</hi> People abound with this more than any other; it is the Duty of every <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Man to prefer and cultivate to the utmoſt his native Language, that he may enjoy all that Infinity of Pleaſure, which is derived from the Spirit, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, good Senſe, and inimitable Humour of his Countrymen. Nor would I have this underſtood, as if it was ſaid in Derogation of the <hi>Latin</hi> School. No; far from this, conſidering how great a Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue is derived from the <hi>Latin;</hi> that all the Terms of Art and Science in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Profeſſions are taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> and that there is Abundance of uſeful Knowledge which can be acquired in no other Language; it is abſolutely incumbent on thoſe who ſtudy to capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themſelves for thoſe Profeſſions, or who aim at a general Education and Acquaintance with Books, to gain a thorough Knowledge of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> Add to this, that the chief Part of the Syſtem of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> School, which is to learn Youth to write and ſpeak it with Purity, is propoſed to be uſed in the <hi>Latin</hi> Schools, which will thereby be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much better, and of more extenſive Uſe.</p>
            <p>THE Newneſs and Peculiarity of this School made it neceſſary to give a diſtinct Account of it: But what the Publick ought principally to be told, and to conſider, is, that the preſent Mode of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006754_0032_10298D2CB58399A8"/>is calculated to ſave Time, and, by good Order and Diſcipline, to fix in the Childrens Mind an early Senſe and Love of Right and Decorum, of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and juſt Behaviour. It is apprehended, that by the Methods propoſed to be here uſed, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Languages will be acquired much ſooner, and all the while good Principles may be inſtilled into the Soul; the Diſpoſitions, if bad, corrected; if good, encouraged. The Boys may be made to love Learning, to crave it with Earneſtneſs, and to apply it to their Manners with Quickneſs. They may be brought to love their Maſters, and when the Childrens Affections are gained by thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the Schools, they may make ſuch Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſpoſe of their Praiſes and Reproaches, of their Rewards and Puniſhments to ſuch Advantage; as to make every Boy diſcern Right and Wrong, and engage all his Paſſions early on their proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. They may raiſe an inextinguiſhable Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch an ardent Deſire to excel, as ſhall take the Lead of all the Paſſions. They may feed it with every worthy Character, recorded to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared either in former or later Times in every Part of the World. Pupils thus taught, will, of their own Accord, introduce a Sort of Honour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Preferment of each other into their very Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; they will ſcorn to cheat, or over-reach, or take any undue Advantage, or uſe any over-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatment or Language, and whoever does, (tho' Accuſations ſhould not be encouraged) ought to be expoſed. The principal Part of Education amongſt the <hi>Orientals,</hi> old <hi>Grecians,</hi> and early <hi>Romans,</hi> conſiſted in the Management of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Diverſions, Exerciſes and Meals; theſe being thought of equal Importance with liberal Arts and Sciences. Manly and noble were their Exerciſes, their Appetites in perfect Subjection, and their Manners formed on the Rules of juſt Courteſy and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006754_0033_10298D3028DFBAD8"/>rational Complaiſance. Pity they are not more imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, as this would certainly promote Hardineſs, Temperance, Modeſty, Emulation, Friendlineſs, Openneſs of Temper, Generoſity, a Senſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Love of Virtue.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be well conſidered, how to make a juſt Advantage of that uſeful Paſſion Shame, the Barrier of Virtue; for the Delicacy of its Nature is ſuch, that tho' with good Management it may be of infinite Aſſiſtance in the Formation of the Childrens Manners, yet unſpeakable Hurt may be done by an injudicious and too frequent Application to it.</p>
            <p>CORRECTION likewiſe is ſometimes neceſſary; but it is propoſed that this be adminiſtred with the utmoſt Prudence and Caution, never whilſt under the Force or Effects of ſudden Paſſion; gentle ſhould be the Reproaches at firſt; then, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, louder and more pointed; and even if not then minded, it ſhould be well conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be a proper Time to come to Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for on this depends the Preſervation of the Child; if they have their proper Effect, he is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if not, he is ruined.</p>
            <p>I reſerve to the laſt, as being of the moſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that great Care ought to be taken to inſtil into the Minds of the Children juſt and ſolid Notions of Religion. The Maſters will be inſtructed to have this always in their View, ſince every thinking Man muſt be ſenſible that if theſe be neglected, all the other Parts of Education will avail little; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſed to begin and end with Prayers, to be made ſuitable to the Occaſion; and this not as a Formality, but an Act of proper and neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to draw down the divine Bleſſing on their Endeavours, without which they cannot expect Succeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:006754_0034_10298D3824DA4F98"/>
ON this Subject two Things occur to me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Conſideration, and ſome better Regulation than has hitherto been obſerved. The firſt relates to the ſacred Name of GOD, and the other to the Uſe of the holy Scriptures. As to the firſt, great Care ſhould be taken that when it occurs in School Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, it be pronounced with Reverence. Was that holy, tremendous and all perfect Spirit, ſeen with the Eyes of the Mind when his ſacred Name is read, which would be the Caſe, did Perſons attend to what they read, the Heart would neceſſarily feel Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adoration and dutiful Regard, and we ſhould ſtop a while at the divine Majeſty of the Perſonage: Grave and religious Men actually do ſo; thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Philoſophers Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed this holy Name without a Pauſe, and a ſhort mental Ejaculation of Adoration and Praiſe. Now as Children do not know what it means, if when it occurs, the Maſters pronounce it, and they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to gabble it over in the ſame careleſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus;</hi> from hence there will ariſe an habitual Irreverence, which may remain even when they know better. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be avoided, and the Maſters uſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome diſtinguiſhing Mark of Reverence when it is neceſſarily to be pronounced; and it may be of Uſe in their Exerciſes, inſtead of the Name, to mention ſome Part of the divine Character, as <hi>the Creator or Governor of the World, the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eternal Spirit, the univerſal Parent, the Good Being, the All-powerful, All-knowing, All-direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit:</hi> Together with this cautious Uſe of the Name, let particular Care be taken that worthy Sentiments of the Divine Supreme Being be by every poſſible Method inſtilled into the Minds of the Scholars. Abſtract Notions confound the Heads of Youth. His Exerciſe of Juſtice, his Love of his Creatures, his Impartiality, and Delight in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006754_0035_10298D39AA745CC8"/>and Happineſs, muſt be engraven on their tender Minds with great Clearneſs and Simplicity, ſo as that their little Souls may be early taught to honour and love his Character. This adorable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be ſpoke of with great Devotion, and with a ſuitable Perſuaſiveneſs, as the affectionate and tender Parent of their Parents and themſelves, whom they ought to love, becauſe he loves them more than their natural Parents or Relations can do, and can diſpoſe their own little Hearts aright, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Hearts of others in their Favour; and therefore they ought to be careful by Prayer and Goodneſs to engage his divine Majeſty to aſſiſt them in their Studies, and to give them Wiſdom, and to make them uſeful in the World. Heaven ſhould be ſpoke of as a Place where JEHOVAH ſits upon his Throne, and at a proper Time will call to him all ſuch as have gone through their Studies with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and, in Virtue of a good Education, have faithfully diſcharged their Duties in their reſpective Stations here below. Our bleſſed Saviour ſhould be repreſented as ſitting at the Right-hand of the Throne of his Father, the Patron, Guardian, Protector, and the Head of the univerſal Church, and Lord of the Souls of Men, ſending the moſt holy and bleſſed Spirit to aſſiſt and ſanctify them while in this lower World; and diſpenſing immenſe Rewards and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments to them, when by Death they ſhall be tranſlated to a better.</p>
            <p>THIS is to be the more earneſtly recommended to the Maſter, as the filial and dutiful Reverence of God, and the Exerciſe of the Affections towards him, is too too much neglected? Suffer me, tho' it may be deemed a Digreſſion, to ſay ſomething on ſo intereſting a Subject. What can make Ingratitude towards God a leſs Crime than towards our Fellow Creatures? Is it that this divine Spirit is not as free and as deliberate in the Diſtribution of his Favours
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006754_0036_10298D3B347C8DD0"/>as Man is? When before the Creation there was an univerſal Blank, when nothing exiſted of what our Eyes now behold, and the Almighty had under his Conſideration, and within his Option, a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Beings, muſt it not be perfect Choice, and the utmoſt Liberty of Action, to bring into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence any, and what Sort of Beings, he pleaſed? If then he was graciouſly pleaſed to form Man after his own Image, and in his own Likeneſs, and to confer upon him the ineſtimable Bleſſings of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Liberty, does not this infer an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And where an intelligent Being finds himſelf under an Obligation, is it not highly reaſonable to acknowledge it, and to return Affection for it? I ſay, does it not enter into the Eſſence of an Obligation, that the Perſon who confers it, knows the Value of the Favour conferred, and may withhold it if he pleaſes? And if he does not withhold it, when at perfect Liberty to beſtow or not, does not this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily engage the Praiſe and Thankſgiving of the Obliged? Does it make a Difference in Point of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Duty, whether it be the Supreme or a ſubordinate Being who confers the Favour?</p>
            <p>ON a fair Anſwer to theſe Queſtions, Reaſon will pronounce, that as the Abſence of the good Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards a proper Object is a great Fault, ſuch Fault muſt needs be the greater when the Object is moſt deſerving; and conſequently we ſhall do no Injuſtice to our Natures, if we place Irreligion and Indevotion among the moſt odious Crimes.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; Are not the good Affections among the natural Excellencies and Perfections of the divine Nature? Are they not the Source and Fountain from whence ſpring ſo many kind and good Providences towards his Creatures? Revelation expreſly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes them to GOD, nor think this is by Way of an indulgent Complaiſance to our weak Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006754_0037_10298D3CC08721C0"/>but as the juſteſt and trueſt Deſcription of the real Diſpoſition of the Almighty. Now if the Supreme Being be an affectionate and loving Spirit, and all his Grace and Favour to us accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Love, are we not, in this View of Things, extremely faulty, to remain without any Return of Love for him? No one who is really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by another here below, can avoid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of his Heart, if his own Affections are not at the fame Time raiſed towards him. The very Brutes, who diſcover Fondneſs for us, raiſe in us a Tenderneſs for them: Love ſhewn by any of our own Species certainly kindles in every well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Breaſt, a warm Return of Affection:—Should not then, in the Eye of Reaſon, the Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord kindle in our Breaſts the greateſt and moſt ardent Affection towards his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. How amazing then, how affecting to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Mind muſt be the Obſervation of the little Devotion which is paid, by the Generality of Men, to this worthieſt and moſt rational Object of their Reverence, Love and Gratitude! If therefore Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not pointed againſt, and does not actually remedy this Evil, whatever elſe it does is of little or no Conſequence to the Soul, either in this World, or in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>THE other Thing that occurs to me, relates to the holy Scriptures. Tho' they cannot be in too common Uſe, and the ſooner and the oftner they are read the better, yet as by the Introduction of them into the School Exerciſes, and for the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Languages, or Words, or Letters, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes a Diſguſt to them, or at beſt an inſipid and careleſs Uſe of them; to prevent this, my Notion is, and I offer it with the utmoſt Caution, that theſe Books be taught in ſeparate and diſtinct Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and treated as containing a Meſſage from the moſt high JEHOVAH to Mankind, committed to his
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006754_0038_10298D45DD843E70"/>moſt bleſſed Son, ſent expreſly from Heaven to deliver it; and further, that there are in them Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the utmoſt Conſequence to our everlaſting Salvation. After this is well underſtood, the eaſy Parts ſhould be read firſt, and explained to them in their native Tongue, or in <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> when theſe Languages are become familiar, then the more difficult Paſſages ſhould be treated of; and herein a juſt and proper Order ſhould be obſerved as the Underſtanding opens, and can bear them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remembering, that the Scripture every where takes for granted, that Men are conſcious there is in them a Power of Reaſoning, moral Senſe, ſocial Affection, Love of Truth, Approbation of good Actions and Characters, and Love of Eſteem; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Pains of Remorſe, Shame and Sympathy. It is on the real Exiſtence of theſe Qualities and Affections in the human Soul, that the Prophets in ſuch pathetick Strains call upon Men to make the Almighty the Object of their Love and Adoration, and to exerciſe towards his divine Majeſty in the higheſt Degree the ſame Gratitude, Awe and Reverence, which they ſee good and grateful Men exerciſe towards their Benefactors here, and for which they are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally admired and beloved. Theſe Qualities are con-natural to the Soul; and tho' weakened and impair'd, yet not totally extinguiſhed by the Fall. They make up in ſhort the Reſemblance which forms <hi>the Likeneſs and Image of God,</hi> after which holy Writ ſays we were at firſt made. To theſe the Scripture conſtantly addreſſes itſelf; theſe are put into Motion by <hi>Grace;</hi> to theſe are applied, as Seed to well prepared Ground, all thoſe gracious Diſcourſes of our Saviour and his Apoſtles; on theſe the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> exerts his efficacious Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; from theſe the <hi>Saint</hi> is produced <hi>elect, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> theſe are ſome of the Materials out of which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006754_0039_10298D4763AFAE60"/>we are built up <hi>a ſpiritual Houſe, a royal Prieſthood, a choſen Generation, an holy Nation, a peculiar People.</hi> From theſe <hi>the perfect Man</hi> is formed, and by them we attain <hi>to the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things duly preſſed, together with the Childrens conſtant Attendance at their reſpective Places of Worſhip (a Point likewiſe to be ſtrongly inſiſted on) will be the likelieſt Means to ſecure a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the King of Kings, and to the inſpired Writings of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to my laſt general Head; <hi>To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all preſent to give their utmoſt Encouragement to this pious Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To relieve another under preſſing Afflictions, is a very laudable Act.—To be aſſiduous to find out the Unfortunate and Miſerable, and to adminiſter ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quick Relief, conſtitutes the Character of a good Man.—Were many ſuch good Perſons in any one Place, the Evils of Life would there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably decreaſed.—By well concerted Schemes to introduce into a Country a Number of ſenſible and virtuous Men, or to make them ſo who live already in it, and to make a Proviſion for a Supply of ſuch good Men in future Times, is the nobleſt Effort of the human Underſtanding. This laſt, the higheſt Step in this enumerated Gradation of Good, is the Object of the Intention of thoſe who plann'd the Inſtitution now to be recommended to you: It has therefore the juſteſt Claims to your Attention and Aſſiſtance. The Good which under the divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it will immediately produce, is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but in no wiſe to be put into Competition with its falutary Effects on the riſing Generation. More Evils may be prevented by it, than (were they for want of it ſuffered to exiſt) cou'd be remedied by all the virtuous Men of the Place put together, aided with all the Power and Wealth of the Community.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006754_0040_10298D48ECE65AB0"/>Whoever then, liſts himſelf amongſt the Contributors, is with them co-operating for the publick Weal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and conſulting the Good of Thouſands, the Good of them who are in the Womb of Time to the lateſt Poſterity. O rational, glorious, and godlike Employment! Cheriſh, my dear Brethren, this Diſpoſition in yourſelves and your Fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; you don't know to what Length it may go; if, as ſome project, others are ſtill as ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, undervaluing perſonal Trouble and Expence; I can, without the Impeachment of an over-fond Love of Country, pronounce this will become a moſt admired and happy Province.</p>
            <p>With what a Tranſport of Joy then do I now prepare to beſpeak your Favour for an Undertaking of ſo extenſive a Benefit!</p>
            <p>And, firſt, the Principles of Duty engage me to addreſs myſelf to You, Sir, to whom the Care of this Government is committed, in Favour of this Academical Collection of Schools. 'Tis what you have long rather wiſhed for, and lamented the Loſs of, than ever expected. This you did when in a private Station; what may not then be expected now the Event is come to paſs, not only in your own Time, but in your own Adminiſtration? Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice calls on the Truſtees to expreſs their grateful Senſe of what you have already done. Their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the warm Place it has in your Breaſt, makes them with the ſincereſt Confidence ready to conſult and adviſe with you, and to indulge large Hopes of the Continuance of your Protection and Liberality. The Senſe and Morals of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are as much the Object of the Care of a good Governor, as their Lives and Properties; a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which will undoubtedly lead you, conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the Diſcharge of your high Truſt, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its Succeſs with a peculiar Zeal. Happy, if the Publick may thence be provided with Perſons of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006754_0041_10298D4C87ED8E68"/>ſolid Piety, and Lovers of Chriſt, from a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth and Excellency of the Chriſtian Religion; able Counſellors to aſſiſt and adviſe in the arduous Affairs of Government; wiſe, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and knowing Magiſtrates to adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; ſenſible and learned Freeholders to furniſh an improving and rational Converſation; and finally, Men in all Ranks and Stations, of all Trades and Profeſſions, well qualified to ſerve their Country, as they may be reſpectively wanted to fill the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Offices and Duties of the Common Wealth.</p>
            <p>I now beg Leave to addreſs you, Gentlemen, who have taken upon you the great Truſt of carrying into Execution the Plan of Education propoſed to be obſerved in this Academy. And I would do it in the moſt affectionate Manner, having the Honour to be not only of your Acquaintance, but in your Friendſhip. What I ſay will be only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory of the firm Purpoſes of your own Hearts, and of the Expectations of the Publick. The Eyes of all are upon you, and as an abſolute Confidence is placed in your perſonal Probity, Diligence and Abilities, it is expected that you will be mighty careful in your Examination of the Talents and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of all who offer for Inſtructors in the ſeveral Schools. That you admit none from a partial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Affection, or from an ill-judged Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Lowneſs of their Circumſtances, or any other Conſideration than Merit previouſly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and after mature Conſideration approved. That you ſee every Thing with your own Eyes, and for that Purpoſe that you be frequent in your Viſits to the Schools, and be careful to make the Rector report at proper Periods of Time the State of each School, and the Improvement of the Scholars, that it may be timely ſeen if any uſeful Additions or Alterations ought to be made to the Plan. That ſince you ſtand engaged to give all becoming En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006754_0042_10298D5370AC4808"/>to the Scholars, you will not fail to give diſtinguiſhing Marks of your Favour to ſuch as deſerve well of you by their Advancement in Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; and if any ſhall diſcover more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Talents, which will want your Aſſiſtance to be improved to their utmoſt Extent, that you be not backward in giving it. And in particular, that you do not ſuffer any Regard to Party, Kindred, or Friendſhip, to byaſs you in your Judgments, but that every Thing be done with Candour, Affection, and a diſintereſted Attachment to perſonal Deſert, and the Reputation of the Academy. And may the Almighty direct, favour and bleſs your Councils.</p>
            <p>ORDER now calls upon me to addreſs you, who preſide in the Schools. The generous Love of Learning, of which you have given ſo ample a Teſtimony, by the ready Tender of your Services, gives Room to expect all that Abilities, Integrity and Care can do for the Youth committed to your Tuition. The Rector has a Precedency given him, from which both he and you may draw many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; you will never want one to conſult with who, on all Occaſions, will be ſure to give you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Advice, and repreſent to the Truſtees any Difficulties or Inconveniencies which may occur in Truſts of ſo complex a Nature: You may ſpeak with perfect Freedom to him, tho' I am perſuaded it will not be without a juſt Regard to his Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And he will make no other Uſe of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentſhip, than to render your reſpective Duties eaſy and delightful to you; he will be a ready Fellow-Labourer with you; his Good-nature, Prudence and Moderation, will make him think that he has no Authority placed in him but for the Good, and from a Regard to the Order and Subordination neceſſary to be obſerved in ſuch a Collection of Schools; nor will you ſuffer ſo unbecoming a Thought to enter into your Minds, as that your
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006754_0043_10298D54F62557E8"/>reſpective Merits are hereby in any Manner depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, or not duly conſidered. In truth, he who does the beſt will gain the greateſt Eſteem. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire then unanimouſly and fervently in raiſing the Name and Reputation of the Academy, and in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Truſtees to put every Branch of Buſineſs on the firmeſt and moſt beneficial Eſtabliſhment. Make it your Study to obtain the Affection of your Scholars, to find out their Genius, to direct it well, to watch their Morals, Tempers and Behaviour, and by your Tenderneſs and well-judg'd Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Reproofs, to infuſe into their Minds the Love of Learning: Adapt their Exerciſes and Learning to the State of their Underſtanding, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or any Infirmities they may labour under from their particular Conſtitutions of Mind or Body: Above all, Teſtify your Concern for a religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, nor ever ſuffer the ſacred Name of GOD to be prophaned, or any rude, immoral, or indecent Expreſſions to be uttered. You will take all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to repreſent the Chriſtian Religion in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and genuine Excellency and Perfection: As the kindeſt and fulleſt Inſtruction of the wiſeſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the moſt affectionate of Parents: As a Syſtem of Laws authoritatively publiſhed for the ſole Rule of Faith and Manners, and compleatly calculated to promote every Intereſt Men can have either as diſcretionary Tenants in this World, or as Inheritors, by divine Favour, of the Kingdom of Heaven; and may the Lord impart unto you the Truth, and with it perfect Freedom, and a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to do all to his Glory, and the Good of the Souls committed to your Care.</p>
            <p>I AM under very ſtrong Ties of Affection towards you my Fellow Citizens, who compoſe the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of this Audience, and ſhall endeavour to Form my particular Addreſs to you in Terms an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to my Eſteem of you. As an Inſtance of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006754_0044_10298D5681D928E8"/>the Reality of my Regard, I have not ſo much as attempted to apply to your Paſſions in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but to your Underſtandings, in my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove the abſolute Neceſſity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefit of a liberal Education. I am not concern'd to raiſe a momentary Warmth in your Breaſts, but to engage your Judgments, and in Conſequence thereof, your Affections, in Behalf of the Academy. I hope to hear you enquire frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and importunately, of the Succeſs of theſe Schools, as if you thought yourſelves more than ordinarily intereſted therein: I have often been a delighted Witneſs of the vaſt Pleaſure you receive, when Strangers expreſs favourable Sentiments of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced State of this Colony; this is a good Omen in their Favour. I would not damp this juſt and becoming Spirit; may your Children inherit it, and be enabled to perpetuate the Advantages you enjoy. One may venture to pronounce, that, imbued with good Principles, intimately acquainted with the ancient and modern Conſtitutions of Kingdoms; their Souls fired with the Examples of the worthy Characters, with the noble Sentiments, and perfect Models of Antiquity; poſſeſſed of a well-grounded and complete Knowledge in Arts and Sciences; they will preſerve the ſacred Depoſite of all your juſtly eſteemed Privileges, and deliver them down, with ſtill greater Improvement, to the lateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>AND now to bring this Diſcourſe towards a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: There is one Science worth all the reſt, and to which all of us may attain; and, Oh! that I could find Language powerful enough to give it its juſt Recommendation; I mean, the Science of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well; in this all are concerned, but principally thoſe who are advanced in Years, for on theſe the Eyes of the Young are naturally fixed, and from them they take their Meaſures. Alas, could it be
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006754_0045_10298D580AC10570"/>ſeen what a mighty Train of Evils does frequently follow one bad Example, it would amaze the beſt informed Man amongſt us! Tho' the Evils which we ſee every Day occaſioned by bad Lives, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous, and of the worſt Sort, yet they are not to be put in Compariſon with the ſecret and unperceiv'd Miſchiefs produced by their Influence on the preſent and ſucceeding Generations? Suffer me, to preſent this ſad View of Things, with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Earneſtneſs, to ſuch as have the Direction and Care of Families.</p>
            <p>YOUR Children knowing that you have gone thro' Life before them, and thinking that you are perfectly well acquainted with what relates to it, place an abſolute Confidence in what you ſay and do, and have an entire Dependance on your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practices. Believe me, your Children are nice Obſervers of your Behaviour, not only in Matters wherein they themſelves are immediately concerned, but in ſuch as relate to others; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in theſe latter, a great deal more than you think of; it is no Secret to them that in theſe you act without Reſerve, and on full and free Choice; and therefore from theſe more than from your immediate Conduct towards them, they form their Notions of the Value and Goodneſs of Actions and Characters. Now let me aſk you ſeriouſly, Are you not extremely unjuſt to theſe little Ones, your own Fleſh and Blood, and for whom you feel and expreſs ſo much Tenderneſs, if as they grow up, you do not form your own Examples on the Models of Piety and Goodneſs, for their eaſy Obſervance and Imitation? Are you not aware, that without this, neither your own, nor their Maſters Leſſons or Corrections can avail. Let therefore the Principles of Juſtice and natural Affection to your Children, engage you to lead holy and good Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:006754_0046_10298D6186B92160"/>
IF you have the Misfortune to live by wicked and bad Neighbours, as ſuch Perſons neceſſarily ſooner or later fall into Diſaſters and afflictive Circumſtances, theſe too will furniſh good Lectures to your Children and Dependants; Oh, what a mighty Advantage would it be to them, if every now and then you took Occaſion, from ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Calamity befalling any one who lived in the notorious Neglect of Goodneſs and Virtue, or in the open Practice of Vice, to ſet forth to your Families in a plain and affecting Manner, the certain Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the ſad Event and the wicked Man's Way of Living, and this not with too much Strictneſs and Formality, but in the Way of Converſation and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſcourſe, and at a Time when you find your Children and Servants in a fit and attentive Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It can ſcarce be believed what an Effect thoſe little occaſional Hiſtories would have on the Minds of the Young. The Calamity being before their Eyes, and its Cauſes made evident, their Paſſions would be all in Motion, and their Memories vaſtly retentive: On their firſt being tempted to do an ill Thing, theſe ſad Conſequences would recur to them, and with their Shame and Modeſty, the natural Barrier of Youth, preſerve them from bad Courſes, till their own Judgment ſhould attain its Ripeneſs, and come with a pure and uncorrupted Force to their Advice and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>BUT excluſive of theſe Conſiderations reſpecting others, let us learn this Science of Living well from Motives reſpecting our own Happineſs. By being good in ourſelves, and uſeful to the World, we are in the proper Exerciſes of our rational Nature, our Affections then faſten on their proper Objects, and we gradually recover the Purity, and Dignity, and Excellency of our primitive Nature, made for the Practice of Benevolence and ſocial Virtue: We evidence the divine Original of our Souls, and even
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006754_0047_10298D630C352EE0"/>here taſte ſome of the choiceſt of the Joys of the Bleſſed above, ſo that our Tranſition from Earth to Heaven will be eaſy and natural. O bleſſed Science, which thus prepares and exalts us thro' divine Grace unto a State of Glory. To conclude:</p>
            <p>WHETHER there be Tongues, they ſhall ceaſe; whether there be Knowledge, it ſhall vaniſh away, but this Science of Living well, ſhall remain. Death indeed removes us from all further Uſe of human Knowledge, and the Exerciſe of human Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but it does not remove us from the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Goodneſs, it does not take away the Joys reſulting from the Poſſeſſion of Piety, Beneficence and Charity: So far from this, Death will mightily enlarge their Sphere of Action, preſent a much nobler World, where the Adepts in this Science in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing forth the tender Buds and Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomings of growing Virtue, will be enabled to bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, in their juſt Perfection, even in angelick Maturity. In ſhort, a good Man embraces Death as opening to him the happy Place where the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect are reaping the Rewards of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, even ſupreme and inconceivable Happineſs, <hi>ſuch as Eye bath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor bath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive;</hi> which that we may all receive, may GOD of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy grant, thro' the Merits of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: To whom, with the Holy Ghoſt, be the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IT is expected that every Scholar to be admitted into this School, be at leaſt able to pronounce and divide the Syllables in Reading, and to write a legible Hand. None to be receiv'd that are under <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <p>LET the firſt Claſs learn the <hi>Engliſh Grammar</hi> Rules, and at the ſame time let particular Care be taken to improve them in <hi>Orthography.</hi> Perhaps the latter is beſt done by <hi>Pairing</hi> the Scholars, two of thoſe neareſt equal in their Spelling to be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; let theſe ſtrive for Victory, each propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ten Words every Day to the other to be ſpelt. He that ſpells truly moſt of the other's Words, is Victor for that Day; he that is Victor moſt Days in a Month, to obtain a Prize, a pretty neat Book of ſome Kind uſeful in their future Studies. This Method fixes the Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words, and makes them good Spellers very early. 'Tis a Shame for a Man to be ſo ignorant of this little Art, in his own Language, as to be perpetually confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations; the Conſciouſneſs of which Defect, makes ſome Men, otherwiſe of good Learning and Underſtanding, averſe to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting even a common Letter.</p>

LET the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Claſs be ſhort, ſuch as <hi>Croxall</hi>'s Fables, and little Stories. In giving the Leſſon, let it be read to them; let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and let them con it over by themſelves before they are called to read to the Maſter, or Uſher; who is to take particular Care that they do not read too faſt, and that they duly obſerve the Stops and Pauſes. A Vocabulary of the moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difficult Words might be formed for their Uſe, with Explanations; and they might daily get a few of thoſe Words and Explanations by Heart, which would a little exerciſe their Memories; or at leaſt they might write a Number of them in a ſmall Book for the Purpoſe, which would help to fix the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Words in their Minds, and at the ſame Time furniſh every one with a little Dictionary for his future Uſe.</p>

               <head>The Second <hi>CLASS</hi> to be taught</head>
               <p>READING with Attention, and with proper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulations of the Voice according to the Sentiments and Subject.</p>
               <p>SOME ſhort Pieces, not exceeding the Length of a <hi>Spectator,</hi> to be given this Claſs as Leſſons (and ſome of the eaſier <hi>Spectators</hi> would be very ſuitable for the Purpoſe.) Theſe Leſſons might be given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Night as Taſks, the Scholars to ſtudy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Morning. Let it then be required of them to give an Account, firſt of the Parts of Speech, and Conſtruction of one or two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; this will oblige them to recur frequently to their Grammar, and fix its principal Rules in their Memory. Next of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Writer, or the <hi>Scope</hi> of the Piece; the Meaning of each Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and of every uncommon Word. This would early acquaint them with the Meaning and Force of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006754_0057_10298D86A22F6B48"/>Words, and give them that moſt neceſſary Habit, of Reading with Attention.</p>
               <p>THE Maſter then to read the Piece with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Modulations of Voice, due Emphaſis, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Action, where Action is required; and put the Youth on imitating his Manner.</p>
               <p>WHERE the Author has us'd an Expreſſion not the beſt, let it be pointed out; and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth.</p>
               <p>LET the Leſions for Reading be varied, that the Youth may be made acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Proſe and Verſe, and the proper Manner of reading each Kind. Sometimes a well told Story, a Piece of a Sermon, a General's Speech to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a Speech in a Tragedy, ſome Part of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, an Ode, a Satyr, a Letter, Blank Verſe, Hudibraſtick, Heroic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let ſuch Leſſons for Reading be choſen, as contain ſome uſeful Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Underſtandings or Morals of the Youth, may at the ſame Time be improv'd.</p>
               <p>IT is requir'd that they ſhould firſt ſtudy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Leſſons, before they are put upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them properly, to which End each Boy ſhould have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dictionary to help him over Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. When our Boys read <hi>Engliſh</hi> to us, we are apt to imagine <hi>they</hi> underſtand what <hi>they</hi> read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>we</hi> do, and becauſe 'tis their Mother Tongue. But they often read as Parrots ſpeak, knowing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing of the Meaning. And it is impoſſible a Reader ſhould give the due Modulation to his Voice, and pronounce properly, unleſs his Underſtanding goes before his Tongue, and makes him Maſter of the Sentiment. Accuſtoming Boys to read aloud what they do not firſt underſtand, is the Cauſe of thoſe even ſet Tones ſo common among Readers, which when they have once got a Habit of uſing, they find ſo difficult to correct: By which Means, among Fifty Readers we ſcarcely find a good One.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006754_0058_10298D8C4AA44228"/>For want of good Reading, Pieces publiſh'd with a View to influence the Minds of Men for their own or the publick Benefit, loſe Half their Force. Were there but one good Reader in a Neighbourhood, a publick Orator might be heard throughout a Nation with the ſame Advantages, and have the ſame Effect on his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as if they ſtood within the Reach of his Voice.</p>

            <div n="3" type="class">
               <head>The Third <hi>CLASS</hi> to be taught</head>
               <p>SPEAKING properly and gracefully, which is near of Kin to good Reading, and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth. Let the Scholars of this Claſs begin with learning the Elements of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric from ſome ſhort Syſtem, ſo as to be able to give an Account of the moſt uſual Tropes and Figures. Let all their bad Habits of Speaking, all Offences againſt good Grammar, all corrupt or foreign Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and all improper Phraſes, be pointed out to them. Short Speeches from the <hi>Roman</hi> or other Hiſtory, or from our <hi>Parliamentary Debates,</hi> might be got by heart, and deliver'd with the proper Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Speeches and Scenes in our beſt Tragedies and Comedies (avoiding every Thing that could injure the Morals of Youth) might likewiſe be got by Rote, and the Boys exercis'd in delivering or acting them; great Care being taken to form their Manner after the trueſt Models.</p>
               <p>FOR their farther Improvement, and a little to vary their Studies, let them now begin to read <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> after having got by Heart a ſhort Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology. They may begin with <hi>Rollin</hi>'s <hi>Antient and Roman Hiſtories,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at proper Hours as they go thro' the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Claſſes, with the beſt Hiſtories of our own Nation and Colonies. Let Emulation be excited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Boys by giving, Weekly, little Prizes, or other ſmall Encouragements to thoſe who are able
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006754_0059_10298246E4124C78"/>to give the beſt Account of what they have read, as to Times, Places, Names of Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will make them read with Attention, and imprint the Hiſtory well in their Memories. In remarking on the Hiſtory, the Maſter will have fine Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of inſtilling Inſtruction of various Kinds, and improving the Morals as well as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Youth.</p>
               <p>THE Natural and Mechanic Hiſtory contain'd in <hi>Spectacle de la Nature,</hi> might alſo be begun in this Claſs, and continued thro' the ſubſequent Claſſes by other Books of the ſame Kind: For next to the Knowledge of <hi>Duty,</hi> this Kind of Knowledge is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt uſeful, as well as the moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Merchant may thereby be enabled better to underſtand many Commodities in Trade; the Handicraftſman to improve his Buſineſs by new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Mixtures and Materials; and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures, or new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of improving Land, that may be ſet on foot greatly to the Advantage of a Country.</p>

               <p>COMPOSITION. Writing one's own Language well, is the next neceſſary Accompliſhment after good Speaking. 'Tis the Writing-Maſter's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take Care that the Boys make fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and place them ſtraight and even in the Lines: But to <hi>form their Stile,</hi> and even to take Care that the Stops and Capitals are properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is the Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſter. The Boys ſhould be put on Writing Letters to each other on any common Occurrences, and on various Subjects, imaginary Buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> containing little Stories, Accounts of their late Reading, what Parts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors pleaſe them, and why. Letters of Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of Compliment, of Requeſt, of Thanks, of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006754_0060_10298D96170AD1A8"/>Recommendation, of Admonition, of Conſolation, of Expoſtulation, Excuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe they ſhould be taught to expreſs themſelves clearly, conciſely, and naturally, without affected Words, or high-flown Phraſes. All their Letters to paſs through the Maſter's Hand, who is to point out the Faults, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Corrections, and commend what he finds right. Some of the beſt Letters publiſhed in our own Language, as Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s, thoſe of <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Friends, and ſome others, might be ſet before the Youth as Models, their Beauties point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and explained by the Maſter, the Letters themſelves tranſcrib'd by the Scholar.</p>
               <p>DR.

And as this Claſs continues the Reading of Hiſtory, let them now at proper Hours receive ſome farther Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Chronology, and in that Part of Geography (from the Mathematical Maſter) which is neceſſary to underſtand the Maps and Globes. They ſhould alſo be acquainted with the modern Names of the Places they find mention'd in antient Writers. The Exerciſes of good Reading and proper Speaking ſtill continued at ſuitable Times.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006754_0061_10298D97DA301618"/>under the Maſter's Eye, who will point out their Faults, and put the Writer on correcting them. Where the Judgment is not ripe enough for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Eſſays, let the Sentiments of a <hi>Spectator</hi> be given, and requir'd to be cloath'd in a Scholar's own Words; or the Circumſtances of ſome good Story, the Scholar to find Expreſſion.
