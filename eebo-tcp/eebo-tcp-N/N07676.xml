            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the late Inſurrection was quelled, it was hoped that unanimity and concord would again have taken place among the good People of this Province: And as the lenity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſo great as to pardon the Offenders, it was expected that not even their abettors would again attempt to rekindle the coals of ſtrife and jealouſy in the breaſts of the raſh and inconſiderate.</p>
            <p>But unhappily for Pennſylvania, there ſeems to be ſome of its Inhabitants that are reſolved to leave no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned till they can hit upon the means that will force a laſting breach among their Fellow-Countrymen. In this Claſs of Men appears the Author of the Piece under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſideration; called <hi>The Quaker Unmaſk'd; or, Plain Truth.</hi> Which, as he aſſerts to be matter of fact, it may be expedient to canvaſs its pages, and ſee if it be the ſpirit of Truth that breathes through it, or a wilful Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: In the diſquiſition of which, we ſhall endeavour, as much as poſſible, to avoid railing, and only ſtick to the argument.</p>
            <p>The Unmaſker ſays, "He thinks it a Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every good ſubject to make diligent ſearch, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find out the aggreſſors, and then to inform the Public how he has found matters".—Let us ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent he proſecutes this deſign: Firſt then, without give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt proof of it, he roundly aſſerts, that "Theſe Incendiaries (the Quakers) have wrote and publiſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inflamatory Pamphlets with a deſign to enrage the Populace". Surely, our Unmaſker never could have made "diligent Search", or he would not have begun with ſo great a miſtake; the Quakers Addreſs to the Governor being the ſole Piece they have publiſhed, vindicating
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009805_0003_0F7A55032B0E56C0"/>
themſelves from the invidious reflections of the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How unfair does this Unmaſker proceed in the next paragraph, "The Savage Indian Butchers—whoſe cauſe and intereſt Quakers ſo warmly eſpouſe". Do the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or any one elſe, eſpouſe the cauſe of ſuch? Did not ſeveral of the Rioters examine all the Indians at the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks that the City has protected? and didn't they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they knew not one of them? then how groundleſs is this Aſſertion!—</p>
            <p>Again, "Terrible! indeed beyond Deſcription, are the Cruelties daily practiſed by thoſe Savages on our Fellow-Subjects, while Priſoners amongſt them! But where are the Quakers who have taken up arms to defend them"? Defend who? — What, defend thoſe that are priſoners? — Have not the Quakers bore their burden of taxes equal with others? and what other way has any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part of the Province defended its Frontiers?</p>
            <p>The Unmaſker now opens a paragraph as angry as it is groſsly fallacious; "When the Indian incurſions laſt ſummer laid waſte a conſiderable part of our Frontier, how did theſe meek Quakers behave on ſo melancholy an occaſion; to their immortal Infamy be it known that they would not grant a ſingle farthing (as a Society) for the relief of their poor Fellow-Subjects". A great defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency appears here in his "diligent Search": The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (or Incendiaries, as he handſomely calls them) did make a Collection as a Society, but withheld it for a while, as there were generous Contributions ſent to the aſſiſtance of the Frontier-Inhabitants, by ſeveral other Societies in Town; thinking, that, when thoſe Monies had been nigh exhauſted, their Subſcriptions might be of greater uſe. Accordingly ſome Gentlemen of their Society (with whom the Money was depoſited) wrote ſeveral times to a Clergyman in one of the Frontier-Townſhips, deſiring him to take upon him the diſtribution of their Money, as he was beſt acquainted with the circumſtances of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009805_0004_0F7A5503EBF6F588"/>
about him;—and he as often refuſed: alledging that their aſſiſtance was not wanted.—This they did as a Society.— And at the ſame time many Individuals moſt freely opened their purſes, and joined in private Collections.—So that we ſee, this vehement outcry "of immortal Infamy" means nothing.—</p>
            <p>But, ſays the Unmaſker, "When their good Brethren the Indians (<hi>ſome</hi> of <hi>whom</hi> were <hi>well known</hi> by Officers now in this City, to have been in the battle againſt Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Bouquet, and others at the ſiege of Fort Pitt, during the ſummer) ſeemed in danger of receiving their <hi>Juſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, &amp;c. no toils are thought too great—to protect theſe <hi>Boſom-friends".</hi> The Officer who was charged with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew them, declared in divers public Companies that it was an abſolute falſehood, and that he had never uttered ſuch a thing. Is it likely that in the hurry and confuſion of a battle, or at the irregular ſiege of Fort Pitt, <note n="*" place="bottom">See 12th Page of <hi>Q—r U—'d.</hi>
               </note> "the red, blue, or any other colour painted" Indians ſeen there, ſhould be <hi>well known,</hi> when ſeen again in Philadelphia in their natural colour?—Or were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that that ſhould be the caſe, is it to be thought that thoſe Gentlemen Officers would not have informed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates of ſo eſſential a truth? On the contrary did they not all (the Officer in particular who was charged with ſaying be knew them) expreſs the greateſt abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the intended Maſſacre, and willingneſs (as well as the Citizens) to protect the Indians? But the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſker, we ſee, unmaſks himſelf with all his circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In the firſt page he ſays, "ſhall we attempt to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their killing Indians under the protection of the Government? By no means". But here we ſee he thinks it would have been <hi>"Juſt".</hi> And in the next paragraph he acknowledges "the Paxton People's coming down in a <hi>ſeemingly</hi> hoſtile manner, is <hi>juſtly</hi> to be condemned". What a ſtrange contradiction is here! But this will be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009805_0005_0F7A5504D2186E58"/>
always the caſe, when men under the Veil of Truth, endeavour to hide <hi>the bittereſt Rancour and Ill-will.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But let us further liſten to what is ſaid in behalf of the Rioters:—"They had long before," ſays their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, "ſent ſeveral Petitions to the Governor and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which, it's <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> have been concealed by ſome ill-deſigning perſons; his Honour never having received theſe Remonſtrances, — and they looked upon themſelves as neglected by the Government". Is it not ſurprizing that if theſe People had done ſo, they ſhould not have availed themſelves of ſo ſtrong a Plea in their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Remonſtrance? where not a word like it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And are thoſe that they ſent ſuch <hi>Petitions</hi> to (whom we may ſuppoſe their unqueſtionable Friends) ſo neglectful of their cauſe and intereſt, as to conceal ſuch important Papers? But this Writer has made ſo bold with Truth in ſeveral other places, that he has given us reaſon to doubt the verity of this aſſertion. But admitting that to be the caſe, why are the poor Quakers to be ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously reviled? Is it to be thought that <hi>they</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the Petitions, or bribed others to do it?</p>
            <p>In the next paragraph he owns, the Paxton People are "mad", but ſays it is owing to their "Oppreſſion". For, ſays he, "have not all Nations and Generations found it ſo? Nay, is not the happy and glorious <hi>Revolution,</hi> by which our Civil and Religious Rights, as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> were ſecured on their preſent footing, a <hi>ſtriking Inſtance</hi> of this Truth"? that is, were not the renowned <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Worthies,</hi> that aſſiſted in eſtabliſhing the bleſſed <hi>Revolution,</hi> "mad", like the Pr—ſt. enflamed Rioters of <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi> Noble compariſon! thrice puiſſant Advocate! — And how can the Quakers help their "madneſs" and "deſperation"? But here we have a Clue to the whole Scheme of Philopatrius, which accounts for the great zeal and warmth he has ſhewn on this occaſion; it is a <hi>Revolution</hi> then that he is hankering after, and prompts him, thus, by way of ſimile,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009805_0006_0F7A550566CA2D00"/>
openly to proſtitute one of the moſt auſpicious Events in the Britiſh Annals to his low and illiberal purpoſes. But let the Caballers have a care that they dont fare like the Dog in the Fable, and looſe the Subſtance by graſping at the Shadow.</p>
            <p>"What theſe People intended by their coming down <hi>armed",</hi> ſays he, "let themſelves declare". This is no bad inſtance of Philopatrius's modeſty, as we ſee he is aſhamed to mention their intention, for it would be too ridiculous to ſuppoſe he could feign ignorance of it ſo late in the day; more eſpecially as, he ſays, they ſent
"ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Petitions",
which not being mention'd in the Declaration, &amp;c. muſt be a piece of private intelligence which he was let into. But the ſtyle of both theſe Pieces is ſo wonderfully ſimilar, that it is more than poſſible the ſame Lucina uſhered them into the world.</p>
            <p>To elucidate this matter, let us ſee what reaſon the Citizens of Philadelphia (including the few armed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) had to put themſelves in a defenſive poſture: — News was brought to them of a great Number of armed Men being on their way towards the City; their deſign being, as they gave out, to kill all thoſe Indians (Friends of this Province) in the Barracks, Men, Women and Children, that were under the Protection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to force their way through all oppoſition, or die in the attempt; and likewiſe threatened what they would do to ſeveral of the Citizens. The Inhabitants therefore, (ſhocked at ſo inhuman and illegal a project) entered into an Aſſociation, at the requeſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, to ſtrengthen the hands of Magiſtracy, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the extravagant deſigns of the Rioters, few of whom were Freeholders or Men of Property, the majority of them being people the Caballers had in pay. But the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Philadelphia had no deſign to offer them the leaſt injury, unleſs they ſhould uſe violence; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears from the meaſures they entered into with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009805_0007_0F7A550627BB66E8"/>However, Philopatrius "<hi>only</hi> obſerves that their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour did them <hi>honour,</hi> as it ſhewed them to be <hi>brave, loyal,</hi> and <hi>diſcreet".</hi> I would aſk this Gentleman, in what Nation was it ever counted <hi>"brave",</hi> to deſire to attack a defenceleſs confin'd body of people, with a reſolution, in cool blood, to kill them all, Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? In what State or Government was it ever thought <hi>"loyal",</hi> to fly in the face of Authority, and trample down the Laws of their Country? In what Realm or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was it ever deemed <hi>"diſcreet",</hi> for a Man to come with a Petition in one hand, and a loaded Muſket in the other. The Unmaſker may think as he pleaſes, but I am ſure this is not PLAIN TRUTH.</p>
            <p>"They ſent in a Memorial", ſays this Writer, "to the Governor; letting his Honour know that by ſuch a time they would be at Germantown, and there halt till he was pleaſed to give them an anſwer". If they did ſend in their Petition before they came to Germantown, it was ſo far commendable, and ſpoke more in their favour than their preceding conduct. But it has been obſerved that it was by no means dictated in the petitory manner; a ſmall quotation will evince the truth of this remark, where, ſpeaking of killing the Indians in the Barracks, they ſay, "It is this we DESIGN, it is this we are RESOLVED to PROSECUTE".</p>
            <p>"Some of the People called Quakers", ſays the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſker, "ſaid that they had force ſufficient to kill the whole", and "it was better ſo, than condeſcend to treat with ſuch a Banditti". It is impoſſible in an anſwer of this kind to decide what "ſome of the People" might ſay. However, had any Quakers of note made ſuch a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, why did he not mention their names? Certainly, he does not want good-will enough to expoſe them. But as he only aſſerts it without proof, I muſt uſe the freedom of ſuſpending my aſſent.</p>
            <p>"Nevertheleſs", ſays he, "thoſe Gentlemen, who were more averſe to the ſhedding of the blood of their Fellow-Subjects,

than the meek, peaceful, inſpired Quakers, did prevail". Here we have another inſtance of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's fair and ingenuous way of arguing. Even admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (tho' with little reaſon) that ſome called Quakers might have been of that opinion, does it infer that the Quakers (i. e. the Society) approved of ſuch ſentiments. Let us reduce the ſenſe of this to the ſcholaſtick way of reaſoning, and ſee what a pretty ſyllogiſm it will make.</p>
            <p>If <hi>ſome</hi> called Quakers would have fought the Paxton People, had they come to Philadelphia, it means the <hi>meek, peaceful, inſpired</hi> Quakers would.</p>
            <p>But ſome <hi>called</hi> Quakers would have fought, had they come to Philadelphia;</p>
            <p>Ergò, the "<hi>meek, peaceful, inſpired</hi> Quakers wanted to ſhed the blood of their Fellow-Subjects."</p>
            <p>What a curious Logic is here! And yet this would be the Unmaſker's inference.</p>
            <p>"They were willing," ſays he, "to diſperſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their reſpective homes, which was accordingly agreed to". (Tho' by the by, it is conceived from an other reaſon than that alledged; to wit) "on proviſo they might have a fair hearing", "and they diſperſed without doing any <hi>Miſchief".</hi> Then their deſign was miſchievous? "They (the Paxton People) have charged the Quakers with groſs partiality to Indians, and their being unfit for Government, nay, aſcribe the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of their ſufferings to them ALONE". This is not ſo "glaring a Fact" neither, as the Unmaſker would make it out. That the Quakers have had more trouble, and been at more expence than any other Society in the Province, in endeavouring to bring the Indians over to the Engliſh Intereſt, ever ſince the commencement of laſt War, is a truth that all the impartial will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If they have not been ſo fortunate as to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deſign, and have ſhewn too much lenity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, would it not be more becoming an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, candid perſon, to attribute ſuch errors to a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009805_0009_0F7A5508B07AA500"/>
in judgment, rather than a deſign in the Quakers to have our bleeding Borders infeſted with the cruel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians of the Wilderneſs? Indeed our Frontier-Inhabitants have been ſtrangely deluded and abuſed concerning the character, that has been handed to them, of this People. "They do ſympathize" (moſt ſincerely) "with them", and unfeignedly "pity their diſtreſſes". But they have Enemies in Philadelphia, that are determined, if it lays in their power, to make the Frontier-Inhabitants ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly hate them. —The reſt of this paragraph contains ſome <hi>low</hi> invectives, quite foreign to PLAIN TRUTH, and are too <hi>mean</hi> to deſerve any further notice.</p>
            <p>"Let us next conſider Quakers with reſpect to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment"; ſays the Unmaſker, "Can it be conſiſtent that a Perſon who declares that his conſcience forbids him to take up Arms, ſhould be a Repreſentative for a warlike People? By no means: Neither is it an "<hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible abſurdity"</hi> that a man who communes with the Quakers may not make a good Repreſentative even "in time of war". You ſtare at this, Sir, as militating againſt itſelf; but let us examine, look into any Set of Chriſtians, and you may find ſome of its Members that don't agree in every Article of its Believe, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with that Society which they have been educated among. Nor is this, I conceive, at all prepoſterous or hypocritical. The Father inſtructs his Son in what he thinks is truth, and during the ſon's minority the father endeavours to implant his own opinions into the boſom of his child, but when the ſon arrives to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is his peculiar privilege to judge for himſelf; (and he is accountable to GOD only, the Author of his being, for his thoughts) and then, as men vary ſo much in their ſentiments, how common is it for people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from their primary inſtructions in ſome particulars, and yet hold in the main with the Chriſtian Syſtem in which they have been educated? nor was this ever thought duplicity, or counted a diſſembling part, by ſenſible
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009805_0010_0F7A5509438EB888"/>
and thinking men. Thus, we have had ſeveral inſtances, at divers times, of men who have been educated Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, (unexceptionable, moral men) who have thought it no Crime to defend their King and Country, their Laws and Immunities againſt the violence of a foreign, or domeſtic enemy. Non-reſiſtance, therefore, is not "a <hi>fundamental Principle"</hi> univerſal among Quakers. But if it is ſo "inexpreſſibly abſurd" for a Quaker to be an Aſſemblyman, why in the name of ſenſe are they not left out at the annual <hi>Elections?</hi> How few Quakers to Members of other Societies is there, in the Counties of Lancaſter and York! and yet we find Quaker Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblymen even in thoſe places: What can be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this? Is it that the people really think them the ſuitableſt men, or are their Conſtituents under an "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation"? as the Declaration civily expreſſes it.</p>
            <p>"Here", the Unmaſker "obſerves, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom the Quakers took up arms to <hi>deſtroy"</hi> (might not the Quakers, with equal juſtice, rejoin, the people that ſaid they'd ſcalp them) "were thoſe who preſerved them from feeling the <hi>Severities</hi> and <hi>Contrivances</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Cruelty?</hi> "'Tis owing", ſays he, "to the brave ſtand which theſe unrequited Voluntiers have made againſt the inroads of Savages, that the Quakers are now able to treat their Protectors with ſuch ingratitude." (Is that really the caſe then? God bleſs them for it! and may their King and Country amply reward them!)—Can the Unmaſker ſeriouſly think that the Paxton Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers expedition to the Great Iſland was the means of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia's not being laid waſte by Savages, and its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants butchered? If this is not his meaning "feeling the <hi>Severities</hi> and <hi>Contrivances</hi> of <hi>Indian Cruelty,"</hi> muſt be idle words. (That Expedition was unqueſtionably praiſe-worthy) but ſurely the Unmaſker muſt be dreaming, or only means this for a flouriſh. Were the Quakers the only people that armed on the late occaſion? Were there not Churchmen, <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> Roman Catholicks, &amp;c
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009805_0011_0F7A5509F24F68E8"/>
in ſhort did not all good and honeſt men approve of the oppoſition? But the Quakers muſt be made odious at any rate.</p>
            <p>"Behold the Meeting-Houſe", ſays he, "converted into a place of Arms". One of the days that the City was under arms happened to be Meeting-Day, and the Meeting-Houſe was opened at the uſual hour for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of its Members, but before they came, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Aſſociation had taken poſſeſſion of it to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves from the inclemency of the weather, it being a rainy day, and there remained till evening; from thence, he ſays, the Quakers have converted it into "a place of Arms".</p>
            <p>"Whilſt ſome of their <hi>Preachers</hi> are buſied in procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder and Shot, others are employed in refreſhing the ſpirit or their brave Soldiers with Wine and other Liquors." Amazing Falſehood! and is this his Addreſs to the Public of <hi>Plain Truth?</hi>—Deſpicable Scribbler! thus to violate the ſacred name of <hi>Truth</hi> with ſuch bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Fictions.</p>
            <p>The Unmaſker here gives way to his depraved fancy once more, and, to make uſe of a peculiar expreſſion of his, "ſaddles" the Quakers with a malicious invention of his own, inſtead of proving matters of fact; — wretched ſuccedaneum!— in which among other things, equally kind, he puts this into the mouth of a Quaker, "nay <hi>we ſecretly rejoice</hi> when we hear of <hi>whole Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> MURDERED and DESTROYED". Sure this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man's ſenſes muſt be ſteep'd in gall, and his heart daſh'd with wormwood, to utter ſuch deteſtable calumny.</p>
            <p>"But it may be asked", ſays the Unmaſker, "why all this <hi>Clamour</hi> againſt Quakers? ay! and with the greateſt reaſon! but Philopatrius ſeems to be ſenſible at laſt, that he is groſsly abuſing a Society of People, on little or no grounds. This Writer ſays, "to talk againſt Preſbyterians as ſuch, is the effect either of party-ſpirit, malice or nonſenſe." I agree with him with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009805_0012_0F7A550AAA822FD8"/>
all my heart; and think likewiſe that to talk againſt Quakers as ſuch, is equally the effect either of malice and party-ſpirit or nonſenſe. To confine virtue or vice to any particular ſect or ſet of men, ſhews little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in human nature and a moſt uncharitable narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit; human nature being all formed out of the ſame eſſence, and only diſperſed in different degrees to different men; every Society, therefore, has its knaves and honeſt men; and that the Quakers have their <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> of the later, with other Communities, I muſt in charity believe.</p>
            <p>In the next paragraph we have an obſervation of the father of Conſtantine the Great, that, "they who were falſe to their God, would never be true to their Prince." Which he ſeems to inſinuate is applicable to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; and that they are like "the Pagans, ready to embrace any religion indifferently", and of courſe ſhould be "diſcarded," and, "the Chriſtians", that is, Paxton people, "be employed, who firmly adhere to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion." I would not invidiouſly pervert any man's meaning, but I can put no other ſenſe on this paragraph.</p>
            <p>"Let us look round", ſays the Unmasker, "and ſee who are thoſe who enjoy the Places of Profit and Truſt in this Province; (<hi>a very few</hi> excepted) are they not Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers or Quakers <hi>Creatures?"</hi> are all thoſe Gentlemen then, of other Societies in the Province, (<hi>a very few</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) that bear public Offices, Quakers <hi>Creatures?</hi>— abuſive man!—to let his factious zeal carry him to ſuch lengths of vile defamation.</p>
            <p>"It has been argued", ſays he, "if the Indians are guilty let their accuſers appear, and not put them to death without a fair trial"? and doubtleſs a very up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and Chriſtian argument it is: but becauſe "it is a hard matter to prove Indians guilty,—that are not guilty—"put them to death without a fair trial."</p>
            <p>Again, "But it <hi>has been proved</hi> by <hi>a very circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Oath</hi> of a young man (who has ſince very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009805_0013_0F7A550B8F362A40"/>
diſappeared) that the Quakers, or Perſons who appeared to be ſuch, have convey'd off and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed theſe (Indians) that were moſt ſuſpected". It is ſaid in the Scriptures, that there be ſome men who will debaſe themſelves even to Hell: what a marvellous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of turpitude does this Writer here diſcover! and what a malignant heart muſt ſuch a man have! to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a moſt infamous Forgery, as—<hi>"a very circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Oath"?</hi> and to ſay the aſſertion <hi>"has been proved":</hi> a perjury that had been plotted with a deſign to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and vilify the King's Officers, (that had orders from the General to guard the Indians) and the Society of Quakers; the Perſon who took the qualification, having abſconded, and the Magiſtrate, who gave the Oath, being afterwards of opinion that he was perjur'd.</p>
            <p>I have now gone thro' the task I impoſed on myſelf; to wit, a diſcuſſion of "THE QUAKER UNMASK'D", or PLAIN TRUTH": and from what the Unmasker has ſaid, "I hope my Countrymen will coolly conſider", whether or no, in his "diligent Search after Aggreſſors", he has hit upon "PLAIN TRUTH"? and whether it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Quakers have ſhewn any favour to our <hi>Savage Enemies,</hi> or attempted to ſcreen one of them from Juſtice? and whether ſome Members of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's joining their Fellow-Citizens to protect the <hi>Innocent</hi> from the bloody violence of a deluded people can be called ſo? And laſtly, that this did not proceed from any prejudice to the diſtreſſed Frontier-Inhabitants, or the want of generous ſympathizing hearts, but from a noble regard to juſtice, and the preſervation of the Laws of their Country, is it not equally clear?</p>
            <p>And now, my Countrymen, if this is the caſe, and I believe all the impartial will acknowledge it is, what muſt we think of a Writer who without any provocation could thus attempt to blaſt the reputation of ſo large a Body of People, many of whom are valuable Members of Society? What muſt we think of a man who could
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009805_0014_0F7A550C42F49780"/>
treat his neighbour with ſuch ſcurrility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who could pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſuch baſe falſehoods, under the mask of truth? It ſurely could not ariſe from a zeal, as he pretended, "that Peace might again be reſtored among us?" No: Such a ſuppoſition would imply greater ſtupidity than belongs to his character. Let me ſpeak with boldneſs what reaſon and truth conſpire to dictate. We muſt than conclude that our <hi>Unmaſker</hi> had no other deſign but to vindicate the conduct of <hi>Rioters,</hi> and beſpatter as much as poſſible the name of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> no matter with how little juſtice or decency; to impoſe on the ignorant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the giddy, and to prolong the alienation (unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py circumſtance!) which has already taken place. Judge then, my Fellow-Countrymen, whether ſuch a man's opinion ſhould determine you in your choice of Repreſentatives?—</p>
            <p>But I haſten to conclude, in the ſentiment of a noble Lord, upon another occaſion; Whatever factions may ariſe, and however loud the Drummers of faction may ſound their noiſy alarms; however they may attempt to drown the voice of reaſon and truth by their clamour; let the <hi>Friends of Pennſylvania</hi> lay aſide the animoſities which have been raiſed and maintained by the wicked and by the weak; let them hold faſt their integrity, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with ſpirit the Cauſe of their Country and its Laws, and they will confirm the good, reclaim the bad, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the incorrigible, and Peace again ſhall be reſtored among us.</p>

               <p>"Our advices from the Frontiers of this Province, received by way of Expreſs on Thurſday laſt, and by the Albany Poſt on Saturday, are of as indubitable authority and credit, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract we gave in our laſt relating to the march of 200 Indians ſent out by Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> againſt the Indian village of Kaneſtio.—" Theſe advices are, that on the 2d inſtant, at night, Sir <hi>William</hi> received an Expreſs by an Indian and a white Man, from the above party, importing, "That on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 26th of February, they had reached the main branch of the river Suſquehanna, on their way weſtward, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived private advices, that a large body of Delawares, our Enemies, were at a ſmall diſtance, deſtined againſt ſome of our ſettlements; upon which intelligence our party immediately made all poſſible diſpatch to ſurprize them, which they happily effected, by ſurrounding them in their encampment at the dawn of day on the 27th. Their approach was ſo ſudden, that our Enemies could make no defence, and were made priſoners to the number of 41, with their Chief Capt.
