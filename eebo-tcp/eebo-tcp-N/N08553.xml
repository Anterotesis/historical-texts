            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>I<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. Epiſtle of St. PETER, v. 5.</hi>
                  </bibl> —And be cloathed with Humility, for GOD reſiſteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ST. <hi>Peter</hi> having given a ſtrict Charge to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Church, to be faithful in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their great and important Function, exhorts <hi>the Younger to ſubmit themſelves to the Elder;</hi> and adds, <hi>yea, all of you be ſubject one to another, and be cloathed with Humility.</hi>—Implying that Humility is a Virtue of ſuch large Extent and vaſt Importance, that it is not only a Duty incumbent upon the younger and lower Sort, with regard to thoſe that are their Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and Superiors; but even upon every one with Regard to every one; and ſhould ſo influence us in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010938_0004_0F852B879915E7D0"/>
all our Deportment, that it ſhould obviouſly appear in all our Language and Behaviour; ſo that, by a very appoſite and expreſſive Metaphor, we may be ſaid to be even <hi>cloathed</hi> with it; and he enforceth his Exhortation with this Reaſon, that <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>—Let us then from theſe Words conſider the Nature and Operations of Humility, and the Reaſons that ſhould induce us to the practice of it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, it conſiſts as St. Paul accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately defines it, in <hi>not thinking of ourſelves more highly than we ought to think;</hi> but <hi>in thinking ſoberly,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we really are, and what God hath given us to be; <hi>according to the Meaſure of Faith;</hi> i. e. in Proportion to the Talent God has committed to our Truſt; and this we ſhould do, <hi>without Partiality and without Hypocriſy.</hi> So that it conſiſts in thinking, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and acting with Regard to ourſelves, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing that concerns us, according to the Truth; and is therefore the Ground and Foundation of all other Virtues, and doth, in Effect, comprehend them all. For if we think ſeriouſly of ourſelves, as being what we really are, we ſhall be deeply ſenſible, that we are of ourſelves poor, blind, ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Creatures, and this will make us earneſtly deſirous of ſpiritual Knowledge, eſpecially of what concerns our beſt Good and Happineſs; and this will diſpoſe us to ſtudy the Holy Scriptures, which are the Word of God, and give an eager and ſtrong Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Divine Inſtructions, and embrace <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus in the Love of it;</hi> and <hi>like new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that we may
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010938_0005_0F852B8859ECEEB0"/>
grow thereby.</hi>—We ſhall moreover, be deeply ſenſible of our great Weakneſs, and extreme Impotence, and Inability to help ourſelves, being exceeding irreſolute and unſtable, and eaſily and frequently borne down by Temptations, into ſinful Compliances, and this will make us ſenſible how much we need the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Preſence and Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, and be frequently looking up to him, and crying earneſtly to him for his Help upon all Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if we are truly humble, and think rightly of ourſelves, as being what we really are, we ſhall have a mortifying Senſe of <hi>the Plague of our own Hearts;</hi> the Prevalence of Pride and Paſſion; of our baſe Luſts and corrupt Affections; and this will make us <hi>watch</hi> as well as <hi>pray that we enter not into Temptation,</hi> that they <hi>may not have Dominion over us;</hi> and whereinſoever we have been miſled by them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any wicked Practices; as in many, <hi>many Things we offend all;</hi> we ſhall have a deep and ſorrowful Senſe of the vaſt Load of Guilt that we have contracted, which will make us walk in deep Abaſement every Day, and we ſhall find no Reſt to the Sole of our Foot, 'til we turn about and amend, and obtain ſome good Hopes of Pardon and Reconciliation with God, on whoſe Favour (if we have any Senſe at all) we muſt be ſenſible that all our Happineſs, and all our Hopes intirely depend.—But then, alas! if we duly conſider, and rightly think of this Affair, what Hopes can we conceive of his Favour to ſuch guilty, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Wretches, merely from the Conſideration of his Goodneſs and Mercy, while at the ſame Time, we are in the Hands of his Juſtice, and actually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010938_0006_0F852B892545EE60"/>
the Sentence of Death for our paſt Rebellion, and there is nothing we can do for the future, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſo penitent and obedient we may propoſe to be, that can ever attone for what is paſt, or cancel the Debt we have contracted, or ſatisfy the divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, whoſe ſacred Laws we have outrageouſly violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whoſe moſt high Authority we have trampled under our Feet!</p>
            <p>What unſpeakable Comfort muſt it then be, under theſe abaſing Convictions, to hear, that God <hi>hath laid Help upon One, who is mighty to ſave,</hi> and that his own bleſſed Son hath <hi>taken upon himſelf the Iniquities of us all,</hi> and made an Attonement for our crying Sins, by the Sacrifice of himſelf? And with how much Gratitude and Devotion will a truly humble and contrite Senſe of our Sinfulneſs bring us to lie proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate at the Foot of Jeſus Chriſt, looking for Pardon and Mercy only thro' his all-ſufficient Merits and Mediation?</p>
            <p>Thus will true Humility diſpoſe us to give all the Glory to God's free Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, who alone hath redeemed us out of the Hands of Juſtice, and put us into a Capacity of obtaining Mercy; a deep Senſe of which muſt engage us with the moſt ardent Love and Gratitude to devote ourſelves to be his faithful and obedient Diſciples as long as we have a Being.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if we rightly think of ourſelves, and our Condition in this World, as being what it really is, we ſhall have, and conſtantly carry about us, a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and humbling Senſe of our Mortality and Miſery; of the many Sickneſſes and Infirmities, and the many
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010938_0007_0F852B89D81E7BF8"/>
Caſualties, Loſſes, Croſes, and Diſappointments to which we are daily and hourly expoſed—the great Uncertainty of our Lives and Health of our deareſt Friends and Relatives, and all our Enjoyments, and the Certainty of our Death to which we are every Moment liable.</p>
            <p>If we had a piercing Senſe of theſe Things, it would be ſufficient to take down all the Pride of our Hearts, all our Conceitedneſs and Self-ſufficiency, and all our towering Thoughts of ourſelves, and we ſhould have little Heart to pride ourſelves in fine Clothes, and gay Apparel, and running into every fooliſh extravagant Faſhion, that this ſilly Age is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually inventing, and we ſhould literally <hi>be cloathed with Humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>How would a humble Senſe of theſe Things wean us from this uncertain World, and theſe dying Bodies? How would it engage us to redeem the Time, and make the beſt of every Moment, ſince <hi>we know not what a Day may bring forth?</hi>—How would it engage us amidſt ſo much Uncertainty to make ſure of ſome Thing? And ſince we can be ſure of Nothing on this Side the Grave, how would it put us upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing that <hi>durable Riches and Righteouſneſs</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will ſtand us in Stead, when this vain Word, with all its empty Toys ſhall be at an End with us? We ſhould then conſider the Intereſts of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, which are truly Ourſelves, and the Cauſe of Chriſt, which is Truth and Righteouſneſs, to be of infinitely more Weight and Importance than any of the Gratifications of our bodily Appetites, or any of the little Intereſts or Concerns of this vain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010938_0008_0F852B8A92FC2350"/>
and tranſitory World, and this would make us meek and patient under all its Frowns.—Such would be the Operations and Effects of true Humility, with Regard to ourſelves, if our Hearts were thoroughly ſeaſoned with it.</p>
            <p>Let us now go on and conſider how this bleſſed Temper of Humility would operate with Regard to God. If we truly knew ourſelves, and had moreover a juſt and piercing Senſe of his infinite Excellency, and inconceivable Greatneſs, Majeſty and Glory, and of our own Nothingneſs and Vileneſs; of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Purity and Holineſs, and of our own Polution and Sinfulneſs, and at the ſame Time were deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our intire Dependence upon him, ſo that we cannot ſubſiſt a Moment without him, and have <hi>no Sufficiency of ourſelves, ſo much as to think any Thing as of ourſelves,</hi> and of his infinite Fullneſs and All ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to all the Purpoſes of our Subſiſtance and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. I ſay, if we rightly conſidered what God is, and what we are, and how we ſtand related to him, and dependent upon him, how would it lay us proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate before Him, and make us Nothing in our own Eyes, and content and rejoice to acknowledge Him to be all in all? How would it aſtoniſh us to think, that ever we ſhould venture to contemn his moſt high Authority, and violate his moſt holy, his moſt righteous &amp; reaſonable Laws, and inſpire us with true Contrition for our paſt Offences, and a moſt filial and dutiful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Reſolution to be in all Things intirely devoted, to be conformed and obedient to him for the future, as far as poſſible? How would it fill us with Love and Gratitude to Him as our great Benefactor,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010938_0009_0F852B8B57EC38C8"/>
and our chief Good, and with Truſt and Dependence upon Him as our only Stay and Support? How would it make us contented with all his Allotments, and acquieſce in all his Diſpenſations, and be all Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Reſignation to his holy and bleſſed Will, both in his Commands and Providences, as well as patient under his Chaſtiſements? How careful ſhould we be not to do any Thing diſpleaſing to the pure Eyes of his Glory, or to harbour the leaſt Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Untowardneſs of Temper, or any Thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with our Duty to Him; but willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up <hi>every Imagination</hi> to be <hi>captivated to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Goſpel?</hi> we ſhould then take Care above all Things not only, <hi>to do juſtly and love Mercy, but to walk humbly with our God,</hi> and in all our <hi>Ways to acknowledge him,</hi> and confide in Him to <hi>direct us in all our Steps,</hi> and live in the daily exerciſe of Prayer and Praiſe, with the loweſt Proſtration of Soul, which would properly expreſs and exerciſe, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and cultivate this bleſſed Temper of Humility.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let us conſider how true Humility will operate with Regard to others, as well as to God and ourſelves. And as to this, if we truly know our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do <hi>not think of ourſelves more highly than we ought to think,</hi> we ſhall conſider all Men, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all Chriſtians, as our Brethren, as Children of the ſame common Parent, however low and mean they may be in outward Circumſtances; and this will diſpoſe us to look on every One with a Brother's Tenderneſs and Benevolence. We ſhall be ſo far from Haughtineſs and Superciliouſneſs, or deſpiſing any One for the Poverty or Meanneſs of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we ſhall rather pity and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010938_0010_0F852B8C130892E8"/>
him, and treat him with the greater Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Condeſcention, conſidering <hi>who it is that made us to differ,</hi> and <hi>what we have that we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> and do not hold from his diſtinguiſhing Bounty and Goodneſs, and that we have <hi>nothing to glory in, as though we received it not.</hi> And indeed there is nothing that betrays ſo much Ignorance both of God and ourſelves, nothing that diſcovers ſo much Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Baſeneſs and Narrowneſs of Spirit, as Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Carriage towards thoſe that are below us, and Contempt of the Ignorant and Needy, and of the Poor, the Friendleſs and Forlorn; as on the other Hand, true Humility is true Greatneſs of Spirit, there being nothing more God-like than a kind, condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Tenderneſs and Fellow-feeling with our poor Neighbours in all their Difficulties and Diſtreſſes, joined with a Readineſs to do all that we can for their Comfort and Relief. Hereby we alſo moſt reſemble Chriſt, when like him, we tenderly compaſſionate the moſt abject Miſery, and ſubmit to the loweſt Offices for the Sake of doing the greateſt Good. Let us therefore take his <hi>Yoke upon us, and learn of him to be meek and lowly of Heart as he was;</hi> and let <hi>the ſame Mind be in us which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who tho' <hi>he was in the Form of God,</hi> yet condeſcended to take <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Form of a Servant,</hi> in order to recover a loſt and undone World, and ſo far <hi>humbled himſelf as to become obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> that we might be reſcued from eternal Death, and live forever.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, a truly humble Spirit is ever a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and forgiving Spirit. Humility and Charity are truly Siſter-Graces, cloſely connected in the ſtricteſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010938_0011_0F852B8CDA197138"/>
Harmony and Friendſhip; ſo that where the one is, you are ſure to find the other. For, <hi>whence come Wars and Fightings,</hi> Quarrels and Contentions, but from our baſe Luſts and Paſſions; from Pride and Stubborneſs, and from an uncondeſcending Spirit? And did Men with true Humility and Contrition of Heart, conſider their own Guilt and Pollution, and duly reflect on their own many, great and heinous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt God, and in how great Need they ſtand of his Forgiveneſs, how ready and glad would they be to forgive and be reconciled one to another. Thus you ſee how Humility operates, and how many Ways it exerts and diſcovers itſelf, and that it is indeed the Ground and Foundation of Charity, and of all other Graces and Virtues, which derive from them both.</p>
            <p>And this alone would be Reaſon ſufficient, if there was nothing elſe, to induce us to cultivate it, which was to be the <hi>laſt</hi> Head of my Diſcourſe. For ſince all our Happineſs, and all our Hopes, in Time &amp; to all Eternity depend intirely, next to God, upon the uniform Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every Grace and Virtue, it muſt eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Humility as the Ground and Foundation of them all. But let us particularly conſider the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuggeſts in my Text, that <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi> The Proud, the Conceited and Self-ſufficient, as being the moſt unreaſonable and inconſiderate Set of Men, are God's peculiar Averſion; he <hi>beholdeth them afar off,</hi> as they do eſpecially bear the Image of the Devil, whoſe Pride occaſioned his Fall. And as Pride begun the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven, ſo it is Pride that hath carried it on upon Earth, ever ſince Man joined with the Devil in his Apoſtacy. For as Humility is the Root and enters
<pb facs="unknown:010938_0012_0F852B8F67235920"/>
into the Nature of every Virtue; ſo Pride is the Root, and its helliſh Nature operates in every Vice, and indeed renders all that are tainted with it utterly unqualified for the Grace and Favour of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Humble are his Delight: For thus ſaith the High and Lofty One who inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him alſo who is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite Ones.</hi> And <hi>to this Man will I look,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>even to him that is poor,</hi> or lowly in his own Eyes; <hi>to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit and who trembleth at my Word.</hi> Such a bleſſed Thing is Humility that ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly qualifieth us for the peculiar Favour and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Regards of Almighty God! and <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed ſuch is the amiable Nature of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that there is nothing like it to recommend us to the Favour and Eſteem, and the good Will and Friendſhip of all Men, as well as of God himſelf. The Man that is <hi>cloathed with Humility,</hi> diſcovering it ſelf in all his Words, Actions and Deportment, who can behold him and not love him and confide in him; Whereas the Proud, the Conceited and Vain, are ever contemptible, and deſpiſed and hated of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; none can endure them, or be eaſy in their Company, but every One ſhuns and avoids them. Juſt in Proportion as they extol or make a vain Shew of themſelves, they are deſpiſed and derided of others. And no Wonder, for they are conſidered (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are) as poor deluded Wretches. What a contemptible Character is that of <hi>Laodicea? Thou ſayeſt I am rich and increaſed in Goods, and ſtand in need of Nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</hi> contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="unknown:010938_0013_0F852B9054C6E4B8"/>
in the Sight of God, and even ſo in the Sight of Men; but God knoweth the Heart. So that if Men had no other View than their own Intereſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, they would abhor, and guard againſt Pride, and cultivate Humility; how much more if they had with all, any Concern to recommend themſelves to the Favor of God?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let us conſider the different and contrary Fates of them, the one and the other. <hi>Solomon,</hi> tells us, <hi>Pride goeth before Deſtruction, and a haughty Spirit before a Fall.</hi> This is what is often obſerved in this World, that by how much the more any have indulged this hateful Spirit, and made a vain Show of themſelves, by ſo much the nearer were they to ſome ſad Cataſtrophe; ſome fatal Downfal, which proved ſo much the more diſaſtrous and conſpicuous, by how much the higher they had got upon the Pinacle of Pride: But if they never fell before, they will have a moſt dreadful Downfal indeed, when they go off the Stage; having been <hi>lifted up to Heaven, they ſhall be brought down to Hell.</hi> On the other Hand, the ſame wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>before Honour is Humility.</hi> Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the ſureſt Way we can take to advance our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and our Advancement ſhall be the greater, by how much the more we abaſed ourſelves; for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſer than he hath aſſured us, That <hi>every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, but he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> Let us therefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be adviſed by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> every Day that we live, to <hi>humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in due Time:</hi> for in this Caſe, however depreſſed our Condition may be in this World, to the very laſt, we may depend upon it, that at length, from the loweſt State on Earth, God will exalt us to the tranſcendant Glories of Heaven.</p>

            <head>A SERMON on the Nature, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and Grounds of Charity.</head>
            <p>The following Diſcourſe was preached and printed at the Deſire of the FREE-MASONS at <hi>Stratford,</hi> on St. <hi>John's</hi> Day, <hi>June</hi> 24, 1767. And introduced with theſe Words, after the Text,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Friends and Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Obſerve from your Hiſtory and Conſtitutions, that you profeſs to be a Fraternity of Charity, as your great Aim. I cannot therefore do better than entertain you on that important Subject, which will teach you what it is to be Maſons indeed; to build up that glorious and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Building, the Chriſtian Church, which is the Body of Chriſt, (of which <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple was the Type) which Church of Chriſt, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us is <hi>built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone.</hi>

                  <hi>I<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. Epiſtle of St. PAUL to TIMOTHY, i. 5.</hi>
               </bibl> Now the End of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned.</q>
            <p>CHARITY is a Thing, in the full Extent of it, of that vaſt Importance, that it is neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in every Light, and to give the ſtrongeſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it in every View. I ſhall now conſider it, as the Aim and End of the Goſpel, and with Regard
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010938_0015_0F852B9153B3DE78"/>
to thoſe Principles in the Heart from whence its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Fruits and Emanations muſt flow.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle here tells <hi>Timothy</hi> that he had deſired him to take up his Reſidence at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> i. e. as the Biſhop of that Church (as all Antiquity witneſſeth) it being a City of large Extent and great Importance, that he might build on the Foundation he had laid; &amp; particularly that he might guard them againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of corrupt Teachers, and <hi>charge</hi> or denounce to them <hi>that they ſhould not teach any other Doctrine,</hi> than the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, which he had taught them; that they ſhould not turn aſide to endleſs Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies and Fables which were apt to create Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and Contentions, and ſo to occaſion Diviſions, and Separations, and ſo fruſtrate the very Intention of the Goſpel, which was to promote univerſal Love and Charity; for, ſays he, the very <hi>End</hi> of the Goſpel, and conſequently of the Charge <hi>Timothy</hi> was to give them, was <hi>Charity out of a pure Heart and a good Conſcience and Faith unfeigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Commandment</hi> then which the Apoſtle here means is the whole goſpel Diſpenſation, implying that entire Syſtem of Chriſtian Doctrine, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached during the two Years that he had reſided there, and which <hi>Timothy</hi> was to charge them to adhere to, and the <hi>End</hi> of this he tells us is <hi>Charity,</hi> and this is the ſame as to ſay, that Charity is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſtianity, for a Thing is then perfected, when its End or Intention is anſwered. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teacheth us that Chriſtianity without Charity is but an empty Name, and an unmeaning Thing. Hence it is, that he ſays in the 13th of the 1ſt to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>Tho' I have the Tongue of Men and Angels, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010938_0016_0F852B9BC052F260"/>
have not Charity, I am but as ſounding Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal, and though I have all Faith ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have not Charity, I am Nothing.</hi> Nay, ſays he, <hi>tho' I give all my Goods to feed the Poor, and</hi> even <hi>my Body to be burnt, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> It is therefore of the utmoſt Importance that we conſider carefully what this Charity really is, that he lays ſo much Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is plain from theſe Words, that it would be a miſerable Thing indeed to be deceived about it.</p>
            <p>Now it is plain from this Text, that the Apoſtle means ſomething more than <hi>giving our Goods to feed the Poor;</hi> nay, ſomething of greater Importance than preaching the Goſpel ever ſo eloquently; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of greater Weight and Worth, than even dying in the Cauſe of it, <hi>by giving our Bodies to be burnt;</hi> and ſomething that a Man may do all theſe Things, and yet be deſtitute of it. What then can it be? — I anſwer, it means an <hi>intire Habit of Benevolence, or good Will exerted, not in ſome few Inſtances only, however ſo ſplendid, but univerſally in all its Branches toward God and Man, and attended with all its bleſſed Fruits.</hi> It is not, now and then a few tranſient Acts, but it is a ſettled Habit or Frame of the Soul; a Soul that hath no other than an entire well-meaning, and is of ſuch a diſintereſted and unbiaſed Love and Good-Will, that it honeſtly aims at the Truth and Right of the Caſe in every Thing that it thinks, ſpeaks and does; a Soul that is intirely devoted, as far as human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can go, to be governed by that <hi>Wiſdom which is from above,</hi> which <hi>is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocriſy:</hi> ſo St. <hi>James</hi> deſcribe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010938_0017_0F852B9C7372E218"/>
it. It is not therefore ſo properly any particular Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as an habitual Temper or Frame of the Soul, from whence as from a Fountain, every Virtue flows; or a ſteady fixed Principle from whence every Thing that is truly pious, virtuous and amiable in Life per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually derives; <hi>Whatſoever Things are true; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Things are honeſt, whatſoever Things are juſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Things are pure, whatſoever Things are lovely, whatſoever Things are of good Report, if there be any Virtue, if there be any Praiſe;</hi> all theſe Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually flow from it, as their living and never failing Source. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes this moſt amiable Principle of <hi>Charity</hi> in the following moſt beautiful Manner; <hi>Charity ſuffereth long and is kind,</hi> ſays he. <hi>Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not itſelf; is not puffed up; doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own; is not eaſily provoked; thinketh no Evil; rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in Iniquity, but rejoiceth in the Truth: beareth all Things; believeth all Things; hopeth all Things; endureth all Things, and Charity never faileth.</hi> Such are the admirable and moſt delightful Properties of this divine Principle of Charity!</p>
            <p>But alas! if this be Charity, where is ſhe fled? where ſhall we ſeek to find her? Time was when ſhe dwelt on Earth, when Chriſtianity was in its greateſt Vigour and Purity, and in its primitive Glory and Simplicity. But if we look on the preſent Condition of Things, one would be apt to think, ſhe is long ſince fled to Heaven! She is hardly now to be found on Earth, unleſs in a few <hi>humble and holy Men of Heart.</hi> Certainly the very beſt of us are extremely deficient, and fall ſadly ſhort of coming up to this amiable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, wherein the true Beauty, and Glory of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity conſiſts. Were we but animated with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010938_0018_0F852B9C987E9D58"/>
Principle, as above deſcribed, we ſhould <hi>abhor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing that is evil, and cleave to every Thing that is good:</hi> we ſhould not only <hi>do juſtly,</hi> but <hi>love Mercy, and walk humbly with our God.</hi> — The leaſt Thing that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would put us upon, would be to do no Injury; to be intirely inoffenſive in all our Behaviour; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void every Thing that might any Way diſoblige one another, and much more whatſoever could be any Way hurtful to our Neighbours, whether in Soul, Body or Eſtate. I ſay theſe are the loweſt Offices of Charity. So far from all that is wrong, that we ſhould be very careful to ſay and do always what is right, juſt and honeſt, true and faithful. But ſtill Charity in all this would have got but a little Way. It not only <hi>does juſtly,</hi> but moreover, it <hi>loves Mercy:</hi> it delights in every Thing that is tender and friendly, kind and obliging, compaſſionate and merciful; and is ready to every good Office, whereby we may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves either amiable or uſeful to our Brethren, eſpecially ſuch as are in Neceſſity or Diſtreſs, and in every Thing that promotes the public Peace and Weal, and the Glory of God. Such are the bleſſed Fruits of Charity; for it looks on every One with a Brother's Eye, as ſtanding in a very near and tender Relation, as having all one heavenly Father, one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer, and one holy Sanctifier. Hence Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity riſes higher and embraceth the whole Family in Heaven and Earth, and from the Children it riſes yet higher and higher, and loves and delights in the great Father and Lord of all Things, as our chief and ſovereign Good, above every Thing in the World beſide, whoſe Intereſt is one and the ſame with that of all his Creatures, ſaying, <hi>Whom is there in Heaven but Thee, and there is nothing on Earth that I deſire in Compariſon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010938_0019_0F852B9F2FF279A0"/>
of Thee.</hi> Thus Charity riſeth from Earth to Heaven, from the Creature to the Creator, and devotes itſelf intirely to Him, who is all in all! And when it hath engaged us to be thus devoted without Reſerve to him, we at once fall proſtrate before him, and make it the grand Care and Buſineſs of our Lives to <hi>walk humbly with our God,</hi> in a lowly Senſe of our intire Dependence upon Him for all our Enjoyments, and all our Hopes; which will engage us to do all our Duties both towards God and Man, from a Senſe of Duty to Him, and a ſolicitous Concern to ſerve and pleaſe him in all that we do.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the vaſt Extent and Influence of this noble Principle of <hi>Charity,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in my Text, is the End of the Commandment; the End of the whole Syſtem of Chriſtianity, for <hi>Love,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> this <hi>Law of Grace.</hi> For this End, that we may be thus devoted to the Love of God and Man; this divine Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, both our ſingle and joint entire Dependence upon him our common heavenly Parent, and our Accountableneſs to him for all our Behaviour, <hi>who ſearcheth the Hearts, and trieth the Reins of the Children of Men.</hi> For this End it teacheth us a moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and myſterious Scene of Love in the Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to die a bitter Death that we might live forever; <hi>to be made Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> and <hi>when he was rich, to become poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made rich.</hi> And for this End it requireth us to rely on the heavenly Aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit; the Spirit of Love and Peace, (whoſe Aid it promiſeth to our ſincere Prayers and Endeavours) to inſpire us with this divine Principle, that we may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010938_0020_0F852B9FD45E1898"/>
               <hi>be followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us and given himſelf for us;</hi> and <hi>forgive one another as God for Chriſt's Sake forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</hi> For this End are we by our Baptiſm admitted into the Family of God, which is the Family of Love, and made his Children by Adoption and Grace, and thereby obliged to conſider all Chriſtians as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and Siſters, and to treat them accordingly, to be pitiful and courteous, kind and obliging in all our Deportment one towards another; to avoid all harſh Conſtructions, and to put the kindeſt Conſtructions we can upon what every One ſays and does. And for this End are we required once every Week to join together in the ſame public Worſhip, in paying our common Homage and Adoration as Children to our one common heavenly Father, <hi>lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath &amp; doubting,</hi> and to delight in his Worſhip &amp; Service: and as often as may be, to partake together at his holy Table, the common heavenly Banquet; the holy Feaſt of Love, where we have ſet before us a lively Repreſentation of the moſt aſtoniſhing Inſtance of Love that ever the Sun beheld, in the Death of Chriſt, who ſpilt his precious Blood alike for us all; than which ſurely nothing can be imagined more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to unite us to God, and to knit our Hearts together in the holy Bands of univerſal Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus you ſee how every Thing in Chriſtianity drives at this ſingle Point! So that it abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <hi>the End of the Commandment is indeed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and that, <hi>out of a pure Heart, and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Faith unfeigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Charity out of a <hi>pure Heart.</hi> From whence it is plain, that Charity muſt be ſeated and rooted in the Heart, for it is <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010938_0021_0F852BA0622A98E8"/>
the Mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and the Hands act. The <hi>Heart</hi> is the Fountain, by which is meant, according to the Nature of Scripture Language, a Principle of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Integrity, or an entire well-meaning, that aims at nothing but Truth and Right, and abhors all Diſguiſe and double Dealing, and diſdains all Deceit and Hypocriſy. <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart,</hi> is the Command of God to every One of us; for <hi>as a Man thinketh in his Heart, ſo is he:</hi> i. e. he is good or bad according to the real Intention and Diſpoſition of his Heart. Charity therefore is not to be eſtimated by ever ſo devout an Appearance, or ſo courteous a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage or fair Profeſſions; it conſiſteth <hi>not in Word and in Tongue only, but in Deed and in Truth:</hi> It muſt proceed out of a <hi>pure Heart,</hi> if it would be genuine; i. e. a Heart that is pure and free from any corrupt Mixture of Inſincerity or Ill-will. But this Phraſe, a <hi>pure Heart,</hi> does alſo imply a Heart free from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, unchaſte or debauched Tempers or baſe Luſts. True Charity is a holy Principle that abhors all <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and ſuperfluity of Naughtineſs.</hi> So that if we love our Neighbour ever ſo heartily, yet if at the ſame Time we aim at gratifying any baſe Luſt, or ſuffer any ſinful Diſpoſition or Deſign to harbour in our Breaſt, this will utterly deſtroy it, as being inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the very Nature of it. Would we then be poſſeſſed of this holy Principle, we muſt <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs</hi> both <hi>of Fleſh and Spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Holineſs in the Fear of God,</hi> and beg of God to <hi>create in us clean Hearts and renew in us right Spirits,</hi> that <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart,</hi> devoted to God, and all that is good, our <hi>Months may ſpeak,</hi> and our Hands act upon all Occaſions ſuch Things as are good, and well pleaſing in the Sight both of God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:010938_0022_0F852BA135871C18"/>For then would Charity alſo proceed from a <hi>good Conſcience;</hi> i. e. a Conſcience that is well inſtructed in the Knowledge of our Duty upon all Occaſions, and in all its Branches, and has a ſerious and conſcientious Concern to do it. This is the Account St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of his own Conduct, which ſpeaks him to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous above all Things, as we ſhould all be, <hi>to think and do always ſuch Things as be rightful.</hi> And <hi>herein,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do I exerciſe myſelf to have always a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Men.</hi> And <hi>this is our Rejoicing,</hi> ſays he again, <hi>the Teſtimony of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, not by fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World:</hi> than which Words, none can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed more appoſite to expreſs what he here means by ſuch a good Conſcience as muſt be the Foundation on which true Charity is built, and the Root from which alone it can ſpring. Vain therefore are all the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Charity, unleſs we <hi>live in all good Conſcience</hi> in the whole of our Conduct, unleſs we ſtudy ſincerely to know it in all its Branches and Exertions, and the Rules by which it muſt be regulated; and unleſs we honeſtly and diligently endeavour to frame the Temper of our Hearts, and the Conduct of our whole Lives, as exactly conformable to them, as ever we can.</p>
            <p>For laſtly this true Charity whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, muſt alſo ſpring from a Principle of <hi>Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,</hi> which is nearly connected with <hi>a pure Heart,</hi> and a <hi>good Conſcience;</hi> for it is <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>purifies the Heart and works by Love;</hi> the Principles of which, are of ſo pure and heavenly a Nature, as to be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with all Impurity and Inſincerity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they be unfeignedly believed and embraced, they will not fail to baniſh every filthy, polluted and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010938_0023_0F852BA1ECAA95E8"/>
ill-deſigning Imagination out of the Heart, and then the pure Love both of God and Man will of Courſe take Place. Moreover, theſe divine Principles of our moſt holy Faith are the Foundations of all thoſe Rules of Action with which a good Conſcience is informed, and the great Motives by which it is governed, in all the Exertions of Charity; ſo that where our <hi>Faith</hi> or Belief of the Principles of Chriſtianity is unfeigned, it cannot fail but true Charity will aſſuredly obtain; every Principle of Chriſtian Belief, implying in it a Rule or a Motive to Charity. Let us then unfeignedly and without any Doubt or Heſitation, and from the very Bottom of our Hearts, believe every Doctrine or Inſtruction which our bleſſed Lord hath taught us; for it will ever be found that our Charity will riſe or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, improve or abate, in exact Proportion to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Faith. But let it be alſo remember'd, that Faith many Times ſignifies an unfeigned Perſuaſion, concerning the Lawfulneſs and Goodneſs of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as the Truth of our Principles. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt make us always wary and conſiderate, and careful that we be never warped or biaſſed by any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or Partiality. And laſtly, as true ſaving <hi>Faith</hi> does always imply in it a practical Faithfulneſs to God and Chriſt, and to one another, in all our Deportment, it muſt therefore ever be our Reſolution in all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of Charity to act the truly faithful, honeſt, and upright Part, that ſo neither our Faith nor Charity may ever be reproved.</p>
            <p>Thus I have explained to you the amiable Nature and genuine Principles of true Chriſtian Charity, and ſhewn you how this is the <hi>End of the Commandment,</hi> &amp; the Perfection of Chriſtianity. Let it therefore be the great Concern of our Lives to prove ourſelves Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians

indeed, by abounding in all the Fruits of <hi>Charity, out of a pure Heart a good Conſcience and Faith unfeigned;</hi> for this is the bleſſed Diſpoſition that will in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it directly qualify us for Heaven, and make us <hi>meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> where nothing but Truth and Charity will for ever prevail. For <hi>now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity, theſe Three, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity;</hi> becauſe <hi>Charity never faileth,</hi> but will ſtill remain beyond the Grave, our Duty and Delight, our Perfection and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as long as Eternity itſelf ſhall endure! In Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, let us continually mortify and guard our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all thoſe baſe Luſts and untoward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which are ſo contrary to Charity, that this divine Principle may ever reign and prevail in our Hearts &amp; govern our Lives. And to our Endeavours, let us add our daily and earneſt Prayers (in the Words of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Church) to that <hi>God who hath taught us that all our Doings without Charity are nothing worth, that he would ſend his Holy Ghoſt, and pour into our Hearts this moſt excellent Gift of Charity, the very Bond of Peace and of all Virtues, without which, whoſoever liveth is counted dead before him; that being dead unto Sin, we may be alive unto God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> and ſo be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for that bleſſed World before us, where God and Truth and Charity ſhall forever reign: Which God our heavenly Father, of his infinite Mercy grant, thro' his free Grace and the Merits and Interceſſion of his bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt, and by the gracious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Influences of his holy Spirit. To which one eternal God, in Three Perſons, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all Honor and Glory, Dominion and Power, World without End. AMEN.</p>
