            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hurt of Souls, to the begetting in their Hearers a false Faith, and to the overthrowing the true Faith, where they can prevail; I hope it will be acceptable to this Auditory, to hear me give you a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Holy Scripture, which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>THE false Gospel which these false Teachers do teach to these Hearers is this, that <hi>the eight within every Man and Woman that comes into the World, that reproves some common sins, and instructs them in some common duties of general Piety towards God as Creator, and of common morality, of temperance, and justice &amp;c.</hi> among Men, is the Gospel yea the whole Gospel, and that there is nothing beside or beyond that; that is the Gospel. And this <hi>light within,</hi> every Man and Woman they say <hi>is sufficient to Salvation without any thing else,</hi> as some of their chief Authors affirm; and as others say, is a sufficient guide to Salvation, <hi>even without the Holy Scriptures,</hi> tho' they generally confess, that <hi>this light within them, without the Holy Scriptures teacheth them nothing of Christ</hi> without them, as he is both God and Man, as he was miraculously conceiv'd by the Holy Ghost in the Womb of the Virgin, and born of Her, as he suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead and buried, rose and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor indeed doth it teach them any one intire Article of the Apostles Creed, from whence it evidently appeareth that the whole Creed, and every one of the Articles of that Creed, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE utmost extent of their Gospel reaches no further, but to the Principles and Precepts of Natural Religion, and excludes all the peculiar Doctrines, Precepts, Promises and Threatnings which God delivered by Special Revelation to his Holy Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and which were by them committed to Writing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>* Note, that Natural Religion is so called from the subject Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which is the very nature of Man, whereas the Author of it, and principal Efficient is God, as truly as he is of Revealed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Example, It is a Principle of Natural Religion, that God is, and that he made the World, that he is True and Faithful, Good, Just and Wise, that he cannot deceive nor be deceived, that he is to be Loved, Feared, Worshipped and Praised by all Mankind; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001108_0007_0FB0430F249D17B8"/>
that Men should be just, sober and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck, and do to all Men, as they would have all Men do to them: And as Natural Religion dictates all this without the Lines of Holy Scripture, and without all special Revealation, so special Revelation given to the Prophets under the Old Testament, and enlarged to the Apostles under the New contains all this, and Christ himself did utter that Golden Rule, <hi>whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye the same to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> which in substance is also a Principle or Precept of <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT He did not say it is all which the Law and Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as necessary to be believed and practised in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and consqeuently neither that, nor all the other Principles, and Precepts of Natural Religion, are the whole contents of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nay, nor are they either the greatest or most excellent parts, but these are the most excellent parts of the Gospel, which deliver to us those most Sublime Doctrines, Precepts and Promises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods Love to us in Christ, and that High and Holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he has called us with unto Holyness and Righteousness, as the means, and eternal Life and Happiness as the end, which no Light of Natural Religion doth lead us unto, alone and by it self considered.</p>
            <p>AND though sincere obedience to all the Precepts of Natural Religion is most necessary to every Christian in order to Salvation, yet the peculiar Principles of Christianity, such as Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, doth afford us far more noble Motives to excite us to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as well as far greater inward Aids and Assistances: to wit, those of Gods special Grace, are given us through the Gospel; so that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of the Law writt in Stone given of God to the Jews, that it was weak and could not make perfect; the same may be said of Natural Religion, and the Laws and Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, commonly called the Law of Nature, whereof Nature i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>NOW without the doctrin of the Holy Trinity, how can we understand that Saying of our Blessed Saviour? That God so loved the World, that he gave his only beloved Son, that whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life <hi>John</hi> 1 16.</p>
            <p>And as God the Father gave us his dear Son to die for us, so as the Scripture testifieth. Jesus Christ the Son gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, <hi>Titus</hi> 2 14. He died for our Sins, that we might die to Sin, and live to him who died for us. He suffer'd most grievous pains and dolours both of Body and Soul to expiate our Sins, and reconcile us to God. And though his bodily suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were great, yet the sufferings of his Soul were far greater, in so much that he said, his Soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, he poured forth his Soul unto death, yet his Soul did not die; but had his Soul been capable of death, the sufferings of his Soul were so great as might have slain it, but being immortal it could not die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>These are the great motives which the Gospel furnisheth us with, to constrain us to love God and Christ, and yield ready obedience to their Commands.</p>
            <p>Thus he who was God, equal and one in Essence with the Father became Man, and humbled himself to the shameful, painful and cursed Death of the Cross, to make us, the Sons of God. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Children were partakers of Flesh and Blood, he took part of the same (as well as a true reasonable Soul of Man) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not ashamed to call us Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sins for the fallen Angels, but for the Sins of the whole World, of Mankind, and had been there ever so many worlds, his Sacrifice had been sufficient for them all that descended of <hi>Adam.</hi> And tho' the Holy Angels than stood, had him not to propitiate for them, yet he is become their Head, and they own their standing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance to him who is their Head, Lord and King.</p>
            <p>BUT in Reverse to all this, those false Teachers, as they preach a false Notion of the Gospel, as if it were nothing but the <hi>light within them,</hi> as it dictates those common principles of Moral Piety, Justice and Temperance, so they teach a false Notion of Christ within, his being their Priest within, and offering himself a Sacrifice within them to appease the wrath of God, and because without shedding of blood as the Scripture saith, there is no remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins, they have a false Notion of Christs Blood shed within them, denying his Blood that was outwardly shed on the Tree of the Cross to be the Blood of the Covenant, for the remission of Sin, arguing that the Covenant is inward and Spiritual, and that So is the Blood of it; and because that Blood is called the Blood of God in Scripture, that therefore it was not the Blood of Christs Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but of Christ as he was God; affirming that the Blood is the Life, and the Life is the Light, and the Light is within.</p>

            <p>THIS I shall answer briefly, because it was his and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns instrumentally and ministerially, as it was Gods and Christs Gospel principally and chiefly, being the great Authors of it; even as the Doctrin which the Apostles preached, is called the Apostles Doctrin; and this affords us a worthy observation, that the Gospel
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001108_0012_0FB04313D4BCEDF0"/>
is not meer Power, or Spirit, or Light within, without all words or form of doctrin outwardly delivered by the ministry of Men, but it is a ministry of words by Men, as well as it has an inward mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Power, and of the Holy Ghost, that doth accompany it. It comes not to Men, in Power and in the Holy Ghost without words and doctrin, nor in word only, without the power of the Holy Ghost, where it is made instrumental to convert Sinners to God, but it comes both in words and power of the Holy Ghost to such who are converted by it, and though it work not irresistably, nor without Mens concurrance who are converted by it, yet it worketh so effectually, and also so gently and gradually, that it obtaineth its end, in all the Heirs of Salvation, that in due time, it works a through Conversion in them and upon them; though the begining of the work of conversion be as a seed, the least of all seeds, yet it takes Root in the good Ground, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">III. To the Third, how and after what way and manner, and by what helps, the Gospel wrought Conversion upon those <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians,</hi> and daily works the conversion of Sinners to whom it is preached, and who are converted by it.</p>
            <p>TO this I answer,, tho' the doctrin of the Gospel has most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Reasons, and Arguments to move and perswade Sinners to turn to God by Faith, and Repentance, yet it is not effectual of and by it self, to turn any to God; but it is made effectual, as it comes to the Consciences and Hearts of Sinners in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, according to the words of the Text, <hi>our Gospel</hi> (said <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>came unto you not in word only; but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost,</hi> for unconverted persons are dead in Sins and Trespasses, are spiritually blind and deaf, and alltogether lame and impotent and under the power of Satan, and held in captivity to him as his slaves, therefore it must be a stronger power, than the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Satan that must convert a Sinner, and that is the mighty power of God, and of the Holy Ghost, to quicken the dead Soul, to open the Eyes of the Mind, and to unstop the Ears of the Soul and to heal the spiritual lameness and impotency of it.</p>
            <p>AND thus the Power of the Holy Ghost, which is also the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001108_0013_0FB0431423EA9868"/>
power of God the Father and of his Son, works by and with the Word, to wit the external Word; to illuminate the Understanding with a saving knowledge of the truths of the Gospel, working also conviction of Sin, and contrition of Heart for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in, and deep Humiliation and Repentance, and also the same power worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Will and Affections to turn them from the love of Sin, and Vice to the love of God and of Christ, and to all Holyness, Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness and Virtue, gradually destroying in them Sin and Vice, and planting and raising up in them all Christian Virtues and fruits of the Spirit, and all this gradually, as we are workers together with God, and by his help, for as it is God who worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure, so he commandeth us, from this noble encouragement, to work out our salvation, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Terms and Conditions of it) with fear and trembling: So that we must not be meerly passive in our Conversion, as so many Stocks and Stones, but as Reasonable Creatures, working together with him; and following after him as he gently leads and draws us.</p>
            <p>THE Power mentioned here in the Text, and which ordinarily wrought the Conversion of Sinners in the Apostles Days, was not altogether the Power of Miracles, but the sanctifying Power, and Grace of the Holy Ghost; whereby many were converted, who never saw a Miracle wrought, tho' they heard of that Miraculous Power; as we also have heard of it, from many more witnesses, to wit, the constant testimony of many thousands of all these past ages since the days of the Apostles, the bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Miracles never converted any, without the inward power of saving and sanctifying Grace, but the power of saving and sanctifying Grace hath convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many thousands, and still doth, without the power of Miracles. The Church of God hath been in all ages, and a Ministry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Power attending it, but the Church hath been o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>* Therefore those false Teachers, falsly charge the Church of <hi>England</hi> with denying all inward operations and inspirations of the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of the faithful, which are of a sanctifying nature; and thus by their Lyes and Falshoods those false Teachers have prevailed to draw away many Proseli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth own the inward sactifying Inspirations of the Holy Spirit, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of them, for our sanctification, and to enable us to perform all Christian Duties acceptably to God, is evident from the daily publick Prayers in the publick Offices, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
