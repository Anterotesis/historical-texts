            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To draw up a Regiment and form a Battalion.</head>
            <p>THE Companies being in the Field, let the Signal for marching be this; the front Rank of the Colonel's Company advance eight or ten paces and fire; upon which all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies inſtantly are to be upon the March, and fall into the Rear of the Colonel's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as their Poſts will be after the Battalion is formed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Major's Company falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rear of the Colonel's; the Company that carries two Spots or Balls in their Colours in the Rear of the Major's; all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that carry the even Spots in their Colours falling in immediately one after another; then the Companies whoſe Colours carry the odd Spots or Balls fall in beginning with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number; the Company carrying but one Ball falling in immediately before the Lieut. Colonel's Company, which Company brings up the Rear.</p>
            <p>They all March to the Ground on which the Battalion is to be formed: After which they are to keep their Facing till the Word is given to Form the Battalion, which is done by Wheeling
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003633_0003_100238A622173028"/>the Diviſions; but before this Word is given, and that they may be exact in performing the ſame obſerve to cloſe your Ranks of each Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cloſe order, then meaſure the length of your Ranks and the diſtance between your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and proportion the ſame.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the Battalions being Formed, the <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> muſt place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Right of their Captains, the <hi>Enſigns</hi> on their Left towards the Flanks of the Companies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Serjeants</hi> are to form themſelves in the Rear of the Rear Rank four paces diſtant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Drummers</hi> are to March thirty paces in the Front, when the Drum-major is to form them into a Rank entire oppoſite to the Center and Facing the Battalion, in which Poſition the whole is to remain till the Major orders the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to their Poſts.</p>

               <hi>OFFICERS</hi> Poſts in Review.</head>
            <p>THE Word of Command being given, <hi>Officers take your Poſts in Battalion.</hi> The eldeſt Captain is to place himſelf on the Right of the Battalion; the ſecond Captain on the Left, the third Captain on the Left of the eldeſt; and ſo it is with the Lieutenants according to the date of their Commiſſion to the Right and Left; the Enſigns with Colours they govern themſelves according to their Companies and not Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003633_0004_1002388E59EB25A8"/>all forming a Rank entire about two good paces before the Front Rank of Men, &amp; to divide the Ground equally between them ſo as to cover the Front of the Battalion. There muſt be a Serjeant placed on the Right and Left Flank of each Rank, who are to dreſs them as often as occaſion ſerves.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Serjeants continuing in the Rear are to Range themſelves about four paces from the Rear Rank of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drummers Poſt.</hi> The Drummers are to be divided into three Diviſions, the firſt upon the Right of the Colonel's Company, the ſecond on the left of the Lieutenant Colonel's Company, and both to dreſs in a Line with the Front Rank; the third diviſion of Drummers are to Poſt themſelves in the Rear of the Enſigns in the Center.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colonel</hi>'s <hi>Poſt.</hi> When the Battalion is drawn up, the Colonel's Poſt is in the Center, and about four paces before the Enſigns with Colours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lieutenant Colonel's Poſt.</hi> The Lieutenant Colonel's Poſt is a little to the Left of the Colonel's, and about three paces from the Rank of Officers. When there is no <hi>General</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, the <hi>Colonel</hi> does not take his Poſt at the Head of the Battalion, but remains in the Front without taking his Half Pike in his Hand, to give the <hi>Major</hi> the neceſſary Orders about the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, &amp;c. In this caſe, the <hi>Lieutenant Colonel</hi> is to Poſt himſelf at the Head of the Battalion with his Half Pike in his Hand: but if the <hi>Colonel</hi> is Abſent, He is then in every Article to Perſonate the <hi>Colonel,</hi> the ſole Command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003633_0005_1002388031EB2108"/>on Him. Immediately upon notice given that the <hi>General</hi> is a coming, the <hi>Major</hi> is to order the Soldiers to Shoulder their Arms, from which Poſition they are always to Reſt their Arms when the Compliment is to be paid, and as ſoon as He approaches near the Right Flank, the <hi>Major</hi> is to order the Soldiers to Reſt their Arms, by the following Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Front Preſent your Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the performing the laſt Motion of the above command, all the <hi>Drummers</hi> are to beat a March, and the <hi>Major</hi> is immediately <hi>to take his Poſt on the Right of the Battalion,</hi> and the <hi>Adjutant</hi> on <hi>the Left of the Battalion, dreſſing in a Line with the Rank of Officers.</hi> As the <hi>General</hi> paſſes along the Front, the <hi>Officers</hi> are <hi>to Salute</hi> Him with their Half Pikes or Partiſans, and to time it in ſuch a manner, that each may juſt finiſh his Salute and pull off his Hat, when the <hi>General</hi> comes oppoſite to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enſigns</hi> are to drop their Colours, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpear pretty near the Ground, juſt when the Colonel drops the point of his Half Pike, pulling off their Hats at the ſame time, and not to raiſe the Colours till the <hi>General</hi> has paſſed them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Adjutant</hi> being on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back are to Salute with their Swords, and when the <hi>Major</hi> has finiſhed his Salute, He is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair oppoſite to the Center of the Regiment, that he may be ready to order the Men to Face when the <hi>General</hi> goes round the Battalion. And when the <hi>General</hi> comes to either outward Angle, the Drums are to ceaſe Beating, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003633_0006_1002388202393AA8"/>the Major would not be heard when the Word was given for Facing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Serjeants</hi> in the Rear are to pull off their Hats without bowing their Heads when the <hi>General</hi> paſſes them, holding their Halberd in their Hand, as the Officers do their Half Pikes without bowing their Heads.</p>
            <p>When the Battalion is ordered to Face, the Officers, Serjeants and Drummers are to do the ſame: and all to remain at their Poſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going through the Battalion to the Rear, when the <hi>General</hi> paſſes along, or Salute Him any more than once ſtanding: Indeed there ſhould never be but two Salutes paid to the ſame Perſon in one Day, <hi>viz.</hi> a Standing and Marching one.</p>

               <hi>OFFICERS</hi> Poſts in Exerciſe.</head>
            <p>AS ſoon as the Ceremony of Viewing the Regiment is over, the General then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the Colonel what he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And the General for the moſt part orders the Manual Exerciſe to be performed; then to go thro' ſome part of the Firings, and laſtly to March by Him either in grand diviſion, ſub-diviſions or ſingle Company's.</p>
            <p>In time of Exerciſe, all the Commiſſion Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as alſo the Lieutenant Colonel's Poſt, is in the Rear of the Battalion, the Officers eight Paces in the Rear of the Serjeants, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003633_0007_100238854F419FD8"/>Colonel four paces behind them, the Serjeants on the Flanks are to March in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Line to the Front, and as ſoon as the two Serjeants who were placed on the Flanks of the Front Rank have Marched forty paces, they are to ſtand; on which the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants are to do the ſame: the Serjeants muſt take care to divide the Ground on the Flanks equally amongſt them The <hi>Drummers</hi> are to March and form themſelves into a Rank entire behind the Major. The method of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this is, in the following manner, firſt, The Major is to direct the orderly Drummer to beat a Ruff to give the Officers notice, after that a Flam or double Stroak upon which the Lieutenant Colonel, and the reſt of the Officers face to the Right about on their left Heels.</p>
            <p>At the ſecond Flam they are to advance their Half Pikes, and the Serjeants their Halberds. At the third Flam, the Officers, Serjeants, &amp; the three Diviſion of Drummers are all to March to their Poſts, beginning with the Left feet. The Officers are to March thro' the Battalions to their Poſts before mentioned and to ſtand: When the Major finds that all are in their proper Poſts of Exerciſe, he is to order to another Flam to be beat, at which the Officers and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their Left Heels.</p>
            <p>The Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels. The Serjeants on the Left Flank are to face to the Right on their Right Heels. As ſoon as they have faced the Officers are to plant their Half Pikes, the Enſigns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds on their Right, in which Poſition they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003633_0008_10023888DBD0D1B0"/>are to remain till they are ordered to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poſt after the Exerciſe is over. The Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are to have their Drums always braced and ſlung during the whole time the Battalion is under hands.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Exerciſe is over, the Officers, Serjeants and Drummers are to be ordered to their Poſts in the following manner: Firſt a ruff of Drum to warn them, then a Flam at which the Officers advance their Half Pikes, the Enſigns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds: After which the Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels, and the Serjeants on the Left are to face to the Right on their Left Heels: At the ſecond Flam they are all to March to their former Poſts, and as ſoon as they have got there the Major orders a third Flam to be beat, at which the Officers plant Half Pikes, and the Enſigns their Colours, and the Serjeants and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their right Heels: After which the Serjeants plant their Halberds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve,</hi> when the Officers are ordered to take their Poſts of Exerciſe which is in the Rear, the Colonel is not to go to the Rear, but to March ſtrait forward and place himſelf by the General, with his Half Pike in his Hand during the Exerciſe; and as ſoon as the Officers are ordered to the Front he is to take his Poſt. When the Command falls to the Major by the abſence of the Colonel or Lieut. Colonel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he is to take the Colonel's Poſt at the Head of the Regiment, and ſalute with his half Pike, yet when the Regiment is to perform the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe he is always to do it on Horſe-back,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003633_0009_1002388C0120C9B0"/>even the Command of a Regiment not being ſufficient to excuſe him from that part of his duty before a General.</p>
            <p>In the abſence of the Field Officers the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Captain takes the Command, and acts in every reſpect as the Colonel would have done were he preſent.</p>

               <hi>OFFICERS</hi> to your Platoons.</head>
            <p>IN dividing the Battalion into Platoons, they ſhould be compoſed of an equal number of Files, or at leaſt not above one File ſtronger than another, and thoſe ſhould be on the Flanks and Colour Platoons. As ſoon as the Platoons are told off there muſt be an Officer appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each to command them, taking an equal proportion of Captains and Lieutenants and Enſigns if any there be that carry half Pikes, for the purpoſe. The Lieut. Colonel with the remaining part of the Officers are to March and Poſt themſelves in the Rear of the Battalion, in the ſame manner as they do at Exerciſe; the Captain, Lieutenant &amp; Enſign with Half Pikes that have not Platoons drawing up into one Rank in the Rear of the Serjeants, and the Lieut Colonel in the Rear of the Officers, and oppoſite to the Colour Platoon. The Serjeants ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the ſeveral Platoons, and Poſted in the Rear of the ſame. The Colonel and the Enſigns with the Colours remain in their former Poſts at the head of the Battalion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003633_0010_10020208121F1D48"/>
There are many reaſons for there being ſome Officers Poſted in the Rear, I ſhall mention only two. They are of great Service in leading the Battalion off in order when they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retire. Again, ſhould there be no Officers in the Rear when the Battalion is ordered to the Right about, the Men would be apt to March off too faſt, and by that means break their Ranks, and fall into Confuſion, or not halt in due time; which inconveniencies are prevented by Officers being there.</p>
            <p>The Battalion being prepared to Fire by Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, the Officers that command them are to place themſelves to the Right and Left of their Platoons facing towards the Colours thus; the Officers to the Right of the Colours are to place themſelves to the Right of their Platoons, and the Officers to the Left on the Left of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, being only advanced a ſhort pace towards the Front Rank of Men.</p>

After they have Fired and Loaded then they are to return as they were, at the ſame time the <hi>Colonel</hi> Colours and Haut boys (if any there be) are to move to the Right and Left, and as ſoon as the Colour Platoons have Fired, are to return to their former Poſts; but when the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion Fires together, the Colours muſt then fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003633_0011_10023890C61B81D0"/>the Colour Platoon; ſuppoſing there be but two or three Colours to a Regiment, as is the caſe in the Regiments abroad; but ſince in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among us there is a Colour to each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for the ſame reaſon that in the Regiments abroad, when the Battalion Fires together, the Colours are to fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of the Colour Platoon; Why may not our Colours fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of the other Platoons, as well as the Colour Platoons?</p>
            <p>The laſt part of the Ceremony of Reviewing, is, that of Marching by the General, either by Grand diviſion, Sub diviſions, or ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's.</p>
            <p>When a Battalion is divided into three equal Parts each Diviſion is then called a Grand divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Sub-diviſions are ſormed by dividing each Grand-diviſion into three, four or five equal parts, according to the number of Files in each Grand diviſion, the Regiment being three deep, the Sub-diviſions then form Platoons.</p>
            <p>By Companies, is the Marching each Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by it ſelf, with its own Officers, Serjeants and Drummers.</p>
            <p>Before the Regiment Marches off, the Files are to be Cloſed either to the Right, Left or Center; after which the Ranks are to the Cloſed to cloſe order, and then ordered to Wheel by Grand or Sub diviſion.

The Field Officers are to March at the Head of their own Company's as Captains. The Staff Officers &amp; Hautboysal ways to March before the Colonel's Company. The Hatchet Men may fall into their Ranks or March before the Captains. After you have Marched to the Ground on which you intend to draw up and have actually ſo done, the Colonel gives Orders to lodge the Colours, and diſmiſs the Battalion; the Colours are Lodged in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner; but as it may not be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to give an account of the method obſerved in Regiments Abroad of bringing the Colours to the Regiment. I ſhall firſt give an account of that.</p>
            <p>The Officers having taken their Poſts in the Front of the Battalion, the Major is to order one of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers to beat the Drummer's Call, upon which the Enſigns who are to carry the Colours and the Drum major, with one half or two thirds of the Drummers are to repair to the Head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Granadiers, where the Drummers are to be formed into Ranks in the Rear of the Enſigns facing outward. A Lieutenant, two Serjeants and twenty four Granadiers are to March with the Enſigns and Guard, the Colours to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who are generally taken from the Left of the Company, and March with their Firelocks reſted on their left Arm and without fixing their Bayonets till they receive their Colours.</p>
            <p>The word of Command to the Granadiers are as follows, 1. Poiſe your Firelocks; Reſt your Firelocks on your left Arms. When this is done the Lieutenant places himſelf two paces before
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003633_0016_1002389BE36A73B8"/>the Enſigns and Marches to the Colonel's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or place where the Colours are lodged. The Drummers with the Drum major at their Head marching in the Rear of the Enſigns, beat the Throop, and the Granadiers four in Rank march immediately after the Drummers, one Serjeant marches on the Right Flank of the Guard and the other in the rear of the Rear Rank with their Halberds advanced. Note, on ſending for the Colours the Compliment then paid by the Battalion is that of Shoulder'd Arms; but when the Colours are brought to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are received with reſted Arms, and the Drummers who remain beat a March, which is the reaſon that one third of the Drummers at leaſt remain with the Battalion. The ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment is paid to the Colours when they are ſent from the Battalion; but when the Enſigns go for the Colours and return without them the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is only to be Shoulder'd. As ſoon as the Lieutenant comes to the place where the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are lodged, he is to draw up his Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment three deep, and then order the Granadiers to fix their Bayonets, as follows: Poiſe your Firelocks; Reſt on your Arms; Draw your Bayonets; Fix your Bayonets; Recover your Arms; Reſt your Firelocks on your left Arm. After theſe Motions are performed the Enſigns are to take the Colours, &amp; the Lieutenant marches back to the Battalion, in the ſame order that he came from it, the Enſigns carrying their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours advanced and letting them fly.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Lieutenant comes to the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, he muſt draw up his Detachment on the Right or Left Flank (according to which Flank
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003633_0017_1002389F05ED0B48"/>he comes to firſt) and halt his Men; but the Enſigns with the Colours followed with the Drummers are to move on till they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a little before the Officers of the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and then Wheel to the Right or Left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to the Flank they are on, and March along the Front of the Officers till they come to their Poſts in the Center, which they are to fall into. When the Enſigns fall into their Poſts, the Drum major is to Wheel the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to the Front and March them about ten paces forward, then Halt, and after he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to ceaſe Beating, he is to ſend them to their reſpective Poſts.</p>
            <p>When the Enſigns with the Colours, and the Drummers have wheeled inwards, in order to March to the Center, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to Face to the Right (if they are drawn on the Left of the Battalion) and march along the Ranks to their former ground; the Lieutenant with the Front Rank of Granadiers marching between the Officers and Front Rank of the Battalion; but if they are drawn up on the Right of the Granadier Company, he is then to face his Detachment to the Left and march it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Front of the Granadiers only, and as ſoon as they come on their former Ground, he is to order them to Halt and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to unfix the Bayonets.</p>
            <p>After this the Major is to order the Battalion to Shoulder their Arms. As ſoon as the Colours are ſent back, as the Military phraſe is, the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Call is to be beat at the Head of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers; on which the Enſigns with the Colours, and the Drum-major with the ſame number of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003633_0018_100238A09125FFD8"/>Drummers are to repair thither immediately, and draw up as before. The Lieutenant of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are to order the ſame Detachment, or an equal number of Granadiers to fix their Bayonets and reſt them on their left Arms; and as ſoon as the Major has ordered the Battalion to <hi>Preſent their Arms,</hi> he is to March back the Colours to the place where they are to be Lodged, the Drummers Beating the Troop as before. The Enſigns are to carry the Colours back in the ſame manner they brought them, that is, advanced and flying; and as ſoon as they arrive at the place, and the Detachment is drawn up, they are to furl their Colours and lodge them. When this is done, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to unfix and return their Bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and reſt their Firelocks on their left Arms; after which he is to March back in the ſame manner he carried the Colours to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, unleſs he is ordered to diſmiſs his Men as ſoon as the Colours are lodged; in which caſe when the Bayonets are returned in ſtead of preſenting, he is to order them to reſt their Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, then Club and diſmiſs them with the Ruff of a Drum.</p>

The two outward Platoons of Granadiers with their Officers, as alſo the two diviſion of Drummers on the Flanks, face to the Right and Left inwards.
