            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>With this String, I wipe the Sweat and Duſt out of your Eyes, that you may ſee your Brethren's Faces, and look chearful. With this String, I take all Bitterneſs out of your Breaſt, as well as every Thing diſagreeable that may have gathered there, in Order that you may ſpeak perfectly free and open to us. With this String, I gather the Blood, and take it away from the Council Seats, that your Cloaths may not be ſtained, nor your Minds any ways diſturbed.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> interpreted the Subſtance of this Speech, and ſaying, his Memory did not ſerve him to remember the ſeveral Ceremonies in Uſe on this Occaſion, he deſired <hi>Nichas,</hi> a <hi>Mohawk</hi> Chief, to do it for him; which he did; and all was afterwards interpreted by Captain <hi>Henry Montour,</hi> in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and the <hi>Delawares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a ſhort Pauſe, <hi>Tagaſhata,</hi> the <hi>Seneca</hi> Chief, roſe up, and repeating, as uſual, each Paragraph diſtinctly, as ſpoke by the Governor, he returned Thanks, and went through the ſame Ceremonies to the Governor, Council and People of the Province; adding on the laſt String, <q>That their Great-Grand-Fathers had told them, that they had made a Road for them to travel to their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that whenever it ſhould be ſtopped, they would become a poor People. They were very glad to find the Road open to their Brethren, and ſhould take Care to preſerve it ſo on their Side.</q>

               <p>After Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Weiſer</hi> had delivered this in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and it was interpreted in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, by <hi>Moſes Tetamy; Tagaſhata</hi> proceeded:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother</hi> ONAS,</p>
                  <p>By this Belt you ſent an Invitation to us to come to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which reached our Towns about the Time that the Leaves put out laſt Spring; but we were then ſo much alarmed by the <hi>French,</hi> who were near us, that we could not then leave our Country. Some little Time ago we received another Belt from Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> which he informed us was ſent to him by you, to be forwarded to us, to enquire into the Reaſons why we did not come to you, according to your firſt Invitation; and Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> deſired us to come here, to meet you in Council; upon which we immediately aroſe, and came as ſoon as we could, to your Council Fire, and now we are here, as you ſee.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Belts.</hi>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Here is another Belt by which we were invited lately to come to a Council Fire that was kindled in an Iſland near the Sea. This ſurprized us, as we never heard of a Council Fire in an Iſland. We know of no Council Fires, but the Old Council Fire at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and the Great Council Fire in <hi>Albany.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here he laid the Belt on the Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then taking four other Strings of Wampum, he ſaid, <q>Theſe were ſent by <hi>Nichas,</hi> the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Chief, with a Meſſage that he was arrived in this Province, and deſired we would comply with the Invitation and come down.</q> Here he laid the four Strings on the Table. <hi>Nichas</hi> having acknowledged the Meſſage, and taken up the Strings, <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> concluded, ſaying, <q>Theſe are your Belts, by which we were invited to come to this Council Fire; and as we are now come, we return them, and deſire to ſee the Belts that were ſent by us, particularly one, on which were ſeveral Images of Men holding each other by the Hand.</q>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008157_0006_102E3E9F102481E0"/>
The Governor replied, that he would enquire for the Belts ſent by them, and they ſhould be returned.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of theſe laſt Speeches of <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> was interpreted to <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and the <hi>Delawares.</hi>

               <p>Governor BERNARD ſignifying his Deſire to bid the Indians welcome, and juſt mention to them the Buſineſs he came upon, it was agreed he ſhould ſpeak firſt; which he did as follows.</p>

The Situation of the Province over which I preſide, and the Diſpoſition of it's People, have hitherto afforded very little Occaſion for Treaties with the neighbouring Indians; but having ſome Months ago ſent a Meſſage to the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> I received a Meſſage from our Brethren the <hi>Senecas</hi> and <hi>Cayugas,</hi> wherein they take upon them to anſwer my Meſſage to the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> and deſire that I would meet them at the Council Fire burning at this Place.</p>
                  <p>It is not uſual for the King's Governors to go out of their Provinces to attend Treaties; but I am glad to have an Opportunity of ſhewing my good Diſpoſition to eſtabliſh Peace and Friendſhip with my Neighbours, and therefore I have waved a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Forms, and am come here according to the Invitation I received at <hi>Burlington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To you therefore, our Brethren the <hi>Senecas</hi> and <hi>Cayugas,</hi> and your Nephews the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> I now ſpeak, and deſire that you would take into your moſt ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Meſſage to the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> your Meſſage to me, and my Anſwer thereto, and let me know what we are to expect from you.</p>
                  <p>What is paſt we are willing to forget; but I muſt remind you, that if you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be our Friends for the future, you ſhou'd give us that Proof of your Sincerity which I have deſired in my Anſwer to your Meſſage, and return us the Captives that have been taken out of our Province, and are now within your Power: This ſhould be one of the firſt Steps, and will be the beſt that can be taken towards reſtoring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that Brotherly Love and Friendſhip between us; which, I am convinced, will be for the mutual Benefit of all Parties.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This was interpreted in the Six Nations Language, by Mr. <hi>Weiſer,</hi> and in the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Stephen Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Schoolmaſter in <hi>Weſt Jerſey.</hi>

                  <p>I deſire all of you who are preſent will give Ear to me. As you, my Brethren, deſired me to call all the Nations who live back; I have done ſo. Now if you have any Thing to ſay to them, or they to you, you muſt ſit and talk together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſit by, only to hear and ſee what you ſay to one another; for I have ſaid what I have to ſay to the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> who ſits here; he knows what has paſſed between us. I have made known to him the Reaſon why I ſtruck him. Now, I and the Governor have made up theſe Differences between him and me; and I think we have done it as far as we can, for our future Peace.</p>

                  <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> then roſe up, and ſpoke,</p>

                  <p>IT has pleaſed the Moſt High, that we meet together here with chearful Countenances, and a good Deal of Satisfaction: And as publick Buſineſs requires great Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Day is almoſt ſpent, I chooſe to ſpeak early To-morrow Morning.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Governors anſwer'd, That they ſhould be glad to give all the Diſpatch poſſible to this good Work they were engaged in, and deſired the Chiefs would fix the Time of Meeting; but they declined it, ſaying, <q>They were unacquainted with Hours, but would give Notice when they were ready.</q>

                     <hi>Brethren, the Governors, and all the</hi> Engliſh,</p>
                  <p>I now confine myſelf to the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> my own Nation.</p>
                  <p>I will hide Nothing from you, becauſe we have promiſed to ſpeak to each other from the Bottom of our Hearts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> like a Thief in the Night, have ſtolen away ſome of our young Men, and miſled them; and they've been concerned in doing Miſchief againſt our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We did not know it when it happened, but we diſcover'd it ſince. The Chiefs of our Nation held their young Men faſt, and would not ſuffer them to go out of their Sight; but the <hi>French</hi> came and ſtole them away from us, and corrupted them to do Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: We are ſorry for it; we aſk Pardon for them, and hope you will forgive them: We promiſe they ſhall do ſo no more: And now, by this Belt, we take out of your Heads the Hatchet with which they ſtruck you.</p>

                  <p>I muſt firſt put you in Mind, that perfect Peace and Friendſhip ſubſiſted between you and your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Province, from our firſt Settlement among you, and that whatever little Diſputes happened between your People and Ours, they were amicably ſettled and adjuſted by our wiſe Men at our Council Fires, according to an Agreement made by our firſt Proptietor, WILLIAM PENN, and your Fathers. Had this wiſe Agreement been carefully obſerved, as it always ought to have been, our late unhappy Differences had never aroſe. But what is paſt cannot be recalled, and ſhall be forgotten. Let us both reſolve never to be guilty of the like Error for the Future.</p>

                  <p>We accept your Belts: We thank you for the Pains you have taken in enquiring of your Nephews into the true Cauſe why they ſtruck us.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the Hatchets are taken out of our Heads, and we are reconciled; we deſire, that your Nephews the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> will conceal nothing from you and us, that ever did, or now does, he heavy on their Minds, that the Intent of this Meeting may be anſwered; which was with your Aſſiſtance, to put Matters that have at any Time diſturbed their Minds, on ſuch a juſt and reaſonable Footing, that the Peace between us may never be interrupted, but continue firm to the remoteſt Ages.</p>

                  <p>This was a very friendly Part, and we flatter ourſelves they will hearken to you, as there are now Deputies here from thoſe Indians on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> with Meſſages to us, which will be delivered in Publick.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:008157_0011_102E3EAF4E3AB340"/>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there are a great many of you here who were not preſent at our former Meetings, I think it proper for your Information, to give you a ſhort Account of what has paſſed between your Nephews the <hi>Delawares</hi> and us.</p>
                  <p>About three Years ago, your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> living on the Borders of this Province were ſtruck on a Sudden, at a Time when they were in profound Peace with you and following their Buſineſs ſuſpecting no Danger: Many were killed, and others carried away Captive.</p>
                  <p>We were ſurprized and did not know who ſtruck us, but ſent Meſſengers up the <hi>Suſquebannab,</hi> as far as the Country of the United Nations, to enquire whence the Blow came and for what Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>On the Return of theſe Meſſengers, we were informed that the Hatchet had been ſtruck into our Heads by our Countrymen the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Time after this Diſcovery was made, a Ceſſation of Hoſtilities was brought about by the United Nations, at our Requeſt made to them for that Purpoſe by Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi>; and upon our Invitation, our Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> came down with a Number of <hi>Delawares</hi> and other Indians to a Council Fire kindled at this Place, where we have ſince had ſeveral Meetings.</p>
                  <p>At one of theſe Meetings <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> told us that the Cauſe of the War was, that their fooliſh young Men had been perſuaded by the falſe-hearted <hi>French</hi> King, to ſtrike their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and one Reaſon why the Blow came harder was that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of this Province had taken from them by Fraud, the Ground we now ſtand on, and all the Lands lying between <hi>Tobiccon Creek</hi> and <hi>Wyomink,</hi> on the River <hi>Suſquebannab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt all Blood was wiped away and buried under Ground; and Peace Belts were exchanged between us and our Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> who then told us, he acted in Behalf of ten Nations, and promiſed to bring in and reſtore to us all our fellow Subjects that had been carried off Priſoners by them. For the Truth of this ſhort Relation I refer you to our Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> who will confirm it to you more particularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>To continue our Friendſhip it is abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve Faith and keep the Promiſes we make with each other. I will ſpeak plainly to you and from the Bottom of my Heart, as one Friend ought to another, that Nothing may lie heavy on my Mind to diſturb me hereafter; and I expect the ſame Openneſs and Freedom on your Parts.</p>
                  <p>I deſire therefore to know the true Reaſon, why our Fleſh and Blood who are in Captivity and in your Power have not been delivered to us, according to the Promiſe made us by our Brother <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> in Behalf of all the Indians he repreſented; and what is become of thoſe Belts we gave him to confirm the Peace, and that Promiſe. For till that Promiſe is complied with, we can never ſleep in Quiet or reſt ſatisfy'd in the Friendſhip of thoſe who detain our Children and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>After the Governor had done ſpeaking, the United Nations, being eight in all, gave the uſual Cry of Approbation with great Solemnity, each Chief according to his Rank, crying <hi>Yoban</hi>; which was anſwered by all the Indians preſent, in a ſolemn, muſical and uniſonal Tone.</p>
               <p>Then Goveror BERNARD delivered the Belts requeſted by the <hi>Senecas, Cayugas</hi> and <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> and ſpoke as follows;</p>

                  <p>The Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> has given a particular Anſwer to what has been ſaid to us both. So far as his Anſwer relates to the Province over which I preſide, I confirm what has been ſaid by this Belt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>

Previous to what follows, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that <hi>Piſquetomen</hi> and another <hi>Ohio</hi> Indian having come to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> laſt Summer, acquainted the Governor, that the Indians in thoſe Parts had not received any Account of the late Tranſactions with this Government nor any Meſſage from it; nor had any Thing been done that they might be perſuaded to lay down the Hatchet. The Governor therefore took that Opportunity to ſend a friendly Meſſage to thoſe Indians by <hi>Piſquetomen,</hi> and appointed Mr. <hi>Frederick Poſt,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, to attend him and acquaint the Indians at <hi>Ohio,</hi> of the Peace made by the <hi>Suſquebannab, Delawares</hi> and other Indians, and the Diſpoſition of this Government to forgive what was paſt, if they wou'd return to their antient Alliance. This Meſſage was accordingly delivered, and an Anſwer returned by <hi>Frederick Poſt, Piſquetomen,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> an <hi>Ohio</hi> Indian, who having come down together as far as <hi>Harriſs</hi>'s Ferty, <hi>Frederick Poſt</hi> went to wait on General <hi>Forbes,</hi> and left the two Indians to proceed with the Meſſage; who being now arrived at <hi>Eaſton, Piſquetomen,</hi> who had the particular Charge of it, introduced it as follows.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>WHEN I was at <hi>Allegbeny,</hi> the Chief Men ſat together as we do here now. I was employed by the Governor, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and <hi>Iſrael Pemberton,</hi> theſe three Men, pointing to them: And the Chief Men told me, that when I ſhou'd come among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants, I muſt ſhake Hands for them with the Governor, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and <hi>Iſrael Pemberton</hi>; [Here he ſhook Hands with them] and that what they had to ſay, was written down in a Paper, which he then produced, and ſaid they deſired it might be read in Publick. Now, you Gentlemen, who are Head Men, ſent <hi>Frederick Poſt</hi> with me, deſiring me to take and carry him in my Boſom there, and when I came there, to introduce him to the publick Council. I did this, and have brought him back ſate to you again.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then taking a Belt and three Strings of Wampum, which were deliver'd with the Paper, he ſaid, he wou'd interpret them; but as all that was ſaid was truly ſet down in the Writing, it was not neceſſary. Let it be read. Then <hi>Piſquetomen</hi> delivered the Paper, with the Belt and three Strings of Wampum; and, on being aſked afterwards to whom they were ſent, anſwered, one was ſent to the Governor, another to <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> and another to <hi>Iſrael Pemberton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Meſſage was read in theſe Words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Indians ſpeak now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Hear what I have to ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> It is a good many Days ſince we have ſeen and heard of you from all Sorts of Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> This is the firſt Meſſage which we have ſeen and heard of you; we have not yet rightly heard of you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> You have talked of that Peace and Friendſhip which we had formerly with you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> We tell you to be ſtrong, and always remember that Friendſhip which we had formerly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> We deſire you wou'd be ſtrong, and let us once more hear of that good Friendſhip and Peace we had formerly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> We deſire you to make haſte, and let us ſoon hear of you again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gave a String.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Hear what I have to ſay; look <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſince we have ſeen and heard of you, of all Sorts of Nations, we ſee that you are forty that we have not that Friendſhip we formerly had.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> It is good that you have held that Friendſhip, which we had formerly amongſt our Fathers and Grand-fathers,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt tell you, we will not let that Friendſhip quite drop which was formerly between us. Now <hi>Brethren,</hi> it is Three Years ſince we dropt that Peace and Friendſhip which we formerly had with you. Now <hi>Brethren,</hi> that Friendſhip is dropt and lies buried in the Ground where you and I ſtand, in the Middle between us both. Now <hi>Brethren</hi> ſince I ſee you have digged up and revived that Friendſhip which was buried in the Ground, now you have it, hold it faſt. Do be ſtrong, <hi>Brethren,</hi> and exert yourſelves, that that Friendſhip may be well eſtabilſhed between us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> If you will be ſtrong, it is in your Power to finiſh that Peace and Freindſhip well. Now <hi>Brethren,</hi> we deſire you to be ſtrong, and eſtabliſh and make known to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> this Peace and Freindſhip, that it over all may be well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as you are of one Colour and one Nation in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> When you have made this Peace, which you have begun, known every where amongſt your Brethren, and have finiſhed and agreed every where together on this Peace and Friendſhip, then you will be pleaſed to ſend it to me at <hi>Allegheny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> When you have ſettled the Peace and Friendſhip and ſent it to me, I will ſend it to all the Nations of my Colour, when I receive of you the Anſwer, and have looked that every thing is well done, ſo that I can ſend it, and to all the Nations of my Colour; They will all join to it, and we all will hold it faſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> When all the Nations join in this Friendſhip, then the Day will begin to ſhine clear over us. When we once more hear of you and we join together, then the Day will be ſtill and no Wind or Storm will come over us to diſturb us.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Brethren,</hi> you know our Hearts, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join and what we have to ſay: Be ſtrong; if you do ſo, every Thing will be well, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Brethren,</hi> let the King of <hi>England</hi> know what our Minds is, as ſoon as poſſibly you can.</p>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE thought proper to meet you here to have ſome private Diſcourſe about our Nephew <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You all know, that he gives out, he is the Great Man and Chief of Ten Nations: This is his conſtant Diſcourſe. Now I, on Behalf of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> ſay, we do not know he is ſuch a great Man. If he is ſuch a great Man, we deſire to know who has made him ſo. Perhaps you have; and if this be the Caſe, tell us ſo. It may be the <hi>French</hi> have made him ſo. We want to enquire and know whence his Greatneſs aroſe,</p>

                  <hi>Tagaſhata,</hi> on the Behalf of the <hi>Senecas,</hi> ſpoke next.</p>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I, for my Nation, ſay the ſame that <hi>Nichas</hi> has ſaid; I need not repeat it. I ſay we do not know who has made <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> this Great Man over ten Nations; and I want to know who made him ſo.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſarandungas</hi> ſpoke next on Behalf of the <hi>Onondagas.</hi>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am here to repreſent the <hi>Onondagas,</hi> and I ſay for them, that I never heard before now, that <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was ſuch a Great Man, much leſs can I tell who made him ſo. No ſuch Thing was ever ſaid in our Towns, as that <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was ſuch a Great Man.</p>

                  <p>Take notice that I ſpeak in Behalf of five Nations, who have their Deputies here preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Oneidos, Cayugas, Tuſcaroras, Nanticokes</hi> and <hi>Conoys,</hi> who have joined together and now make one Nation, and <hi>Tuteloes.</hi> We five are all connected together, and if any Thing is ſaid to one of us, it is communicated to all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>On their Behalf I now tell you, we none of us know who has made <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſuch a great Man. Perhaps the <hi>French</hi> have, or perhaps you have, or ſome among you, as you have different Governments, and are different People. We for our Parts entirely diſown that he has any Authority over us, and deſire to know, from whence he derives his Authority</p>

                  <p>I ſpeak to you, on Behalf of the Nations juſt now mentioned. You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that you ſaid the other Day, you cou'd not be eaſy without your Priſoners were returned. We have conſidered this, and I now aſſure you, that they ſhall be returned.</p>
                  <p>We ſpeak from the Bottom of our Hearts; we will look carefully into all our Towns for them: You ſhall have them all; we will keep none. If there be any of them that have gone down our Throats, we will throw them up again. You told us a tender Father, Huſband, Wiſe, Brother or Siſter, cou'd not ſleep found, when they reflected that their Relations were Priſoners. We know it is ſo with us, and we will therefore uſe our Endeavours to make your Hearts eaſy, and we give you this Belt, as a Promiſe that we will perform our Words.</p>

                  <p>I ſpeak now in Behalf of my own Nation, and my two other Brethren, Deputies of the <hi>Senecas</hi> and <hi>Onondagas.</hi> We remember you deſired us to leave Nothing in our Hearts, but ſpeak open on every Matter, and you ſaid you wou'd do the ſame to us.</p>
                  <p>You told us that you cou'd not ſleep found whilſt your Priſoners were detained from you, nor cou'd you have any Confidence in the Friendſhip of thoſe who did detain them.</p>
                  <p>We of theſe Three Nations promiſe, that we will uſe our beſt Endeavours to make you eaſy. When we return, we will enquire of every Town for the Priſoners. We will call our Councils, and lay what you have ſaid before them, and make diligent Enquiry for them thro' all our Towns, and all that we can find you ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>If any of them are gone down our Throats, we will heave them up again.</p>

               <p>The Minutes of the preceding Conference were read, and approved.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>IN a Conference held with you Yeſterday, you told me, that we know your Nephew <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> gives out, that he is the great Man, and Chief of Ten Nations, and that this was his conſtant Diſcourſe; by this Belt therefore you denied him to be ſo great a Man, and deſired to know of me who made him ſo, or gave him any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over you.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I will anſwer you truly, and tell you in a few Words, all that I know of the Matter; I have already informed you, that after the <hi>Delawares</hi> had ſtruck us, you, our good Friends, the United Nations, adviſed them to ſit ſtill and do us no more Miſchief; and that ſoon after this, we invited the <hi>Delawares</hi> to meet us at a Council Fire kindled at this Place.</p>
                  <p>We received an Anſwer to our Meſſage from <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> as a Chief among the <hi>Delawares:</hi> At the Time appointed he came and told us that he repreſented ten Nations, amongſt which the United Nations were included; that he acted as a Chief Man for the <hi>Delawares,</hi> but only as a Meſſenger from the United Nations, who were his Uncles and Superiors, to whom he wou'd faithfully carry every Thing that ſhou'd be tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between us, that they might do as they ſaw Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>We believed what your Nephew told us; and therefore made him a Counſellor and Agent for us, and deſired him to publiſh to all Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> what we did at our Council Fires, and to let them know we were ſincerely diſpoſed to be at Peace with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can only ſpeak for myſelf, and do aſſure you, that I never made <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> this Great Man, nor ever pretended to give him any Authority over you; and I muſt do him the Juſtice to declare to you, that at our former publick Treaties, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> never aſſumed any ſuch Power, but on many Occaſions, when he ſpoke of you, called you his Uncles and Superiors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008157_0016_102E3EBA149C4E60"/>
I never ſhall attempt to nominate or impoſe a Chief on any Indian Tribe or Nation, but, on all Occaſions, will pay due Regard to thoſe who are choſen by their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>If any others have made <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſo great a Man, as to ſet himſelf above you, I am ſorry for it. It is more than I know; and they who have done it, muſt anſwer for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſhou'd be greatly concerned, that any Uneaſineſs ſhoud ariſe among you; and hope you will guard againſt it, and preſerve that Harmony which ought to ſubſiſt between Friends and Relations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Belt and String, you promiſed me, to make diligent Search in your Towns for our Fleſh and Blood, who are Priſoners among you, and return them to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have always found you honeſt and punctual in the Performance of your Promiſes; your Words therefore give me great Comfort, and fill all our Hearts with Pleaſure. We rely upon you, that no Time may be loſt in fulfilling an Engagement on which our Peace and Quiet ſo greatly depend.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren of all the confederated Nations,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS you propoſed your Queſtions concerning <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſeparately, I think it proper to give you a ſeparate Anſwer thereto.</p>
                  <p>I know not who made <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſo great a Man; nor do I know that he is any greater than a Chief of the <hi>Delaware</hi> Indians ſettled at <hi>Wyomink.</hi> The Title of King cou'd not be given him by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governor; for we know very well, that there is no ſuch Perſon among Indians, as what we call a King. And if we call him ſo we mean no more than a <hi>Sachem,</hi> or Chief. I obſerve in his Treaties which he has held with the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> [which I have peruſed ſince our laſt Meeting] that he ſays he was a Woman, till you made him a Man, by putting a Tomhawk in his Hand; and thro' all of thoſe Treaties, eſpecially in the laſt, held at this Town, he calls you his Uncles, and profeſſes that he is dependent on you; and I know not that any Thing has ſince happened to alter his Relation to you. I therefore conſider him to be ſtill your Nephew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am obliged to you for your kind Promiſes to return the Captives which have been taken from us. I hope you will not only do ſo, but will alſo engage ſuch of your Allies and Nephews, as have taken Captives from us, to do the ſame. That you may be mindful of this, I give you this Belt.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Governor had done ſpeaking, and their Anſwers were interpreted in the United Nations and <hi>Delaware</hi> Languages, the Indian Chiefs were asked if they had any Thing more to ſay. On which <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> aroſe, and made a Speech to his Couſins the <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Miniſink</hi> Indians, directing his Diſcourſe to <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nephews,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU may remember all that paſſed at this Council Fire. The Governors who ſit there have put you in Mind of what was agreed upon laſt Year: You both promiſed to return the Priſoners. We your Uncles, put you in Mind of this Promiſe, and deſire you will perform it: You have promiſed it, and muſt perform it. We your Uncles, have promiſed to return all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners among us, and therefore we expect that you our Couſins and Nephews will do the ſame. As ſoon as you come home, we deſire that you will ſearch carefully in your Towns for all the Priſoners among you that have been taken out of every Province, and cauſe them to be deliver'd up to your Brethren. You know that this is an Article of this Peace that was made between you and your Brethren: In Confirmation of which you received a large Peace Belt; of which Belt we deſire you will give an Account, and let us know what is become of it, and how far you have proceeded in it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:008157_0017_102E3EBF0B185500"/>
After this was interpreted in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, it was obſerved, that there were no <hi>Miniſink</hi> Indians preſent; the Governors therefore deſired, that Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Read</hi> would procure a Meeting of the Chiefs of the United Nations, <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> and cauſe the Speech of <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> to be interpreted to the <hi>Miniſinks</hi> in the Preſence of their Uncles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert White,</hi> the <hi>Nanticoke</hi> Chief, aroſe and ſaid, he was going to ſpeak in Behalf of Seven Nations, and directing his Diſcourſe to the Governors, he delivered himſelf in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language as follows,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is now more than two Years ſince we heard of our Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> taking up the Hatchet againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> At the firſt, Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the Head Nations, and when they received it, they ſent to us at <hi>Otſaningo</hi>; telling us, that as we lived cloſe by our Couſins, they deſired we wou'd invite them to meet at our Town, and accordingly we invited them, and they came to a great Meeting at our Town of <hi>Otſaningo.</hi> We then gave our Couſins a Belt of a Fathom long, and Twenty-five Rows in Breadth, and deſired them to lay down the Hatchet that they had taken up againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to be eaſy with them: And if they wou'd follow this Advice, we told them, that they wou'd live in Peace, untill their Heads were white with Age; otherwiſe, it might not be ſo with them.</p>
                  <p>Not hearing from our Couſins for ſome Time, what they did in Conſequence of this Belt, we ſent to them two other Belts, one of Sixteen and the other of Twelve Rows, deſiring them once more to be eaſy with their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not to ſtrike them any more: But ſtill we heard nothing from them: Indeed ſome Time afterwards we underſtood the <hi>Delawares</hi> ſhou'd ſay, that the Indians at <hi>Otſaningo</hi> had grey Eyes, and were like the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſhou'd be ſerved as <hi>Engliſhm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi>; and we thought we ſhou'd have had the Hatchet ſtruck into our Heads. We now want to know what is become of theſe Belts: May be they may be under Ground, or they have ſwallowed them down their Throats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our Couſins have been loath to give any Anſwer to theſe Belts, we now deſire they may let us know, in publick Conference, what they have done with them.</p>

               <head>At a Conference held at <hi>Eaſton</hi> the 18<hi>th October,</hi> 1758.</head>
               <p>PRESENT. The Governors, Council, Gentlemen and Indians, with the Interpreters: <hi>As aforeſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Peters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Read</hi> acquainted the Governors, <q>That at a Meeting of the Chiefs of the older and younger Nations, with the ſeveral Tribes of the <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Miniſink</hi> Indians, on Monday Night, the Speech of <hi>Tagaſhata,</hi> delivered that Morning in the publick Conference, reſpecting the giving up the Priſoners, was interpreted in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language by <hi>Stephen Calvin</hi>; and another Belt, on the Part of the Governors, being joined to <hi>Tagaſhata's</hi> Belt, they were both deliver'd to the <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Miniſink</hi> Chiefs, to enforce the ſubject Matter. When this was done, <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Miniſink</hi> Chief <hi>Egotchowen,</hi> ſaying, we were told by you, that you had delivered up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, and we believed you; but our Brethren have told us, that they were not delivered up, and therefore we earneſtly deſire that they may be made eaſy on this Article. You know; Couſins, that their Hearts will always be in Grief, till they ſee again their Fleſh and Blood: It is natural that they ſhou'd be ſo: It wou'd be ſo with us, if it was our Caſe. We deſire you will be <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008157_0018_102E3EC2ABE73260"/>extreamly careful to perform this Matter fully and ſoon. Let there be perfect Peace over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Country. And let it now be publiſhed, that we may all live in Peace, and with Satisfaction, now and for ever. I told you, <hi>Egotchowen,</hi> when you was in my Town, to bring with you the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, and that our Brethren wou'd expect it. I wiſh you had done it. But however, do it now with all Speed, and it will be well.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Egotchowen</hi> anſwered, It is true, <q>I was at my Uncles Fire, and I believe he deſired me to bring the Priſoners down; but I ſuppoſe it was not interpreted to me; for I did not underſtand it clearly; but I now underſtand it.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>That the <hi>Miniſink</hi> and <hi>Delaware</hi> Indians were deſired to collect all their Warriors together, and give them their Belts, and receive from them their Anſwer, it being neceſſary they ſhou'd concur heartily in whatever ſhou'd be concluded.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then <hi>Nichas,</hi> the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Chief acquainted the Governors, <q>That, as Counſellors, they had finiſhed, having Nothing to propoſe at this preſent Meeting. The Warriors were to ſpeak now, and <hi>Thomas King</hi> was appointed to deliver their Words;</q> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aroſe, and began <q>with an Exhortation as well to all concerned in publick Affairs, Governors and their Councils, and Indian Chiefs and their Councils as to the Warriors of all Nations, White People and Indians, deſiring all preſent to attend carefully to what was going to be related, as Matters of great Conſequence, which wou'd ſerve to regulate the Conduct of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> to each other. He added, that the Relation going to be made had taken a great deal of Trouble to put it into Order, and it was made on Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation given by the ſeveral Indians now preſent, who were acquainted with the Facts.</q>
               </p>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE the Warriors have waited ſome Time, in Hopes our Counſellors wou'd have taken this Matter in Hand; but as they have not done it, we have, at their Deſire, undertaken it, and they have approved of every Thing. I ſay, the Counſellors of the five younger Nations, as well as the three older Nations, have approved of what the Warriors are going to relate; and take Notice that the Speech is not only the Speech of all the Warriors of the elder and younger Nations, but of our Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Miniſinks.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>This was interpreted in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language; and <hi>Thomas King</hi> then proceeded, directing his Speech to the Governors, and all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the Continent.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU have been inquiſitive to know the Cauſe of this War; You have often enquired among us, but perhaps you did not find out the true Cauſe of the Bitterneſs of our Hearts, and may charge us wrongfully, and think that you were ſtruck without a Cauſe, by ſome of our own Warriors, and by our Couſins. But if you look a little about you, you will find, that you gave the firſt Offence. For in Time of profound Peace, ſome of the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> paſſing thro' <hi>South-Carolina</hi> to go to War with their Enemies, were taken up and put into Priſon. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> knew they were going to War, and that they uſed to do it every Year: And yet, after they had perſuaded them in a friendly Way into their Houſes, they were taken up, and put into Priſon; and one who was a head Man of that Nation loſt his Life, and the others were ſeverely uſed. This firſt raiſed Ill-will in the Minds of the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> and as the <hi>French</hi> came a little after this happened to ſettle on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> complained of it to them, and they made an artful Uſe of it, ſet them againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and gave them the Hatchet. Being reſolved on Revenge, they accepted it, and likewiſe ſpoke to their Grand-Fathers the <hi>Delawares,</hi> ſaying, Grand-Fathers, are not your Hearts ſore at our being uſed ſo ill, and at the Loſs of one of our Chiefs? Will not you join us in revenging his Death? So by Degrees our young Men were brought over to act againſt you. On ſearching Matters to the Bottom, you will find, that you in this Manner, gave the firſt Offence. This we thought proper to let you know: It may be of Service for the future. You

may be induced by this, to take better Care in conducting your Council-Buſineſs, ſo as to guard againſt theſe Breaches of Friendſhip, or as ſoon as they happen, in correſponding immediately with one another, and with the Indian Nations, who are in any wiſe concerned on ſuch Occaſion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the Caſe of the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> that I have juſt now related. Another of the like Nature has ſince happened to the <hi>Senecas,</hi> who have ſuffer'd in the ſame Manner.</p>
                  <p>About Three Years ago, eight <hi>Seneca</hi> Warriors were returning from War thro' <hi>Virginia,</hi> having ſeven Priſoners and Scalps with them. At a Place called <hi>Green Briar,</hi> they met with a Party of Soldiers, not leſs than one Hundred and Fifty, who kindly invited them to come to a certain Store, and ſaid they wou'd ſupply them with Proviſions: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they travelled two Days with them, in a friendly Manner; and when they came to the Houſe, they took their Arms from the <hi>Senecas</hi>: The head Man cried out, Here is Death, defend yourſelves as well as you can;?? which they did, and Two of them were killed on the Spot; and one, a young Boy, was taken Priſoner. This gave great Offence, and the more ſo, as it was upon their Warriors Road, and we were in perfect Peace with our Brethren. It provoked us to ſuch a Degree that we cou'd not get over it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have juſtly demanded your Priſoners; it is right; and we have given you an Anſwer: And therefore, as we think this young Boy is alive, and ſomewhere among you, we deſire you will enquire for him. If he be alive, return him; if you have ſwallow'd him down your Throats, which perhaps may be the Caſe, let us know it, and we will be content. His Name is <hi>Squiſſatego.</hi>
                  </p>

               <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have one Word more to mention of the ſame Nature, and which was the very Cauſe why the Indians at <hi>Ohio</hi> left you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we firſt heard of the <hi>French</hi> coming to <hi>Ohio,</hi> we immediately ſent Word to the Governors of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>; we deſired them to come, and likewiſe to ſupply us with ſuch Things as were proper for War, intending to defend our Lands, and hinder the <hi>French</hi> from taking the Poſſeſſion of them: But theſe Governors did not attend to our Meſſage; perhaps they thought there was no Foundation for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. The <hi>French,</hi> however came, and become our Neighbours; and you neither coming yourſelves, nor aſſiſting us with warlike Stores, our People of Neceſſity were obliged to trade with them for what we wanted, as your Traders had left the Country. The Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> took Care to ſettle on our Lands for his own Benefit; but when we wanted his Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>French,</hi> he diſregarded us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>

                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this Treaty you juſtly demanded to ſee your Fleſh and Blood. We have preſſed this on our Couſins the <hi>Miniſinks</hi>; and they by this String, deſired us to aſſure you, the Governors, that they wou'd make ſtrict Search in their Towns, and ſincerely comply with your Requeſt, and return all the Priſoners in their Power.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then directing his Diſcourſe to the Governor of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> he proceeded,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother, the Governor of</hi> Jerſey.</p>
                  <p>Our Couſins the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> tell us, they were wronged out of a great deal of Land, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettling ſo faſt, they were puſhed back, and cou'd not tell what Lands belonged to them. They ſay, if we have been drunk, tell us ſo: We may have forgot what we ſold; but we truſt to you, the Governor of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> to take our Cauſe in Hand, and ſee that we have Juſtice done us. We ſay, that we have here and there Tracts of Land, that have never been ſold. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild Creatures, and will not let us come on your Land to hunt after them. You will not <pb n="20" facs="unknown:008157_0020_102E3EC5B892B638"/>ſo much as let us peel a ſingle Tree: This is hard, and has given us great Offence. The Cattle you raiſe are your own, but thoſe which are wild, are ſtill ours, or ſhou'd be common to both; for when we ſold the Land, we did not propoſe to deprive ourſelves of hunting the wild Deer, or uſing a Stick of Wood when we ſhou'd have Occaſion. We deſire the Governor to take this Matter into his Care, and ſee that Juſtice be done in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two Strings of white Wampum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that has been ſaid has been of one Nature, that is of Matters that are Subjects of Diſpute; this that I am now going to ſpeak upon, is of another Nature.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then directing himſelf to the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> he ſaid:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>We muſt put you in Mind, that four Years ago, you bought at <hi>Albany,</hi> a large Tract of Land over <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> extending from the Mouth of <hi>John Penn</hi>'s Creek to the <hi>Ohio</hi>: The Proprietors Agents then paid One Thouſand Pieces of Eight for that Part which was ſettled by your People, that have been ſince driven off and killed. We acknowledge to have received Payment for thoſe Parts that were ſettled: But for the other Part that we have not received Payment for, that we reclaim. Our Warriors and Hunters, when they heard that we had ſold ſuch a large Tract, diſapproved our Conduct in Council; ſo now we acquaint you, that we are determined not to confirm any more than ſuch of the Lands as the Conſideration was paid for, and were then ſettled, though the others were included in the Deed; they are our hunting Grounds, and we deſire this Requeſt may be granted, and Notice taken, that it was made in open Conference.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three white Strings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas King</hi> ſat down.</p>
               <p>The Confederate Chiefs, being aſked if they had any Thing to ſay, anſwer'd, <q>That they had done; and having eaſed their Minds of all that lay heavy upon them, they wou'd return Home.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Governors promiſed attentively to conſider what was ſaid, and give them an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then aroſe and ſpoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>

                  <p>I SHOU'D have ſaid ſomething at the Time our Uncles laid before you their Grievances, or Cauſes of Complaint, in Behalf of my Countrymen, who lived near <hi>Goſhen.</hi> About three Years ago, nine of their People were killed at <hi>Goſhen,</hi> when they were in Peace. I will not take upon me to ſay, that the Land had never been ſold; but there was no Diſpute about this at that Time: I verily believe, that they killed thoſe nine Indians for no other Reaſon, than becauſe they were hunting on that Land. I ſpeak to all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when I mention this, as what was very wrong.</p>

                  <p>One of the <hi>Waping</hi> Tribes, or <hi>Goſhen</hi> Indians, tells me, that, as ſoon as thoſe nine Men were killed, he went with Three Belts and Tears in his Eyes, to <hi>George Vreeland,</hi> in order to have the Matter made up: But he never received any Anſwer to this Day, though he told him, he wou'd ſend the Belts to the Governor; and as ſoon as he ſhou'd receive his Anſwer, he wou'd ſend for him, and let him know. But he had never yet received any Anſwer.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>I give you this String, to enquire what became of the three Belts, and what Anſwer was made to them.</p>

                  <p>You may remember we made Peace laſt Year, and a Peace Belt was made a Fathom long, and of Fifteen Rows; Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi> was preſent, ſo were ſome of my Uncles, and the <hi>Miniſinks</hi>; they all ſaw it. You have aſked me, what is become of that Belt, and <pb n="21" facs="unknown:008157_0021_102E3EC840B51378"/>how far it went. I will tell you: I ſent it up the <hi>Suſquebannah</hi> to <hi>Diabogo</hi>; from thence it went to <hi>Aſſintzin</hi>; thence to <hi>Secaughkung.</hi> The chief Men there got together, to conſider what was beſt to be done with it: They all concluded, that it ſhou'd be ſent to our Uncle: He is a Man, and often told us, he ought to ſee Things firſt, and conſider what is to be done. The <hi>Senecas</hi> had the Belt firſt; and then all the United Nations afterwards; they had it almoſt a Year. Now it is come back, and is in <hi>Lapachpeton</hi>'s Hand, who is one of the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and lives at <hi>Secaughkung.</hi> How far the Peace Belt went, I don't know; but I ſuppoſe it went through all my Uncles: And I aſſure you, I will do as my Uncle does. He has promiſed you, he will deliver up all your Captives; and I aſſure you, I will do ſo, whereſoever I find them, in all my Towns. Four Tribes, <hi>now preſent,</hi> have agreed to this, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Delawares, Unamies, Mohiccons</hi> and <hi>Wapings,</hi> who are ſettled as far as <hi>Secaughkung,</hi> This Belt confirms my Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother, the Governor of</hi> Pennſylvania,</p>
                  <p>I did let you know formerly what my Grievance was. I told you, that from <hi>Tobiccon</hi> as far as the <hi>Delawares</hi> owned, the Proprietors had wronged me. Then you and I agreed, that it ſhould be laid before the King of <hi>England:</hi> For you ſaid he was our Father, and he ſhou'd ſee what were our Differences; for, as you and I cou'd not decide it, he ſhould do it. Let us not alter what you and I have agreed: And now, let me know, if King GEORGE has decided the Matter between you and me. I don't pretend to mention any of my Uncles Lands, I only mention what we, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> own as far as the Heads of <hi>Delaware.</hi> All the Lands lying on the Waters that fall into the <hi>Suſquebannah</hi> belong to our Uncles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then took up another Belt, deſigning to ſpeak to his Uncles the United Nations, but whilſt he was delivering the above, their Chiefs had one after another left the Council, ſeeming much diſpleaſed: He therefore declined ſpeaking it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Proprietors of this Province, have on all Occaſions manifeſted their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard for you: They prefer your Friendſhip and the publick Good to their own private Intereſt. Their former Conduct gives you no Room to doubt the Truth of this; what I am about to tell you is a further Confirmation of it: therefore give me your Attention, and liſten to what I ſhall ſay. You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that, at a Treaty you held with your good Friend Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> three Years ago, ſome of your wiſe Men told him, that there were ſome among them who were diſſatisfied with the Sale of the above Lands, made by them at <hi>Albany,</hi> and were deſirous that Part of it ſhould be reſerved for them; tho' the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had purchaſed it fairly of them, and paid One Thouſand Pieces of Eight; which was all they were to receive, till our People ſettled to the Weſtward of the <hi>Allegheny,</hi> or <hi>Apalachian</hi> Hills. Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> repreſented this Matter to the Proprietors, in your Behalf: Whereupon they chearfully agreed to releaſe to you all that Part of the Purchaſe you have reclaimed, and by a Letter of Attorney, empowered <hi>Richard Peters</hi> and <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> to execute a Deed to you for thoſe Lands, on your confirming to them the Reſidue of that Purchaſe. On this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therefore you will pleaſe to confer with them, and ſettle the Boundaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you, that they may releaſe the Lands to you accordingly, before you leave this Place, and ſet your Minds at Eaſe.</p>

                  <p>I have ſomething to ſay to you, which is of the utmoſt Importance to us all; it requires your particular Attention and Conſideration.

You know, Brethren, that there is an old Agreement between the Proprietors and you, that you will not ſell any of the Lands lying within this Province to any one but them; and they never take Poſſeſſion of Lands till they have bought them of the <hi>Indians.</hi> You know alſo, that the United Nations have ſold Lands to the Proprietors, which your Nephews the <hi>Delawares</hi> now claim as their Right. This is the Caſe with regard to ſome Part of the Lands lying between <hi>Tobiccon</hi> Creek and the Head of <hi>Delaware</hi> River, which <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> it your Hearing the Day before Yeſterday, ſaid the Proprietors had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded him of. The Proprietors are deſirous to do ſtrict Juſtice to all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but it cannot be ſuppoſed they can know in which of you the Right was veſted. It is a Matter that muſt be ſettled among yourſelves; till this is done, there will probably remain ſome Jealouſly and Diſcontent among you, that may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt both your and our future Quiet, which we ſhou'd guard againſt by all Means in our Power.</p>

And I am glad to hear from him, that you look friendly, and that there ſtill remain ſome Sparks of Love towards us. It is what we believed before-hand; and therefore we never let ſlip the Chain of Friendſhip, but held it faſt on our Side, and it has never dropt out of our Hands. By this Belt we deſire you will dig up your End of the Chain of Friendſhip, that you ſuffered, by the Subtlety of the <hi>French,</hi> to be buried.</p>

                  <p>It happened, that the Governor of <hi>Jerſey</hi> was with me and a great many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Brethren, ſitting in Council at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> when your Meſſengers arrived: And it gave Pleaſure to every one that heard it; and it will afford the ſame Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our neighbouring Governors, and their People, when they come to hear it. I ſhall ſend Meſſengers to them, and acquaint them with what you have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Your requeſting us, to let the King of <hi>England</hi> know your good Diſpoſitions, we took to Heart, and ſhall let him know it; and we will ſpeak in your Favour to his Majeſty, who has for ſome Time paſt, looked upon you as his loſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And we can aſſure you, that as a tender Father over all his Children, he will forgive what is paſt, and receive you again into his Arms.</p>

There is a clear and open Road for you; fear therefore Nothing, and come to us, with as many as can be of the <hi>Delawares, Shawaneſe,</hi> or of the Six Nation Indians. We will be glad to ſee you; we deſire all Tribes and Nations of Indians, who are in Alliance with you, may come. As ſoon as we hear of your coming, of which we deſire you will give us timely Notice, we will lay up Proviſions for you along the Road.</p>

                  <p>The Six Nation and <hi>Delaware</hi> Chiefs, join with me in thoſe Belts, which are tied together, to ſignify our Union and Friendſhip for each other; with them we jointly take the Tomhawk out of your Heads, and bury them under Ground.</p>
                  <p>We ſpeak loud, ſo as you may hear us; you ſee we all ſtand together joined Hand in Hand.</p>

They ſaid further, that as the <hi>French</hi> had many Indians fighting for them, and they by Intermarriages were related to the Indians who ſent the Meſſages, it could not be expected they would eaſily be perſuaded to join the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> leſt they ſhould kill their own Fleſh and Blood; adding, that the only proper Meaſure, that could now be taken, was to adviſe them to ſit ſtill and keep out of the Way: And this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they believed would be hearkened to.</p>
               <p>They then deſired, that, at leaſt two of our Inhabitants might accompany <hi>Piſquetomen,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hickman,</hi> the two Meſſengers to the <hi>Ohio.</hi> The Confederate Chiefs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend two of their own People with them, and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid he would ſend one, if not two <hi>Delawares.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>His Excellency informed them, that he met them to agree about a Conſideration for the uncertain Claims of the <hi>Miniſinks, Wapings</hi> and other Indians, Claimants of Land in the Northern Parts of the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and deſired that it might be conſidered, that they knew not what they ſold, and he knew not what he bought; therefore the Price ought not to be large.</p>
               <p>That they might propoſe a Sum to him, or he would make an Offer to them; or it ſhould be left to their Uncles to conſider of a Price, as would pleaſe them beſt.</p>
               <p>The United Nations, by <hi>Thomas King,</hi> ſaid, that they had no Claim to the Lands of the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> or others their Nephews, on the Eaſt Side of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and ſhould therefore leave the fixing a Price to them.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Miniſinks</hi> and <hi>Wapings</hi> withdrew to conſult upon it, and being returned, <hi>Egobobowen,</hi> the <hi>Miniſink</hi> Chief, ſaid, they would chooſe the Governor ſhould make an Offer, as they might perhaps demand too much.</p>
               <p>His Excellency having conſulted the Commiſſioners, offered them Eight Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Spaniſh Dollars for their Claim in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> as an extraordinary Price.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Miniſinks</hi> ſaid, they ſhould be glad of the Opinion of their Uncles in the Matter.</p>
               <p>The United Nations, by <hi>Thomas King,</hi> ſaid, it was a fair and honourable Offer, and that, if it was their own Caſe, they would chearfully accept of it: But, as there were a great many Perſons to ſhare in the Purchaſe Money, they recommended it to his Excellency, to add two Hundred Dollars more; and, if that was complied with, the Report of it would be carried to all the Nations, and would be a great Proof of the Affection and Generoſity of their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and would be very agreeable to them.</p>
               <p>His Excellency deſired to know of the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> and other Claimants, if they approved of the Propoſal of their Uncles; and they informed him, that they did.</p>
               <p>The Governor after conſulting the Commiſſioners, ſaid, it was more than he had intended to give; but as the United Nations had given themſelves the Trouble of being Mediators between them, he could not refuſe their Recommendations, and was glad of the Opportunity he had of ſhewing his Regard to the United Nations, and his Benevolence to the <hi>Miniſink</hi> and other Indians, who had reſided in the Province where he preſided, and therefore complied with their Requeſt.</p>
               <p>His Excellency then deſired them to remember, that this Conſideration Money, was to be in full for the Claims of all the <hi>Miniſink</hi> and <hi>Waping</hi> Indians, and all others who claim any Lands, in a Map, which was laid before them at the ſame Time, which <pb n="27" facs="unknown:008157_0027_102E3ED97A3D7450"/>included all the Lands from the Line between the Provinces of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and down <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, to the Mouth of <hi>Rariton</hi> up the ſame to <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metung</hi> Falls, on the North Branch of <hi>Rariton</hi> River, thence on a ſtreight Line to <hi>Paoqualin</hi> Mountain, where it joins on <hi>Delaware</hi> River, and thence up the <hi>Delaware</hi> to <hi>Cuſbytunk</hi>; and recommended it to them to have Reſpect to this in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Conſideration Money.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Tagaſhata,</hi> the <hi>Seneca</hi> Chief, aroſe, and addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Miniſinks</hi> and other Indian Claimants, ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>My <hi>Nephews,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire you will now give over all Thoughts of your Land, and that we may hear no more Complaints about it.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt remember the Friendſhip between you and your Brother, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmit to your Children, and make them acquainted with the Tranſactions of this Day. I recommend this to you, not from my Lips only, but from the Bottom of my Heart: I hope it will alſo make a deep Impreſſion in your Hearts.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, as if your Grandfathers had not told you of the Treaties they uſed to have with their Brethren, but carried them with them to the Grave. But we hope you will not do ſo, but carefully inform your Children of your Agreements. We have given you this Advice, and hope you will follow it. We alſo expect you will take Care of your young Men, that they do no more Miſchief to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother,</hi>

                  <p>We are now thoroughly ſatisfied, and we ſtill retain a Friendſhip for our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and we deſire, that if we ſhould come into your Province, to ſee our old Friends, and ſhould have Occaſion for the Bark of a Tree to cover a Cabbin, or a little Refreſhment, that we ſhould not be denied, but be treated as Brethren: And that your People may not look on the wild Beaſts of the Foreſt, or Fiſh of the Waters, as their ſole Property; but that we may be admitted to an equal Uſe of them.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Governor anſwered, that, as ſoon as he got Home, he ſhould iſſue a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to notify to the People of his Province, that he had made a Peace with them, and to order, that, for the Future, they ſhould be treated as Brethren, which he hoped would be done: But deſired they would not go into thoſe Parts, where they had lately committed Hoſtilities, till the People's Paſſions were cooled; for he could not be anſwerable for his People's Behaviour, whilſt their Loſſes were freſh upon their Minds.</p>

                  <p>I deſire you will hear me. We have gone ſo far at this Treaty, as to talk of Lands, I therefore thought proper to meet you here, to let you know, that I have conſulted with all my Brethren, your Couſins here preſent, about the Deed you, our Uncles, ſigned to the Proprietors of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhewn to us Yeſterday, for the Lands beyond the <hi>Kittachtinny</hi> Hills.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen the Deed, and know it well. <hi>Nutimus,</hi> one of our chief Men has ſigned it, and here ſits one of our Men, named <hi>Philip Compaſs,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when the Sale was made, and remembers, that <hi>Nutimus</hi> our Chief received Forty-four Dollars, as his Part or Share of the Conſideration Money. We agree to it, and acknowledge the Land was fairly ſold. We give it up, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, that there may be no Difference, nor any Thing more ſaid about it. This is not the Land I have diſputed with my Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> That Land lies between <hi>Tohiccon</hi> Creek and the <hi>Kittachtinny</hi> Hills.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I thank you for your Openeſs and Honeſty on this Occaſion, freely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Truth. We wiſh our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> naming the Governors of <hi>Pennſylvania, Virginia, Carolina</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> were ſo plain and preciſe. They have called us down to this Council Fire, which was kindled for Council Affairs, to renew Treaties of Friendſhip, and brighten the Chain of Friendſhip. But here we muſt hear a Diſpute about Land, and our Time is taken up from Day to Day; but they do not come to the chief Point.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt began to do Miſchief; we told them ſo: They only thanked us for our Openneſs and Advice, and ſaid they would take Care for the Future, but healed no Wounds. In ſhort, when they ſpeak to us, they do it with a ſhorter Belt or String, than that which we ſpeak to them with; tho' they can make Wampum, and we cannot.</p>
                  <p>They ought not thus to treat with Indians on Council Affairs. Several of our Strings and Belts are loſt in their Hands entirely. I fear they only ſpeak from their Mouth, and not from their Heart.</p>
               </q>
               <p>On the ſame Day, P. M. <hi>Piſquetomen</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hickman</hi> came to take their Leave of the Governor, accompanied with Captain <hi>Bull,</hi> jun. <hi>William Hayes,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Stille,</hi> the Perſons appointed to attend them to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> who were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recommended to their Care and Protection, by a String of Wampum.</p>
               <p>The Belts and Strings were numbered, as well in the written Paper containing the Meſſages, as on Labels tied to each of them, and delivered to <hi>Piſquetomen,</hi> and the written Meſſage was delivered with the Paſſports to Captain <hi>Bull.</hi>

                     <p>By this Belt, we heal your Wounds; we remove your Grief; we take the Hatchet out of your Heads; we make a deep Hole in the Earth, and bury the Hatchet ſo low, that no Body ſhall be able to dig it up again.</p>

                     <p>Now we have healed your Wounds, we, by this Belt, renew all our Treaties; we brighten the Chain of Friendſhip; we return to our firſt Affection; we confirm our antient Union; we put freſh Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it may bear up againſt every Storm that can blow, and live and flouriſh to the End of Time, whilſt the Sun ſhines, and the Rivers run.

                     <p>We thank you, for the Care and Diligence with which you have attended to the ſeveral Matters recommended to you in theſe Conferences, which have yielded us Abundance of Satisfaction. This Treaty will convince all our Enemies, that we are now united in the firmeſt Band of Amity; and whilſt we join our Strength together, it will not be in their Power to hurt either you or us.</p>

                     <p>As a Token of the Love we your Brethren of this Province bear you, I ſhall make a Preſent of a Quantity of Goods, which we have prepared for you, and deſire your Acceptance of them; ſenſible of the approaching Seaſon, and of the many Difficulties you live under, from the preſent War. We give them with an hearty good Will.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here his Honour delivered a Liſt of the Goods, and deſired Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Montour</hi> wou'd interpret it to them at a proper Time.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>BY this Belt you put me in Mind, that we formerly referred our Diſpute about Lands to our Father King GEORGE, and you deſired to know if he has decided it.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:008157_0030_102E3EDF57FD9DE8"/>
                        <hi>Brother,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſhou'd conſider the Circumſtances of the Affairs of your Father King GEORGE: His Majeſty lives at a very great Diſtance from us, is now engaged in a War with the <hi>French</hi>; and the Buſineſs of War takes up a great deal of Time and Attention: Beſides, in Time of War, we have but few Opportunities of hearing from him.</p>
                     <p>As yet I have had no Anſwer relative to your Affairs. You may depend upon it, as ſoon as I receive one, it ſhall be communicated to you. And I can aſſure you, the Proprietors have preſſed Diſpatch, and will do every Thing they can, to bring it to a ſpeedy Determination.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Governor BERNARD, requeſting the Attention of the Indians, addreſſed them as follows,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brethren, of the United Nations,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BY this String, you ſpoke on Behalf of our Brethren the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> and ſaid, "That they were wronged in their Lands; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettled ſo faſt, they were continually puſhing them back; and when they aſked for their Lands, they were told that they had ſold their Lands, and had got drunk and forgot it. If they had ſwallow'd their Lands, they muſt be content; but they did not believe that they had ſwallow'd all, but that ſome was left. They deſired, that I wou'd enquire after their Lands that were left, and to them Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am glad I have an Opportunity, in the Preſence of ſo many Nations, to expreſs the Deſire I have of doing Juſtice to every one. The Throne of the Great King is founded on Juſtice: And I ſhou'd not be a faithful Servant to him, if I neglected to give Redreſs to all Perſons, that have received Injuries from the People, over whom the Great King has placed me.</p>
                     <p>I have therefore had a Conference with the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> in the Preſence of ſome of their Uncles; and have come to a full Agreement with them, the Proceedings of which are now ready to be read to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have another Proof to give you of the Uprightneſs and Juſtice of our Province. We have come to an Agreement with the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and other Indians for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Claims they had on the Southern Parts of our Province. I hereby produce the Deeds, that have been executed on this Occaſion, that the Subject of them may be explained to you, and be had in perpetual Remembrance by all the Nations preſent: And I deſire, that you may all remember, that, by theſe two Agreements, the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> is entirely freed and diſcharged from all Indian Claims. In Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, I give you this Belt.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother Teedyuſcung,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>By this String you tell me, that, after the Killing the nine Indians near <hi>Eſopus,</hi> you carried three Belts to <hi>George Vreeland,</hi> who undertook to give them to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and you aſk what is become of thoſe Belts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brother,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I can only ſay, that I never heard of thoſe Belts before; nor do I know what Governor <hi>George Vreeland</hi> undertook to carry thoſe Belts to. The proper Governor was the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi>; for in his Province was this Miſchief committed. And probably the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> had theſe Belts; for I have heard that be iſſued a Proclamation for apprehending the Perpetrators of this Fact. This Fact has been blamed by all good and wiſe Men; and I am glad it was not done by the People of my Province. I will acquaint the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> with what you have ſaid upon this Occaſion, and I will enquire after thoſe Belts, and give you an Anſwer.</p>
                  </q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Governor DENNY, being obliged to return to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> on urgent Buſineſs, took his Leave of the Indians, ſaying.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT gives me great Pleaſure that the Buſineſs of this Treaty has been carried on with ſo much Satisfaction.</p>

I am ſorry, I am now to inform you, that I am obliged to leave you, having received laſt Night an Expreſs from General <hi>Forbes,</hi> who is now near the <hi>Ohio.</hi> My Buſineſs calls me to Town; I ſhall therefore leave Mr. <hi>Logan</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> to tranſact the Remainder of the Buſineſs, and doubt not but they will act to your Satisfaction. I aſſure you of my Affection for you, and wiſh you all Manner of Happineſs.</p>

The Belt had a round Circle Pendant, repreſenting the Sun: He then produced two Certificates, One from Governor CLINTON, and the other from Governor HARDY, both which were much in Favour of the <hi>Waping</hi> Indians. He ſaid the Belt was given them by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> and repreſented their Union, which was to laſt as long as the Sun ſhould continue in the Firmament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> addreſſed Governor BERNARD, deſiring by a String of Wampum, that he would extend his Protection to the <hi>Wapings</hi>; and as their Chief was old and infirm, he requeſted the Favour of a Horſe to carry him Home; which was readily granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tagaſhata</hi> made the ſame Requeſt to Governor DENNY, which was likewiſe granted.</p>
                  <p>The Six Nation Chiefs conſulted together, and in a little Time, <hi>Nichas,</hi> in their Behalf, returned an Anſwer to the Speeches of the Governors, laying the Belts and Strings upon the Table, in the Order they were delivered, and repeating diſtinctly what was ſaid on each of them. At the End of every Article he returned Thanks, and expreſſed the higheſt Satisfaction, particularly on the ratifying the Peace, and the large Belt given thereupon, which he ſaid ſhould be ſent to all the diſtant Nations of Indians, to whom it would be very agreeable; he likewiſe promiſed, that every Thing tranſacted in theſe Conferences, which he again ſaid had afforded them great Pleaſure, ſhould be laid before the great Council at <hi>Onondaga,</hi> whoſe Anſwers ſhould be carefully tranſmitted.</p>
                  <p>He thanked Governor BERNARD for making up all the Differences between that Government and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Miniſink</hi> Indians ſo much to their Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>He made an Apology for the Want of Wampum, and the Exchange of other Belts to give in Confirmation of their Performance of the ſeveral Things mentioned in the Governors Speeches, agreeable to Indian Cuſtoms.

               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Peters</hi> having obſerved to the confederate Chiefs, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors were by <hi>Tokaaio,</hi> charged with having omitted ſome Things in their Anſwers, and deſired to know what they were. <hi>Thomas King</hi> ſaid, that in Regard to ſome Things, they had been ſince ſupplied, and recommended that ſome other Things ſhould be more particularly taken Notice of than they had been.

                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>With this String of Wampum, we condole with you for the Loſs of your wiſe Men, and for the Warriors that have been killed in theſe troubleſome Times, and likewiſe for your Women and Children, and we cover their Graves decently agreeable to the Cuſtom of your Forefathers.</p>
                  <p>A String of a Thouſand Grains of Wampum.</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>We diſperſe the dark Clouds that have hung over our Heads, during theſe Troubles, that we may ſee the Sun clear, and look on each other with the Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs our Forefathers did.</p>
                  <p>A String of a Thouſand Grains of Wampum.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I AM very glad this good Work has been ſo happily finiſhed. I came among you wholly unacquainted with your Forms, and therefore, if I have omitted any Ceremonies, you will readily excuſe me. But in whatever I have been deficient, I am ſure, I have not wanted a good Heart towards you.</p>
                  <p>The Circumſtances of our Province, have hitherto rendered us unable to give you any great Proofs of our Regard for you. But I ſhall endeavour to perſuade my People, to do you good Service for the future, by opening a Communication with you; which if rightly managed, will be much to the Advantage of both People. And for my own Part, I ſhall be always ready to do you Juſtice; and deſire that whenever you have Cauſe of Complaint againſt my People, you will take care to ſignify it to me.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A String.</p>
               <p>The Five Nation Chiefs, laid all the Belts and Strings on the Table, that were delivered at this and the laſt Conference. <hi>Tokaaio,</hi> the <hi>Cayuga</hi> Chief, deſired the Governor and all preſent, would take Notice of what <hi>Thomas King</hi> was going to ſay, on Behalf of the United Nations.</p>
               <p>On which <hi>Thomas King</hi> aroſe, and taking up the firſt Belt which was given by <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> when he requeſted a Deed for the <hi>Wioming</hi> Lands, he addreſſed the <hi>Delawares,</hi> (<hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> not being preſent) as follows.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:008157_0034_102E3EEC600EAA40"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Couſins,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Belt, <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> deſired us to make you the Owners of the Lands at <hi>Wioming, Shamokin</hi> and other Places on the <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> River; in Anſwer to which, we who are preſent ſay, That we have no Power to convey Lands to any one, but we will take your Requeſt to the Great Council Fire, for their Sentiments, as we never ſell or convey any Land, till it be agreed on at the Great Council of the United Nations. In the mean Time, you may make uſe of theſe Lands, in Conjunction with our People, and all the reſt of our Relations, the Indians of the different Nations in our Alliance.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Which being interpreted into <hi>Delaware,</hi> the String of Wampum was given to <hi>Moſes Tetamy</hi> and <hi>James Davis,</hi> to be delivered to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> as he was not preſent.</p>
               <p>Then taking up each Belt and String in the Order it was delivered in this, and the laſt Conference, he proceeded to repeat diſtinctly, what had been ſaid under each Article, returning Thanks for all thoſe good Speeches, which he ſaid, were extreamly agreeable. He made particular Mention of the large Peace Belt, ſaying, <q>The Nations are greatly pleaſed, that all the antient Treaties made here, at <hi>Albany,</hi> and elſewhere, are renewed, as well as that the Old Council Fire at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> is kindled again, and a good Road made to it, that may be travelled without any Danger: Theſe in particular, as well as every other Matter tranſacted at theſe Conferences, we will make known to our own Nations, and to every other in Friendſhip and Alliance with us, and we are ſure they will be very well received.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then addreſſing Governor BERNARD, he thanked him for his farewell Speech, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>It was a very kind one, and that they were much pleaſed with his having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>een preſent, and given his Aſſiſtance at this Treaty, which had given them an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gaining an Acquaintance with him, which they would ever remember with Pleaſure. After a Pauſe he deſired to be excuſed for mentioning ſome Thing that had been omitted by the Governors and their Councils.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>They have forgot to bring with them Ammunition, of which we always uſed to receive a ſufficient Quantity, not only to ſerve us in our Journey, but to ſupport us in our hunting Seaſon, that we might be enabled to make Proviſion for our Families. They have given us Gunlocks without Guns, which are of no Manner of Uſe to us; and therefore this muſt have ſurely been forgot, as it is impoſſible for Indians to ſubſiſt without Guns, Powder and Lead, of which we have received none.</p>
                  <p>As many of us are old and infirm, we deſire our Brethren, will be ſo good as to furniſh us with a Number of Waggons, to convey ſuch of us, as are not able to walk, and the Goods you have been pleaſed to give us, as far as <hi>Wioming,</hi> where we have left our Canoes, and then we will diſcharge the Waggons, and they may come back again.</p>
                  <p>We further deſire a Supply of Proviſions may be put into the Waggons, enough to ſerve us till we get to our reſpective Habitations.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He then took up the Proprietary Releaſe, and returned Thanks for it. He ſaid, <q>When the United Nations firſt made the Requeſt to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmitted to <hi>Onas,</hi> they had no doubt but <hi>Onas</hi> would comply with it, having always found him ready to grant all their Requeſts. With him we have never had any Difference, he has always ſettled our Affairs without giving us any Trouble, and to our Satisfaction. We heartily thank <hi>Onas</hi>; this Act confirms us in the good Opinion we always had of him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> with a String of Wampum, he ſpoke as follows,</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:008157_0035_102E3EEEE05E9F00"/>
                  <p>This ſerves to put <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> in mind of his Promiſes, to return the Priſoners: Remember, Couſins, you have made this Promiſe in our Preſence; you did it indeed before, and you ought to have performed it: To tell Lies, does not become a Great Man: A Great Man always keeps his Word and performs his Promiſes. Couſins, You muſt not now fail to keep your Word: We are all now one People, and we muſt all be punctual in the Performance of our Engagements.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This was interpreted into the <hi>Delaware</hi> Language, and the String was given to <hi>Moſes Tetamy,</hi> to be delivered to <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he ſaid, the United Nations had finiſhed what they had to ſay.</p>
               <p>Some Wine and Punch was called for, and mutual Healths were drank, and the Conferences were concluded with great Satisfaction.</p>
