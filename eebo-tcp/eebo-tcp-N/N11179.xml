            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>STRICTURES, &amp;c. TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>A PAMPLET, entitled <hi>A friendly addreſs to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Americans,</hi> advertiſed and ſold by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of ſo extraordinary a nature that it is difficult for any Man, who is intereſted in the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain ſilent.—I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the author is a Layman or Eccleſiaſtic, but he bears ſtrongly the character of the latter.—He has the want of candour and truth, the apparent ſpirit of perſecution, the unforgiveneſs, the deadly hatred to Diſſenters, and the zeal for arbitrary power, which has diſtinguiſhed Churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the <hi>high</hi> part of the Church of England; I cannot help therefore conſidering him as one of this order.</p>
            <p>THE deſign of his pamphlet is manifeſtly to diſſolve the ſpirit of union, and check the noble ardor prevailing through the continent; but his zeal ſo far outruns his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, that there is the greateſt reaſon to think that his Reverence has laboured to little effect.—His diſcretion ſeems to be ſtill leſs than his genius.—A man of common judgment would not ſo wantonly have attacked the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reigning principles and opinions of a people, whom he intends to ſeduce or intimidate out of their rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges: For inſtance, I believe there are ninety-nine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans in a hundred, who think that Charles the Firſt was an execrable tyrant, that he met with no harder fate than he deſerved, and that his two ſons ought in juſtice to have made the ſame exit. To deſcant therefore on the criminality of the reſiſtance made to that tyrant; to affect on every occaſion giving the title of rebellion to the civil war which brought him to juſtice, is a degree of weakneſs which no man who is not blinded by the Daemon of ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobitiſm
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014155_0004_0F9330A8CD517838"/>
could poſſibly be guilty of.—But to preach up, in this enlightened age (as he does in almoſt expreſs terms) paſſive obedience, is a mark of lunacy, or at leaſt it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it looſes the faculty of reaſoning, for if the principle of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience is admitted, the gracious Prince, for whom his Reverence profeſſes ſo great a devotion, is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right uſurper, and the Parliament of which he ſpeaks ſo reſpectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</p>
            <p>The doctrines he aims to inculcate, are as follow—<hi>That the Parliament has a right to tax you without your conſent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cauſe of Boſton is their own concern; that it is not your cauſe; that the puniſhment of Boſton is a juſt puniſhment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to the crimes; that the Boſtonians are rebels traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Congreſs are little better; that no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of adminiſtration can juſtify or excuſe open diſreſpect; that ſubmiſſion is to be paid to the higher powers, whatever character they be; that an Apoſtle enjoined ſubmiſſion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under heaven the King's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican ſubjects have the leaſt cauſe for complaint; that the preſent confuſion of the Colonies has been occaſioned by falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded: no injury has been done you, and conſequently that you can never be juſtified in reſenting that of which you have no reaſon to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Parliament ought to act according to their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not according to yours, even in things which concern you principally or ſolely; that they aſſert they have the right in queſtion; that you have never proved they have not; that you have always believed or allowed they had it until the preſent occaſion; that the Quebec Bill is a juſt &amp; conſtitutional Bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the beſt &amp; moſt loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in his Majeſty's American dominions; that there is too much reaſon to believe that the minds of the Americans are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled, &amp; their hearts diſpoſed for rebellion; that ſince the reduction of Canada, they have been bloated with a vain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own power and importance; that the Iſland of Great-Britain is able to govern</hi> (that is to dragoon) <hi>ten A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericas;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014155_0005_0F9330A98DDB8BE0"/>
that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great-Britain, all the maritime powers of Europe would join to ravage your ſea ports, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſeize your ſhips merely for the pleaſure of ravaging;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This is perhaps the moſt prepoſterous idea that ever was hatched in a diſtempered brain. America (more particularly ſince the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Poland have taken place) has been the great granary or <hi>cell<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>un's ſake? Is it not more natural to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they would out bid each other for your friendſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce on which ſo much depends? When the Low Countries withdrew themſelves from the dominion of Spain, did England, France, and the other Powers immediately ſet about ravaging their ſea ports and ſeizing their ſhips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert themſelves directly and indirectly to aſſiſt them? The eaſe is ſimilar, the event would be ſimilar; and that Great-Britain would not be powerful enough at ſea, when ſeparated from her Colonies; to prevent this aſſiſtance, I ſhall refer my readers to Maſſie's Eſtimates, the authority of which has never been diſputed, and which demonſtrate, that more than half the naval power of Great-Britain ſtands on her American foundation.</note> 
               <hi>that all the maritime powers of the world would not diſpoſſeſs Great-Britain of the empire of the ſea, even when America is ſeparated from her.</hi> Now I challenge the world to produce ſo many wicked ſentiments, ſtupid principles, audaciouſly falſe aſſertions, &amp; monſtrous abſurdities, crouded together in ſo ſmall a compaſs. All his poſitions are indeed ſo ſelf-evidently abſurd and falſe, that it would be an inſult to American underſtandings, ſeriouſly to attempt refuting them. I ſhall only beg leave to take notice of the curious argument he uſes to prove the duty on tea to be no tax; it is that, <hi>unleſs we conſent to the tax, we are not to pay the the duty. We may refuſe purchaſing it if we pleaſe.</hi> The ſame logic would demonſtrate that a duty on beer, candles, or ſoap, would be no tax, as we are not abſolutely obliged to drink beer; we may drink water, we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to waſh our ſhirts. His aſſertion that Great Britain, when divorced from her Colonies, will ſtill hold the empire of the ſeas, in ſpite of all the powers of the world, is ſtill more ingenious. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, that <hi>without the poſſible means of procuring timber, iron, plank, maſts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furniſh out a ſingle frigate, they may build more ſhips then all the world
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014155_0006_0F9330AA4D461240"/>
put together;</hi> that <hi>when her nurſery for ſeamen is deſtroyed, and all the commerce on which the exiſtence of ſeamen depends, is annihilated, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univerſe put together.</hi> But I am aſhamed of treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing on the public patience, in making ſtrictures on ſuch ridiculous articles, I ſhall therefore paſs on to ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have not been ſo much agitated, and on which, if I miſtake not, his reverence lays the greateſt ſtreſs; for as he modeſtly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to conſider intimidation and terror as the moſt powerful figures of rhetoric. <hi>Regular armies from Great-Britain, Heſſians, Hanoverians, royal ſtandards erected, ſkilful</hi> G<hi>enerals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of Savages; ſwords flaming in the front and rear, peſtilence, deſolation and famine,</hi> are all marſhalled in a moſt dreadful order by this church-militant author.—But let us ſomewhat minutely examine the picture, and ſee whether, ſtript of its falſe colours, it has any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally terrifying. His reverence begins with aſſuring us, that there is no room to doubt but that ſuch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is an army of ſeven thouſand men) would be more than ſufficient for the conqueſt of all the diſaffected American Colonies (which are in fact all the Colonies.) Should <hi>ſuch</hi> a reſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary, in order to reduce them to obedience, for my own part, I think there is very great reaſon to doubt, that ſeven thouſand, even of the beſt troops, are able to conquer two hundred thouſand of the moſt diſorderly pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry upon earth, if they were animated in defence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they hold moſt dear &amp; ſacred; and there is ſtill greater reaſon to doubt that 7000 very indifferent troops, compoſed of the refuſe of an exhauſted nation, few of whom have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> action of any kind, ſhould be able to conquer two hundred thouſand active, vigorous yeomanry, fired with the noble ardor, we ſee prevalent through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, all armed, all expert in the uſe of arms almoſt from their cradle. The ſucceſs of Quebec it is true, does infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite honor to the Engliſh arms, the army was, I believe, only for a thouſand, the enemy were perhaps more than double, but ſixteen thouſand men are not two hundred
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014155_0007_0F9330AB0F9A6668"/>
thouſand. The fate of Canada, depended upon one deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive action, but it is impoſſible to calculate how many vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories muſt be gained before theſe Colonies could be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, whereas a ſingle victory gained by the Colonies muſt decide the conteſt in their favour. In the affair of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec there is another circumſtance to be conſidered, it was Wolfe, who commanded; a man of the moſt wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties; to render the moſt deſpicable ſoldiery almoſt inſtantaneouſly an army of heroes. In ſhort, the genius of the man was ſo extraordinary, the event was ſo extraordinary that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this without preſumption may be aſſerted, that no General now exiſting in the Britiſh ſervice, would with double or treble his number have ſucceeded in the ſame circumſtances. One thing more I muſt add in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that illuſtrious perſonage, that the ſame greatneſs of ſoul which qualified him to conquer the natural here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary enemies of his country, would have made him reject with horror the Hangman's office, which others, who are not endowed with conquering attributes, will with readineſs accept.</p>
            <p>IT is notorious that Mr. Wolfe was not only the firſt of ſoldiers, but that he was a moſt liberal, virtuous citizen, that he was paſſionately attached to the liberties of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of mankind; and that he was particularly an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to large ſtanding armies in time of peace. It is on the other hand remarkable, that all the advocates for ſtanding armies; all thoſe who are the fondeſt of the faddling and parade of war, are the moſt active in avoiding real ſervice.</p>
            <p>THIS tremendous ſoothſayer, on the ſuppoſition that ſo great a miracle ſhould happen in our favour, as that the trifling body of five hundred thouſand men, though firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to leſs) ſhould be able to withſtand his ſeven thouſand; goes on to rattle in our ears, armies of Heſſians and Hanoverians. I wiſh to Heaven he had for once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated into probability &amp; truth. I wiſh 10,000 of them could poſſibly be tranſported to-morrow. The purpoſe they would anſwer, is a purpoſe devoutly to be wiſhed for; they would be an addition to this continent of juſt ſo many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014155_0008_0F9330ABCCD97590"/>
and excellent citizens, for I will venture to affirm, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming is infectious) that in leſs than four months not two of theſe ten thouſand would remain with their Colours. But does not this reverend Gentleman know, that in the year 1764 a convention was formed by moſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the empire, at the head of which convention were the Emperor himſelf and the King of Pruſſia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatened depopulation to Germany? Does he not know that no troops can march out of the empire without the conſent of the empire? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the Emperor are upon exceedingly ill terms? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia are ſtill upon worſe? Is he ſure that the Landgrave of Heſs would ſell his troops (for as not one man would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to their country, he muſt conſider them as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſold!) Is he ſure that as the finances of Great-Britain ſtand, the vaſt ſum neceſſary for this purchaſe would be conveniently found? Is he ſure that the State of Hanover would conſent to ſuch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his moſt excellent Majeſty GEORGE the Third, who in England is juſtly eſteemed the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of Sovereigns, the wiſeſt, greateſt, and beſt of Kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Hanover. Theſe people ſeem to think it hard that Two Hundred and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Pounds ſhould annually be drawn from them, for the purpoſes (as they conceive it) of corrupting the Members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to ſupport the power and authority of a ſet of men, who from the beginning have been enemies to the ſucceſſion of the Hanover line, and who ſhewed a particular animoſity to their laſt and favourite Prince, George the Second; but theſe difficulties (great and unſurmountable as to a common mortal they appear) our divine Exorciſt has in an inſtant conjured down, and, by a ſingle motion of his enchanted wand, has tranſported whole armies, in ſpite of their reſpective Princes, and without the conſent of their reſpective States, from the interior parts of Germany, acroſs the Atlantic into the plains of New-England and Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. But he does not confine himſelf to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction

of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the Royal Standard, to which he tells us that all who have the courage to declare themſelve now friends to government, will undoubtedly reſort, and theſe, he ſays, in a good cauſe, will be of themſelves formidable to their oppoſers: Dreadfully formidable they muſt be indeed! There would reſort to it, let me ſee (for the reſpectable town of Rye have declared themſelves a kind of neutrals, <hi>rather than friends to government)</hi> there would reſort to it, Mr. Juſtice Sewell, the honorable Mr. Paxton, Brigadier Ruggles, and about eight or ten more mandamus Councilmen, with perhaps twice their number of Expectants, and not leſs than twenty of the unrecanted Hutchinſonian Addreſſers.—Theſe the four Provinces of New-England alone would ſend forth—New-York would furniſh ſix, ſeven or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eight, volunteers from a certain knot, who are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion or expectation of contracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high flying Church of England Romaniſed Prieſts—I repreſent to myſelf the formidable countenance they will make, when arranged under the Royal or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Standard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance, will be their Reverend Pontifix himſelf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inquiſitorial frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a croſs in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <hi>In hoc ſigno vinces,</hi> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on, and exciting them to victory. It is impoſſible, that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of heaven, ſhould flatter themſelves, that forty thouſand American Yeomanry (for we are aſſured, by the ſame great authority, that more than forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cannot be brought to action) ſhould ſtand the ſhock of this dreadful Phalanx.</p>
            <p>BUT I ſhould beg pardon for attempting to be ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous upon a ſubject which demands our utmoſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—I ſhall now therefore on the preſumption that the People of England ſhould be ſo loſt to ſenſe, virtue and ſpirit, as to ſuffer their profligate Miſrulers to perſevere in their preſent meaſures, endeavour to ſtate to you what is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014155_0010_0F9330AD47223BA0"/>
their force, and what is yours.—I ſhall endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the falſe terrors which this writer would hold out, in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and thoſe of your poſterity, that he and his ſimilars may wallow in ſinecures and benefices heaped up from the fruits of your labour and induſtry.</p>
            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN has, I believe, of infantry at home (comprehending Ireland, and excluſive of the guards) fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men.—They find the greateſt difficulty in keeping the regiments up to any thing near their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—what they are able to procure are of the worſt ſort. They are compoſed of the moſt debauched Weavers' pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, the ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics, who deſert upon every occaſion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs.—This is no exagera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thoſe who have been lately at Boſton, repreſent the ſoldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in ſize, and apparently in ſtrength: But we ſhall be told they are ſtill regulars, and regulars have an irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantage.—There is, perhaps, more impoſition in the term <hi>regular troops,</hi> than in any of the jargon which iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from the mouth of a Quack Doctor. I do not mean to inſinuate, that a diſorderly mob are equal to a trained diſciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials neceſſary to form infantry for real ſervice may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a few months.<note n="*" place="bottom">There cannot be a ſtronger illuſtration of the truth here advanced, than the Pruſſian army.—They are compoſed of about one third of the King's own ſubjects, two-thirds foreigners.—The third, conſiſting of his own ſubject, are, when the exerciſing ſeaſon is over, (which laſts ſix or ſeven weeks) ſuffered to return to their families, and attend to the buſineſs of huſbandry—half of the other two-thirds, conſiſting of foreigners, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garriſon towns, and never touch a muſket for the reſt of the year, ſo that, in fact, only one third are, in the modern language, to be called regular Soldiers;—theſe generally make their eſcape the firſt opportunity: It may be ſaid, therefore, that the King of Pruſſia has gained all his victories with a ſort of Militia.</note> I mean that it is very poſſible for men to be clothed in red, to be expert in all the tricks of the parade, to call themſelves regular troops, and yet, by attaching themſelves principally or ſolely to the tinſel
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014155_0011_0F9330AE378B6BE0"/>
and ſhew of war, be totally unfit for real ſervice.—This, I am told, is a good deal the caſe of the preſent Britiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry: If they can acquit themſelves tolerably in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erile reviews exhibited for the amuſement of royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miſſes in Hyde Park or Wimbledon Common, it is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the late war, ſome of the moſt eſteemed regular regiments were ſent over to this country; they were well dreſſed; they were well powdered; they were perfect maſters of their manual exerciſe; they fired together in platoons; but fatal experience taught us, that they knew not how to fight.—While your Militia were frequently crowned with ſucceſs, theſe regulars were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated or baffled for three years ſucceſſively in every part of the continent—at length, indeed (after repeated loſſes and diſgraces) they became excellent troops, but not until they had abſolutely forgotten every thing which, we are aſſured, muſt render regulars quite irreſiſtable. The corps ſent from this country under General Monkton was, I believe, for its number, one of the beſt armies that ever was led to conqueſt, and yet, if I have been rightly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was not a ſingle regiment of them that could go through the manual exerciſe, or at beſt, they performed it moſt wretchedly.—It is likewiſe ſaid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conqueſt of Martinico, they were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpruce regiments from Europe; ſuch was their uncouth appearance, that they were ſcarce honored with the title of Soldiers by thoſe Gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is moſt certain, that men may be ſmartly dreſſed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action.—It is equally certain, that a Militia, by confining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to eſſentials, by a ſimplification of the neceſſary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable infantry.—The Yeomanry of America have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, infinite advantages over the peaſantry of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; they are accuſtomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the uſe of them:—Whereas the lower and middle people of England are, by the tyranny of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014155_0012_0F9330AECA9482E8"/>
laws almoſt as ignorant in the uſe of a muſket, as they are of the ancient Catepulta. The Americans are likewiſe, to a man, ſkilful in the management of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments neceſſary for all military works; ſuch as ſpades, pickaxes, hatchets, &amp;c.—Taking, therefore, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into conſideration, there will be no raſhneſs in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that this continent may have formed for action, in three or four months, an hundred thouſand infantry: For as to the aſſertion of one friendly adviſer, <hi>that no more than forty thouſand could act to advantage,</hi> I confeſs I do not underſtand it, nor does he, I believe, underſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—If he means that ſixty thouſand men cannot be rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a field capable of containing only forty thouſand, we ſhall all agree with him; but how in the operations of a war upon a vaſt continent double this number ſhould be a diſadvantage, I can have no conception.</p>
            <p>LET one ſimple general plan be adopted for the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubdiviſion of your battalions; let them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed only in ſo much of the manual exerciſe as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent confuſion, and accidents in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce themſelves from a line of fire to a line of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that is, from two deep to four, ſix, or eight.—This is all ſo eaſy and ſimple, that it may be acquired in three months. Let ſome plan of this ſort be adopted, I ſay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you may have an army on foot of ſeventy, eighty, or an hundred thouſand men, equal to all the ſervices of war.</p>
            <p>SHOULD this be admitted, it will be ſtill objected, that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have; but it is certain that thoſe ſent to dragoon you have better? I have taken ſome pains to inform myſelf what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods theſe gentlemen, ſaid to be bred to arms, take to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify themſelves in a ſuperior degree for the profeſſion.—What is their rotine of inſtruction? Do they read much? I am aſſured that they do not: From books alone the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of war can be acquired: and the Engliſh ſervice, in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014155_0013_0F9330AF88166388"/>
times of peace, affords them no practical leſſons; for mounting guard once or twice a week, or the preparation for the review of a ſingle regiment can never be eſteemed as ſuch.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is much to be lamented, that the Gentlemen of the Army do not apply more of the many leiſure yours they have upon their hands <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now I am upon the ſubject of the Officers of the Army, I take the opportunity of mentioning, with the reſpect due to him, one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of high rank amongſt them—the tenure of his conduct while in command, was ſo liberal, and his letters, quoted in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were ſo fair, candid and friendly to this Continent, that he is entitled to the thanks of America.—He is indeed of a country that owes not only its proſperity but its exiſtance to the ſame principles which actuate America.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER circumſtance, Americans, may be added for your comfort. It has been allowed by ſome of the moſt candid of the regulars themſelves, that during the laſt war upon this continent, your countrymen, the provincial field-officers, were in general more underſtanding and capable than their own of the ſame rank. But the hiſtory of the civil war, in the year 1641, furniſhes us with the ſtrongeſt inſtances that excellent officers may be ſoon formed from Country Gentlemen, Citizens, Lawyers, and Farmers—The Parliament's army (or as our prieſtly writer would all them, the rebellious Republicans) were chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of this claſs of men. In the beginning of this war, they were treated with the ſame affected contempt, and almoſt in the ſame opprobrious terms as you, the people of America, are by your friendly and decent adviſer.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER would infer from the tenure of theſe papers, that the writer is deſirous of precipitating, or could look

with indifference upon the calamities of a civil war, does him great injuſtice. He conſiders them with all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror natural to a feeling man and honeſt citizen. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrates the memory of thoſe men to whom they may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be attributed, but he is perſuaded that they never ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated (at leaſt in ſtates of any conſiderable extent) in the turbulent diſpoſition of the people, nor in the arts of demagogues, but in the oppreſſion of their rulers, in the wantonneſs, folly, pride, or avarice of Kings, Miniſters, or Governors. The Gri<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ers of Switzerland, the Granvels of Holland, the Lauds and Straffords of England, were the undoubted authors of the tragedies acted in their reſpec-countries: And if this continent ſhould be ſtained with the blood of a ſingle citizen, it can never be charged to the unreaſonable pretenſions of the people, but to the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards, Hutchinſons, and ſome other traitors of a ſimilar ſtamp.</p>
            <p>HE is convinced, that being prepared for a civil war is the ſureſt means of preventing it; that to keep the ſwords of your enemies in their ſcabbards, you muſt whet your own.—He is convinced that remonſtrances, petitions, prayers, and ſupplications will make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on our callous Court, and abandoned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; England, Ireland, America, even Guernſey, Jerſey, and Minorca, are witneſſes of their inefficacy.—He is convinced, that ſear alone can operate; there are ſymptoms that it already begins to operate;—the monſter, Tyranny, already begins to pant, preſs her now with ardor, and ſhe is down; already the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry have expreſſed in their letters an inclination to make ſome conceſſions; to meet you half-way: Which I ſuppoſe may be conſtrued thus, that as they find they have it not in their power to eſtabliſh, by force, the deſpotiſm which they aimed at, they ſhall be very well ſatisfied <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

influence, and ſapping your virtue, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the reſt at their leiſure.</p>
            <p>THERE now remains, people of America, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which (however it may be taken) I think it my duty to offer. Hiſtory tells us that the free ſtates of Greece, Thebes, Sparta, Athens, and Syracuſe, were all in their turns ſubjugated by the force or art of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. They almoſt all, in their turns, recovered their liberty and deſtroyed their tyrants. The firſt act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recovery of their liberty was to demoliſh thoſe badges of ſlavery, citadels, ſtrong holds and military tenements; the Switzers did the ſame; the people of England (loſt in corruption and lethargy as they are) could never be prevailed upon to ſuffer barracks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; even the courtly Blackſtone is ſtartled at the idea. No ſeparate camps, no barracks, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land fortreſſes, ſays he, ſhould be allowed; in fact, wherever barracks are, freedom cannot be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, or ſhe exiſts ſo lamely as ſcarcely to deſerve the name.</p>
            <p>IT is worth your conſideration, Americans, whether theſe badges ſhould remain or on. I ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, brave citizens, with invoking the Almighty God, from whom all virtues flow, to continue you in that ſpirit of unanimity and vigour which muſt inſure your ſucceſs, and immortalize you through all ages, as the champions and patrons of the human race.</p>
