            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>DO not affect the utmoſt aſtoniſhment at this addreſs; it comes not in the tremendous form of a Petition; of theſe your ſulky Majeſty ſhall have no more during the ſhort time you can hope to tyrannize over us in a regal ſhape. What I humbly offer now, concerns, not your infeſted and afflicted kingdoms, ſo nearly as your dear ſelf and favourites. Your Majeſty's beſt beloved ſpirits, Bute and Mansfield, the whole aſtoniſhed world conſider as the blackeſt imps in all your train; and yourſelf, as their humble execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. They adviſe, and you moſt condeſcendingly adminiſter, Deſtruction. Their aſcendancy and your humility, their patriotiſm and your diſcernment, their wiſdom and your humanity, are ſubjects of univerſal admiration. But of all your moſt diabolical virtues, ſatanic Sir, the moſt conſpicuous is Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. The blaze of it, upon one occaſion, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the death of Lord Chancellor Yorke, (as Milton ſays) <hi>"far round illumin'd hell."</hi> As you can practice it ſo ſucceſſively for the deſolation, let me intreat you, gloomy Sir, to aſſume it now (by way of frolic only) for the preſervation of mankind; but, above all, for your own precious intereſt, much
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:013989_0002_0F9258FE03262700"/>dearer to you than the ſalvation of an inferior uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Your Majeſty has diſported yourſelf amidſt the dangerous indulgencies of three moſt unprincely paſſions; pride, anger, and revenge, for fourteen years paſt; ever ſince the demiſe of our good King, George the ſecond; in whoſe reign your moſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical highneſs was adviſed to wear the maſk of decency and circumſpection. You then caſt a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable glance only at corruption; but you have ſince ſpurned the reign of policy, and broke out into ſuch uncommon tyrannies, ſuch bloody inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unprovoked, that your deſpotic Highneſs muſt now either deſiſt, or expect to be deſerted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. My great tenderneſs for two of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes deareſt friends, the Scotch Lords, Bute and Mansfield, obliges me to give you this timely notice Should you ſtill continue, dread Sir, to "have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence in the wiſdom of your Divan," ſhould you ſtill, "Steadily purſue thoſe meaſures which they have recommended"—your reign can be but ſhort; your animating ſupporters Bute, and Mansfield, muſt ſurely fail. When theſe helliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigators of your pride are gone, your unhappy reign muſt end, when thoſe arch fiends of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and iniquity, are no more; your wiſe Divan, will fall off from you like water, they will neither ſupport your wanton ſlaughter in America, nor your pious deſigns upon Great Britain, your faithful pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners will faint for want of thoſe heartening ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, with which they are now daily refreſhed in plenteous ſtreams, by your Majeſty's feeder Lord North, under the provident eye of your beſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Bute and Mansfield. When theſe fountains of milk and honey, ceaſe to flow, your Majeſty's hired majority will grow languid and relaps into what
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:013989_0003_0F9258FED9E5F970"/>they once were, and ever will be, mere diſſemblers of patriotic virtue, even your ſovereign tool of all, who now audaciouſly plumes himſelf upon their ſupport, will then foreſwear any further attachment to them, or you. When your chief agents Lord Bute and Mansfield are extinct, what muſt become of ways and means, arbitrary taxation, and moſt effectual methods for carrying theſe pregnant ſchemes into a daring execution, by ſword and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? Your angels, Bute and Mansfield are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at theſe devices; but their fervent zeal for your Highneſs's cauſe, has, at laſt tranſported them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of judgment. Call theſe winged hell hounds off in time, great Sir, if you value the preſervation of your deſpotic power; and as you have hitherto played the tyrant for your pleaſure, begin now to play the hypocrite for your ſafety. Should you permit theſe Scotch imps of yours to proceed farther, you will hazard all. We now feel certain ſtretches of your perſevering powers too great for human nature, or human patience to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port long; aſſume therefore, moſt ſteady Prince, in this dangerous Criſis, a virtue to which you are, in truth, a ſtranger. Play off, once more an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of clemency; it will be better timed now, than it ever was in the caſe of Sodomites, wanton mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and military cut-throats. Diſſemble your cauſeleſs anger, and effeminate thirſt for blood. By this ſtratagem you may, probably, make the eaſy, long ſuffering, paſſive fools, whom you wiſh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, believe that your Majeſty is really ſincere, when you condeſcend to call them (with inward reluctance and diſdain) "Your faithful and beloved people." Believe me, moſt infernal Prince, this is the only way to compaſs their utter ruin, with the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:013989_0004_0F9258FFB322A708"/>leaſt probable ſecurity to your gracious ſelf, your wiſe Divan, your faithful minions, your obſequious aſſaſſins, and penſioned parricides. By theſe means, and by theſe alone, you may ſtill live in proſperous and plenteous infamy. Thus, and thus only, can you hope to introduce, with ſafety to yourſelf, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive plan of tyranny, by which your beloved Bute and Mansfield, will immortalize your reign. It muſt be introduced, my Prince, by gentle, ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. By your obdurate ſteadineſs, and precipitate perſeverance (virtues not unworthy of a Devil) your darling ſchemes may be ſuddenly extinguiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can have time to declare again how much you are aſtoniſhed at thoſe ſufferers, who deſpiſe and deteſt you as much as</p>

               <p>YOUR Lordſhips will pardon me, and I am ſure your brother North will readily excuſe me, if I paſs him by, for the preſent, as a mere expletive in your execrable triumvirate. He is, in truth, my Lords, (and the world ſees it) no more than the oſtenſible leader of that fawning, falſe, corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, who arrogantly groupe themſelves under the ſpecious name of King's friends. Like deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing traytors, they, and you, my Lords, aſſume this maſk for the worſt of purpoſes; that of enriching your wretched ſelves, by the ſpoils of this unhappy country; whilſt your deluded, paſſive Sovereign, is but your ſtalking horſe. Poor, mean, obſequious, flexible Lord North, (like the reſt of your ſervile herd) is no more than the humble and callous exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:013989_0005_0F9259007B0F2400"/>of your infernal ſelfiſh views, your inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man warrants, your deſtructive bloody policy. In a word my Lords, you are the ſubtiles, and he is the face.</p>
               <p>To your Lordſhips, therefore, and to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips only, as principals, as the earlieſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable deluders of weak and ductile Majeſty; I now addreſs myſelf, not in terms of pleaſing flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but in the rough, and odious language of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting Truth. Such, my Lords, as the Sovereign is, the nation has received him from your hands. He was born a Briton; you, my Lords, have taught him not only to forget, but to ſhame his birth. He was born a Prince; you have levelled him with the worſt, the moſt inhuman, and meaneſt of his ſubjects. He became (too ſoon alas!) a King; you, my Lords, have debaſed him to a tyrant. His mind, though enligtened by no auſpicious ray from heaven, was yet capable of receiving ſome moderate degrees of culture; it was in its infant ſtate, open at leaſt to the impreſſions of humanity; you, my Lords, in that early period, gave it a moſt unhappy bent; you moulded, you contracted, you ſteeled it, for your own wicked purpoſes. To ſay the beſt of it, it remains, after all your painful lectures, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unprincipled, or moſt attrociouſly perverted. Hence, my patriotic Lords, have flowed (and ſtill flow) all the grievances of the preſent inglorious, ignoble, and inhuman reign. Let me ring them in your ears, my Lords:—Court—and Miniſterial Aſſaſſinations, of which Martyn, Dun, and Talbot, can remind you, in Wilkes's caſe. In the ſame caſe, in Bingley's and ſome others, royal perſecutions, Star Chamber inquiſitions, eraſing records, inveigling, byaſſing, miſleading, deceiving, over-bearing, and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:013989_0006_0F9259011171FCF8"/>even packing juries, by Lord Mansfield. Daring corruptions and perverſions of juſtice, by the ſame hand, in the laſt reſort (the once righteous houſe of Lords) in the late caſe of Thickneſs and Leigh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the infamous, illegal, and unprecedented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Lord Apſley, Lord Mansfield, Lord High Chancellor of Great-Britain. The unjuſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this caſe will (to your immortal infamy, Lord Mansfield) be handed down to the lateſt poſterity—even a Jeffereys would have bluſhed at them. As for your ſhadow, Apſley; your dependant Scots, Carthcart and Galloway, and your bully Denbigh, they are but tools in your Lordſhip's craft, they live by the breath of your Lordſhip's noſtrils, and are too inconſiderable to be named either by hiſtorian or reporter; but Lord Mansfield's name and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines will be faithfully recorded.—Now, my Lords, I return to grievances, the offspring of your Scotch politics. Among others, you may recollect the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the freedom of election, and the lives you have to anſwer for at the Middleſex election, in ſupport of your court tool, Sir William Beauchamp Proctor. Your Lordſhips, and your royal pupil, countenanced a ſtill greater violation of the rights of election, which was moſt impudently and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly avowed, and ſanctified by a corrupt Houſe of Commons, in the caſe of that inſignificant time ſerver, Col. Luttrel, the King's brother in law. Let me now remind your Lordſhips (for you are too callous to be ſhocked with the ſound) of Murders (repeated, wanton murders) at the Brentford election, and in St. George's fields, even of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. The barbarous carnage of young Allen (naked and unarmed) muſt be attoned for. By whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and with whoſe privity, my Lords, did your
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013989_0007_0F925901C980C510"/>Pupil return public thanks for this ſlaughter of his ſubjects; who in the one caſe were but curious gazers, and in the other, were diſcharging their duties as honeſt, independent electors, above mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial bribery and corruption? let me aſk you, my Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Juſtice of England (whoſe duty it was to bring theſe miniſterial cut-throats to condign puniſhment) why were theſe guilty miſcreants ſcreened, protected, pardoned, penſioned? Why and by whoſe orders (unleſs yours, my Lord) was ſo much affected tenderneſs, manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brow-beating of the proſecutor's councils and witneſſes, ſuch nice caution in ſumming up the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſuch menaces againſt thoſe who dare to print theſe public trials, but particularly that of young Allen? why did your Lordſhip's upright, holy, and favourite judge, Smythe, ſo ſignalize himſelf, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with ſuch uncommon partiality? why were the laws of England, diſpenced with in the caſe of the military Scotch ruffians, who ſpilled the innocent blood of Allen in St. George's Fields? who ſuggeſted the happy thought of diſſolving the laſt Parliament on a ſudden, and of ſmuggling and packing (by means of private in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="6 letters">

How, and by whom, are the Seats of Juſtice to be filled for the future, my Lords, and for what purpoſes? I will not aſk, what knowledge of the laws, but what intereſt, what reaſons, made ſuch a man as Hotham, a Baron of the exchequer? This is a new grievance and a real one.</p>

Of all your other wicked counſels, what impolitic, diabolical ſpirit, could inſtigate you to adviſe your pupil ever to conſent to, much more to perſevere, in the inhuman maſſacre of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica? Why were the petitions of the city of London, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in your reign, my Lords, with ſneers, inſults, abuſe, menaces, indignant frowns, and even with accuſations of high treaſon? I refer your Lordſhips to your laſt Baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aw-like anſwer to the city petition, where you will find, to the general aſtoniſhment, that you have almoſt impeached a part of his Majesty's faithful and beloved people, of high treaſon, for only making a conſtitutional ſupplication to the throne for humbly remonſtrating againſt the pernicious influence of corruption and your lordſhips, and for expreſſing natural and just feelings for their fellow ſubjects, doomed by your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to deſtruction in America.</hi>

               <p>Theſe my Lords, are ſome of the moſt palpable wounds which your Lordſhips have, by hirelings and dupes, already given, there are others in Embryo, which you are about to give to the Britiſh conſtitution. For theſe iniquities, when your meaſure is full, my Lords, you muſt aſſuredly account at laſt, unleſs, like true cowards, you fly from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice, or diſappoint the meritorious executioner, by the timely application of your own guilty hands, to the rottenneſt and moſt deteſted hearts that ever beat. If murdering innocence and virtue, in the ſubject, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing their influence in the ſovereign, is tyranny and treaſon, and rank cowardice, I am no falſe accuſer of your Lordſhips. The inſtances I have already given are ſuch as would blacken the reigns of a Nero, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but they are ſuch my Lords as ſprung naturally from thoſe internal inſtitutes which your Lordſhips have inceſſantly penned and preached, for the Edification of a Britiſh King; of a King; who neither does, nor poſſibly can, hold the crown of England upon ſuch principles as your Lordſhips have laboured to inſtill, theſe labours, my Lords, are crying ſins againſt the liberties, and Majeſty of the nation, and the wages of theſe ſins is death.</p>
