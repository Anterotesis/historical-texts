                  <note>The American Antiquarian Society copy is inscribed "-ather, D.D." in a contemporary hand following "J.M." on title page, and has consequently been attributed to Increase Mather. This attribution is refuted in Holmes, T.J. Increase Mather. Holmes identifies J.M. as the author of "Some proposals to benefit the Province" (Boston, 1720), and notes that Trumbull has suggested that this might have been Joseph Morgan.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Courteous Candid RREADER.</head>
            <p>THE Good of the Governed is the sole end of all Government, which the <hi>English</hi> Constitution, Wholsome Laws, and bright Magistrates will Effect. Good Magistrates are God-like Men, (the greatest Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings on Earth to Mankind) and Merit the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Service, Praise and Honour from them: They are their greatest Benefactors, Imitating their Maker, always doing Good; Uneasy when they want Ability, or Opportunity thereto; they look upon themselves Appointed, Set up and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God, &amp; also Dignified by their Brethren for that very End; knowing, that all the Governed are ready to Contribute their Lives, and all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their Glory; therefore Gratefully they Exert all their Power for the Good of all the Governed, and promote every one who contributes thereto.</p>
            <p>They are Men of Souls above their Brethren, possest with soaring elevated Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs for the Good of Mankind, &amp; o make their Brethren happy, watching over them, to keep off all Evil, to take off all heavy Burthens, &amp; to break all Yokes, and to possess them of all GOOD <hi>Happy, Happy are the People that are in such a Case!</hi> In such a Government there is no difference in the Views &amp; Interests of the Governours and Governed, but each striving to Excel, in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one the others Happiness. It has been so in <hi>N-England,</hi> &amp; why may it not now, if in our Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 
<pb facs="unknown:002346_0004_0FDB2CD6CD884B60"/>
we make Choice of Good Delegates, and they of Good MAGISTRATES? we have an Excellent Governour, who is must willing to do every thing by Counsel, for the best Good and Welfare of this People; therefore if we be not happy, we must condemn our selves for it. Pray God increase our Wisdom, and Love one to another, and remove all Jealousies, and Direct all our Elections to his Glory, and the best Good for this Province.</p>
            <p>The Design aimed at in this Scroul, is to do all Men good, without wrong to any, by removing from all, all causes of just Complaint, and by giving to the <hi>Industrious</hi> all due Encouragement, and wherein this falls short thereof, may the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious give further Light.</p>
            <p>Ambition, Custome and Interest will move some to Object against the Positions argued from, but if no Wrong be done, then no Person hath just Cause of Complaint.</p>
            <p>For which is most to be <hi>Avoided,</hi> a positive or a privitive Evil, is it not according as the degrees thereof be! Certainly that which is the greatest Paenal Evil is most to be <hi>Feared;</hi> for if a Privitive Evil be a greater damage, it is by so much the more to be avoided; for is it not better to suffer a less Positive Evil (tho' to be Robbed) than a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Privative Evil, (for Men and their Posterity to be deprived of their Birth-right) and a far greater Sum it amounts to then many Robberies; it is a progressive Robbery, from Generation to Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And only suffers Mankind to Live, that they may be Slaves to Monopolizers; for so much as they can Raise (if not more) they must give them for Deeds, <hi>

may be committed by a Law, and Men and their Posterity be made to Work &amp; Fight for others, &amp; to feed &amp; pay themselves for the support of Pride, Ambition and Coveteousness. For is it not just cause of Complaint, that men shall be possest of a Visible Increasing Estate in Dormant Lands? (that is no benefit to, but Impoverish the Province, also is defended by the Blood &amp; Purse thereof) worth 10, 20 or 30 <hi>Thousand Pounds,</hi> more or less, and Pay no Rates for it; when others are constantly Taxed for their Improved Lanes, which is the Enriching and Support of the Country; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be justified a necessity for the Farmers to purchase Dormant Lands? and thereby make the Farmers that subdues &amp; improves the Earth <hi>Slaves,</hi> or the Taxing of Dormant Lands to prevent <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;</hi> &amp; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Lands for themselves and their Posterity, or leave them naked.</p>
            <p>The first beginning of this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity, (to set up Idol self)</hi> was a shadow of Justice and Righteousness, under specious pretences of our just and natural Rights, giving large Towns to a few Men, who finding that dividing all the Towns Lands among themselves, the more Land they could keep for their Posterity, &amp; Sell to Strangers that wanted Land to improve; and at first selling shares at low prices, it was not much minded, but now it is risen to so great a price as to make us all Oppressors or Slaves, (that is Monopolizers or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers of Dormant Land,) therefore it's high time to be looked upon as a great Iniquity; and Laws made to free us therefrom, to prevent <hi>such attempts</hi> for the future. It's true, the first <hi>Towns-men</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Towns Land among themselves, thereby have kept Land for their Children, else the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would have been less improved, and their Posterity necessitated to have Removed, as a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude have done, and Settled many Towns in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</hi> To Conclude, if nothing be struck at, but what is a <hi>Provoking Sin,</hi> both against God &amp; Man, Let us beware of persevering therein; for whether is <hi>Wisdoms Choice,</hi> the removing of Sin, and thereby saving the Land, or to uphold Sin, and thereby destroy the Country; for God is a Jealous God, and will not suffer Coveteous Hucksters to interpose betwixt his Gift (and the Subject Man, to whom it is given) and thereby destroy his free Bounty, to Serve their Lusts, and Ruin their Brethren.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>If it cannot be proved, that God hath given the Property of all this vast unsubdued and unknown</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican <hi>Part of the Creation to the</hi> Indians, <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of all others, nor that they have subdued or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved one hundred thousand part thereof; (they only were born and brought up in the Country, as also the wild and savage Creatures were, and preyed on every thing they could catch, a Rattle Snake could not escape their teeth) then the</hi> Natives <hi>have no more Property, save the Land they have subdued

            </p>
            <p>But God in his Providence did bring the <hi>English</hi> to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Morton,</hi> Secretary of <hi>Plymouth</hi> gives account thereof, in his History of <hi>New-England,</hi> at large especially in the second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Page</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is manifest, that the Property is not invested in the <hi>Indians,</hi> but in the Crown and Nation of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we consider the<hi> Indians </hi>or<hi> Natives </hi>as Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then this vast Continent either is their<hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, </hi>exclusive of all others, or it is not; if it be the Communities Property, what right have their<hi> Sachems </hi>to Sell it; for if<hi> Sachems, </hi>or any in Authority do destroy, or alienate their innocent Subjects, their Liberties and Properties to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (without their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

whatsoever. Thereby they forfeit all Right of Authority to Govern, and are manifested to be Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; and then they ought to be deposed; for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Destraction and Alienation are contrary to, and inconsistent with both Moral Virtue, Reason and Government; and also destroys the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is the Preservation of Life, Liberty and Property.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>English</hi> Arrived to this Continent, there was nothing in this Country, save <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Squashes, not one tame Creature, save our Dogs, nor any thing made of Metal, nor the least step of Literature; nor did the <hi>Indians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be invested with the property of the Soil, save where they had improved if <hi>that</hi> till <hi>the English</hi> possessed them therewith; designing Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to take Umbrage for a colour and pretence to Monopolize Lands, which they have effected one or two hundred miles deep into the back Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, more or less; also in Towns, to the Inslaving of their Brethren. For the Earth by God is as freely given to the Species Man, as the light and influence of the Sun, or as the Air we brethe in, &amp; is as necessary for his subsisting, and ought to be as free to the Improver. For,</p>
            <p>What necessity for any Men to have such great quantities of Dormant Lands more than they can improve, (is it not the effect and fruit of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Spirit, &amp; what is worse) that they may reap the Effects of the Farmers, and Labouring Mens Industry; knowing, that Farmers cannot live, nor the World be supported but by Farmers and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers subduing and improving the Earth; and therefore by their Monopolizing Dormant Lands, they bring the Farmer under a necessity to Buy of them, and give them their Price.</p>
            <p>And so great a Price do Farmers give for Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant Lands, that when they are improved, if you 
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002346_0016_0FDB2CF19F3D15E8"/>
compute what the Building, Subduing, Fence and Fencing, breaking up the Land, &amp; all other Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amounts to; suppose that Labourers were Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do all the Work (except some few instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) their Farms would not Sell for more, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Farms not for so much as to pay the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; (only near Navigable Rivers, where Timber and Wood is worth Money to carry to <hi>Boston,</hi> or some Fire-works that for Cole enables the Farmer to clear his Land) therefore generally what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the Farmer gives for Dormant Lands, is so much to the Monopolizer for nothing; for if he Sells his Farm for no more than will pay for his Labour done upon it, then he loseth all he paid for the Purchase.</p>
            <p>Government is the Appointment of God for Good to the Species Apostate Man, and while it moves in its proper channels of Love, Truth Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Equity and Mercy, its sovereign Authority is the greatest resemblance of God we have on Earth; but if reversed, the greatest resemblance of Satan, &amp; of the Tyranny &amp; Oppression of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Government is the Foundation of all Humane Societies, and the Vital Spirit &amp; Conduct there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, appointed of God for Peoples Safety &amp; Utility.</p>
            <p>Princes in Possession of Government ought not to Sacrifice Divine Donations to that great and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Universal Idol Self, nor to their Families, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, Friends, Parasites, Companions, Servants, nor to their Personal Circumstances, to make themselves or their Great and Honourable, by any Distributions, Exactings or Delaves contrary to Divine Appointment, thereby wronging &amp; griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Subjects, and frustrating the Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; thereby misapplying the Power given to them. For they are Gods Stewards, and must give a strict Account to him for both Persons and Things committed to their Charge and Care; 
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002346_0017_0FDB2CF2D5058BC8"/>
therefore their safest course is to have special Regard to the Divine Mind in all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may give up their Account with Joy, and be the Subjects of that Blessed Sentence, <hi>Well done,</hi> &amp;c. and receive that great Reward; <hi>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>It's granted, that Government hath a Divine Rightful Power to Distribute, Proportion, Order &amp; Dispence with Wisdom and good Conduct to their Subjects, without Price or Purchase; that which God hath freely given to them, dividing this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness into Townships, and the Towns into Farms, (quantity and quality considered) appointing the places for Habitation, best for Defence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, setting off proper Commonages, Roads &amp; High ways; also all Publick Buildings &amp; Revenues thereto; and then whoever will freely, without price or purchase, according to Divine Donation, Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon, and Improve a Farm so appointed, and that Farm to be his Fee Simple for ever; and when one Town is full, to set off more; which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal had it been put in practice by the First Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the Province by this time, would have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the Direction and Conduct of Good &amp; Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Laws, and have Good Men advanced to Execute the same, Wise Men fearing God, and hating Coveteousness; I say, hating Coveteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for it is the root of all Evil; <hi>that the bonds of wickedness may be loosed, and heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens taken off, and the Oppressed go free; yea, break every Yoke.</hi>

            <p>I Appeal to you Fathers, Honourable and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved! If a Parent, or any Man Give &amp; Bequeaths Legacies, whether the Legatees may not demand of the Executors? and if they refuse to Pay, Sue them for, and Recover their Legacies.</p>
            <p>And is not God as much the Donor of this Earth, as any Parent or Man is of their Estates? Or is not that Species Man the Donees of this Earth, so much as any Legatees are the Donees of Legacies? Or is not this Earth the Donation of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to that Species Man? (as hath been proved) Or is it only given to a few of them, and the rest to be their <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vassals,</hi> to Subdue, Replenish and Improve this Earth for them? And the Monopolizers to have all the fruits of their Labours.</p>
            <p>Pray consider the State and Condition of this <hi>Province!</hi> Suppose but One hundred Towns (tho' there is more) and that every year ten good Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Sons, one Town with another, wants each of them to purchase One hundred Acres of Land, for a Farm to Settle upon, and <hi>give</hi> only <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> an Acre, which is less by half then will purchase good Land, that lies commodiously; How great a Sum doth it amount to? no less than <hi>One Hundred Thousand Pound.</hi> How shall this be paid, either by their Parents, or their Sons, or both? Two times the number of Bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Youth, or their paying double the Sum comes to more Money, or Bills of Credit then there is 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002346_0019_0FDB2CF7F32AFBD8"/>

            <p>If any such Monopolizers, Oppressors and Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers be in our Legislative Assemblies, is it not high time in our Elections, to leave them out?</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Jerfies,</hi> the Proprietors Demands was but one half-penny an Acre; at which lay, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres is but <hi>Four Shillings</hi> and <hi>two pence</hi> Yearly; which no doubt might be bought off for twenty years value, which is but <hi>Four Pound Three Shillings</hi> and <hi>four pence</hi> for one hundred A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; but suppose <hi>One Penny</hi> an Acre, then it will but amount to <hi>Eight Pound Six Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight pence,</hi> clear of all Quit-Rents; but with us if good, and lies commodious, it will fetch <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four Hundred Pounds,</hi> though no Work done upon it.</p>

            <p>Monopolizing the Common Earth, subjects this Colony to the greatest Slavery, especially Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Husbandmen, Labourers, late Comets and their Progeny; for without Earth for them to Work upon, they cannot follow their Callings; for they having no Land, either must Bay of the Dormant Lands, or must become Barriers to the Monopolized Lands lately set off for that end, and there be exposed to the insults of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and be excluded the convenience of Life, for the good of both their Souls and Bodies.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Nor doth giving the Farmer one half of their Monopolized Lands mend the matter; it is but a bait to draw them to go and improve there; for when they have improved, the Monopolizer rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth on the remaining Moiety more than six times the first Value; which the Farmer, his Children or others, must of necessity Buy to Improve, or lie under the same Disadvantages as before; nor doth it mend the matter to give a Township to a few men, for in a little time they divide the Land among themselves, &amp; then all after Comers must Buy of them: this Monopolizing of Lands runs some Parallel with Stock Jobbing, which never helps, but always hurts a Country.</p>
            <p>Here is a vastly great and desirable Continent, extending from 25 to 52 degrees in <hi>North</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; the difference of Latitude is 27 degrees, which according to the <hi>English</hi> Computation makes 1620 Miles.</p>
            <p>And we are in Possession of all the Sea Coasts, save Cape <hi>Brettoon,</hi> which are full of good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and a multitude of Islands, replenished all along the Coast with great plenty of all sorts of Fish and Fowl, and a back Wilderness of <hi>very good</hi> Arable Land, of vast and unknown extent; all Uninhabited, except a few scattering <hi>Indians,</hi> which are mostly, if not all Civilized, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>This part of the Continent lieth in a good Climate, a very healthful Air; there is no sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, as in the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts; and if here were

ten Millions more of People, here is Land and Room enough for many times more; and then every thing would be much more plentiful, and for the better Living: for the Honour, Riches, Plenty and Strength of a Country consists in the Multitude of People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If this Earth were not Monopolized, we should have a multitude more Farmers and Labourers; every one that could would Farm it, and every one that had Money, would Hire, Buy or send for Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Labourers, that they might have a Farm; and thereby the Necessaries and Comforts of Life would be plentiful and cheap; and all Artificers would live cheaper, and their Work would be better and cheaper: and then we should Import less, and Export more, which would be the making of this Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taxing Monopolized Dormant Lands a just and speedy Remedy, and no Person hurt, nor unjustly treated, but gainers thereby. For,</p>
            <p>If all Visible Estates ought to be Taxed for the Support of <hi>Government,</hi> then all Dormant Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized Lands ought to be Taxed.</p>
            <p>If Moral and Paenal Evils ought to be Taxed till they be removed, then so far as Monopolizing Lands is a Moral and Paenal Evil, it ought to be Taxed till it be removed; that is improved, or given up to the <hi>Government,</hi> that they may see thereto.</p>
            <p>Nor will any Person be unmercifully or unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated, nor be a loser, but a gainer thereby; for now the Monopolizers are circumscribed, bounded and limited; but if the Common Earth were made Free for the Improver, and laid forth in Townships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as hath been proposed) <hi>Page</hi> 11, then whosoever would without being limited, might fill up the whole Province with improved Farms; it would be all before them; whereas 
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002346_0024_0FDB2D03106046A8"/>
now they are limited, so that the Monopolizers if they mean the Good of the Country, that is to improve it, would be gainers thereby, but if they mean to live upon, &amp; reap the fruits of <hi>the</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man &amp; Labourers Industry, then thereby prevented they are, and should be from so greatly oppressing and burdening their poor industrious Labouring Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Monopolizers of Dormant Lands would be the Lords of this Continent, and necessitate the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, their Families, and Posterity, to give them the benefits of all their Labours, from Generation to Generation, for Liberty or Deeds from them, to improve the Common Earth, (which God hath freely given to the Improver) and so the Continent would be the Monopolizers Property, and all Farmers and their Posterity the Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers <hi>Slaves</hi> for ever; for they will keep Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing this Continent faster than the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Farmer can Improve it.</p>
            <p>It would be a much easier Lay for the Farmer to hold his Land from the Crown and Nation of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> paying <hi>One Penny</hi> an Acre Quit-Reat, for that would be laid out for the Support of the <hi>Government,</hi> (and in a short time how great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> would it amount to?) and then Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es would be so much the less, and thereby the Subject as much eased in Taxes, as the paying of Quit-Reats amounts to; but now the Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers goes away with all, and Contributes nothing for the Support of Government, nor hath done for this 100 years past.</p>
            <p>May there be a Cry throughout all your Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no Monopolizers, no biting Usurers; for there is more Electors that are neither Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers and biting Usurers then that are such, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being in your Power, shew your selves once more Free-men, and be not over-awed by any

            <p>I Appeal to you our most Learned, Reverend &amp; Pious Seers, to read, &amp; weigh in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, judge &amp; determine with your Spiritual Understanding; and what is contrary to right judgment, condemn and cast over-board, and what agreeable thereto, and for the best good of this Province, justifie and maintain convincing all Gain-sayers; Is it not your Duty, and your great abilities, both natural and acquired; also your faithfulness not only enables, but also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you thereto, for you are to be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
