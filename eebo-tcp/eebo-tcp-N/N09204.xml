            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p ana="#role_commentary">And firſt, the Reſpondent begs leave to obſerve of the Complaint, that it had its origination in a reſentment againſt the Reſpondent, for his being charged with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain orders of his Majeſty relating to the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and his declaring his intention to obey ſuch orders. This will appear from the Journals of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, where it will be ſeen, that on <hi>June</hi> 21ſt, 1768, the Reſpondent ſent a meſſage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing an extract of a letter from the Secretary of State to him the Reſpondent, ſignifying his Majeſty's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he ſhould require the Houſe to reſcind a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a former Houſe, and declare their diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſame. On <hi>June</hi> 23d, the Houſe deſired the Reſpondent would give them a copy of the other part of the Secretary of State's letter. On <hi>June</hi> 24th, the Reſpondent ſent a copy of the other part of the letter, by which he was ordered, in caſe of refuſal, to diſſolve the Aſſembly; and ſaid, that, if they obliged him to it, he muſt obey his orders. On <hi>June</hi> 30th, the Houſe paſſed a Vote, that they would not reſcind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paſſed an anſwer to the Reſpondent to that purpoſe, immediately after which, they appointed a committee to prepare a petition to the King to remove the Governor. The petition being ready prepared, was immediately reported and read; and upon debate, it being objected that there was no proof of the facts alledged, the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was recommitted, and the committee was ordered to bring evidence in ſupport of divers articles. Thus it reſted until a new Aſſembly met in <hi>May,</hi> 1769, when this Complaint was revived, with ſome little alteration, and ſome additional articles ariſing from new facts; and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011730_0002_0F881C60E2231708"/>
notwithſtanding it had been before rejected for want of proof, it was now admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any proof, and paſſed the Houſe the 27th day of <hi>June</hi> 1769. It has been ſince circulated throughout <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in News-Papers, Magazines and Pamphlets; it has been commented upon, and argued from, as true, in different Papers; and the Reſpondent has been called upon, by anonymous writers, to anſwer this complaint before the public, whilſt he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to obtain a hearing of it before the King in Council, and the Agent for the Complainants was doing all he could to prevent it, under a pretence of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for proofs.</p>

               <p n="1" ana="#role_commentary">1. And the Reſpondent, further anſwering, ſaith, That the firſt article is notoriouſly untrue, it being well known to all who are acquainted with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Maſſachuſet's-Bay,</hi> that from the time of the preſent Governor's (the Reſpondent's) entering upon that government, which was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1760, until the oppoſition made to the Stamp-act, which began in the year 1765, a very good underſtanding and agreement of ſentiments and actions between the Governor and the Aſſembly, in both its branches, continually prevailed; of which the Journals of the Houſe afford many pregnant proofs. But, after the oppoſition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was adopted by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, it became impoſſible for the Reſpondent, or any Governor, to do his duty and preſerve his popularity.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2" ana="#role_commentary">2. The Reſpondent admits, that he did declare that the General Aſſembly left Gentlemen out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil only for their fidelity to the Crown; and if this is to be deemed oppugnation againſt the royal authority, he admits this article to be true. And to juſtify ſuch declaration he obſerves, that, upon the election of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors in <hi>May</hi> 1766, (which was about a month after they had received advice of the repeal of the Stamp-act) the majority of the General Aſſembly turned out the Lieutenant Governor (who was alſo Chief Juſtice of the Province) the Secretary, two other Judges of the Superior Court, and the Attorney General, all of them men of irreproachable characters, and high eſtimation among the people. There was no accounting for the depriving the government of the ſervice of men of ſuch high offices, and known abilities and integrity, but from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011730_0003_0F881C61A22A27A0"/>
an intention to lower the King's authority in the government, and reduce the royalty of it to mere form, and veſt all the real power in the people. That this was and is ſtill the intention, has been ſince made plain by further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſubſequent elections, in which every Counſellor who has been known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or even ſuſpected to be diſpoſed to ſupport the authority of the King and Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or the royal rights of the provincial government, has been turned out of the Council. The Reſpondent begs leave to refer to a liſt of counſellors who have been thus turned out at the four laſt elections, which, by an enquiry into the characters of the perſons from thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the province, will fully prove the aſſertions above mentioned.</p>

The Reſpondent admits, that, ſince the excluſion of the Lieutenant Governor, Secretary, Judges, and Attorney General, from the Council, he has repeatedly uſed the right given to the Governor by the Charter, of negativing perſons elected for Counſellors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him for his approbation; but he denies that he has acted therein indiſcreetly or wantonly, or upon any other motive than that of promoting the King's ſervice. He has, from time to time, ſignified to his Majeſty's miniſters the principles upon which he formed his conduct in this reſpect, and has had the honor to have ſuch conduct approved of by his Majeſty, as it was ſignified to him by the Earl of <hi>Shelburne,</hi> at that time one of his Majeſty's principal ſecretaries of ſtate, by his letter dated Sept. 17, 1767, which was after the ſecond time of his exerciſing his negative; from which letter he begs leave to inſert the following words:
 <q>I have the pleaſure to ſignify to you his Majeſty's approbation of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to acquaint you, that He is graciouſly pleaſed to approve of your having exerted the power lodged in you by the conſtitution of the Province of <hi>Maſſachuſet's-Bay,</hi> of negativing Counſellors in the late elections, which appears from your ſeveral letters to have been done with due deliberation &amp; judgment.</q>

The Reſpondent denies this article to be true, ſo far as it relates to the inforcing the re-election of his favorites; for he has no favorites in reſpect to the government, but ſuch as have recommended themſelves by fidelity to the King, and ability to ſerve him. In this light the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011730_0003_0F881C61A22A27A0"/>
may be conſidered as his favorites; and if ſuch declaration was made, it was in favour of them and them only: And he believes he did make ſuch declaration upon the following account. Upon the excluſion of theſe two gentlemen from the Council (of which they had been Members for many years, and by their particular functions, as well as their knowledge of the public buſineſs, were become almoſt neceſſary to that body) upon enquiry into the conſtitution of the preſent government, it appeared from the uſage under the former Charter, from conſiderations previous to the granting the preſent Charter, from the words of the Charter itſelf, and from the practice of the firſt year after the opening the Charter, that the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary had a right to ſeats and voices in the Council in virtue of their offices, and without being elected thereto, and did actually enjoy ſuch right for one year as aforeſaid. But upon the election of a new Council at the end of the firſt year, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly elected the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary among the twenty-eight elective Councellors, inſtead of permitting them to be ſuperadded to the elective Councellors, as was deſigned by the Charter, and practiſed the year before. The Lieutenant Governor and Secretary acquieſcing in this, probably from their unwillingneſs to diſpute with the Aſſembly, upon whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, ſubmitted to take their ſeats as elected Councellors, inſtead of official members of the Council. And this method prevailing ever after, the King has by theſe means been deprived of the ſervice of his Lieutenant Governor and Secretary, the nomination of whom he had reſerved to himſelf, in his Council, where it appears to have been intended they ſhould have ſeats in virtue of their offices.

As for the charge itſelf, the fact was this: Having received his Majeſty's orders to take every neceſſary ſtep for the accommodation of his troops at <hi>Boſton,</hi> he applied to the Council, to the Select-Men of the town, and to all the juſtices in the town, whom he called together for that purpoſe, being all the perſons that could be pointed out by the Act of Parliaments for quartering ſoldiers, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſeparately, deſiring them to provide quarters for the ſoldiers. This they all refuſed to do; ſo that when the commanding officer found himſelf obliged to land two regiments at <hi>Boſton,</hi> there were no quarters for them. Whereupon the commanding officer applying to the Reſpondent to provide a covering for one of the regiments, who had no camp-equipage with them, until they could hire buildings at the King's expence to make barracks of, the Reſpondent aſſigned to them ſeveral rooms in the Town-houſe, which were not then in uſe, among which was the Repreſentatives chamber; and there the regiment remained, without any inconvenience to the public, or any perſons whatſoever, until barracks were provided for them. What enhances the falſity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011730_0006_0F881C63E23406F8"/>
and virulence of this charge is, that the party who has preferred it knew that the Reſpondent acted in this buſineſs under the King's ſpecial orders, and that his Majeſty has ſince been pleaſed to ſignify his full approbation of his Conduct, under the difficulties that were continually thrown in his way. And yet they have had the boldneſs in this indirect manner to arraign his Majeſty's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for iſſuing orders, with which the Reſpondent had nothing to do but to obey.</p>

               <p n="14" ana="#role_commentary">14. This article is of the ſame complexion with the preceeding, but much more falſe and prevaricating. The fact upon which it is founded is this: The King ordered two Regiments, to be ſent from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be landed at <hi>Boſton;</hi> and alſo two other Regiments to be ſent from <hi>Halifax</hi> to <hi>Boſton.</hi> The two Regiments from <hi>Halifax</hi> arrived firſt; and the commanding officer, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to the Reſpondent that he had orders to ſtation both thoſe regiments at <hi>Boſton,</hi> demanded quarters. The Reſpondent conſulted the Council, and by their advice applied to the Select men of the town, and then to the Juſtices of Peace, and laſt of all to the Council themſelves: But they all refuſed to aſſign any quarters to the two regiments, under different pretences; the principal of which was, that they ought to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at the caſtle, upon an iſland, diſtant from the town of <hi>Boſton</hi> three miles by ſea and ſeven miles by land, where there were barracks that would hold only one regiment, and that but inconveniently, as has been ſince proved. And though the impoſſibility of quartering four regiments in barracks that could hold but one, and the impropriety of quartering troops in an iſland diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from <hi>Boſton,</hi> which were expreſſly ordered to be ſtationed at <hi>Boſton,</hi> were urged again and again, they ſtill perſiſted in refuſing quarters: Wherefore the Commander in Chief found himſelf obliged to hire buildings, and fit them up for barracks, at the King's expence, for three of the regiments, after having aſſigned the barracks at the Caſtle for the other regiment. And endeavors were uſed to defeat even this the only method left for executing the King's commands; for it was given out by the faction, that if any ſoldiers were put into ſuch barracks, the officers commanding ſuch ſoldiers would be proſecuted for quartering ſoldiers
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011730_0007_0F881C64A224B130"/>
without the interpoſition of a magiſtrate, contrary to the Mutiny-Act, and, being convicted thereof by two juſtices, would incur the penalty of being caſhiered: To prevent this abuſe of the act, the Reſpondent, at the requeſt of General <hi>Gage,</hi> Commander in chief, granted a commiſſion to an officer of his to place the ſoldiers in the barracks, which ſhould be provided for them at the King's expence. And this is the fact upon which the charge againſt the Reſpondent, for evaſively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing an officer to provide quarters for the troops otherwiſe than is preſcribed by the act, is founded. The Reſpondent is ſorry that he is obliged, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned generality of the charge, in his defence thereto, to ſtate ſuch a detail of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, prevarications, and contempt of law and authority, in the promoters of the accuſation againſt him: But it is all to be accounted for by the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of one maxim, which originated with the faction, and has lately been adopted by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, That the King has no right to order any of his troops into any of the <hi>American</hi> provinces, without being firſt authorized ſo to do by an Act of the provincial Aſſembly. And from this pretenſion the tranſition is eaſy to the preſumption of petitioning the King to puniſh an officer of his, for obeying his commands, and aſſiſting to carry his orders into execution.</p>

This ſoleciſm in policy has been as hurtful in practice as it is abſurd in Theory, and is the true cauſe of the extreme imbecility of the power of the Crown in this government, at Times when the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is moſt wanted. This is not an obſervation of a new date; it is of many years ſtanding; and the avowal of the Reſpondent's opinion on this occaſion, is not to be reckoned from the date of his Letters to the Earl of <hi>Hillsborough:</hi> He has made no ſcruple to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſentiments upon this ſubject, ever ſince he has felt the effects which the popular conſtitution of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011730_0008_0F881C65621B4708"/>
Council has had upon the Royalty of the government, which as above three years ago; within which time, he has ſeen the King deprived of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of every man at the Council Board who has had reſolution enough to diſapprove the oppoſition to the authority of the King and the Parliament, and their ſupremacy over the <hi>American</hi> colonies. This, and this only, is the foundation of the charge of his endeavouring to overthrow the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereas his real deſire has been, that the Charter ſhould have a more durable ſtability, by means of a neceſſary alteration, without which, he is perſuaded it cannot have a much longer duration; as the abuſe of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Council now prevailing, muſt oblige the Parliament to interfere ſooner or later. And therefore he is perſuaded, that, in avowing this opinion, he has acted not only as a faithful ſervant to the King, and a true ſubject of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but alſo as a real friend of the province of <hi>Maſſachuſet's-Bay,</hi> whoſe true intereſt it is, to have its government ſo confirmed and eſtabliſhed, that it may not be liable to be continually diſturbed and diſgraced by factions and deſigning men, as it is at preſent.</p>

The Reſpondent denies, that by the means men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid complaint, or by any other means, he has rendered his adminiſtration odious to the whole body of the people. He denies, that the opinion of the whole people of that province can now be taken and aſcertained, labouring as it does at preſent, under the baneful influence of a deſperate faction, who, by raiſing groundleſs fears and jealouſies, by deluding one part of the people and intimidating the other part, has deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all real freedom, not only of action, but even of ſentiment and opinion. But the Reſpondent doubts not but that his adminiſtration has been approved of by the generality of the beſt and moſt reſpectable men in the province; and aſſures himſelf, that notwithſtanding that, in the courſe of the late diſputes, he has been obliged by his duty to give his teſtimony againſt ſome popular prejudices, when the preſent infatuation ſhall ceaſe, and truth and reaſon ſhall be allowed to interpoſe, he ſhall be acknowledged to have been a faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the King, and a real friend of the people.

            <head>The following is the Report of the Lords of the Committee relative to the foregoing Complaint, &amp;c. March 7. 1770.</head>
            <p>"THE Lords of the Committee conſidering, that the complainants ought to have been prepared with evidence to ſupport their charges, at the time of preſenting the ſame, or within a reaſonable time after, or at leaſt, that they might have been ſufficiently prepared ſince the bringing into the Houſe of Repreſentatives the former petition to remove the Governor in June 1768. And further, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives having omitted to ſend over to their Agent, the documents neceſſary to make good their complaints, although it appears by the printed journals of the aforeſaid Houſe, that they continued ſitting eighteen days after the paſſing of the ſaid Order, 27th of June 1769, could only be with a view of keeping up the ſpirit of clamour and diſcontent in the ſaid province. And conſidering likewiſe that the ſaid articles of complaint againſt the Governor, could not be ſuppoſed to affect the Governor; but are rather a charge againſt your Majeſty's government: Their Lordſhips are therefore of opinion, upon the whole, that the ſeveral charges contained in the ſaid petition of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of Maſſachuſets-Bay, are groundleſs, vexatious and ſcandalous; and that the ſaid petition ought to be diſmiſſed."</p>
