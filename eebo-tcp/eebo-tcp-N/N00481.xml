            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE are sorry that we should have occasion to publish such Account of things, in the open View of all, who may read the following Account, or hear of it, that may be occasion of Grief to many, especially who had better Thoughts of some here-away, than the said Account doth give of them; and it is too probable, the Enemyes of Truth and of all true Religion, will seek to take Advantage there from, and think themselves greatly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thereby, so as to rejoyce the more in their Iniquity, and glory over the sincere Lovers and Professors of Truth. But as on the one hand, we have been deeply afflicted with sorrow to find some so highly pretending to Truth, and to the inward and immediate Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit of Truth, which they have greatly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and some of them have preached for some Years, so very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unsound in some of the chief and Fundamental Principles of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and so resolute and confident in their Ignorance and Error, that they have from time to time refused and rejected good and seasonable Information, and means of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that have been in love held forth unto them, partly in publick Testimonies, and partly in private Meetings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

many; and we may sincerely and uprightly say, They, and not We, have discovered and made Publick these things; for when they heard true and sound Doctrine preached, concerning <hi>Christ and the true Faith in him, &amp;c.</hi> they have whispered against it, and publickly rejected it, which yet hath been greatly refreshing and edifying to us, and to many others, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elt the Power of Christ accompanying that Doctrine, and sealing to the Truth of it in our hearts; so that not only we have owned and do own the Doctrine that hath been preached among us, of late Times, by divers that God hath raised up in a zealous Testimony to the Truth of these things (<hi>Denyed</hi> by <hi>some,</hi> and <hi>Rejected</hi> by <hi>others,</hi> and <hi>meanly esteemed</hi> by <hi>too many,</hi> as not Necessary, but Indifferent matters to Salvation, to be believed, though true) but also, we have owned, and do own the Spirit by which that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath been zealously delivered unto us, being perswaded, it was of God; and we do not judge so rashly and uncharitably as some do, calling that sincere and godly Zeal, that hath appeared in some among us in publick Testimonies, <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi>: But it is no new thing to hear Light call'd Darkness, as well as Darkness called Light, and Good Evil, and Evil Good; we believe, and are perswaded, that as to the main, it hath been and is a sincere godly Zeal, that hath been of Gods raising in some of our Brethren, both to preach in publick Testimonies this Doctrine, so much of late contradicted by some, and slighted by others, and to defend it with gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now that these men have been the Discoverers of their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Error and Unbelief, is very apparent, because they not only
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000606_0004_0FA95D1690E103B0"/>
dared to whisper against found Doctrine in private, but openly in Meetings appointed to hear these Differences, and even at Monethly Meetings, they have been so bold as to resist found Doctrine, and show their Unbelief; and the Nature of our Meetings being such, especially our Monethly Meetings, that too many come to them and sit in them, hearing all things there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that are not qualified, either with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Knowledge or Prudence, or indeed with humane Discretion, as men, to conceal things that are not always seasonable to be published, insomuch that scarce any thing hath been said or done in a Monthly Meeting for a long time past, but it is soon after publickly known: And we desire to reverence the Providence of God, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his powerful Hand, Wisdom and Goodness, and great faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this Discovery; for we are well satisfied it is far better that the hidden things of <hi>Esau</hi> be searched and found out, than to remain hid; for when <hi>Achan</hi> had Transgressed in the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> and had hid the accursed thing, the Anger of the Lord was kindled against them until he was discovered, and Judgment executed against him. And seeing it is so, that many evil and hurtful Opinions, that are as poysonous Weeds, have had too much place among us, but have so secretly lurked under Ground, and yet have brought forth bad Fruit above Ground; for it is the Nature of Errors in Doctrine, to produce Errors of Practice, and evil Conversation of Life, that we did not know that such bad Fruits did spring from such bad Principles of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that were held by them, but we did rather impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e them to some other Cause, than to Ignorance or Error in Judgment. We have great cause to rejoyce and bless God that his Light hath made this Discovery among us; for the Light discovereth Darkness, as well of Error and Unbelief, in relation to Doctrine, as in matters of bad Conversation; and we are fully perswaded, that it is an infallible sign of that approaching Glory of Gods blessed Day that is more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be revealed among us, and in us, which many of our faithful Friends have fore-told, as nigh at hand, and all the faithful have much longed and wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and pray in our Meetings, their way both of preaching and praying hath been very offensive to many tender-hearted People, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending greatly to the Spirits Leadings and Movings, when they have expressed very unsound and unsavoury words, and have greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their unskillfullness in the <hi>Mystery of Christ,</hi> both outwardly as he came in the Flesh, dyed and rose again, and is ascended, and the great benefit of his outward Coming to men, as so known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, and as inwardly revealed; so that many who have come to our Meetings have been as a hungery Child that greatly needed the Breast, and thirsted for the sincere Milk of the Word, having heard a great Noise of it, but when they came to suck they did not find that which answered their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another Reason was, <hi>That the Clark and the Monthly Meeting Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rethren at that Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that did adjourn, and met when adjourned, than hath been at many Monthly Meetings here, that have been approved. A 4<hi>th Reason</hi> was, <hi>That the matter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had been a matter of Doctrine, we did, and do assert, That the Monthly Meeting, to wit, consisting of a considerable Number of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000606_0013_0FA95D2290C5F200"/>But whereas some from this would infer, as if <hi>G. K.</hi> denyed any <hi>positive Power of Iudgment to a true Church, or Meeting of true Christians, met together in the Name of Christ, where he is present in the mindst of them G. K.</hi> gave no ground for any such inference, for he doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant, That a true Christian Assembly hath a positive Power of Judgment, when met together in his Name, and that he is present in the midst of them, and is felt and witnessed to guide them in true Judgment. But we all know, that it is possible at times, that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and Prejudice, and Annimosities may prevail in Meetings, that may pretend to meet in the Name of Christ, and also to have him present in the midst of them, and yet where such things prevail, Christ is not in the midst known to give true Judgment, or to guide men to give it, as Friends Letter to us from <hi>London</hi> expresly declareth. And therefore we judge, That <hi>No absolute Submission</hi> should be required of any Member to the Judgment of that Society he belongeth unto in a matter of Truth or Christian Doctrine, or wherein the Conscience is concerned; for it is time enough to submit to the Judgment of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when a man hath heard it, and has brought it to the Ballance and Test of that which giveth true Judgment in every particular, that is in a qualified Frame to understand it, even as Christ said, <hi>As I hear I judge,</hi> John 5.30. And if any be st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But if any say, <hi>At last it was yeilded in the Quarterly Meeting, that the Adjourned Meeting in the School-house was a true Meeting, but an Appeal was made from that Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, and the Quarterly Meeting offering to give a new Iudgment in the Case, and in order thereto ordered</hi> G K. <hi>to with-draw, he refusing so to do, hindered that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the most leading men, were known to be prejudiced against <hi>G. K.</hi> and Parties against him; and <hi>G. K.</hi> did offer very fairly in naming seven or eight Persons, that we know were his opposite Parties (and had been mainly instrumental at former Meetings about a Year ago, and at the time of the Yearly Meeting, to hinder Justice to be done, and true Judgment to be past concerning bringing <hi>W</hi>— to Conviction and Condemnation of his Error) <hi>That if they would go out, he would go out also,</hi> but they who were his manifest opposite Parties, and had manifestly appeared from time to time to excuse and defend <hi>W</hi>— and blame <hi>G.

Besides, things being duely considered, there was no reason that <hi>G. K.</hi> should have gone forth, either at that Meeting or any other, for <hi>G.

K.</hi> nor so much as brought under the Consideration of the Body of the Meeting, only one or two particular Persons fasly accused him, but the thing was never brought to any due Tryal. And here let it be noted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat both the Meeting of Friends of the Ministry at <hi>R. E</hi>'s refusing to answer <hi>G.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000606_0015_0FA95D241640A3D8"/>
given such deep ground of offence, to all of us, with other thing concurring, that because to this day nothing hath been done (it being now above a Year since complaint was made against <hi>W</hi>—) by these of the other side, who meet in a Seperation from us, either to bring <hi>W</hi>— or <hi>T</hi>— to Condemnation, but suffer them to continue to preach and pray in their Meetings; therefore we do justly judge, That the whole Meeting that meet in a Seperation from us, that owneth these men &amp; tollerateth them in their great Errors and Trepasses, are guilty with them, and accountable for their Errors; and therefore according to Christs command recorded in the holy Scripture, we ought to be sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them, altho' (as hath been sufficiently proved) they began the Seperation, and they having begun it, we cannot in Conscience unite in Meetings with them here at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> until they give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Truth in these weighty things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Cause</hi> of the Seperation (which also we lay at their door) is, That whereas in the Monthly Meeting in the first Month last, a Proposition bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000606_0016_0FA95D24CD1ADBC0"/>
case we had been disappointed of the other; and tho' some of us did declare our sincere intention and sense, that it were good but to have one Publick Meeting on first Days, to end about the second hour, and the remaing part to be used for private Meetings in Families, yet their keeping up their publick After-noons meeting, hath given us just occasion at present to have a Publick After-noons Meeting as well as they, for we hope they shall not have any cause to say against us, that we are short of them in our Zeal for good Meetings.</p>
            <p>Things being thus far advanced, and the Seperation being begun, and carried on so far by them, and justly chargeable upon them, some of them having desired us to make some Proposals, or Expedients for healing the Breach, and uniting again as formerly, after some time we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And also, because they cannot set up the present measure of Light and Grace to be sufficient for all time to come, but exhort men to wait and pray in the help of the present measure of Grace received, to receive more Grace from him, who hath the fullness of it, even the <hi>man Christ Iesus.</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> that they cannot set up the Sufficiency of the Light within in opposition to the necessary and great outward helps and means of Salvation, such as the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Teaching of faithful men.</hi> And beside these great Questions and Disputes that have happened among us, there have been others concerning the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Day of Iudgment,</hi> as, <hi>Whether the Saints have got the Resurrection of the Body already?</hi> or <hi>Whether they get it immediately after Death?</hi> or <hi>Whether they wait for it generally unto Christs Coming?</hi> and <hi>Whether Christ is to come without us, to judge the Quick and the Dead?</hi> and <hi>Whether there is any Day of Iudgment beyond the Grave?</hi> and <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any great and general Day of Iudgment that the deceased are in expectation of?</hi> And this is but a hint of these things that have been in Question &amp; Debate amongst us here-away in <hi>Pennsilvania</hi> and <hi>West-Iarsey, &amp;c.</hi> to which many other great &amp; weighty things of <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> do so necessarily relate, that they stand or fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And it is no small grief and wound to us to find some so little concerned about these things, as if they were not so material as to cause any just Seperation or Breach of Fellowship, when we know, that for less Errors many of us have seperated from other Professions; and we cannot but declare before the World, our godly Zeal moveth us to a holy Impatience, that we cannot longer bear (some of us having born the weight of these things for many months) such gross Ignorance and Unbelief, and gross Errors, tending to the denying the Lord that bought us, and making void his Death and Sufferings, without bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witness against them, who either hold them or support and defend them; and we are convinced and perswaded in our Consciences, that God calleth us to seperate from such Unbelievers, and not to be yoked together in Church-fellowship and Discipline with any that we have not proof of by Confession of the mouth, that they are sound in Faith, touching these necessary and Fundamental parts of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000606_0023_0FA95D2DE6450AF8"/>
as well as that their Conversation is such as becometh the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. And we have been so much grieved with the Confusion and Disorder that hath lately happened in our Meetings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of these things, (more like <hi>Babylon</hi> than a Church of Christ) that we have great clearness and peace in the Lord, to retire and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from such disorderly Walkers and Talkers, as we have formerly done from other Professions, to meet together in the Name of Christ, having the true Faith of him, and of his Promise, <hi>To be spiritually present in the midst of us,</hi> and to wait upon him, and be refreshed and edified, whether in Silence or any living Testimony of words that God shall be pleased to enable any among us to bring forth. Yet we design not any Seperation from our Faithful Brethren here or any where else in any part of the World; for we declare, we are one with all our faithful brethren in all parts of the World, both in <hi>Spirit, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice of true Christianity</hi>; and we faithfully believe, that our Faith in all things doth well agree to all our faithful Brethren every where, and is the real, sound and upright Faith, as it hath been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not only by Antient <hi>Christians,</hi> in all Ages of the World, but also by the most sound Antient and Present Friends of Truth, called in scorn <hi>Quakers.</hi> And we altogether deny and disown to be called the Disciples or Proselites of man or men, being spiritually baptized into no other Name than that of Christ Jesus, who was crucified for us and rose again, and whose Disciples and Followers we only desire to be, and to follow none but as they follow him.</p>
