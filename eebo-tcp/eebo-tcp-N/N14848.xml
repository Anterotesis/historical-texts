            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Committee conſiſting of Mr. Beresford, Mr. Jefferſon, Mr. Chaſe, Mr. Spaight and Mr. Read, appointed to take into conſideration the ſtate of Indian affairs in the Southern Department, beg leave to REPORT:</p>
            <p>That a report was made upon Indian affairs in the northern and middle departments, and being amended, was agreed to on the 15th of October 1783: That, as many of the principles contained in that report will apply with equal propriety to the ſouthern depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſenſe of Congreſs was then expreſſed, the committee propoſe, ſo often as the circumſtances agree, to adopt them in the preſent. That the department conſigned to their particular conſideration extends, as it is defined by an act of Congreſs of July 12, 1775, ſo far northward as to include the Cherokees, and ſo far ſouthward as to include all the other ſouthern tribes.</p>
            <p>That all claims made by South-Carolina and Georgia upon the Indians have been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. That in a conference with a deputation of Indians held in Charleſton, South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, in December 1782, by governor Matthews, there appeared in them a pacific diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from the circumſtances in which our treaty with Great-Britain has left the hoſtile Indians, the ſame diſpoſition may be ſuppoſed to be univerſal among them. That the preſervation thereof is an object greatly deſireable; for though a weak, they are a deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive foe; and in a conteſt with them much may be loſt, but nothing won which will be uſeful to us, or which will not be more uſeful when it will be more eaſily won. That if an Indian war ſhould be rekindled, repeated victories might produce the retreat of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, but could not prevent them from regaining poſſeſſion of ſome of the diſtant territory of the United States: That while ſuch temporary expulſions could only be effected at a great charge, they could not be maintained but by numerous garriſons, and an expenſive peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That even if the Indians could be totally expelled, the policy of reducing them to ſuch an extremity is deemed queſtionable; for in caſe of any future rupture with Great-Britain, they would thereby become an uſeful ally to that power, and a formidable enemy to the United States. That it is highly fortunate that in the ſouthern department no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of contention threatens us when we are but little prepared to contend; yet how long that may continue, which at preſent ſeems to be in ſome degree the effect of diſappointment and deſpair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cannot now be aſcertained, and it will probably depend upon the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the occaſion may ſuggeſt. That generoſity, clemency and mercy, ought to appear in the tranſactions of the grand council of the United States, with a people who live in a lamentable ſtate of ignorance and error; and that theſe will perhaps be found ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o compoſe the beſt policy. That ſo often as the intereſts of both parties can be made to accord, mutual advantage ought to be attempted; and that nothing elſe can form ſo ſolid and durable a foundation for harmony and peace. That ſmall benefits ſhould be cheerfully reſigned for the probable attainment of thoſe which are important, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it cannot be preſumed the Indians will in their preſent circumſtances venture upon any extravagant demands.</p>
            <p>That Congreſs, however deſirous they may be to gratify their better feelings in acts of humanity, will not be warranted in advancing beyond the eſſential intereſts of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents: and furthermore, generoſity becomes bankrupt, and fruſtrates its own deſigns by prodigal bounty. That the ſtates which are inhabited by the Indians in the ſouthern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, have in common with the reſt of the United States, pledged themſelves for the payment of the public debts; that juſtice, gratitude and good policy, direct them to make ample proviſion more eſpecially for their own quota of the virtuous army, whoſe patient courage has ſo eminently conduced to the eſtabliſhment of their liberty and independence; that it is become neceſſary by the increaſe of domeſtic population and emigration from abroad, to provide ſpeedily for the ſettlement of their reſpective territories, and their finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not admit of any conſiderable expenditure to extinguiſh the Indian claims upon ſuch lands—The committee are therefore of opinion, that the Indians in the ſouthern depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be prevailed upon to aſcertain and eſtabliſh between the United States and themſelves, ſuch lines of property, and to make ſuch ceſſions of uncultivated land to the ſtates they inhabit reſpectively, as may be convenient to thoſe nations, and commenſurate to the preſent and approaching neceſſities of thoſe ſtates. Nor, in the opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, can the Indians make any reaſonable objection againſt the meaſures recommended. They were themſelves aggreſſors in the war, without even a pretence of provocation; and the barbarities which attend their mode of warfare are too ſhocking and of too great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety to be here recited. Theſe circumſtances are ſufficient to manifeſt the obligation they are under to make atonement for their outrages, and a reaſonable compenſation for the expences and alarms to which they have expoſed their unoffending neighbours; and they poſſeſs no other means to do this act of juſtice than by a compliance with the propoſed terms.</p>
            <p>The committee are of opinion, that care ſhould be taken neither to yield nor require too much; to accommodate the Indians as far as the public good will admit, and to avoid the hazard of a war, the expences of which may exceed the value of the acquiſition fought for: but it is ſuppoſed that when they ſhall have been informed of the damages which our citizens have ſuſtained from their irruptions, and thoſe of their Britiſh ally, all unreaſonable expectations will be ſuppreſſed— Whereupon</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That conventions be held with the Indians reſiding in the ſouthern department, who have taken up arms againſt the United States, for the purpoſe of receiving them into the favor of the United States, and of eſtabliſhing boundary lines of property for ſeparating and dividing the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of the citizens of the United States from the Indian villages and hunting grounds, and thereby extinguiſhing as far as poſſible, all occaſion for future animoſity, diſquiet and co<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tion. That,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:018830_0002_0FA9B58A87AB8810"/>Firſt, and as a preliminary, it ſhall be required, that all priſoners of whatever age or ſex among the Indians, and all fugitive and other ſlaves, ſhall be delivered up.</p>
            <p>Secondly. That the Indians be informed, that after a conteſt of eight years for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of this country, Great-Britain has relinquiſhed to the United States all claim to the country within the limits deſcribed by the ſecond article of the definitive treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and the king of Great-Britain, ſigned on the third day of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the year 1783; that is to ſay,</p>
            <p>(Here inſert the limits.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly. That as the Indians in contempt of every principle of juſtice and humanity, regardleſs of the friendly temper and deſigns of the United States, and in defiance of their power or reſentment, were determined to join their arms to thoſe of Great-Britain and to ſhare her fortunes, ſo conſequently by a leſs generous people than Americans, they might be compelled to retire to the moſt diſtant parts of the continent. But as we prefer cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to rigor, as we perſuade ourſelves that their eyes are open to their error, and that they have found by fatal experience, that their true intereſt and ſafety muſt depend upon our friendſhip; as the country is large enough to maintain and ſupport us all; and as we are diſpoſed to be kind to them, to ſupply their wants, and to partake of their trade; we, from theſe conſiderations, and from motives of compaſſion, draw a veil over what is paſt, and will eſtabliſh a boundary line between us and them, beyond which we will reſtrain our citizens from hunting and ſettling, and within which the Indians ſhall not come but for the purpoſes of trading, treating, or other buſineſs equally unexceptionable. That Congreſs are deſirous that the moſt friendly intercourſe may ſubſiſt between us, and that all commercial tranſactions may be conducted upon the moſt equitable principles, and ſuch as may equally promote the intereſts of both parties. But that they take warning of the perils of a freſh rupture. That a ſecond injury is more grievous than the firſt. That an offence againſt one ſtate will be reſented by the whole. That their friends have deſerted them, and that our arms obliged them to do ſo: that without their friends they muſt be immediately overwhelmed. That we alſo have friends who never deceived us; but on the contrary enabled us to capture an army the loſs of which ruined the Britiſh cauſe in America. That their friends, in the late treaty of peace, left them to the mercy of their enemies, having made no ſtipulation in their favor; yet that we are not diſpoſed to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their diſtreſs: that men ought to be preferred who are merciful as enemies to men who are treacherous as friends.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. The commiſſioners which ſhall be appointed to treat with theſe Indians, are inſtructed to uſe their own diſcretion in eſtabliſhing between the United States and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations of Indians, the moſt advantageous boundary lines to which they can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to accede; unleſs they ſhall hereafter be otherwiſe directed by Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. The commiſſioners are inſtructed to treat with the Indian nations collectively, or at different times and places as they ſhall find moſt conducive to the Intereſt of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, care being taken to avert the miſchiefs which may ariſe from united councils or powerful combinations among the Indians, and to encourage in them every diſpoſition to act independently.</p>
            <p>Sixthly The commiſſioners are inſtructed not to admit into a treaty with the Indians, or ſuffer to be in any manner connected with it, any article, ſtipulation or condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, making or confirming, or tending to make or confirm to any individual or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, any grant or grants of land, whether real or pretended, within the bounds of the United States as before deſcribed. Moreover that no treaty which may have been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Indians by any ſtate or ſtates, and not by the United States in Congreſs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for obtaining land or for any other purpoſe, ſhall be confirmed by the treaty or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties now propoſed to be held; unleſs the ſaid treaties which may have been concluded by ſuch ſtate or ſtates, appear manifeſtly and perfectly conſiſtent with the deſign of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties now propoſed to be held.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. The commiſſioners are inſtructed to take ſecurity from the Indians, for the performance of their engagements, if they ſhall find this meaſure practicable.</p>
            <p>Eighthly. The commiſſioners are inſtructed to warn all perſons not properly authorized, from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Indians. That the commiſſioners do not allow the Indian traders to take advantage of the intoxication of the Indians, or to wrong them in any manner in their dealings: and in order that the traders may be kept under the controul of the commiſſioners, and that their fidelity may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and theſe evils may be prevented, the commiſſioners are inſtructed to put them under the obligation of a bond with good and ſufficient ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Ninthly. The commiſſioners are inſtructed to encourage the Indians to give intelligence of any miſchievous deſigns which may be concerted in any neighbouring tribe againſt the United States; thus will evil be prevented in the firſt inſtance, and the ſtrength of the Indians be divided, and diminiſhed by violated faith, ſhould any tribe, at preſent friendly to us, become in future hoſtile and threaten an invaſion. That the commiſſioners take proper ſteps for obtaining and tranſmitting ſuch intelligence with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Tenthly. That it be recommended to the executive of the ſtate of South-Carolina, to furniſh the commiſſioners which ſhall be appointed to treat with the Indians in the ſouthern department, with all ſuch goods and ſums of money as may be neceſſary at the propoſed treaty or treaties, and fully to carry into effect he views of the United States in Congreſs aſſembled; and that a credit ſhall be allowed to the ſaid ſtate for the amount of ſuch advances as part of the quota of the ſaid ſtate on any of the requiſitions of Congreſs againſt the ſaid ſtate now unſatisfied. But if the ſtate of South-Carolina, ſhould fail to grant the ſupplies above mentioned, that the ſuperintendant of finance be directed to purchaſe goods of ſuch kinds as are moſt uſeful and acceptable to the Indians, to the amount of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  dollars. And that the goods or ſums of money which may be furniſhed by the executive of
<pb facs="unknown:018830_0003_0FA9B58B44393510"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
South-Carolina, or the ſuperintendant of finance, be depoſited in the hands of the commiſſioners, they having previouſly appointed an agent, ſubject to their orders, to take them under his care. That the commiſſioners make the uſual preſents to the Indians at their firſt interview. That the reſt of the goods be diſpoſed of at ſuch prices as ſhall appear to the commiſſioners prudent and convenient.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly. That the commiſſioners uſe ſuch arguments as ſhall appear to them moſt likely to prevail with the Indians, to enter into the ſociety of the citizens of the United States: and that they make them acquainted with ſuch laws as exiſt in the different ſtates, particularly thoſe in their vicinity, for the encouragement of new ſettlers.</p>
            <p>The committee, are moreover of opinion, that commiſſioners not exceeding  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  in number with ſalaries of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  dollars per day each, excluſive of their expences, be immediately appointed with inſtructions to form a treaty or treaties with the Indians in the ſouthern department, upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples contained in the foregoing report, ſo far as ſhall be conſiſtent with the articles of confederation.</p>
            <p>The committee alſo think it adviſeable, that Congreſs recommend that laws be paſſed for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons not authoriſed by Congreſs, from trading with the Indians: alſo for the ſecurity of the Indians, and the puniſhment of thoſe who ſhall invade them, or in any manner treat them unjuſtly, and thereby endanger the tranquility of the United States: alſo to adapt their laws as much as convenient to the purpoſe of inducing the Indians to become citizens.</p>
            <p>The committee upon Indian affairs in the ſouthern department, have alſo been directed to take under conſideration ſeveral papers, conſiſting of a letter from general Wilkinſon, to the preſident, dated falls of Ohio, January 17th, 1784; a letter from Mr. J. Donne, to general Wilkinſon, of the ſame date; a talk of five chiefs of the Chickeſaw nation of Indians, dated Chuck-ul-iſſah, July 20th, 1783, addreſſed to the preſident, and forwarded by Mr. Donne, through general Wilkinſon; alſo a copy of the commiſſion of captain Colbert, taken from the original by Mr. Donne, under which he ſerved the king of Great Britain in the late war, and commanded a volunteer corps of white men and ſouthern Indians, alſo forwarded by Mr. Donne. The committee have attentively peruſed theſe papers, and from the repreſentations they contain, have agreed to report their opinion as follows.</p>
            <p>That long before the declaration of peace with Great Britain, and as early as the beginning of the year 1782, the Chickeſaw nation of Indians made overtures for a peace with the United States, but before a meſſenger diſpatched by general Clark, to aſſiſt in concluding the ſame, could reach their country, the hunting ſeaſon had arrived, and the chiefs were abroad; but that the moſt friendly diſpoſition prevailed throughout the nation; and that they have remained in this diſpoſition ever ſince. That attempts have been made by the Spaniards to attach them to their intereſts, but they prefer a connexion with us, and have formed a reſolution to accept of no advantages, which have been offered to them, unleſs they ſhall be driven to that reſource by our neglect, and are now anxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waiting the reſult of their application to Congreſs. That they have expelled out of their nation, all thoſe who were on the Miſſiſippi, under Colbert, leſt their preſence ſhould be offenſive to the Americans. That although long ſince deſirous of peace, they have been confuſed and perplexed with contradictory accounts, and knew not where they ſhould make their application, whether to any ſtate in their vicinity or to Congreſs. That they were finally determined by the advice of Mr. J. Donne, at this time, or heretofore, an officer of the ſtate of Virginia, (and as the committee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) in the Indian department; and that they promiſed to confide in the anſwer he ſhould return them. That during the Britiſh government, the Indian nations were accuſtomed to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary reſiding among them, who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be known their wants, ſtudied their ruling paſſions, and became ſo uſeful and neceſſary to them that he was ſtyled the <hi>beloved man.</hi> That by his influence it was eaſy to excite them to war or compoſe them to peace. That he could eaſily preclude or expel from among them characters unfriendly to his deſigns. That he acted frequently as a magiſtrate in ſettling diſputes among the Indians, and alſo among the white reſidents; and from his importance with both theſe parties may be ſuppoſed to have been often uſefully employed as a mediator between them. That he prevented innovations on the eſtabliſhed trade of the Indians; and, by keeping a watchful eye over their conduct, with held them from the purſuit of new objects, and ſecured their attachment to his own cauſe. That ſuch a perſon is peculiarly neceſſary at this time among the Chickeſaws, they having made it an earneſt requeſt, being very importunate for ſupplies, particularly ammunition and cloathing, being alarmed and exaſperated by the menaces of miſchievous perſons, who threaten to take poſſeſſion of their country, and being expoſed to the arts of the Spaniards and to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their proferred trade. That captain James Colbert, poſſeſſes conſiderable influence over the Chickeſaws, Chacktaws, and Creeks; and although by his activity againſt the Spaniards during the late war, he had made himſelf very obnoxious to them, yet they have been ſo ſenſible of his importance, as to make propoſals to him; that he has thought proper to decline the ſame, hoping to meet with a favourable reception from the Americans; that ever ſince the peace he has been principally inſtrumental in baffling the Spaniards in their attempts to tamper with the Chickeſaws, and in preſerving order and ſteadineſs among the Indians, and promiſes to employ all his intereſt for theſe purpoſes until he ſhall be informed of the deſtiny which awaits him. That he is diſpoſed to enter into the employment of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, urging, "that his having ſerved his maſter faithfully, ought not to be brought in evidence againſt him, and that he was now deſerted by that maſter." That ſhould the good offices of this man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſome diſadvantage and danger are to be apprehended from his deſpair, that it will therefore be prudent to ſecure him to our party by a ſubordinate office in the Indian department. That Mr. Donne, who has furniſhed Congreſs with the late communications, appears to have obtained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable inſight into Indian affairs, and from the character he ſeems to have ſuſtained, is worthy of the notice of Congreſs: That it is expedient that a talk be forthwith returned by Congreſs, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the talk lately received from five chiefs of the Chickeſaw nation.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the committee have come to the following reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Firſt. That ſuperintendants of Indian affairs be immediately appointed, not exceeding  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap>  in number, with ſalaries of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  dollars each, to reſide at ſuch places as ſhall be named by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed or to be appointed for ſettling a peace with the Indians, in the department to which each ſuperintendant may reſpectively belong: and that they be ſubject to ſuch orders and regulations as ſhall be framed and agreed to by the ſaid commiſſioners in their reſpective departments, until the further pleaſure of Congreſs be known. Moreover that the ſuperintendant of Indian affairs in the diſtrict inhabited by the Chickeſaws be, and he is hereby directed, to employ Mr. James Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, in the ſervice of the United States, in the Indian department, in ſuch manner as ſhall beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the honor and intereſt of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That a committee be appointed to prepare a talk, in anſwer to the talk lately received from five chiefs of the Chickeſaw-nation.</p>
