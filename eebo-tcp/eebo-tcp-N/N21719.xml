            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHILE my heart is following you with a truly pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſolicitude, through all the dangers of military life, in which you are thus early engaged, anxious for your ſafety amidſt the inſtruments of death, and the far more dangerous allurements of vice; I feel a peculiar pleaſure in being able at length, though after ſuch long delays, to put into your hands the MEMOIRS with which I now preſent you. They contain many particulars, which would have been worthy of your attentive notice, had they related to a perſon of the moſt diſtant nation or age: But they will, I doubt not, command your peculiar regard, as they are ſacred to the memory of that excellent man, from whom you had the honour to derive your birth, and by whoſe generous and affectionate care, you have been laid under all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the beſt of fathers could confer on a moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon.</p>
                  <p>Here, Sir, you ſee a gentleman, who with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a liberal and religious education, added to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural accompliſhment that could render him moſt agreeable, entered, before he had attained the ſtature of a man, on thoſe arduous and generous ſervices to which you are devoted, and behaved in them with a gallantry and courage, which will always give a ſplendor to his name among the Britiſh ſoldiery, and render him an example to all officers of his rank. But alas! amidſt all the intrepidity of the Martial Hero, you ſee him vanquiſhed by the blandiſhments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80"/>
and in chace of it plunging himſelf into follies and vices, for which no want of education or genius could have been a ſufficient excuſe. You behold him urging the ignoble and fatal purſuit, unmoved by the terrors which death was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually darting around him, and the moſt ſignal deliverances by which Providence again and again reſcued him from thoſe terrors; till at length he was reclaimed by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorable interpoſition of divine grace. Then you have the pleaſure of ſeeing him become in good earneſt a convert to Chriſtianity, and by ſpeedy advances growing up into one of its brighteſt ornaments; his mind continually filled with the great ideas which the goſpel of our Redeemer ſuggeſts, and bringing the bleſſed influence of its ſublime principles into every relation of military and civil, of public and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life. You trace him perſevering in a ſteady and uniform courſe of goodneſs, through a long ſeries of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and proſperous years, the delight of all that were ſo happy as to know him, and, in his ſphere, the moſt faithful guardian of his country; till at laſt, worn out with honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able labours, and broken with infirmities which they had haſtened upon him before the time, you ſee him forgetting them at once at the call of duty and Providence; with all the generous ardour of his moſt vigorous days ruſhing on the enemies of religion and liberty, ſuſtaining their ſhock with the moſt deliberate fortitude, when deſerted by thoſe that ſhould have ſupported him, and chearfully ſacrificing the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remains of a mortal life, in the triumphant views of a glorious immortality.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, is the noble object I preſent to your view; and you will, I hope, fix your eye continually upon it, and will never allow yourſelf for one day to forget, that this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man is COLONEL GARDINER, your ever honoured fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who having approved his <hi>fidelity to the death</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>a crown of life,</hi> ſeems as it were, by what you here read, to be calling out to you from amidſt <hi>the cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> with which you are ſurrounded, and urging you by every generous, tender, filial ſentiment, to mark the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of his Chriſtian race, and ſtrenuouſly to maintain that combat, where the victory is through divine grace certain, and the prize an eternal kingdom in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80"/>My hopes, Sir, that all theſe powerful motives will eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially have their full efficacy on you, are greatly encouraged by the certainty which I have of your being well acquainted with the evidence of Chriſtianity in its full extent; a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ignorance of which, in the midſt of great advantages for learning them, leaves ſo many of our young people a prey to Deiſm, and ſo to vice and ruin, which generally bring up its rear. My life would be a continual burthen to me, if I had not a conſciouſneſs in the ſight of God, that during the years in which the important truſt of your education was committed to my care, I had laid before you the proofs both of natural and revealed religion, in what I aſſuredly eſteem to be, with regard to the judgment, if they are carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, an irreſiſtable light; and that I had endeavoured to attend them with thoſe addreſſes, which might be moſt likely to impreſs your heart. You have not, dear Sir, forgotten, and I am confident you can never entirely forget, the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity with which I have laboured to form your mind, not only to what might be ornamental to you in human life, but above all to a true taſte of what is really excellent, and an early contempt of thoſe vanities by which the generality of our youth, eſpecially in your ſtation, are debaſed, enerva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed, and undone. My private as well as public addreſſes for this purpoſe will, I know, be remembered by you, and the tears of tenderneſs with which they have ſo often been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied: And may they be ſo remembered, that they who are moſt tenderly concerned, may be comforted under the loſs of ſuch an ineſtimable friend as Colonel Gardiner, by ſeeing that his character, in all its moſt amiable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent parts, lives in you; and that how difficult ſoever it may be to act up to that height of expectation, with which the eyes of the world will be fixed on the ſon of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are, in the ſtrength of divine grace attempting it; at leaſt are following him with generous emulation, and with daily ſolicitude, that the ſteps may be leſs unequal!</p>
                  <p>May the Lord God of your father, and I will add, of both your pious and honourable parents, animate your heart more and more with ſuch views and ſentiments as theſe! May he guard your life amidſt every ſcene of danger, to be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028578_0004_0FD972C4CB4B8A60"/>
a protection and bleſſing to thoſe that are yet unborn; and may He give you, in ſome far diſtant period of time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it by a gentler diſſolution than the hero from whom you ſprung; or if unerring wiſdom appoint otherwiſe, to end it with equal glory.</p>

                  <p n="1">§ 1. WHEN I promiſed the public ſome larger account of the life and character of this illuſtrious perſon, than I could conveniently inſert in my ſermon on the ſad occaſion of his death, I was ſecure, that, if providence continued my capacity of writing, I ſhould not wholly diſappoint the expectation. For I was furniſhed with a variety of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which appeared to me worthy of general notice, in conſequence of that intimate friendſhip with which he had honoured me during the ſix laſt years of his life; a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which led him to open his heart to me in repeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations with an unbounded confidence, (as he then aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, beyond what he had uſed with any other man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) ſo far as religious experiences were concerned: And I had alſo received ſeveral very valuable letters from him, during the time of our abſence from each other, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained moſt genuine and edifying traces of his chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But I hoped farther to learn many valuable particulars from the papers of his own cloſet; and from his letters to other friends, as well as from what they more circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially knew concerning him: I therefore determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the execution of my promiſe, till I could enjoy theſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028578_0005_0FD972C4CD7DA0E8"/>
advantages for performing it in the moſt ſatisfactory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; nor have I, on the whole, reaſon to regret that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. I ſhall not trouble my reader with all the cauſes, which concurred to retard theſe expected aſſiſtances for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a whole year: The chief of them were, the tedious languiſhing illneſs of his afflicted lady, through whoſe hands it was proper the papers ſhould paſs; together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into which the rebels had thrown them, when they ranſacked his ſeat at Bankton, where moſt of them were depoſited. But having now received ſuch of them, as have eſcaped their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p n="5">§. 5. Colonel James Gardiner, of whom we write, was the ſon of Captain Patrick Gardiner, of the family of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Head, by Mrs. Mary H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dge, of the family of Gladſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muir. The Captain who was maſter of a handſome eſtate, ſerved many years in the army of King William and Queen Anne, and died abroad with the Britiſh forces in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, quickly after the battle of Hochſter, through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues he underwent in the duties of that celebrated cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. He had a company in the regiment of foot, once commanded by Colonel Hodge, his valiant brother-in-law, who was ſlain at the head of that regiment, (my memorial from Scotland ſays,) at the battle of Steenkirk, which was fought in the year 1692.</p>
                  <p n="6">§ 6. Mrs. Gardner, our Colonel's mother, was a lady of a very valuable character; but it pleaſed God to exerciſe her with very uncommon trials: For ſhe not only loſt her huſband and her brother in the ſervice of their country, as before related, but alſo her eldeſt ſon, Mr. Robert Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on the day which compleated the 16th year of his age, at the ſiege of Namur, in 1695. But there is great reaſon to believe, God bleſſed theſe various and heavy afflictions as the means of forming her to that eminent degree of piety, which will render her memory honourable as long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. Her ſecond ſon, the worthy perſon of whom I am now to give a more particular account, was born at Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in Linlithgow-ſhire, on the 10th of January, A. D.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028578_0006_0FD972C611F3EE98"/>
1687-8; the memorable year of that glorious revolution which he juſtly eſteemed among the happieſt of all events. So that when he was ſlain in the defence of thoſe liberties, which God then by ſo gracious a providence reſcued from utter deſtruction, <hi>i. e.</hi> on the 21ſt of September, 1745, he was aged 57 years, 8 months, and 11 days.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. The annual return of his birth day was obſerved by him, in the latter and better years of his life, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner very different from what is commonly practiſed: For inſtead of making it a day of feſtivity, I am told, he rather diſtinguiſhed it as a ſeaſon of more than ordinary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God; both in commemoration of thoſe mercies which he received in the firſt opening of life, and under an affectionate ſenſe, as well of his long alienation from the great author and ſupport of his being, as of the many imperfections which he lamented, in the beſt of his days and ſervices.</p>
                  <p n="9">§. 9. I have not met with many things remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the early years of his life, only that his mother took care to inſtruct him with great tenderneſs and affection, in the principles of true chriſtianity. He was alſo trained up in human literature at the ſchool at Linlithgow, where he made a very conſiderable progreſs in the languages. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have heard him quote ſome paſſages of the Latin Claſſicks very pertinently; though his employment in life, and the various turns which his mind took under different impulſes in ſucceeding years, prevented him from cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſtudies.</p>
                  <p n="10">§. 10. The good effects of his mother's prudent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary care were not ſo conſpicuous, as ſhe wiſhed and hoped, in the younger part of her ſon's life; yet there is great reaſon to believe, they were not entirely loſt. As they were probably the occaſion of many convictions, which in his younger years were over-borne; ſo I doubt not, that when religious impreſſions took that ſtrong hold of his heart which they afterwards did, that ſtock of knowledge which had been ſo early laid up in his mind, was found of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſervice And I have heard him make the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an encouragement to parents, and other pious friends, to do their duty, and to hope for thoſe good conſequences of it which may not immediately appear.</p>

Could his mother, or a very religious aunt, (of whoſe good inſtructions and exhortations I have often heard him ſpeak with pleaſure,) have prevailed, he would not have thought of a military life, from which, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, theſe ladies endeavoured to diſſuade him, conſidering the mournful experience they had of the dangers attending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But it ſuited his taſte; and the ardor of his ſpirit, animated by the perſuaſions of a friend who greatly urged it,<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe this to have been Brigadier General Rue, who had from his childhood a peculiar affection for him.</note> was not to be reſtrained. Nor will the reader wonder, that thus excited and ſupported, it eaſily overbore their tender remonſtrances, when he knows, that this lively youth fought three duels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attained to the ſtature of a man; in one of which, when he was but eight years old, he received from a boy much older than himſelf, a wound in his right cheek, the ſcar of which was always very apparent. The falſe ſenſe of honour which inſtigated him to it, might ſeem indeed ſomething excuſeable, in thoſe unripened years, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the profeſſion of his father, brother, and uncle; but I have often heard him mention this raſhneſs with that regret, which the reflection would naturally give to ſo wiſe and good a man in the maturity of life. And I have been informed, that after his remarkable converſion, he declined accepting a challenge, with this calm and truly great reply which in a man of his experienced bravery was exceeding graceful; "I fear ſinning, though you know I do not fear fighting."</p>
                  <p n="12">§. 12. He ſerved firſt as a cadet which muſt have been very early; and then at 14 years old, he bore an enſign's commiſſion in a Scotch regiment in the Dutch ſervice; in which he continued till the year 1702, when (if my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be right,) he received an enſign's commiſſion from Queen Anne, which he bore in the battle of Ramellies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the 19th year of his age. In this ever memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action, he received a wound in his mouth by a muſket-ball, which hath often been reported to be the occaſion of his converſion. That report was a miſtaken one; but as ſome very remarkable circumſtances attended this affair, which I have had the pleaſure of hearing more than once from his own mouth, I hope my reader will excuſe me, if I give him ſo uncommon a ſtory at large.</p>

They ſucceeded much better than was expected; and it may well be ſuppoſed that Mr. Gardiner, who had before been in ſeveral encounters, and had the view of making his fortune to animate the natural intrepidity of his ſpirit, was glad of ſuch an opportunity of ſignalizing himſelf, accordingly he had planted his colours on an advanced ground; and while he was calling to his men, (probably in that horrid language, which is ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a diſgrace to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Not feeling at firſt the pain of the ſtroke, he wondered what was become of the ball, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſurprize began to ſuſpect he had ſwallowed it; but dropping ſoon after, he traced the paſſage of it by his finger, when he could diſcover it no other way: which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as one circumſtance, among many which occur to make it probable that the greater part of thoſe who fall in battle by theſe inſtruments of death, feel very little anguiſh from the moſt mortal wounds.</p>
                  <p n="14">§. 14. This accident happened about five or ſix in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, on the 23d day of May, in the year 1706; and the army purſuing its advantages againſt the French, without ever regarding the wounded (which was it ſeems the Duke of Marlborough's conſtant method) our young officer lay all night in the field; agitated as may well be ſuppoſed, with a great variety of thoughts. He aſſured me, that when he reflected upon the circumſtances of his wound, that a ball ſhould, as he then conceived it, go through his head without killing him, he thought God had preſerved him by miracle; and therefore aſſuredly concluded, that he ſhould live, abandoned and deſperate as his ſtate then ſeemed to be. Yet, (which to me appeared very aſtoniſhing) he had little thoughts of humbling himſelf before God, and returning to him after the wanderings of a life ſo licentiouſly begun.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028578_0007_0FD972CBA53BF3B0"/>But expecting to recover, his mind was taken up with contrivances to ſecure his gold, of which he had a pretty deal about him; and he had recourſe in a very odd expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which proved ſucceſsful. Expecting to be ſtripped, he firſt took out a handful of that clotted gore, of which he was frequently obliged to clear his mouth, or he would have been choaked; and putting it into his left-hand, he took out his money (which I think, was about nineteen piſtoles) and ſhutting his hand, and beſmearing the back part of it with blood, he kept it in this poſition till the blood dried in ſuch a manner, that his hand could not eaſily fall open, though any ſudden ſurprize ſhould happen, in which he might loſe the preſence of mind which that concealment otherwiſe would have required.</p>
                  <p n="15">§ 15 In the morning the French, who were maſters of the ſpot, though their forces were defeated at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came to plunder the ſlain; and ſeeing him to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance almoſt expiring, one of them was juſt applying a ſword to his breaſt, to deſtroy the little remainder of life; when in the critical moment, upon which all the extraordinary events of ſuch a life as his afterwards proved were ſuſpended, a cordelier, who attended the plunderers, interpoſed, taking him by his dreſs for a Frenchman; and ſaid, "Do not kill that poor child." Our young ſoldier heard all that paſſed, though he was not able to ſpeak one word; and opening his eyes, made a ſign for ſomething to drink. They gave him a ſup of ſome ſpirituous liquor, which happened to be at hand; by which he ſaid he found a more ſenſible refreſhment, than he could remember from any thing he had taſted either before or ſince. Then ſigning to the friar to lean down his ear to his mouth, he employed the firſt efforts of his feeble breath in telling him (what, alas was a contrived falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) that he was nephew to the governor of Huy, a neutral town in the neighbourhood, and that, if he could take any method of conveying him thither, he did not doubt but his uncle would liberally reward him. He had indeed a friend at Huy, (who I think, was governor, and if I miſtake not, had been acquainted with the captain his father) from whom he expected a kind reception: but the relation was only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

                  <p>The anguiſh of it engaged him earneſtly to beg that they would either kill him outright, or leave him there to die, without the torture of any farther motion; and indeed they were obliged to reſt for a conſiderable time, on account of their own wearineſs. Thus he ſpent the ſecond night in the open air, without any thing more than a common ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to ſtanch the blood. He hath often mentioned it as a moſt aſtoniſhing providence, that he did not bleed to death; which, under God, he aſcribed to the remarkable coldneſs of theſe two nights.</p>
                  <p n="16">§. 16. Judging it quite unſafe to attempt carrying him to Huy, from whence they were now ſeveral miles diſtant, his convoy took him early in the morning to a convent in the neighbourhood; where he was hoſpitably received, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great kindneſs and tenderneſs. But the cure of his wound was committed to an ignorant barber ſurgeon, who lived near the houſe: the beſt ſhift that could then be made, at a time when it may eaſily be ſuppoſed perſons of ability in their profeſſion had their hands full of employment. The tent which this artiſt applied, was almoſt like a peg driven into the wound; and gentlemen of ſkill and experience, when they came to hear of the manner in which he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wondered how he could poſſibly ſurvive ſuch management. But by the bleſſing of God on theſe applications, rough as they were, he recovered in a few months. The lady ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He received a great many devout admonitions from the ladies there; and they would fain have perſuaded him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what they thought ſo miraculous a deliverance, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the catholic faith, as they were pleaſed to call it. But they could not ſucceed: for though no religion lay near his heart, yet he had too much of the ſpirit of a gentleman, lightly to change that form of religion, which he wore (as it were) looſe about him; as well as too much good ſenſe, to ſwallow thoſe monſtrous abſurdities of popery, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

                  <p n="17">§. 17. When his liberty was regained by an exchange of priſoners, and his health thoroughly eſtabliſhed, he was far from rendering unto the Lord according to that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſplay of divine mercy which he had experienced. I know very little of the particulars of thoſe wild, thoughtleſs, and wretched years, which lay between the 19th and the 30th of his life; except it be, that he frequently experienced the divine goodneſs in renewed inſtances, particularly in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him in ſeveral hot military actions in all which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received ſo much as a wound after this, forward as he was in tempting danger; and yet, that all theſe years were ſpent in an entire alienation from God, and an eager purſuit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal pleaſure, as his ſupreme good. The ſeries of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal amours in which he was almoſt inceſſantly engaged du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, muſt probably have afforded ſome remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adventures and occurrences; but the memory of them is periſhed. Nor do I think it unworthy notice here, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the intimacy of our friendſhip, and the many hours of chearful, as well as ſerious converſe, which we ſpent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I never remember to have heard him ſpeak of any of theſe intrigues, otherwiſe than in the general with deep and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn abhorrence This I the rather mention, as it ſeemed a moſt genuine proof of his unfeigned repentance; which, I think, there is great reaſon to ſuſpect, when people ſeem to take a pleaſure in relating and deſcribing ſcenes of vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which yet they profeſs to have diſapproved and forſaken.</p>
                  <p n="18">§. 18. Amidſt all theſe pernicious wanderings from the paths of religion, virtue, and happineſs, he approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well in his military character, that he was made a lieutenant in that year, viz. 1706: And I am told, he was very quickly after promoted to a cornet's commiſſion in lord Stair's regiment of the Scotch greys; and on the 31ſt of January, in the year 1714-15, was made captain li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Colonel Ker's regiment of dragoons. He had the honour of being known to the Earl of Stair ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was made his aid de-camp; and when, upon his lordſhip's being appointed ambaſſador from his late majeſty to the court of France, he made ſo ſplendid an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paris, Captain Gardiner was his maſter of the horſe;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028578_0009_0FD972D2E1ACD1B0"/>
and I have been told, that a great deal of the care of that admirably well adjuſted ceremony fell upon him; ſo that he gained great credit by the manner in which he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Under the benign influences of his lordſhip's favour, (which to the laſt day of his life he retained,) a captain's commiſſion was procured for him, (dated July 22, in the year 1715,) in the regiment of dragoons commanded by Colonel Stanhope, (now Earl of Harrington;) and, in the year 1717, he was advanced to the majority of that regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in which office he continued till it was reduced, on November the 10th, 1718; when he was put out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But then his majeſty King George I. was ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly apprized of his faithful and important ſervices, that he gave him his ſign-manual, intituling him to the firſt majority that ſhould become vacant, in any regiment of horſe or dragoons; which happened, about five years after, to be in Croft's regiment of dragoons, in which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a commiſſion, dated June the 1ſt, 1724; and on the 20th of July the ſame year, he was made major of an older re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, commanded by the Earl of Stair.</p>
                  <p n="19">§. 19. As I am now ſpeaking of ſo many of his military preferments, I will diſpatch the account of them by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that on the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he continued in this rank, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, till the 19th of April, 1743, when he received a colonel's commiſſion over a regiment of dragoons, lately commanded by Brigadier Bland; at the head of which he valiantly ſell, in the defence of his ſovereign and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, about two years and an half after he received it.</p>
                  <p n="20">§. 20 We will now return to that period of his life which paſſed at Paris, the ſcene of ſuch remarkable and important events. He continued (if I remember right,) ſeveral years under the roof of the brave and generous Earl of Stair; to whom he endeavoured to approve himſelf by every inſtance of diligent and faithful ſervice. And his lordſhip gave no inconſiderable proof of the dependance which he had upon him, when, in the beginning of the year 1715, he intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the important diſpatches, relating to a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which by a ſeries of admirable policy he had made, of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028578_0009_0FD972D2E1ACD1B0"/>
a deſign which the French king was then forming, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Great-Britain in favour of the pretender; in which the French apprehended they were ſo ſure of ſucceſs, that it ſeemed a point of friendſhip in one of the chief counſellors of that court, to diſſuade a dependant of his from accepting ſome employment under his Britannic majeſty, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his envoy there; becauſe it was ſaid, that in leſs than ſix weeks there would be a revolution, in favour of what they called the family of the Stuarts. The captain diſpatched his journey with the utmoſt ſpeed; a variety of circumſtances happily concurred to accelerate it; and they, who remember how ſoon the regiments which that emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy required were raiſed and armed, will, I doubt not, eſteem it a memorable inſtance, both of the moſt cordial zeal in the friends of the government, and of the gracious care of divine providence over the houſe of Hanover, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh liberties, ſo inſeparably connected with its intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="21">§. 21. While Captain Gardiner was at London, in one of the journies he made upon this occaſion, he, with that frankneſs which was natural to him, and which in thoſe days was not always under the moſt prudent reſtraint, ventured to predict, from what he knew of the bad ſtate of the French king's health, that he would not live ſix weeks. This was made known by ſome ſpies who were at St. James's, and came to be reported at the court of Verſailles; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived letters from ſome friends at Paris, adviſing him not to return thither, unleſs he could reconcile himſelf to a lodging in the baſtile. But he was ſoon free from that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; for, if I miſtake not, before half that time was accompliſhed, Louis XIV. died, Sept. 1, 1715, and it is generally thought, his death was haſtened by a very acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumſtance, which had ſome reference to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's prophecy. For the laſt time he ever dined in public, which was a very little while after the report of it had been made there, he happened to diſcover our Britiſh envoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſpectators. The penetration of this illuſtrious perſon was too great, and his attachment to the intereſt of his royal maſter too well known, not to render him very diſagreeable to that crafty and tyrannical prince, whom God had ſo long ſuffered to be the diſgrace of monarchy, and the ſcourge of Europe. He at firſt appeared very languid, as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028578_0010_0FD972DBD1383018"/>
indeed he was; but on caſting his eye upon the Earl of Stair, he affected to appear before him in a much better ſtate of health than he really was; and therefore, as if he had been awakened on a ſudden from ſome deep reverie, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put himſelf into an erect poſture, called up a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured vivacity into his countenance, and eat much more heartily than was by any means adviſeable, repeating it two or three times to a nobleman, (I think the Duke of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,) then in waiting, <q>Methinks I eat very well, for a man who is to die ſo ſoon<note n="*" place="bottom">Il me ſemble, que je ne mange pas mal pour un homme qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This gave occaſion for ſome humorous people to ſay, that old Louis after all, was killed by a Briton. But if this ſtory be true, (which I think there can be no room to doubt, as the colonel, from whom I have often heard it, though abſent, could ſcarce be miſinformed,) it might more properly be ſaid, that he fell by his own vanity; in which view I thought it ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as not to be unworthy a place in theſe memoirs.</p>
                  <p n="22">§. 22. The captain quickly returned, and continued with ſmall interruptions at Paris, at leaſt till the year 1720, and how much longer I do not certainly know. The Earl's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and generoſity made him eaſy in his affairs though he was (as has been obſerved above,) part of the time out of commiſſion, by breaking the regiment to which he belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which before he was major. This was, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, the gayeſt part of his life, and the moſt criminal. Whatever wiſe and good examples he might find in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily where he had the honour to reſide it is certain that the French court, during the regency of the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, was one of the moſt diſſolute under heaven. What, by a wretched abuſe of language, have been called intrigues of love and gallantry, were ſo entirely to the major's then degenerate taſte, that if not the whole buſineſs, at leaſt the whole happineſs of his life conſiſted in them; and he had now too much leiſure, for one who was ſo prone to abuſe it. His fine conſtitution, than which perhaps there was hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y ever a better, gave him great opportunities of indulging himſelf in theſe exceſſes; and his good ſpirits enabled him
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028578_0010_0FD972DBD1383018"/>
to purſue his pleaſures of every kind, in ſo alert and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a manner, that multitudes envied him, and called him, by a dreadful kind of compliment, "the Happy Rake."</p>
                  <p n="23">§. 23. Yet ſtill the checks of conſcience, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining principles of ſo good an education, would break in upon his moſt licentious hours; and I particularly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he told me, that when ſome of his diſſolute companions were once congratulating him on his diſtinguiſhed felicity, a dog happening at that time to come into the room, he could not forbear groaning inwardly, and ſaying to himſelf, "Oh that I were that dog!" Such was then his happineſs; and ſuch perhaps is that of hundreds more, who bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves higheſt in the contempt of religion, and glory in that infamous ſervitude which they affect to call liberty, But theſe remonſtrances of reaſon and conſcience were in vain; and, in ſhort, he carried things ſo far, in this wretched part of his life, that I am well aſſured, ſome ſober Engliſh gentlemen, who made no great pretences to religion, how agreeable ſoever he might have been to them on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, rather declined than ſought his company, as fearing they might have been inſnared and corrupted by it.</p>
                  <p n="24">§. 24. Yet I cannot find, that in theſe moſt abandoned days, he was fond of drinking. Indeed he never had any natural reliſh for that kind of intemperance, from which he uſed to think a manly pride might be ſufficient to preſerve perſons of ſenſe and ſpirit; as by it they give up every thing that diſtinguiſhes them from the meaneſt of their ſpecies, or indeed from animals the moſt below it. So that, if he ever fell into any exceſſes of this kind, it was merely out of complaiſance to his company, and that he might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtiff and ſingular. His frank, obliging, and generous temper, procured him many friends; and theſe principles, which rendered him amiable to others, not being under the direction of true wiſdom and piety, ſometimes made him, in the ways of living he purſued, more uneaſy to himſelf, than he might perhaps have been if he could entirely have out-grown them; eſpecially as he was never a ſceptic in his principles, but ſtill retained a ſecret apprehenſion, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and revealed religion, though he did not much care to think of either, were ſounded in truth. And with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, his notorious violations of the moſt eſſential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of both could not but occaſion ſome ſecret miſgivings

of heart. His continual neglect of the great Author of his being, of whoſe perfections he could not doubt, and to whom he knew himſelf to be under daily and perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, gave him, in ſome moments of involuntary reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inexpreſſible remorſe; and this, at times, wrought upon him to ſuch a degree, that he reſolved he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pay him ſome acknowledgements. Accordingly for a few mornings he did it; repeating in retirement ſome paſſages out of the Pſalms, and perhaps other ſcriptures, which he ſtill retained in his memory; and owning, in a few ſtrong words, the many mercies and deliverances he had received, and the ill returns he had made for them.</p>

I find, among the other papers tranſmitted to me, the following verſes, which I have heard him repeat, as what had impreſſed him a good deal in his unconverted ſtate: and as I ſuppoſe they did ſomething towards ſetting him on this effort towards devotion, and might probably furniſh out a part of theſe oriſons, I hope I need make no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to my reader for inſerting them, eſpecially as I do not recollect that I have ſeen them any where elſe,

But theſe ſtrains were too devout to continue long in a heart as yet quite unſanctified: For how readily ſoever he could repeat ſuch acknowledgments of the divine power, preſence, and goodneſs, and own his own follies and faults; he was ſlopt ſhort by the remonſtrances of his conſcience, as to the flagrant abſurdity, of confeſſing ſins he did not deſire

A model of devotion, where ſuch ſentiments made no part, his good ſenſe could not digeſt; and the uſe of ſuch language before an heart ſearching God, merely as an hypocritical form, while the ſentiments of his ſoul were contrary to it, juſtly appeared to him ſuch daring profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that, irregular as the ſtate of his mind was, the thought of it ſtruck him with horror. He therefore determined to make no more attempts of this ſort; and was perhaps one of the firſt, that deliberately laid aſide prayer, from ſome ſenſe of God's omniſcience, and ſome natural principle of honour and conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="27">§. 27.

Nor was it ſoftened, or awakened, by ſome very memorable deliverances, which at this time he received.— He was in extreme danger by a fall from his horſe, as he was riding poſt, (I think in the ſtreets of Calais) when go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a hill, the horſe threw him over his head, and pitched over him; ſo that when he roſe, the beaſt lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him, and almoſt dead. Yet, though he received not the leaſt harm, it made no ſerious impreſſion on his mind — In his return from England in the packet boat, (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right, but a few weeks after the former accident,) a violent ſtorm, that drove them up to Harwich, toſſed them from thence for ſeveral hours in a dark night on the coaſt of Holland, and brought them into ſuch extremity that the captain of the veſſel urged him to go to prayers immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he ever intended to do it at all; for he concluded, they would in a few minutes be at the bottom of the ſea. In this circumſtance, he did pray, and that very fervently too: and it was very remarkable, that while he was crying to God for deliverance, the wind fell, and quickly after they arrived at Calais, But the major was ſo little affected with what had befallen him, that when ſome of his gay friends, on hearing the ſtory, rallied him upon the efficacy of his prayers, he excuſed himſelf from the ſcandal of being thought much in earneſt, by ſaying, <q>that it was at midnight, an hour when

his good mother and aunt were aſleep; or elſe he ſhould have left that part of the buſineſs to them.</q> A ſpeech, which I ſhould not have mentioned, but as it ſhews in ſo lively a view the wretched ſituation of his mind at that time, though his great deliverance from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was then nearly approaching. He recounted theſe things to me with the greateſt humility, as ſhewing how ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unworthy he was of that miracle of divine grace, by which he was quickly after brought to ſo true, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, a ſenſe of religion.</p>

And I believe it was this, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the deſire of avoiding every thing that might look like oftentation on this head, that prevented his leaving a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten account of it; though I have often entreated him to do it: As I particularly remember I did, in the very laſt letter I ever wrote him, and pleaded the poſſibility of his falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt thoſe dangers, to which I knew his valour might in ſuch circumſtances naturally expoſe him. I was not ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to receive any anſwer to this letter, which reached him but a few days before his death: nor can I certainly ſay, whether he had, or had not, complied with my requeſt; as it is very poſſible, a paper of that kind, if it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, might be loſt amidſt the ravages which the rebels made, when they plundered Bankton.</p>

The ſtory however was ſo remaakable, that I had little reaſon to apprehend I ſhould ever forget it; and yet, to guard againſt all contingencies of that kind, I wrote it down that very evening, as I had heard it from his own mouth: And I have now before me the memoirs of that converſation, dated Aug. 14, 1739, which conclude with theſe words; (which I added, that if we ſhould both have died that night, the world might not have loſt this edifying and affecting hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or have wanted any atteſtation of it I was capable of giving;) <q>N. B. I have written down this account with

all the exactneſs I am capable of, and could ſafely take an oath of it as to the truth of every circumſtance, to the beſt of my remembrance, as the Colonel related it to me a few hours ago.</q> I do not know, that I had reviewed this paper ſince I wrote it, till I ſet myſelf thus publicly to record this extraordinary fact; but I find it punctually to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with what I have often related from my memory, which I charged carefully with ſo wonderful and important a fact. It is with all ſolemnity that I now deliver it down to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as in the ſight and preſence of God. And I chooſe deliberately to expoſe myſelf to thoſe ſevere cenſures, which the haughty, but empty, ſcorn of infidelity, or principles nearly approaching it, and effectually doing its pernicious work, may very probably dictate upon the occaſion; rather than to ſmother a relation, which may in the judgment of my conſcience, be like to conduce ſo much to the glory of God, the honour of the goſpel, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. One thing more I will only premiſe, that I hope, none who have heard the Colonel himſelf ſpeak ſomething of this wonderful ſcene, will be ſurprized if they find ſome new circumſtances here; becauſe he aſſured me at the time he firſt gave me the whole narration, (which was in the very room in which I now write,) that he had never imparted it ſo fully to any man living before. Yet, at the ſame time, he gave me full liberty to communicate it to whomſoever I ſhould in my conſcience judge it might be uſeful to do it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or after his death. Accordingly I did, while he was alive, recount almoſt every circumſtance I am now going to write, to ſeveral pious friends; referring them at the ſame time to the colonel himſelf, whenever they might have an opportunity of ſeeing or writing to him, for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This memorable event happened toward the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of July, 1719. but I cannot be exact as to the day. The major had ſpent the evening (and if I miſtake not, it was the Sabbath,) in ſome gay company, and had an unhappy aſſignation with a married woman, of what rank or quality, I did not particularly enquire, whom he was to attend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at twelve. The company broke up about eleven; and not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he went into his chamber, to kill the tedious hour, perhaps with ſome amuſing book or ſome other way. But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book, which his good mother or aunt had, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſlipped into his portmanteau. It was called, if I remember the title exactly, The Chriſtian Soldier, or Heaven taken by Storm; and was written by Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Watſon. Gueſſing by the title of it, that he ſhould find ſome phraſes of his own profeſſion ſpiritualized, in a manner which he thought might afford him ſome diverſion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to dip into it: but he took no ſerious notice of any thing he read in it: And yet, while this book was in his hand, an impreſſion was made upon his mind (perhaps God only knows how,) which drew after it a train of the moſt important and happy conſequences.</p>

But nothing can be more certain, than that, when he gave me this relation, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to have been as broad awake during the whole time, as he ever was in any part of his life; and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it to me ſeveral times afterwards, as what undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly

[as being, when moſt real, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural impreſſions on the imagination, rather than attended with any external object,] had ſome influence upon him. Yet ſtill it is evident, he looked upon this as a viſion, whether it were before the eyes, or in the mind, and not as a dream.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">§. 32. He thought he ſaw an unuſual blaze of light fall on the book while he was reading, which he at firſt imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might happen by ſome accident in the candle. But lifting up his eyes, he apprehended, to his extreme amazement, that there was before him, as it were ſuſpended in the air, a viſible repreſentation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt upon the croſs, ſurrounded on all ſides with a glory; and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as if a voice, or ſomething equivalent to a voice, had come to him, to this effect, (for he was not confident as to the very words,) <q>Oh ſinner, did I ſuffer this for thee, and are theſe the returns?</q> But whether this were an audible voice, or only a ſtrong impreſſion on his mind equally ſtriking, he did not ſeem very confident; though, to the beſt of my remembrance, he rather judged it to be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Struck with ſo amazing a phaenomenon as this, there remained hardly any life in him, ſo that he ſunk down in the arm-chair in which he ſat, and continued, he knew not exactly how long, inſenſible; (which was one circumſtance, that made me ſeveral times take the liberty to ſuggeſt, that he might poſſibly be all this while aſleep:) but however that were, he quickly after opened his eyes, and ſaw nothing more than uſual.</p>
                  <p n="33">§. 33. It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, he was in no condition to make any obſervation upon the time, in which he had remained in an inſenſible ſtate. Nor did he, throughout all the remainder of the night, once recollect that criminal and deteſtable aſſignation, which had before engroſſed all his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028578_0014_0FD972EFA69B2DC0"/>
thoughts. He roſe in a tumult of paſſions, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and walked to and fro in his chamber, till he was ready to drop down, in unutterable aſtoniſhment and agony of heart; appearing to himſelf the vileſt monſter in the creation of God, who had all his life-time been crucifying Chriſt afreſh by his ſins, and now ſaw, as he aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by a miraculous viſion, the horror of what he had done. With this was connected ſuch a view, both of the majeſty and goodneſs of God, as cauſed him to loath and abhor himſelf, and to repent as in duſt and aſhes. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave judgment againſt himſelf, that he was moſt juſtly worthy of eternal damnation: He was aſtoniſhed, that he had not been immediately ſtruck dead in the midſt of his wickedneſs: And (which I think deſerves particular remark,) though he aſſuredly believed that he ſhould ere long be in hell, and ſettled it as a point with himſelf for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months, that the wiſdom and juſtice of God did almoſt neceſſarily require, that ſuch an enormous ſinner ſhould be made an example of everlaſting vengeance, and a ſpectacle as ſuch both to angels and men, ſo that he hardly durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to pray for pardon; yet what he then ſuffered, was not ſo much from the fear of hell, though he concluded it would ſoon be his portion, as from a ſenſe of that horrible ingratitude he had ſhewn to the God of his life, and to that bleſſed Redeemer, who had been in ſo affecting a manner ſet forth as crucified before him.</p>
                  <p n="34">§. 34. To this he refers in a letter, dated from Douglas, April 1, 1725. communicated to me by his lady<note n="*" place="bottom">N. B. Where I make any extracts as from Colonel Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's letters, they are either from originals, which I have in my own hands, or from copies, which were tranſmitted to me from perſons of undoubted credit, chiefly by the right honorable the lady Frances Gardiner, through the hand of the Rev. Mr. Webſter, one of the miniſters of Edinburgh. This I the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe ſome letters have been brought to me as Colonel Gardiner's, concerning which, I have not only been very dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but morally certain, that they could not have been written by him. I have alſo heard of many, who have been fond of aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, that they were well acquainted with him, and were near him when he fell; whoſe reports have been moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with each other, as well as contrary to that teſtimony relating to the circumſtances of his death, which, on the whole, appeared to me beyond controverſy the moſt natural and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic; from whence therefore, I ſhall take my account of that affecting ſcene.</note>, but I know not to whom it was addreſſed. His words are theſe: <q>One thing relating to my converſion, and a remarkable inſtance of the goodneſs of God to me the chief of ſinners,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028578_0014_0FD972EFA69B2DC0"/>
I do not remember that I ever told to any other perſon. It was this; that after the aſtoniſhing ſight I had of my bleſſed Lord, the terrible condition in which I was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not ſo much from the terrors of the law, as from a ſenſe of having been ſo ungrateful a monſter to him whom I thought I ſaw pierced for my tranſgreſſions.</q> I the rather inſert theſe words, as they evidently atteſt the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which may ſeem moſt amazing in this affair, and contain ſo expreſs a declaration of his own apprehenſion concerning it.</p>
                  <p n="35">§. 35 In this view it may naturally be ſuppoſed, that he paſſed the remainder of the night waking; and he could get but little reſt in ſeveral that followed His mind was continually taken up in reflecting on the divine purity and goodneſs; the grace which had been propoſed to him in the goſpel, and which he had rejected; the ſingular advantages he had enjoyed and abuſed; and the many favours of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which he had received, particularly in reſcuing him from ſo many eminent dangers of death, which he now ſaw muſt have been attended with ſuch dreadful and hopeleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The privileges of his education, which he had ſo much deſpiſed, now lay with an almoſt inſupportable weight on his mind; and the folly of that career of ſinful pleaſure, which he had ſo many years been running with deſperate eagerneſs and unworthy delight, now filled him with indignation againſt himſelf, and againſt the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, by whom (to uſe his own phraſe,) he had been "ſo wretchedly and ſcandalouſly be fooled." This he uſed often to expreſs in the ſtrongeſt terms; which I ſhall not repeat ſo particularly, as I cannot recollect ſome of them. But on the whole, it is certain, that by what paſſed before he left his chamber the next day, the whole frame and diſpoſition of his ſoul was new-modelled and changed; ſo that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and continued to the laſt day of his exemplary and truly chriſtian life, the very reverſe of what he had been before. A variety of particulars, which I am afterwards to mention, will illuſtrate this in the moſt convincing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028578_0015_0FD972F0CD63BFE8"/>
But I cannot proceed to them, without pauſing a while to adore ſo illuſtrious an inſtance of the power and freedom of divine grace, and intreating my reader ſeriouſly to reflect upon it, that his own heart may be ſuitably affected. For ſurely if the truth of the fact be admitted, in the loweſt views in which it can be placed, (that is, ſuppoſing the firſt impreſſion to have paſſed in a dream,) it muſt be allowed to have been little, if any thing, leſs than miraculous. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the courſe of nature be imagined, how ſuch a dream ſhould ariſe in a mind, full of the moſt impure ideas and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and (as he himſelf often pleaded,) more alienated from the thoughts of a crucified Saviour, than from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object that can be conceived: Nor can we ſurely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it ſhould, without a mighty energy of the divine power, be effectual to produce, not only ſome tranſient flow of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but ſo entire and ſo permanent a change in character and conduct.</p>
                  <p n="36">§. 36. On the whole therefore, I muſt beg leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my own ſentiments of the matter, by repeating on this occaſion what I wrote ſeveral years ago, in my eighth ſermon on regeneration, in a paſſage dictated chiefly by the circumſtantial knowledge which I had of this amazing ſtory, and methinks ſufficiently vindicated by it, if it ſtood entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alone; which yet, I muſt take the liberty to ſay, it does not: for I hope the world will be particularly informed, that there is at leaſt a ſecond, that very nearly approaches it, whenever the eſtabliſhed church of England ſhall loſe one of its brighteſt living ornaments, and one of the moſt uſeful members, which that, or perhaps any other chriſtian communion, can beaſt: In the mean time, may his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life be long continued, and his zealous miniſtry abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proſpered! I beg my reader's pardon for this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The paſſage I referred to above is remarkably, though not equally, applicable to both the caſes, as it ſtands in page 263, of the firſt edition, and page 160, of the ſecond; under that head, where I am ſhewing, that God ſometimes accompliſhes the great work of which we ſpeak, by ſecret and immediate impreſſions on the mind. After preceding illuſtrations, there are the following words, on which the colonel's converſion will throw the juſteſt light: <q>Yes I have known thoſe of diſtinguiſhed genius, polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and great experience in human affairs, who, after

                  <p n="37">§. 37. The mind of major Gardiner continued from this remarkable time till towards the end of October, (that is, rather more than three months, but eſpecially the two firſt of them,) in as extraordinary a ſituation as one can well imagine; he knew nothing of the joys ariſing from a ſenſe of pardon; but on the contrary, for the greater part of that time, and with very ſhort intervals of hope toward the end of it, took it for granted, that he muſt, in all probability, quickly periſh. Nevertheleſs he had ſuch a ſenſe of the evil of ſin, of the goodneſs of the divine being, and of the admirable tendency of the chriſtian revelation, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſpend the remainder of his life, while God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued him out of hell, in as rational and as uſeful a manner as he could; and to continue caſting himſelf at the feet of divine mercy, every day, and often in a day, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there might be hope of pardon, of which all that he could ſay was, that he did not abſolutely deſpair He had at that time ſuch a ſenſe of the degeneracy of his own heart,

Nor was he only delivered from that bondage of corruption, which had been habitual to him for ſo many years, but he felt in his breaſt ſo contrary a diſpoſition, that he was grieved to ſee human nature, in thoſe to whom he was moſt entirely a ſtranger, proſtituted to ſuch low and contemptible purſuits. He therefore exerted his natural courage in a very new kind of combat, and became an open advocate for religion, in all its principles, ſo far as he was acquainted with them, and all its precepts, relating to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iety, righteouſneſs, and godlineſs. Yet he was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and cautious, that he might not run into an extreme, and made it one of his firſt petitions to God, the very day after theſe amazing impreſſions had been wrought in his mind, that he might not be ſuffered to behave with ſuch an effected ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs, as would lead others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him into miſtaken notions of religion, and expoſe it to reproach or ſuſpicion, as if it were an unlovely or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing. For this reaſon he endeavoured to appear as chearful in converſation, as he conſcientiouſly could; though, in ſpite of all his precautions, ſome traces of that deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> ſenſe which he had of his guilt and miſery, would at times appear. He made no ſecret of it however, that his views were entirely changed, though he concealed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances attending that change. He told his moſt intimate companions freely, that he had reflected on the courſe of life in which he had ſo long joined them, and found it to be folly and madneſs, unworthy a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and much more unworthy perſons calling themſelves chriſtians. And he ſet up his ſtandard, upon all occaſions, againſt principles of infidelity, and practices of vice, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately, and as boldly, as ever he diſplayed or planted his colours, when he bore them with ſo much honour in the field.</p>
                  <p n="39">§. 39. I cannot forbear mentioning one ſtruggle of this kind, which he deſcribed to me, with a large detail of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the firſt day of our acquaintance. There was at that time in Paris a certain lady, (whoſe name, then
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028578_0017_0FD972FF095DFEB8"/>
well known in the grand and the gay world, I muſt beg leave to conceal,) who had imbibed the principles of deiſm, and valued herſelf much upon being an avowed advocate for them. The major, with his uſual frankneſs, (though I doubt not with that politeneſs of manners, which was ſo habitual to him, and which he retained throughout his whole life,) anſwered her, like a man who perfectly ſaw through the fallacy of her arguments, and was grieved to the heart for her deluſion. On this ſhe briſkly challenged him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the matter at large, and to fix upon a day for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he ſhould dine with her, attended with any clergyman he might chuſe, whether of the proteſtant, or catholic communion. A ſenſe of duty would not allow him to decline this challenge; and yet he had no ſooner accepted it, but he was thrown into great perplexity and diſtreſs, left being (as I remember he expreſſed it, when he told me the ſtory,) only a chriſtian of ſix weeks old, he ſhould prejudice ſo good a cauſe, by his unſkilful manner of defending it. However, he ſought his refuge in earneſt and repeated pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that he who can ordain ſtrength, and perfect praiſe, out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings, would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly enable him, on this occaſion, to vindicate his truths in a manner which might carry conviction along with it. He then endeavoured to marſhal the arguments in his own mind, as well as he could; and apprehending that he could not ſpeak with ſo much freedom before a number of perſons, eſpecially before ſuch, whoſe province he might in that eaſe ſeem to invade, if he had not devolved the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the diſcourſe upon them, he eaſily admitted the apology of a clergyman or two, to whom he mentioned the affair and waited on the lady alone upon the day appointed. But his heart was ſo ſet upon the buſineſs, that he came earlier than he was expected, and time enough to have two hours diſcourſe before dinner; nor did he at all decline hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two young perſons, nearly related to the lady, preſent during the conference.</p>
                  <p n="40">§. 40. The major opened it, with a view of ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the chriſtian religion as he had digeſted in his own mind, to prove that the apoſtles were not miſtaken themſelves, and that they could not have intended to impoſe upon us, in the accounts they give of the grand facts they atteſt; with the truth of which facts, that of the chriſtian
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028578_0017_0FD972FF095DFEB8"/>
religion is moſt apparently connected. And it was a great encouragement to him, to find, that unaccuſtomed as he was to diſcourſes of this nature, he had an unuſual command, both of thought, and expreſſion; ſo that he recollected, and uttered every thing, as he could have wiſhed. The lady heard with attention; and though he pauſed between every branch of the argument, ſhe did not interrupt the courſe of it, till he told her, he had finiſhed his deſign, and waited for her reply.

But this ſenſible triumph over theſe difficulties was not, till his chriſtian experience had been abundantly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the bleſſing of God on the ſermons he heard, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Swiſs chapel,) and on the many hours which he ſpent in devout retirement, pouring out his whole ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in prayer He began, within about two months after his firſt memorable change, to perceive ſome ſecret dawnings of more chearful hope, that vile as he ſaw himſelf to be, (and I believe no words can expreſs, how vile that was,) he might nevertheleſs obtain mercy through a Redeemer. And at length, (if I remember right, about the end of October, 1719,) he found all the burthen of his mind taken off at once, by the powerful impreſſion of that memorable ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon his mind; Rom iii 25, 26. <q>Whom God hath ſet forth for a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs in the remiſſion of ſins,—that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</q> He had uſed to imagine, that the juſtice of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the damnation of ſo enormous a ſinner, as he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be. But now he was made deeply ſenſible, that the divine juſtice might be, not only vindicated, but glorified, in ſaving him by the blood of Jeſus, even that blood which "cleanſeth us from all ſin." Then did he ſee, and feel, the riches of redeeming love and grace, in ſuch a manner, as not only engaged him, with the utmoſt pleaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to venture his ſoul upon it; but even ſwallowed up, (as it were) his whole heart in the returns of love, which from that bleſſed time became the genuine and delightful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his obedience, and animated him with an enlarged heart, to run the way of God's commandments. Thus God was pleaſed, (as he himſelf uſed to ſpeak,) in an hour to turn his captivity. All the terrors of his former ſtate were changed into unutterable joy, which kept him almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028578_0018_0FD973009BBCA5A0"/>
waking for three nights together and yet refreſhed him as the nobleſt of cordials. His expreſſions, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very ſtrong, always ſeemed to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the firſt exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of it afterwards ſubſided into a more calm and compoſed delight; yet were the impreſſions ſo deep, and ſo perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that he aſſured me, on the word of a chriſtian and a friend, wonderful as it might ſeem, that for about ſeven years after this he enjoyed almoſt an heaven upon earth. His ſoul was ſo continually filled with a ſenſe of the love of God in Chriſt, that it knew little interruption, but when neceſſary converſe, and the duties of his ſtation, called off his thoughts for a little time: And when they did ſo, as ſoon as he was alone, the torrent returned into its natural channel again; ſo that from the minute of his awakening in the morning, his heart was riſing to God, and triumphing in him; and theſe thoughts attended him through all the ſcenes of life, till he lay down on his bed again, and a ſhort parentheſis of ſleep (for it was but a very ſhort one that he allowed himſelf,) invigorated his animal powers, for renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with greater intenſeneſs and ſenſibility.</p>

I ſhall have an opportunity of illuſtrating this in the moſt convincing manner below, by extracts from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral letters which he wrote to intimate friends during this happy period of time; letters, which breathe a ſpirit of ſuch ſublime and ſervent piety, as I have ſeldom met with any where elſe.

I have been ſo happy as to get the ſight of five ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal letters, which he wrote to his mother about this time; which do, in a very lively manner, illuſtrate the ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing change made in the whole current of his thoughts, and temper of his mind. Many of them were written in the moſt haſty manner, juſt as the courier who brought them was, perhaps unexpectedly, ſetting out; and they relate chiefly to affairs in which the public is not at all concerned: Yet there is not one of them, in which he has not inſerted ſome warm and genuine ſentiment of religion. And indeed it is very remarkable, that though he was pleaſed to honor me with a great many letters, and I have ſeen ſeveral more which he wrote to others, ſome of them on journeys, where he could have but a few minutes at command; yet I cannot recollect, that I ever ſaw any one, in which there was not ſome trace of piety.

The major, with great juſtice, tells the good lady his mother, <q>that when ſhe ſaw him again, ſhe would find the perſon indeed the ſame, but every thing elſe entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed</q> And ſhe might eaſily have perceived it of herſelf by the whole tenor of theſe letters, which every where breathe the unaffected ſpirit of a true chriſtian. They are taken up, ſometimes with giving advice and directions concerning ſome pious and charitable contributions; (one of which I remember amounted to ten guineas, though, as he was then out of commiſſion, and had not formerly been very frugal, it cannot be ſuppoſed he had much to ſpare;) ſometimes in ſpeaking of the pleaſure, with which he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſermons, and expected ſacramental opportunities; and at other times, in exhorting her, eſtabliſhed as ſhe was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to labour after a yet more examplary character and conduct, or in recommending her to the divine preſence and bleſſing, as well as himſelf to her prayers. What ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſuch letters as theſe muſt give to a lady of her diſtinguiſhed piety, who had ſo long wept over this dear and amiable ſon, as quite loſt to God, and on the verge of final deſtruction, it is not for me to deſcribe, or indeed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.

If I have hitherto at all remembered you at the throne of grace, at your good mother's deſire, (which you are pleaſed to take notice of with ſo much reſpect,) I can aſſure you I ſhall hence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be led to do it, with more concern and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both by duty and inclination. And if I were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of giving you any little aſſiſtance in the noble deſign you are engaging in, by correſponding with you by letter, while you are at ſuch a diſtance, I ſhould do it moſt chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And perhaps, ſuch a motion may not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unacceptable: For I am inclinable to believe, that when ſome, whom you are obliged to converſe with, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your behaviour ſo different from what it formerly was, and banter you upon it as mad and fanciful, it may be ſome little relief to correſpond with one, who will take a pleaſure in heartening and encouraging you.

be plain, nor ſuitable perſons to adviſe with at hand, it may be ſome ſatisfaction to you to correſpond with one, with whom you may uſe a friendly freedom in all ſuch matters, and on whoſe fidelity you may depend. You may therefore command me in any of theſe reſpects, and I ſhall take a pleaſure in ſerving you. One piece of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I ſhall venture to give you, though your own good ſenſe will make my enlarging upon it leſs needful; I mean that you would, from your firſt ſetting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out carefully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between the eſſentials of real religion, and thoſe things which are commonly reckoned by its profeſſors to belong ſo it. The want of this diſtinction has had very unhappy conſequences from one age to another, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in none more than the preſent. But your daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with your bible, which you mention, may herein give you great aſſiſtance, I move alſo, that ſince infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſo much abounds, you would not only, by cloſe and ſerious conſideration, endeavour to ſettle yourſelf well in the fundamental principles of religion, but alſo that, as opportunity offers, you would converſe with thoſe books which treat moſt judiciouſly on the divine original of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, ſuch as Grotius, Abadie, Baxter, Bates, Du Pleſſis, &amp;c. which may eſtabliſh you againſt the cavils that occur in almoſt all converſations, and furniſh you with arguments which, when properly offered, may be of uſe to make ſome impreſſions on others. But being too much ſtraitened to enlarge at preſent, I can only add, that if your hearty falling in with ſerious religion ſhould prove any hindrance to your advancement in the world, (which I pray God it may not, unleſs ſuch advancement would be a real ſnare to you,) I hope you wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="49">§. 49. I think it very evident from the contents of this letter, that the major had not imparted to his mother the moſt ſingular circumſtances attending his converſion: And indeed there was ſomething ſo peculiar in them, that I do not wonder, he was always cautious in ſpeaking of them,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028578_0021_0FD973056B9EDAD8"/>
and eſpecially, that he was at firſt much on the reſerve. We may alſo naturally reflect, that there ſeems to have been ſomething very providential in this letter, conſidering the debate in which our illuſtrious convert was ſo ſoon engaged. For it was written but about three weeks, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the lady above mentioned in the defence of chriſtianity; or at leaſt, before the appointment of it. And as ſome of the books recommended by Dr. Calamy, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Abadie and Du Pleſſis were undoubtedly within his reach, (if our Engliſh advocates were not) this might, by the divine bleſſing contribute conſiderably towards arming him for that combat, in which he came off with ſuch happy ſucceſs. And as in this inſtance, ſo in many others, they who will obſerve the coincidence and concurrence of things, may be engaged to adore the wiſe conduct of providence in events, which, when taken ſingly and by themſelves, have nothing very remarkable in them.</p>
                  <p n="50">§. 50. I think it was about this time, that this reſolute and examplary chriſtian entered upon that methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, which be purſued through ſo many ſucceeding years of life, and I believe, generally, ſo far as the broken ſtate of his health would allow it in his latter days, to the very end of it. He uſed conſtantly to riſe at four in the morning, and to ſpend his time till ſix in the ſecret exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of devotion, reading, meditation, and prayer; in which laſt he contracted ſuch a fervency of ſpirit, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve few men living ever obtained. This certainly tended very much to ſtrengthen that firm faith in God, and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end animating ſenſe of his preſence, for which he was ſo eminently remarkable, and which carried him through the trials and ſervices of life, with ſuch ſteadineſs, and with ſuch activity; for he indeed endured, and acted, as always ſeeing him who is inviſible. If at any time he was obliged to go out before ſix in the morning, he roſe proportionably ſooner; ſo that when a journey, or a march, has required him to be on horſe back by four, he would be at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at fartheſt by two. He likewiſe ſecured time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in an evening; and that he might have it the more at command, and be the more fit to uſe it properly as well as the better able to riſe early the next morning, he gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally went to bed about ten: And, during the time I was
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028578_0022_0FD973074B846128"/>
acquainted with him, he ſeldom at any ſupper, but a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of bread with one glaſs of wine. In conſequence of this, as well as of his admirably good conſtitution, and the long habit he had formed, he required leſs ſleep than moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have known: And I doubt not, but his uncommon progreſs in piety was in a great meaſure owing to theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute habits of ſelf-denial.</p>
                  <p n="51">§. 51. A life any thing like this, could not, to be ſure, be entered upon, in the midſt of ſuch company as he had been accuſtomed to keep, without great oppoſition: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as he did not entirely withdraw himſelf from all the circle of chearful converſation; but on the contrary, gave ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours every day to it, leſt religion ſhould be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as having made him moroſe. He however early began a practice, which to the laſt day of his life he retained, of reproving vice and profaneneſs; and was never afraid to debate the matter with any, under the conſciouſneſs of ſuch ſuperiority in the goodneſs of his cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="52">§. 52. A remarkable inſtance of this happened, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, about the middle of the year 1720, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be very exact as to the date of the ſtory. It was howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on his firſt return, to make any conſiderable abode in England, after this remarkable change. He had heard, on the other ſide of the water, that it was currently reported among his companions at home, that he was ſtark mad: A report, at which no reader, who knows the wiſdom of the world in theſe matters, will be much ſurprized, any more than himſelf. He concluded therefore, that he ſhould have many battles to fight, and was willing to diſpatch the buſineſs as faſt as he could. And therefore, being to ſpend a few days at the country houſe of a perſon of diſtinguiſhed rank, with whom he had been very intimate, (whoſe name I do not remember that he told me, nor did I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to enquire after it,) he begged the favour of him that he would contrive matters ſo, that a day or two after he came down, ſeveral of their former gay companions might meet at his lordſhip's table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might have an appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making his apology to them, and acquainting them with the nature and reaſons of his change. It was accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ingly agreed to; and a pretty large company met on the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> appointed, with previous notice that major Gardiner would be there. A good deal of raillery paſſed at dinner, to which
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028578_0022_0FD973074B846128"/>
the major made very little anſwer. But when the cloth was taken away, and the ſervants retired, he begged their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for a few minutes, and then plainly and ſeriouſly told them, what notions he entertained of virtue and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and on what conſiderations he had abſolutely determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by the grace of God he would make it the care and buſineſs of life, whatever he might loſe by it, and whatever cenſure and contempt he might incur. He well knew how improper it was in ſuch company, to relate the extraordinary manner in which he was awakened; which they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have interpreted as a demonſtration of lunacy, againſt all the gravity and ſolidity of his diſcourſe: But he content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with ſuch a rational defence of a righteous, ſober, and godly life, as he knew none of them could with any ſhadow of reaſon conteſt. He then challenged them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing they could urge, to prove that a life of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and debauchery was preferable to the fear, love, and worſhip of the eternal God, and a conduct agreeable to the precepts of his goſpel. And he ſailed not to bear his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from his own experience, (to one part of which many of them had been witneſſes) that after having run the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt round of ſenſual pleaſure, with all the advantages the beſt conſtitution and ſpirits could give him, he had never taſted any thing that deſerved to be called happineſs, till he had made religion his refuge and his delight. He teſtified calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly, the habitual ſerenity and peace that he now felt in his own breaſt, (for the moſt elevated delights he did not think fit to plead, leaſt they ſhould be eſteemed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,) and the compoſure and pleaſure with which he looked forward to objects, which the gayeſt ſinner muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be equally unavoidable and dreadful.</p>
                  <p n="53">§. 53. I know not what might be attempted by ſome of the company in anſwer to this; but I well remember he told me, the maſter of the table, a perſon of a very frank and candid diſpoſition, cut ſhort the debate, and ſaid, <q>Come, let us call another cauſe: We thought this man mad, and he is in good earneſt proving that we are ſo.</q> On the whole, this well judged circumſtance ſaved him a great deal of future trouble. When his former acquaintance obſerved, that he was ſtill converſable and innocently chearful, and that he was immoveable in his reſolutions, they deſiſted from farther importunity. And he has aſſured me that

inſtead of loſing any one valuable friend by this change in his character, he found himſelf much more eſteemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, by many who could not perſuade themſelves to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his example.</p>
                  <p n="54">§. 54. I have not any memoirs of Colonel Gardiner's life, or of any other remarkable event befalling him in it, from the time of his return to England, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may be recollected, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the reduction of that regiment of which he was major, he was out of commiſſion from Nov. the 10th, 1718, till June the 1ſt, 1724: And after he returned from Paris, I find all his letters during this period dated from London, where he continued, in communion with the chriſtian ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety under the paſtoral care of Doctor Calamy. As his good mother alſo belonged to the ſame, it is eaſy to imagine, it muſt be an unſpeakable pleaſure to her, to have ſuch frequent opportunities of converſing with ſuch a ſon, of obſerving in his daily conduct and diſcourſes the bleſſed effects of that change which divine grace had made in his heart, and of ſitting down with him monthly at that ſacred feaſt, where chriſtians ſo frequently enjoy the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now there was no period of his life, in which he was more eminently favoured with theſe; nor do I find any of his letters ſo overflowing with tranſports of holy joy, as thoſe which were dated during this time.

his life which was open to public obſervation. It is not to be imagined, that letters written in the intimacy of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friendſhip ſome of them with the moſt apparent marks of haſte, and amidſt a variety of important public cares, ſhould be adorned with any ſtudied elegance of expreſſion, about which the greatneſs, of his ſoul, would not allow him to be at any time very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he concealed them a long time: but obſerving with how much freedom the ſacred writers open all the moſt ſecret receſſes of their hearts, eſpecially in the Pſalms, his conſcience began to be burthened, under an apprehenſion, that, for the honor of God, and in order to engage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current praiſes of ſome of his people, he ought to diſcloſe them. On this he ſet himſelf to reflect, who among all his numerous acquaintance ſeemed at once the moſt experienced chriſtian he knew, (to whom therefore ſuch things as he had to communicate might appear ſolid and credible,) and who the humbleſt. He quickly thought of the lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs of Douglas, in this view: And the reader may well imagine, that it ſtruck my mind very ſtrongly, to think that now, more than twenty four years after it was written, Providence ſhould bring to my hand, (as it has done within theſe few days,) what I aſſuredly believe to be a genuine copy of that very letter; which I had not the leaſt reaſon to expect I ſhould ever have ſeen, when I learnt from his own mouth, amidſt the freedom of an accidental converſation, the occaſion and circumſtances of it.</p>

It is dated from London, July 21. 1722, and the very firſt lines of it relate to a remarkable circumſtance, which from others of his letters I find to have happened ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times. I mean, that when he had received from any of his chriſtian friends a few lines which particularly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart, he could not ſtay till the ſtated return of his devotional hour, but immediately retired to pray for them, and to give vent to thoſe religious emotions of mind which ſuch a correſpondence raiſed. How invaluable was ſuch a friend? And how great reaſon have thoſe of us, who once poſſeſſed a large ſhare in his heart, and in thoſe retired and ſacred moments, to bleſs God for ſo ſingular a felicity; and to comfort ourſelves in a pleaſing hope, that we may yet reap future bleſſings, as the harveſt of thoſe petitions which he can no more repeat.</p>

The one is, that he never pretends, in any of the paſſages cited above, or elſewhere, to have received any immediate revelations from God, which ſhould raiſe him above the ordinary methods of inſtruction, or diſcover any thing to him, whether of doctrines or facts. No man was farther from pretending to predict future events, except it were from the moral prognoſtications of cauſes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tending to produce them; in tracing of which he had indeed an admirable ſagacity, as I have ſeen in ſome very remarkable inſtances. Neither was he at all inclinable to govern himſelf by ſecret impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"How often are good thoughts ſuggeſted," (viz. to the pure in heart,) <q>Heavenly affections kindled, and inflamed? How often is the chriſtian prompted to holy actions, drawn to his duty, reſtored, quickened, perſuaded, in ſuch a manner, that he would be unjuſt to the Spirit of God to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his agency in the whole? Yes, oh my ſoul, there is a Supreme Being, who governs the world, and is preſent with it, who takes up his more ſpecial habitation in good men, and is nigh to all who call upon him, to ſanctify, and aſſiſt them! Haſt thou not felt him, oh my ſoul, like another ſoul, actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy faculties, exalting thy views, purifying thy paſſions, exciting thy graces, and begetting in thee an abhorrence of ſin, and a love of holineſs?

Nor do I fear to tell the world, that it is the deſign of my writing theſe memoirs, and of every thing elſe that I undertake in life, to ſpread this glorious and bleſſed enthuſiaſm; which I know to be the anticipation of heaven, as well as the moſt certain way to it.</p>

But leſt any ſhould poſſibly imagine, that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the experiences which have been deſcribed above, to have been ever ſo ſolid and important, yet there may be ſome appearance of boaſting in ſo free a communication of them; I moſt add to what I have hinted in reference to this above, that I find in many of the papers before me very genuine expreſſions of the deepeſt humility and ſelf-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which indeed ſuch holy converſe with God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and praiſe, does above all things in the world tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and promote. Thus in one of his letters he ſays, <q>I am but as a beaſt before him:</q> In another he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf "a miſerable hell deſerving ſinner:" And in another he cries out, <q>Oh how good a maſter do I ſerve; but alas, how ungrateful and I!

It is a farther inſtance of this unfeigned humility, that when (as his lady with her uſual propriety of language expreſſes it, in one of her letters to me concerning him,) <q>theſe divine joys and conſolations were not his daily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,</q> he with equal freedom, in the confidence of chriſtian friendſhip, acknowledges and laments it. Thus in the firſt letter I had the honour of receiving from him, dated from Leiceſter, July 9 1739, when he had been mentioning the bleſſing with which it had pleaſed God to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my laſt addreſs to him, and the influence it had upon his mind, he adds, <q>Much do I ſtand in need of every help, to awaken me out of that ſpiritual deadneſs, which ſeizes me ſo often. Once indeed it was quite otherwiſe with me, and that for many years:</q>
                     <q>
                        <l>"Firm was my health, my day was bright,</l>

"And here," adds he, "lies my ſin, and my folly."</p>
                  <p n="71">§. 71. I mention this, that the whole matter may be ſeen juſt as it was, and that other chriſtians may not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, if they feel ſome abatement of that ſervor, and of thoſe holy joys, which they have experienced during ſome of the firſt months or years of their ſpiritual life. But with relation to the Colonel, I have great reaſon to believe, that theſe which he laments as his days of ſpiritual deadneſs were not unanimated; and that quickly after the date of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and eſpecially, nearer the cloſe of his life, he had far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revivings, as the joyful anticipation of thoſe better things in reſerve, which were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

communion, though my joys and enlargements were not ſo overflowing and ſenſible, yet I have had habitual real communion with God from that day to this;</q> the latter end of the year 1743; <q>and I know myſelf, and all that know me ſee, that through the grace of God, to which I aſcribe all, my converſation has been becoming the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and let me die, whenever it ſhall pleaſe God, or wherever it ſhall be, I am ſure, I ſhall go to the manſions of eternal glory, &amp;c.</q> And this is perfectly agreeable to the manner in which he uſed to ſpeak to me on this head, which we have talked over frequently and largely.</p>

"In this period," meaning that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the firſt ſeven years after his converſion, <q>when his complaint of comparative deadneſs and languor in religion began, he had a dream; which, though he had no turn at all for taking notice of dreams, yet made a very ſtrong impreſſion upon his mind, He imagined, that he ſaw his bleſſed Redeemer on earth, and that he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him through a large field, following him whom his ſoul loved but much troubled, becauſe he thought his bleſſed Lord did not ſpeak to him; till he came up to the gate of a burying-place, when turning about he ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, in ſuch a manner as filled his ſoul with the moſt raviſhing joy; and on after reflection animated his faith, in believing that whatever ſtorms and darkneſs he might meet with in the way, at the hour of death his glorious Redeemer would lift upon him the light of his life-giving countenance.</q> My correſpondent adds a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, for which he make ſome apology, as what may ſeem whimſical, and yet made ſome impreſſion on himſelf; <q>that there was a remarkable reſemblance in the field in which this brave man met death, and that he had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him in the dream.</q> I did not fully underſtand this at firſt; but a paſſage in that letter from Mr. Spears, which I have mentioned more than once, has cleared it. <q>Now obſerve, Sir, this ſeems to be a literal deſcription of the place, where this chriſtian hero ended his ſorrows, and conflicts, and from which he entered triumphantly into the joy of his Lord. For after he fell in the battle,

And here my reader will eaſily conclude, that the reſolution of Joſhua was from the firſt adopted and declared, <q>As for me, and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q> It will naturally be ſuppoſed, that as ſoon as he had a houſe, he erected an altar in it; that the word of God was read there, and prayers and praiſes were conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered. Theſe were not to be omitted, on account of any gueſt; for he eſteemed it a part of due reſpect to thoſe that remained under his roof, to take it for granted, they would look upon it as a very bad compliment, to imagine they would have been obliged, by neglecting the duties of religion on their account. As his family increaſed, he had a miniſter ſtatedly reſident in his houſe, who both diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the office of a tutor to his children, and of a chaplain; and who was always treated with a becoming kindneſs and reſpect.

Theſe, no doubt, were frequently the ſubjects of mutual diſcourſe: And many letters, which her ladyſhip has had the goodneſs to communicate to me, are moſt convincing evidences of the degree in which this noble and moſt friendly care filled his mind in the days of their ſeparation; days, which ſo entire a mutual affection muſt have rendered exceeding painful, had they not been ſupported by ſuch exalted ſentiments of piety, and ſweetened by daily communion with an ever preſent and ever gracious God.</p>
                  <p n="79">§. 79. The neceſſity of being ſo many months together diſtant from his family, hindered him from many of thoſe condeſcending labours in cultivating the minds of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in early life, which to a ſoul ſo benevolent, ſo wiſe, and ſo zealous, would undoubtedly have afforded a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pleaſure. The care of his worthy conſort, who well knew, that it is one of the brighteſt parts of a mother's character, and one of the moſt important views in which the ſex can be conſidered, made him the eaſier under ſuch a circumſtance: But when he was with them, he failed not to inſtruct and admoniſh them; and the conſtant deep ſenſe with which he ſpoke of divine things, and the real unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indifference which he always ſhewed for what this vain world is moſt ready to admire, were excellent leſſons of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom, which I hope they will recollect with advantage in every future ſcene of life. And I have ſeen ſuch hints in his letters relating to them, as plainly ſhew with how great a weight they lay on his mind, and how highly he deſired above all things that they might be the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, and acquainted betimes with the unequalled pleaſures and bleſſings of religion. He thought an exceſs of delicacy, and of indulgence, one of the moſt dangerous faults in education, by which he every where ſaw great numbers of young people undone: Yet he was ſolicitous to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſeverity, which might terrify or diſcourage; and though he endeavoured to take all prudent precautions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the commiſſion of faults, yet when they had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and there ſeemed to be a ſenſe of them, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

So much did he, on one of the moſt trying occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of life, manifeſt of the temper of a glorified ſaint; and to ſuch happy purpoſes did he retain thoſe leſſons of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, and acquieſcence in him, which I remember he once inculcated in a letter he wrote to a lady of quality, under the apprehenſion of a breach in her family, with which Providence ſeemed to threaten her; which I am wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling to inſert here, though a little out of what might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is dated from London, June 16, 1722, when ſpeaking of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous illneſs of a dear relative, he has theſe words: <q>When my mind runs hither,</q> that is, to God, as its refuge and ſtrong defence, (as the connection plainly determines it,) <q>I think I can bear any thing, the loſs of all, the loſs of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When I think, that God orders, diſpoſes, and manages all things, according to the counſel of his own will: when I think of the extent of his providence, that it reaches to the minuteſt things; then, though a uſeful friend or dear relative to be ſnatched-away by death, I recall myſelf, and check my thoughts with theſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, is he not God, from everlaſting, and to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting? And has he not promiſed to be a God to me? A God in all his attributes, a God in all his perſons, a God in all his creatures, and providences? And ſhall I dare to ſay, What ſhall I do? Was he not the infinite cauſe of all I met with in the creatures? And were not they the finite effects of his infinite love and kindneſs? I have daily experienced, that the inſtrument was, and is, what God makes it to be; and I know, that this God hath the hearts of all men in his hands, and the earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof. If this earth be good for me. I ſhall have it; for my Father hath it all in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. If favor in the eyes of men be good for me, I ſhall have it: for the ſpring of every motion in the heart of man is in God's hand. My dear — ſeems now to be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but God is all wiſe, and every thing is done by him for the beſt. Shall I hold back any thing that is his own, when he requires it? No, God forbid! When I conſider the excellency of his glorious attributes, I am ſatisfied with all his dealings.</q> I perceive by the introduction,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028578_0032_0FD9733262996FE8"/>
and by what follows, that moſt, if not all of this, is a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from ſomething written by a lady; but whether from ſome manuſcript, or a printed book, whether exactly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, or quoted from memory, I cannot determine: And therefore I thought proper to inſert it, as the major (for that was the office he bore then,) by thus interweaving it with his letter makes it his own; and as it ſeems to expreſs in a very lively manner the principles which bore him on, to a conduct ſo truly great and heroic, in circumſtances that have overwhelmed many an heart, that could have faced danger and death with the greateſt intrepidity.</p>
                  <p n="84">§. 84. I return now to conſider his character in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic relation of a maſter, on which I ſhall not enlarge. It is however proper to remark, that as his habitual meekneſs, and command of his paſſions, prevented indecent ſallies of ungoverned anger towards thoſe in the loweſt ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, (by which ſome in high life do ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe themſelves, and loſe much of their authority,) ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural greatneſs of his mind made him ſolicitous to render their inferior ſtations as eaſy as he could; and ſo much the rather, becauſe he conſidered all the children of Adam as ſtanding upon a level before their great Creator, and had alſo a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſenſe of the dignity and worth of every immortal ſoul, how meanly ſoever it might chance to be lodged, than moſt perſons I have known. This engaged him to give his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants frequent religious exhortations and inſtructions, as I have been aſſured by ſeveral who were ſo happy as to live with him under that character. One of the firſt letters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he entered on his chriſtian courſe, expreſſes the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; in which with great tenderneſs he recommends a ſervant, who was in a bad ſtate of health, to his mother's care, as he was well acquainted with her condeſcending temper; mentioning at the ſame time the endeavors he had uſed, to promote his preparations for a better world, under an apprehenſion that he would not continue long in this And we ſhall have an affecting inſtance of the prevalency of the ſame diſpoſition, in the cloſing ſcene of his life, and indeed in the laſt words he ever ſpoke, which expreſſed his generous ſolicitude for the ſafety of a faithful ſervant, who was then near him.</p>
                  <p n="84">§. 84. As it was a few years after his marriage that he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, in which he
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028578_0033_0FD973339408E418"/>
continued till he had a regiment of his own; I ſhall for the future ſpeak of him by that title; and may not perhaps find any more proper place, in which to mention, what it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me to ſay of his behaviour and conduct as an officer. I ſhall not here enlarge on his bravery in the field, though that was very remarkable, as I have heard from others: I ſay, from others, for I never heard any thing of that kind from himſelf, nor knew, till after his death, that he was preſent at almoſt every battle that was fought in Flanders, while the illuſtrious Duke of Marlborough commanded the allied army there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have alſo been aſſured from ſeveral very credible perſons, ſome of whom were eye-witneſſes, that at the ſkirmiſh with the rebels at Preſton in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, (thirty years before that engagement at the other Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which deprived us of this gallant guardian of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,) he ſignalized himſelf very particulaly: For he headed a little body of men, I think about twelve, and ſet fire to the barricado of the rebels in the face of their whole army, while they were pouring in their ſhot, by which eight of the twelve that attended him fell. This was the laſt action of the kind in which he was engaged, before the long peace which enſued: And who can expreſs, how happy it was for him, and indeed for his country, of which he was ever ſo generous, and in his latter years ſo important a friend, that he did not fall then; when the profaneneſs which min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled itſelf with his martial rage, ſeemed to rend the heavens, and ſhocked ſome other military gentlemen, who were not themſelves remarkable for their caution in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="86">§. 86. But I inſiſt not on things of this nature, which the true greatneſs of his ſoul would hardly over permit him to mention, unleſs, when it tended to illuſtrate the divine care over him in theſe extremities of danger, and the grace of God in calling him from ſo abandoned a ſtate. It is well known, that the character of an officer is not only to be approved in the day of combat. Colonel Gardiner was truly ſenſible that every day brought its duties along with it; and he was conſtantly careful, that no pretence of amuſement, friendſhip, or even devotion itſelf, might prevent their being diſcharged in their ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="87">§. 87. I doubt not, but the noble perſons in whoſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was lieutenant colonel, will always be ready to bear an honourable and grateful teſtimony to his exemplary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028578_0033_0FD973339408E418"/>
and fidelity, in all that related to the care of the troops over which he was ſet; whether with regard to the men, or the horſes. He knew, that it is incumbent on thoſe who have the honour of preſiding over others, whether in civil, eccleſiaſtical, or military offices, not to content themſelves with doing only ſo much as may preſerve them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The duties of the cloſet, and of the ſanctuary, were ſo adjuſted, as not to interfere with thoſe of the parade, or any other place where the welfare of the regiment called him. On the other hand, he was ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, not to ſuffer theſe things to interfere with religion; a due attendance to which he apprehended to be the ſureſt method of attaining all deſirable ſucceſs in every other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and concern in life. He therefore abhorred every thing, that ſhould look like a contrivance to keep his ſoldiers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about their horſes and their arms at the ſeaſons of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip; (an indecency, which I wiſh there was no room to mention:) Far from that, he uſed to have them drawn up juſt before it began, and from the parade they went off to the houſe of God. He underſtood the rights of conſcience too well, to impoſe his own particular profeſſion in religion on others, or to uſe thoſe who differed from him in the choice of its modes, the leſs kindly or reſpectfully on that account. But as moſt of his own company, and many of the reſt choſe (when in England) to attend him to the diſſenting chapel, he uſed to march them thither in due time, ſo as to be there before worſhip began. And I muſt do them the juſtice to ſay, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o far as I could ever diſcern, when I have ſeen them in large numbers before me, they behaved with as much reverence, gravity, and decorum, during the time of divine ſervice, as any of their fellow worſhippers.</p>
                  <p n="88">§. 88. That his remarkable care to maintain good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline among them (of which we ſhall afterwards ſpeak,) might be the more effectual, he made himſelf on all proper occaſions acceſſible to them and expreſſed a great concern for their intereſt; which being ſo genuine and ſincere, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſcovered itſelf in a variety of inſtances. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I had once occaſion to viſit one of his dragoons; in his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028578_0034_0FD9733517C82E38"/>
laſt illneſs, at Harborough, and I found the man upon the borders of eternity; a circumſtance, which, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it himſelf, muſt add ſome peculiar weight and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to his diſcourſe. And he then told me, in his colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's abſence, that he queſtioned not, but he ſhould have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting reaſon to bleſs God on Colonel Gardiner's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for he had own a father to him in all his intereſts, both temporal and ſpiritual. He added, that he had viſited him almoſt every day during his illneſs, with religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and inſtruction, as well as taken care that he ſhould want nothing, that might conduce to the recovery of his health. And he did not ſpeak of this, as the reſult of any particular attachment to him, but as the manner in which he was accuſtomed to treat thoſe under his command. It is no wonder, that this engaged their affection to a very great degree. And I doubt not, that if he had fought the fatal battle of Preſton-Pans at the head of that gallant regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he had the care for ſo many years, and which is allowed by moſt unexceptionable judges to be one of the fineſt in the Britiſh ſervice, and conſequently in the world, he had been ſupported in a much different manner; and had found a much greater number, who would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in an opportunity of making their own breaſts a barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the defence of his.</p>
                  <p n="89">§. 89. It could not but greatly endear him to his ſoldiers, that ſo far as preferments lay in his power, or were under his influence, they were diſtributed according to merit; which he knew to be as much the dictate of prudence, as of equity. I find by one of his letters before me, dated a few months before his happy change, that he was ſolicited to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his intereſt with the Earl of Stair, in favour of one whom he judged a very worthy perſon; and that he had been ſuggeſted by another who recommended him, that if he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded he might expect ſome handſome acknowledgment. But he anſwers with ſome degree of indignation; <q>Do you imagine, I am bribed to do juſtice?</q> For ſuch it ſeems he eſteemed it, to confer the favour which was aſked from him, on one ſo deſerving. Nothing can more effectually tend to humble the enemies of a ſtate, than that ſuch maxims ſhould univerſally prevail in it: And if they do not prevail, the worthieſt men in an army or fleet may be ſunk under repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

diſcouragements, and the baſeſt exalted, to the infamy of the public, and perhaps to its ruin.</p>
                  <p n="90">§ 90. In the midſt of all the gentleneſs which Colonel Gardiner exerciſed towards his ſoldiers, he made it very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that he knew how to reconcile the tenderneſs of a real faithful, and condeſcending friend, with the authority of a commander. Perhaps hardly any thing conduced more generally to the maintaining of this authority, than the ſtrict decorum and good manners, with which he treated even the private gentlemen of his regiment; which has always a great efficacy towards keeping inferiors at a proper diſtance, and forbids, in the leaſt offenſive manner, familiarities, which degrade the ſuperior, and enervate his influence. The calmneſs and ſteadineſs of his behaviour on all occaſions, did alſo greatly tend to the ſame purpoſe. He knew, how mean a man looks in the tranſports of paſſion, and would not uſe ſo much freedom with any of his men, as to fall into ſuch tranſports before them; well knowing, that perſons in the loweſt rank of life are aware, how unfit they are to govern others, who cannot govern themſelves. He was alſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how neceſſary it is in all who preſide over others, and eſpecially in military officers, to check irregularities, when they firſt begin to appear: And that he might be able to do it, he kept a ſtrict inſpection over his ſoldiers; in which view it was obſerved, that as he generally choſe to reſide among them as much as he could, (though in circumſtances which ſometimes occaſioned him to deny himſelf in ſome intereſts which were very dear to him,) ſo when they were around him, he ſeldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has often been obſerved, that the regiment of which he was ſo many years lieutenant colonel, was one of the moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and orderly regiments in the public ſervice; ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps none of our dragoons were more welcome than they, to the towns where their character was known. Yet no ſuch bodies of men are ſo blameleſs in their conduct, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be found, eſpecially among ſuch conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, worthy of cenſure, and ſometimes of puniſhment. This Colonel Gardiner knew how to infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

attended with meekneſs; for he well knew, that when things are done in a paſſion, it ſeems only an accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that they are acts of juſtice, and that ſuch indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies greatly obſtruct the ends of puniſhment, both as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to reforming offenders, and to deterring others from an imitation of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the colonel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be brought early the next morning to his own quarters, where he had prepared a piquet, on which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him a private ſort of penance: And while he was put upon it, he diſcourſed with him ſeriouſly and tenderly upon the evils and aggravations of his fault; admoniſhed him of the divine diſpleaſure which he had incurred; and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to argue from the pain which he then felt, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more dreadful it muſt be, to fall into the hands of the living God, and indeed to meet the terrors of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which he had been accuſtomed impiouſly to call for on himſelf and his companions.

He often declared his ſentiments with reſpect to this enormity, at the head of his regiment; and urged his captains and their ſubalterns to take the greateſt care, that they did not give the ſanction of their example, to that which by their office they were obliged to puniſh in others. And indeed his zeal on theſe occaſions wrought in a very active, and ſometimes in a remarkably ſucceſsful manner, not only among his equals, but ſometimes among his ſuperiors too. An inſtance of this in Flanders, I ſhall have an opportunity hereafter to produce; at preſent I ſhall only mention his conduct in Scotland a little before his death, as I have it from a very valuable young miniſter of that country, on whoſe teſtimony I can thoroughly depend; and I wiſh, it may excite many to imitation.</p>

The commanding officer of the king's forces then about Edinburgh, with the other colonels, and ſeveral other gentlemen of rank in their reſpective regiments, favoured him with their company at Bank on, and took a dinner with him.

As ſoon as they were come together, he addreſſed them with a great deal of reſpect, and yet at the ſame time with a very frank and determined air; and told them, that he had the honour in that diſtrict to be a juſtice of the peace, and conſequently that he was ſworn to put the laws in execution, and among the reſt thoſe againſt ſwearing: That he could not execute them upon others with any confidence, or by any means approve himſelf as a man of impartiality and integrity to his own heart, if he ſuffered them to be broken in his preſence by perſons of any rank whatſoever: And that therefore he intreated all the gentlemen who then honoured him with their company, that they would pleaſe to be upon their guard; and that if any oath or curſe ſhould eſcape them, he hoped they would conſider his legal animadverſion upon it, as a regard to the duties of his office and the dictates of his conſcience, and

The views which he gave me even then, (for he began to repoſe a moſt obliging confidence in me, though he concealed ſome of the moſt extraordinary circumſtances of the methods by which he had been recovered to God and happineſs,) with thoſe cordial ſentiments of evangelical piety and extenſive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he poured out into my boſom with ſo endearing a freedom, fired my very ſoul; and I hope I may truly ſay, (what I wiſh and pray, many of my readers may alſo adopt for themſelves,) that I glorified God in him.

It might be a pleaſure to me, to make ſeveral extracts from many others of his letters: But it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I ought to ſuppreſs and rather to reflect with unfeigned humility, how unworthy I was of ſuch regards from ſuch a perſon, and of that divine goodneſs which gave me ſuch a friend in him. I ſhall therefore only add two general remarks, which offer themſelves from ſeveral of his letters. The one is, that there is in ſome of them, as our freedom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed an agreeable vein of humour and pleaſantry; which ſhews, how eaſy religion ſat upon him, and how far he was from placing any part of it in a gloomy melancholy, or ſtiff formality. The other is, that he frequently refers to domeſtic circumſtances, ſuch as the illneſs or recovery of my children, &amp;c. which I am ſurprized how a man of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and important buſineſs could ſo diſtinctly bear upon his mind. But his memory was good, and his heart was yet better; and his friendſhip was ſuch, that nothing which ſenſibly affected the heart of one whom he honoured with it, left his own but ſlightly touched. I have all imaginable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that in many inſtances his prayers were not only offered for us in general terms, but varied as our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſituation required. Many quotations might verify this; but I decline troubling the reader with an enumeration of paſſages, in which it was only the abundance of friendly ſympathy, that gave this truly great, as well as good man, ſo cordial a concern.</p>

And I ſhall here mention ſome other points in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which particularly ſtruck my mind; and likewiſe ſhall touch on his ſentiments on ſome topics of importance, which he freely communicated to me, and which I remarked on account of that wiſdom and propriety, which I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.</p>
                  <p n="107">§. 107. There was nothing more openly obſervable in Colonel Gardiner, than the exemplary gravity, compoſure, and reverence, with which he attended public worſhip Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as he was in his ſecret devotions before he engaged in it, he always began them ſo early, as not to be retarded by them, when he ſhould reſort to the houſe of God. He, and all his ſoldiers who choſe to worſhip with him, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally there, (as I have already hinted,) before the ſervice began; that the entrance of ſo many of them at once might not diſturb the congregation already engaged in devotion, and that there might be the better opportunity for bringing the mind to a becoming attention, and preparing it for converſe with the divine Being. While acts of worſhip were going on, whether of prayer or ſinging, he always ſtood up; and whatever regard he might have for perſons who paſſed by him at that time, though it were to come into the ſame pew, he never paid any compliment to them: And often has he expreſſed his wonder at the indecorum, of breaking off our addreſs to God, to bow to a fellow creature; which he thought a much greater indecency, than it would be, on a like occaſion and circumſtance, to interrupt an addreſs to our prince. During the time of preaching, his eye was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fixed upon the miniſter, though ſometimes turned round upon the auditory, where if he obſerved any to trifle, it filled him with juſt indignation. And I have known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which upon making the remark, he has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it to ſome friend of the perſons who were guilty of it, that proper application might be made to prevent it for the time to come.</p>

And ſome, who have converſed intimately with him after he came from that ordinance, have obſerved a viſible abſtraction from ſurrounding objects; by which there ſeemed reaſon to imagine, that his ſoul was wrapped up in holy contemplation And I particularly remember, that when we had once ſpent great part of the following Monday in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together, he made an apology to me for being ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as he ſeemed, by telling me, <q>that his heart was flown upwards before he was aware, to him whom not having ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and charity made him eager and ſtrenuous in oppoſing, what he judged to be errors of ſo pernicious a nature. Yet I muſt declare, that according to what I have known of him, (and I believe he opened his heart on theſe topics to me, with as much freedom as to any man living,) he was not ready upon light ſuſpicions to charge tenets which he thought ſo pernicious on any, eſpecially where he ſaw the appearances of a good temper and life, which he always reverenced and loved in perſons of all ſentiments and profeſſions. He ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned cauſeleſs jealouſies, and evil ſurmiſings of every kind; and extended that charity in this reſpect, both to clergy, and laity, which good biſhop Burnet was ſo ready, according to his own account, to limit to the latter, <q>of believing every man good till he knew him to be bad, and his notions right till he knew them wrong.</q> He could not but be very ſenſible of the unhappy conſequences, which may follow on attacking the characters of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe who are miniſters of the goſpel: And if through a mixture of human frailty, from which the beſt of men in the beſt of their meanings and intentions are not entirely free, he has ever, in the warmth of his heart, dropped a word which might be injurious to any other on that account, (which I believe very ſeldom happened,) he would gladly retract it on better information; which was perfectly agreeable to that honeſt and generous frankneſs of temper, in which I never knew any man who exceeded him.</p>
                  <p n="113">§. 113. On the whole, it was indeed his deliberate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Arian, Socinian, and Pelagian doctrines were highly diſhonourable to God, and dangerous to the ſouls of men; and that it was the duty of private chriſtians, to be greatly on their guard againſt thoſe miniſters by whom they are entertained, leſt their minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt. Yet he ſincerely abhorred the thought of perſecution for conſcience ſake; of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and iniquity of which in all its kinds and degrees, he had as deep and rational a conviction, as any man I could name. And indeed the generoſity of his heroic heart could hardly bear to think, that thoſe glorious truths, which he ſo cordially loved, and which he aſſuredly believed to be capable of ſuch fair ſupport, both from reaſon and the word of God, ſhould be diſgraced by methods of defence and

To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the genuine fruits of chriſtianity in a good life, to be ready to plead with meekneſs and ſweetneſs for the doctrines it teaches, and to labour by every office of humanity and goodneſs to gain upon them that oppoſe it, were the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons with which this good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt faithfully fought the battles of the Lord. Theſe weapons will always be victorious in his cauſe; and they who have recourſe to others of a different temperature, how ſtrong ſoever they may ſeem, and how ſharp ſoever they may really be, will find they break in their hands when they exert them moſt furiouſly, and are much more likely to wound themſelves, than to conquer the enemies they oppoſe.</p>

But while I am ſpeaking of Colonel Gardiner's charity in this reſpect, I muſt not omit that of another kind which has indeed engroſſed the name of charity much more than it ought, excellent as it is; I mean alms-giving, for which he was very remarkable. I have oſen wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how he was able to do ſo many generous things this way: But his frugality fed the ſpring.

The lively and tender feelings of his heart in favour of the diſtreſſed and afflicted, made it a ſelf-indulgence to him to relieve them; and the deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction he had of the vain and tranſitory nature of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this world, together with the ſublime view he had of another, engaged him to diſpenſe his bounties with a very liberal hand, and even to ſeek out proper objects of them: And above all, his ſincere and ardent love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt engaged him to feel, with a true ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the concerns of his poor members. In conſequence
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028578_0042_0FD9735492CEF4E8"/>
of this, he honoured ſeveral of his friends with commiſſions for the relief of the poor; and particularly, with relation to ſome under my paſtoral care, he referred it to my diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupply them with what I ſhould judge expedient, and frequently preſſed me in his letters to be ſure not to let them want. And where perſons ſtanding in need of his charity happened, as they often did to be perſons of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably religious diſpoſitions, it was eaſy to perceive, that he not only loved, but honoured them; and really eſteemed it an honour which providence conferred upon him, that he ſhould be made, as it were, the almoner of God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="115">§. 115. I cannot forbear relating a little ſtory here which, when the Colonel himſelf heard it, gave him ſuch exquiſite pleaſure, that I hope it will be acceptable to ſeveral of my readers. There was in a village, about three miles from Northampton, and in a family which of all others near me was afterwards moſt indebted to him, (though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then ſeen any member of it,) an aged and poor, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently good woman, who had with great difficulty, in the exerciſe of much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length, when worn out with age and infirmities, ſhe lay upon her dying bed, ſhe did in a moſt lively and affecting manner expreſs her hope and joy in the views of approaching glory. Yet amidſt all the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of ſuch a proſpect, there was one remaining care and diſtreſs which lay heavy on her mind; which was, that her journey and her ſtock of proviſions were both ended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſhe feared, that ſhe muſt either be buried at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh expence, or leave her moſt dutiful and affectionate daughters the houſe ſtripped of ſome of the few moveables which remained in it, to perform the laſt office of duty to her, which ſhe had reaſon to believe they would do. While ſhe was combating with this only remaining anxiety. I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though I knew not the extremity of her illneſs, to come it, and to bring with me a guinea, which the generous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel had ſent by a ſpecial meſſage, on hearing the character of the family, for its relief. A preſent like this, (probably the moſt conſiderable they had ever received in their lives,)

coming in this manner from an entire ſtranger, at ſuch a creſis of time, threw my dying friend, (for ſuch, amidſt all her poverty, I rejoiced to call her,) into a perfect tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of joy. She eſteemed it a ſingular favor of Providence, ſent to her in her laſt moments as a token for good, and greeted it as a ſpecial mark of that loving-kindneſs of God which ſhould attend her for ever. She would therefore be raiſed up in her bed, that ſhe might bleſs God for it upon her knees, and with her laſt breath pray for her kind and generous benefactor, and for him who had been the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of directing his bounty into this channel. After which ſhe ſoon expired, with ſuch tranquility and ſweetneſs, as could not but moſt ſenſibly delight all who beheld her, and occaſioned many, who knew the circumſtances, to glorify God on her behalf.</p>

The Colonel's laſt reſidence at Northampton was in June and July, 1742, when Lord Cadogan's regiment of dragoons was quartered here: And I cannot but obſerve that wherever that regiment came, it was remarkable not only for the fine appearance it made, and for the exactneſs with which it performed its various exerciſes (of which it had about this time the honor to receive the moſt illuſtrious teſtimonials;) but alſo for the great ſobriety and regularity of the ſoldiers. Many of the officers copied after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern, which they had daily before their eyes; and a conſiderable number of the private men ſeemed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not only of ſtrict virtue, but of ſerious piety. And I doubt not, but they found their abundant account in it; not only in the ſerenity and happineſs of their own minds which is beyond compariſon the moſt important conſideration; but alſo in ſome degree, in the obliging and reſpectful treatment which they generally met with in their quarters. And I mention this, becauſe I am perſuaded that if gentlemen of their profeſſion knew, and would reflect, how much more comfortable they make their own quarters by a ſober order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obliging conduct, they would be regular out of more ſelf-love; if they were not influenced, as I heartily wiſh they may always be, by a nobler principle.</p>

his other abodes delightful. But as he had made ſo eminent a progreſs in that divine life, which they are all intended to promote, he could not be unactive in the cauſe of God. I have now before me a letter dated from thence, October 16, 1742, in which he writes: <q>As for me, I am indeed in a dry and barren land, where no water is, Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe nothing is to be heard in our Sodom, but blaſpheming the name of my God; and I am not honoured as the inſtrument of doing any great ſervice. 'Tis true I have reformed ſix or ſeven field-officers of ſwearing. I dine every day with them, and have entered them into a voluntary contract, to pay a ſhilling to the poor for every oath; and it is wonderful to obſerve the effect it has had already. One of them told me this day at dinner, that it had really ſuch an influence upon him, that being at cards laſt night when another of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer fell a ſwearing, he was not able to bear it, but roſe up and left the company. So you ſee, reſtraints at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from a low principle may improve into ſomething better.</q>

In the mean time, as he had the promiſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment before he quitted England, his friends were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expecting an occaſion of congratulating him on having received the command of one.

With great pleaſure do I at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recollect the unaffected ſerenity, and even indifference, with which he expreſſes himſelf on this occaſion, in a letter to me, dated about the beginning of April, 1743; <q>The diſappointment of a regiment is nothing to me; for I am ſatisfied, that had it been for God's glory, I ſhould have had it; and I ſhould have been ſorry to have had it on any other terms.

And it is properly remarked by the reverend and worthy perſon through whoſe hand this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was tranſmitted to me, that when the Colonel thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf, he could have no proſpect of what he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo ſoon obtained; as General Bland's regiment, to which he was advanced, was only vacant on the 19th of April, that is, two days before the date of this letter, when it was impoſſible he ſhould have any notice of that vacancy. And it alſo deſerves obſervation, that ſome few days after the Colonel was thus unexpectedly promoted to the command of theſe dragoons, Brigadier Cornwallis's regiment of foot, then in Flanders, became vacant: now had this happened before his promotion to General Bland's, Colonel Gardiner in all probability would only have had that regiment of foot, and ſo have continued in Flanders.

Accordingly, though he had other preferments offered him in the army, he choſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and I believe, the more willingly, as he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect there would have been any action. Juſt at this time it pleaſed God to give him an awful inſtance of the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human proſpects and enjoyments, by that violent fever, which ſeized him at Ghent in his way to England; and perhaps the more ſeverely, for the efforts he made to puſh on his journey, though he had for ſome days been much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. It was, I think, one of the firſt fits of ſevere ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had ever met with; and he was ready to look upon it, as a ſudden call into eternity: But it gave him no pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alarm in that view.

Accordingly he paſſed through London, about the middle of June, 1743, where he had the honor of waiting on their royal highneſſes the Prince and Princeſs of Wales, and of receiving from both the moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging tokens of favor and eſteem. He arrived at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton on Monday the 20th of June, and ſpent part of three days here. But the great pleaſure which his return and preferment gave us, was much obated, by obſerving his countenance ſo ſadly altered, and many marks of languor, and remaining diſorder, which evidently appeared; ſo that he really looked ten years older than he had done ten months before. I had however a ſatisfaction, ſufficient to counter-balance much of the concern which this alteration gave me, in a renewed opportunity of obſerving, indeed more ſenſibly than ever, in how remarkable a degree he was dead to the enjoyments and views of this mortal life. When I congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated him on the favorable appearances of Providence for him in the late event, he briefly told me the remarkable circumſtances that attended it, with the moſt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The evening before our laſt ſeparation, as I knew I could not entertain the invaluable friend who was then my gueſt more agreeably, I preached a ſermon in my own houſe, with ſome peculiar reference to his caſe and circumſtances, from thoſe ever memorable words, than which I have never felt any more powerful and more comfortable: Pſal. xci. 14, 15, 16. "Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I deliver him; I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my name: He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him: With long life (or length of days) will I ſatisfy him, and ſhew him my ſalvation." This ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not but lead our meditations to ſurvey the character of the good man, as one who ſo knows the name of the bleſſed God, (has ſuch a deep apprehenſion of the glories and perfections of his nature,) as determinately to ſet his love upon him, to make him the ſupreme object of his moſt ardent and conſtant affection. And it ſuggeſted the moſt ſublime and animating hopes to perſons of ſuch a character; that their prayers ſhall be always acceptable to God; that though they may, and muſt be called out to their ſhare in the troubles and calamities of life, yet they may aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the divine preſence in all; which ſhall iſſue in their deliverance, in their exaltation, ſometimes, to diſtinguiſhed honour and eſteem among men, and, it may be in a long courſe of uſeful and happy years on earth; at leaſt, which ſhall undoubtedly end in ſeeing, to their perpetual delight, the complete ſalvation of God, in a world where they ſhall enjoy length of days for ever and ever, and employ them all in adoring the great author of their ſalvation and felicity. It is evident, that theſe natural thoughts on ſuch a ſcripture were matters of univerſal concern. Yet had I known, that this was the laſt time I ſhould ever addreſs Colonel Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a miniſter of the goſpel, and had I foreſeen the ſcenes through which God was about to lead him, I hardly know what conſiderations I could have ſuggeſted with more peculiar propriety. The attention, elevation, and delight, with which he heard them, was very apparent; and the pleaſure which the obſervation of it gave me, continues to this moment. And let me be permitted to digreſs ſo far, as to add, that this is indeed the great ſupport of a chriſtian miniſter, under the many diſcouragements and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

which he meets with, in his attempts to fix upon the profligate or the thoughtleſs part of mankind a deep ſenſe of religious truths; that there is another important part of his work, in which he may hope to be more generallly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; as by plain, artleſs, but ſerious diſcourſes, the great principles of chriſtian duty and hope may be nouriſhed and invigorated in good men, their graces watered as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="128">§. 128. An incident occurs to my mind, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that evening, which at leaſt for the oddneſs of it may deſerve a place in theſe memoirs. I had then with me one Thomas Porter, a poor, but very honeſt and religious man, (now living at Hatfield-Broadoak in Eſſex,) who is quite unacquainted with letters, ſo as not to be able to diſtinguiſh one from another; yet is maſter of the contents of the bible in ſo extraordinary a degree, that he has not only fixed an immenſe number of texts in his memory, but merely by hearing them quoted in ſermons has regiſtered there the chapter and verſe, in which theſe paſſages are to be found: This is attended with a marvellous facility in directing thoſe that can read, to turn to them, and a moſt unaccountable talent of fixing on ſuch, as ſuit almoſt every imaginable variety of circumſtances in common life There are two conſiderations in his caſe, which make it the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: The one, that he is a perſon of a very low genius, having, beſides a ſtammering which makes his ſpeech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unintelligible to ſtrangers, ſo wild and aukward a manner of behaviour that he is frequently taken for an idiot, and ſeems in many things to be indeed ſo: The other, that he grow up to manhood in a very licentious courſe of living, and an entire ignorance of divine things, ſo that all theſe exact impreſſions on his memory have been made in his riper years. I thought it would not be diſagreeable to the Colonel, to introduce to him this odd phaaenomenon, which many hundreds of people have had a curioſity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine:
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028578_0047_0FD97366B33200B8"/>
And among all the ſtrange things I have ſeen in him, I never remember any which equalled what paſſed on this occaſion. On hearing the colonel's profeſſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome hints of his religious character, he ran through a vaſt variety of ſcriptures, beginning at the Pentateuch and going on to the Revelation, relating either to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance to be fixed on God for the ſucceſs of military pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I believe, he quoted more than twenty of theſe paſſages; and I muſt freely own, that I know not who could have choſe them with greater propriety. If my memory do not deceive me, the laſt of this catalogue was that from which I afterwards preached on the lamented occaſion of this great man's fall: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. We were all aſtoniſhed at ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a fact; and I queſtion not, but that many of my readers will think the memory of it worthy of being thus preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="129">§. 129. But to return to my main ſubject: The next day after the ſermon and converſation of which I have been ſpeaking, I took my laſt leave of my ineſtimable friend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attending him ſome part of his way northward. The firſt ſtage of our journey was to the cottage of that poor, but very religious family, which I had accaſion to mention above, as relieved, and indeed in a great meaſure ſubſiſted, by his charity. And nothing could be more delightful, than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the condeſcenſion, with which he converſed with theſe his humble penſioners. We there put up our laſt united pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together, and he afterwards expreſſed, in the ſtrongeſt terms I ever heard him uſe on ſuch an occaſion, the ſingular pleaſure with which he had joined in them. Indeed it was no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, to have an opportunity of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a valuable friend to the divine protection and bleſſing, with that particular freedom, and enlargement on what was peculiar in his circumſtances, which hardly any other ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs we had been quite alone, could ſo conveniently have admitted. We went from thence to the table of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of diſtinction in the neighbourhood; whoſe he had an opportunity of ſhewing, in how decent and graceful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028578_0048_0FD9736D4AAC3D20"/>
he could unite the Chriſtian and the gentleman, and give converſation an improved and religious turn, without violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the rules of polite behaviour, or ſaying or doing any thing which looked at all conſtrained or affected. Here we took our laſt embrace, committing each other to the care of the God of heaven; and the Colonel purſued his journey to the north, where he ſpent all the remainder of his days.</p>
                  <p n="130">§. 130. The more I reflect upon this appointment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the more I diſcern of the beauty and wiſdom of it not only as it led directly to that glorious period of life, with which God had determined to honour him, and in which, I think, it becomes all his friends to rejoice; but alſo, as the retirement on which he entered could not but have a happy tendency to favour his more immediate and compleat prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ſo ſpeedy a remove. To which we may add, that it muſt probably have a very powerful influence to promote the intereſts of religion (incomparably the greateſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts) among the members of his own family; who muſt ſurely edify much by ſuch daily leſſons as they received from his lips, when they ſaw them illuſtrated and enforced by ſo admirable an example, and this for two compleat years. It is the more remarkable, as I cannot find from the memoirs of his life in my hands, that he had ever been ſo long at home ſince he had a family, or indeed, from his childhood, ever ſo long at a time in any one place.</p>

He mentions his ſacramental opportunities with peculiar reliſh crying out as in a holy rapture, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to one and another of them, <q>Oh how gracious a maſter do we ſerve!

He ſpent much of his time at Bankton in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſolitude; and one moſt intimately converſant with him aſſures me, that the traces of that delightful converſe with God which he enjoyed in it, might eaſily be diſcerned in that ſolemn yet chearful countenance, with which he often came out of his cloſer. Yet his exerciſes there muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been very mournful, conſidering the melancholy views which he had of the ſtate of our public affairs. <q>I ſhould be glad,</q> ſays he, (in a letter which he ſent me, about the cloſe of the year 1743,) <q>to hear what wiſe and good people among you think of the preſent circumſtances of things.

She anſwered I don't know, I did not obſerve him. On what then, ſaid one of the company, did you fix your attention? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"Oh," cried the colonel when reading it, <q>how ought we to fix our eyes and hearts on him, who not in offer, but in reality, gave his own precious life to ranſom us from the moſt dreadful ſlavery, and from eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction!</q> But this is only one inſtance among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. His heart was ſo habitually ſet upon divine things, and he had ſuch a permanent and overflowing ſenſe of the love of Chriſt, that he could not forbear connecting ſuch reflections, with a multitude of more diſtant occaſions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in daily life, where leſs advanced chriſtians would not have thought of them: And thus, like our great maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he made every little incident a ſource of devotion, and an inſtrument of holy zeal.</p>

and deſigned to have ſpent part of September at Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. The expectation of this was mutually agreeable; but providence ſaw fit to diſconcert the ſcheme. His love for his friends in theſe parts occaſioned him, to expreſs ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret on his being commanded back: And I am pretty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the manner in which he expreſſed himſelf in one of his laſt letters to me, that he had ſome more important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for wiſhing an opportunity of making a London jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney juſt at that criſis; which, the reader will remember, was before the rebellion broke out. But as providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it otherwiſe, he acquieſced; and I am well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that could he have diſtinctly foreſeen the approaching event, ſo far as it concerned his own perſon, he would have eſteemed it the happieſt ſummons he ever received: While he was at Scarborough, I find by a letter dated from thence, July 26, 1745, that he had been informed of the gaiety which ſo unſeaſonably prevailed at Edinburgh, where great multitudes were then ſpending their time in balls, aſſemblies, and other gay amuſements, little mindful of the rod of God which was then hanging over them: on which occaſion he hath this expreſſion: <q>I am greatly ſurprized, that the people of Edinburgh ſhould be employed in ſuch fooliſh diverſions, when our ſituation is at preſent more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly than ever I ſaw it in my life. But there is one thing which I am very ſure of, that comforts me, viz. that it ſhall go well with the righteous, come what will.</q>

It was in the caſtle there, that his lady and eldeſt daughter enjoyed the laſt happy hours of his company; and I think, it was about eight or ten days before his death, that he parted from them there. A remarkable circumſtance attended that parting, which hath been touched upon by ſurviving friends in more then one of their letters to me. His lady was ſo affected when ſhe took her laſt leave of him, that ſhe could not forbear burſting out into a flood of tears, with other marks of unuſual emotion. And when he aſked her the reaſon, ſhe urged the apprehenſion ſhe had of loſing ſuch an invaluable friend, amidſt the dangers to which he was then called out, as a very ſufficient apology. Upon which ſhe took particular notice, that whereas he had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally comforted her on ſuch occaſions, by pleading with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028578_0054_0FD9737C725427C0"/>
her that remarkable hand of providence, which had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in former inſtances being exerted for his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in the greateſt extremity, he ſaid nothing of it now; but only replied, in his ſententious manner, "We have an eternity to ſpend together."</p>
                  <p n="147">§. 147. That heroic contempt of death which had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſcovered itſelf in the midſt of former dangers, was manifeſted now in his diſcourſe with ſeveral of his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends. I have reſerved for this place one genuine expreſſion of it many years before, which I thought might be mentioned with ſome advantage here. In July, 1725, he had been ſent to ſome place, not far from Hamilton, to quell a mutiny among ſome of our troops. I know not the particular occaſion; but I remember to have heard him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it as ſo fierce a one, that he ſcarce ever apprehended himſelf in a more hazardous circumſtance. Yet he quelled it, by his preſence alone, and the expoſtulations he uſed; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently putting his life into his hand to do it. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſtory ſtruck me much; but I do not ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember them, as to venture to relate them here. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve, that in a letter dated July 16, that year, which I have now before me, and which evidently refers to this event, he writes thus: <q>I have been very buſy, hurried about from place to place; but bleſſed be God, all is over without bloodſhed. And pray let me aſk, what made you ſhow ſo much concern for me in your laſt? Were you afraid, I ſhould get to heaven before you? Or can any evil befall thoſe, who are followers of that which is good?<note n="*" place="bottom">I doubt not, but this will remind ſome of my readers of that noble ſpeech of Zuinglius, when (according to the uſage of that country,) attending his flock to a battle in which their religion and libertie, were all at ſtake, on his receiving a mortal wound by a bullet, of which he ſoon expired, while his friends were in all the firſt aſtoniſhment of grief, he bravely ſaid as he was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Ecquid hoc infortunii?

And as theſe were his ſentiments in the vigour of his days, ſo neither did declining years and the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a broken conſtitution on the one hand, nor any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of enjoying the honours and profits of ſo high a ſtation, or (what was much more to him,) the converſe of the moſt affectionate of wives and ſo many amiable children and friends on the other, enervate his ſpirits in the leaſt: But as he had in former years often expreſſed it, to me and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, as his deſire, <q>that if it were the will of God, he might have ſome honourable call to ſacrifice his life in defence of religion and the liberties of his country;</q> ſo when it appeared to him moſt probable that he might be called to it immediately, he met the ſummons with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt readineſs. This appears in part from a letter which he wrote to the reverend Mr. Adams of Falkirk, juſt as he was on marching from Stirling, which was only eight days before his death: "The rebels," ſays he, are <q>advancing to croſs the Firth; but I truſt in the Almighty God, who doth whatſoever he pleaſes, in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</q> And the ſame gentleman tells me, that a few days after the date of this, he marched through Falkirk with his regiment; and though he was then in ſo languiſhing a ſtate, that he needed his aſſiſtance as a ſecretary to write for ſome reinforcement, which might put it in his power to make a ſtand, (as he was very deſirous to have done,) he expreſſed a moſt genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and noble contempt of life, when to be expoſed in the defence of a worthy cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="149">§. 149. Theſe ſentiments wrought in him to the laſt, in the moſt effectual manner; and he ſeemed for a while to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them into the regiment which he commanded: For they expreſſed ſuch a ſpirit in their march from Stirling, that I am aſſured, the colonel was obliged to exert all his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to prevent their making incurſions on that rebel army, which then lay very near them; and had it been thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſend him the reinforcement he requeſted, none can ſay what the conſequence might have been. But he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to march as faſt as poſſible, to meet Sir John Cope's forces at Dunbar: which he did: And that haſty retreat, in concurrence with the news which they ſoon after received of the ſurrender of Edinburgh to the rebels, (either by the treachery or weakneſs of a few, in oppoſition to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of by far the greater and better part of the inhabitants,) ſtrick a panic into both of the regiments of dragoons, which became viſible in ſome very apparent and remarkable circumſtances in their behaviour, which I forbear to relate. This affected Colonel Gardiner ſo much, that on the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before the fatal action at Preſton Pans, he intimated to an officer of conſiderable rank and note, (from whom I had it by a very ſure channel of conveyance) that he expected the event would be, as in fact it was. In this view there is all imaginable reaſon to believe, he had formed his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as to his own perſonal conduct, which was, <q>that he would not, in caſe of the flight of thoſe under his command, retreat with them;</q> by which, as it ſeemed, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably apprehenſive, he might have ſtained the honour of his former ſervices, and have given ſome occaſion for the enemy to have ſpoken reproachfully. He much rather choſe, if providence gave him the call, to leave in his death an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of fidelity and bravery, which might very probably be (as in fact it ſeems indeed to have been,) of much greater importance to his country, than any other ſervice, which in the few days of remaining life he could expect to render it, I conclude theſe to have been his views, not only from what I knew of his general character and temper, but likewiſe from ſome intimations which he gave to a very worthy perſon from Edinburgh, who viſited him the day before the action; to whom he ſaid, <q>I cannot influence the conduct of others, as I could wiſh; but I have one life to ſacrifice to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ſafety, and I ſhall not ſpare it;</q> or words to that effect.</p>

ſpent the little remainder of the time, which could not be much above an hour, in thoſe devout exerciſes of ſoul, which had ſo long been habitual to him, and to which ſo many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances did then concur to call him. The army was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed by break of day, by the noiſe of the rebels approach, and the attack was made before ſun riſe; yet when it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Colonel at the beginning of the onſet, which in the whole laſted but a few minutes, received a wound by a bullet in his left breaſt, which made him give a ſudden ſpring on his ſaddle; upon which his ſervant, who had the led horſe, would have perſuaded him to retreat: But he ſaid, it was only a wound in the fleſh; and fought on, though he preſently after received a ſhot in his right thigh. In the mean time it was diſcerned, that ſome of the enemy fell by him; and particularly one man, who had made him a treacherous viſit but a few days before, with great profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of zeal for the preſent eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p n="153">§ 153. Events of this kind paſs in leſs time, than the deſcription of them can be written, or than it can be read. The Colonel was for a few moments ſupported by his men, and particularly by that worthy perſon, lieutenant-colonel Whitney, who was ſhot through the arm here, and a few months after fell nobly in the battle of Falkirk; and by lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Weſt, a man of diſtinguiſhed bravery; as alſo by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen dragoons, who ſtood by him to the laſt. But after a faint fire, the regiment in general was ſeized with a pannic; and though their Colonel and ſome other gallant officers, did what they could to rally them once or twice, they at laſt took a precipitate flight. And juſt in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when Colonel Gardiner ſeemed to be making a pauſe, to deliberate what duty required him to do in ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, an accident happened, which muſt I think, in the judgment of every worthy and generous man, be allowed a ſufficient apology for expoſing his life to ſo great hazard, when his regiment had left him.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Colonel, who was well acqainted with military hiſtory, might poſſibly remember, that in the battle at Blenheim, the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Prince Eugene, when the horſe of the wing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded had run away thrice, charged at the head of the foot, and thereby greatly contributed to the glorious ſucceſs of the day. At leaſt ſuch an example may conduce to vindicate that noble ardour, which, amidſt all the applauſes of his country, ſome have been ſo cool and ſo critical as to blame. For my own part, I thank God, that I am not called to apologize for his following his troops in their flight; which I feel would have been a much harder taſk; and which, dear as he was to me, would have grieved me much more than his death, with theſe heroic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending it.</note> He ſaw a party of the

The moment he fell, another Highlander, who, if the king's evidence at Carliſle may be credited, (as I know not why they ſhould not, though the unhappy creature died denying it,) was one Mac-naught, who was executed about a year after, gave him a ſtroke, either with a broad-ſword, or a Lochabar axe, (for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant could not exactly diſtinguiſh,) on the hinder part of his head, which was the mortal blow. All that his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attendant ſaw farther at this time was, that as his hat was fallen off, he took it in his left hand, and waved it as a ſignal to him to retreat; and added, what were the laſt words he ever heard him ſpeak. "Take care of yourſelf:" Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the ſervant retired.</p>
                  <p n="154">§ 154. It was reported at Edinburgh on the day of the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When I preached the ſermon, long ſince printed, on occaſion of his death, I had great reaſon to believe, this report was true; though before the publication of it I began
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028578_0057_0FD97386CFA0F230"/>
to be in doubt: And on the whole, after the moſt accurate enquiry I could poſſibly make at this diſtance, I cannot get any convincing evidence of it. Yet I muſt here obſerve, that it does not appear impoſſible, that ſomething of this kind might indeed be uttered by him; as his ſervant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that he ſpoke to him after receiving that fatal blow, which would ſeem moſt likely to have taken away the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſpeech; and as it is certain, he lived ſeveral hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he fell. If therefore any thing of this kind did happen, it muſt have been juſt about this inſtant. But as to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his being taken priſoner, and carried to the pretended prince, (who by the way afterwards rode his horſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon it into Derby) with ſeveral other circumſtances which were grafted upon that interview, there is the moſt undoubted evidence of its falſehood. For his attendant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, aſſures me, that he himſelf immediately fled to a mill, at the diſtance of about two miles from the ſpot of ground on which the Colonel fell; where he changed his dreſs, and, diſguiſed like a miller's ſervant, returned with a cart as ſoon as poſſible; which yet was not till near two hours after the engagement. The hurry of the action was then pretty well over, and he found his much honored maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only plundered of his watch and other things of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but alſo ſtripped of his upper garments and boots; yet ſtill breathing: And adds, that though he were not capable of ſpeech, yet on taking him up he opened his eyes; which makes it ſomething queſtionable, whether he were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſenſible. In this condition, and in this manner, he conveyed him to the church of Tranent, from whence he was immediately taken into the miniſter's houſe, and laid in bed, where he continued breathing, and frequently groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till about eleven in the forenoon; when he took his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal leave of pain and ſorrow, and undoubtedly roſe to thoſe diſtinguiſhed glories, which are reſerved for thoſe who have been ſo eminently and remarkably faithful unto death.</p>
                  <p n="155">§. 155. From the moment in which he fell, it was no longer a battle, but a rout and carnage. The cruelties, which the rebels, (as it is generally ſaid, under the command of Lord Elcho) inflicted on ſome of the king's troops after they had aſked quarter, are dreadfully legible on the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many who ſurvived it. They entered Colonel Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner's
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028578_0058_0FD97389D6E04AF0"/>
houſe, before he was carried off from the field; and, notwithſtanding the ſtrict orders which the unhappy Duke of Perth, (whoſe conduct is ſaid to have been very humane in many inſtances) gave to the contrary, every thing of va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lue was plundered, to the very curtains of the beds, and hangings of the rooms. His papers were all thrown into the wildeſt diſorder, and his houſe made an hoſpital for the reception of thoſe who were wounded in the action.</p>
                  <p n="156">§. 156. Such was the cloſe of a life, which had been ſo zealouſly devoted to God, and filled up with ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſervices. This was the death of him, who had been ſo highly favoured by God, in the method by which he was brought back to him after ſo long and ſo great an eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the progreſs of ſo many years, during which (in the expreſſive phraſe of the moſt ancient of writers,) he had walked with him;—to fall, as God threatened the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his wrath that they ſhould do, "with tumult, with ſhouting, and with the ſound of the trumpet." (Amos ii. 2.) Several other very worthy, and ſome of them very eminent perſons, ſhared the ſame fate; either now in the battle of Preſton-Pans, or quickly after in that of Falkirk:<note n="*" place="bottom">Of theſe none were more honourable than thoſe illuſtrious brothers, Sir Robert Munro, and Doctor Munro; whoſe tragical but glorious fate was alſo ſhared quickly after by a third hero of the family, captain Munro of Culcair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But indeed there was no great hazard in this; for his character was ſo well known, that even they themſelves ſpoke honorably of him, and ſeemed to join with his friends in lamenting the fall of ſo brave and ſo worthy a man.</p>

The remoteſt poſterity will remember, for whom the honour of ſubduing this unnatural and pernicious rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was reſerved; and it will endear the perſon of the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious duke of Cumberland, to all but the open, or ſecret abettors of it in the preſent age, and conſecrate his name to immortal honours among all the friends of religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty who ſhall ariſe after as.

It is abundant matter of thankfulneſs, that ſo ſignal a monument of grace and ornament of the chriſtian profeſſion, was raiſed in our age and country, and ſpared for ſo many honourable and uſeful years. Nor can all the tenderneſs of the moſt affectionote friendſhip, while its ſorrows bleed afreſh in the view of ſo tragical a ſcene, prevent my adoring the gracious appointment of the great Lord of all events, that when the day in which he muſt have expired without an enemy appeared ſo very near, the laſt ebb of his generous blood ſhould be poured out, as a kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred libation, to the liberties of his country, and the honour of his God; that all the other virtues of his character, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed as it were by that precious ſtream, might diffuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round a more extenſive fragrancy, and be tranſmitted to the moſt remote poſterity with that peculiar charm, which they
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028578_0059_0FD9738850813C28"/>
cannot but derive from their connection with ſo gallant a fall: An event, (as that bleſſed apoſtle, of whoſe ſpirit he ſo deeply drank, has expreſſed it,) according to his earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and his hope, that in him Chriſt might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all things whether by his life, or by his death.</p>

                  <head>APPENDIX. Relating to the COLONEL'S Perſon.</head>
                  <p>IN the midſt of ſo many more important articles, I had really forgot to ſay any thing of the perſon of Colonel Gardiner, of which nevertheleſs it may be proper here to add a word or two. It was, as I am informed, in younger life remarkably graceful and amiable: And I can eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, from what I knew him to be, when our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance began; though he was then turned of fifty, and had gone through ſo many fatigues as well as dangers, which could not but leave ſome traces on his countenance. He was tall, (I ſuppoſe, ſomething more than ſix foot,) well proportioned, and ſtrongly built: His eyes of a dark grey, and not very large; his forehead pretty high; his noſe of a length and height no way remarkable, but very well ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his other features; his cheeks not very prominent, his mouth moderately large, and his chin rather a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining (when I knew him) to be peaked. He had a ſtrong voice, and lively accent; with an air very intriped, yet attempered with much gentleneſs: And there was ſomething in his manner of addreſs moſt perfectly eaſy and obliging, which was in a great meaſure the reſult of the great candor and benevolence, of his natural temper; and which, no doubt, was much improved by the deep humility which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace had wrought into his heart; as well as having been accuſtomed from his early youth, to the company of perſons of diſtinguiſhed rank and polite behaviour.</p>
                  <p>The picture of him, was taken from an original done by Van Deeſt, (a Dutchman brought into Scotland by general Wade) in the year 1727, which was the 40th of his age;

and is ſaid to have been very like him then, though far from being an exact reſemblance of what he was when I had the happineſs of being acquainted with him. Perhaps he would have appeared to the greateſt advantage of all, could he have been exactly drawn on horſeback; as many very good judges, and among the reſt the celebrated Monſ. Faubert himſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ingularly graceful in his appearance in that attitude, that it was ſufficient (as what is very eminent in its kind gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is,) to ſtrike an eye not formed on any critical rules.</p>

                  <p>SO animating a ſubject as the death of ſuch a man, in ſuch circumſtances, has occaſioned a great deal of poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Some of this has already been publiſhed; eſpecially one large compoſition, ſaid to be done by a worthy clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Lincolnſhire, in which there are many excellent lines and noble ſentiments: But I rather chooſe to refer to the piece itſelf, than to inſert any extracts from it here. It may be more expedient to oblige my reader with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing copy of verſes, and an elegiack poem, compoſed by two of my valuable friends whoſe names are annexed. I could not preſume to attempt any thing of this kind myſelf; becauſe I knew, that nothing I was capable of writing could properly expreſs my ſenſe of his worth, or deſcribe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of my friendſhip; the ſentiments of which will (as I aſſuredly believe,) mingle themſelves with the laſt ideas which paſs through my mind in this world, and perhaps with ſome of the firſt which may open upon it in that which is to come.</p>

                  <p>THE intimate knowledge I had of Colonel Gardiner's private as well as public character, and of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared friendſhip which ſo long ſubſiſted between him and your ladyſhip, makes me more ſenſible than moſt others can be, both of the inexpreſſible loſs you have ſuſtained, and of the exquiſite ſenſe you have of it. I might, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, argue what you felt from the agony with which my own heart was torn by that ever to be lamented ſtroke, which deprived the nation, and the church, of ſo great an ornament and bleſſing: And indeed, madam, I was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your calamity, as to be ready in my firſt thoughts to congratulate you, when I heard the report which at firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prevailed, that you died under the ſhock. Yet cooler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections teaches me, on many accounts, to rejoice that your ladyſhip has ſurvived that deareſt part of yourſelf; though after having been ſo lovely and pleaſant in your lives, it would have been matter of perſonal rejoicing, in death not to have been divided. The numerous and promiſing offspring with which God hath bleſſed your marriage, had evidently the higheſt intereſt in the continued life of ſo pious and affectionate a mother: And I hope, and aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there was a more important, and to you a much dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intereſt concerned, as God may be, and is ſignally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the manner in which you bear this heavieſt and moſt terrible ſtroke of his paternal rod.</p>
                  <p>God had been pleaſed, madam, to make you both emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for a variety of graces; and he has proportionably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed you both in the opportunity he has given you of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808"/>
exerciſing thoſe, which ſuit the moſt painful ſcenes, that can attend a pious and an honourable life. But when I conſider, what it is, to have loſt ſuch a man, at ſuch time, and in ſuch circumſtances, I muſt needs declare, that brave and heroic as the death of the colonel was, your ladyſhip's part is beyond all compariſon the hardeſt. Yet even here has the grace of Chriſt been ſufficient for you; and I join with your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in adoring the power and faithfulneſs of him, who has here ſo remarkably ſhewn, that he forgets not his promiſe to all his people of a ſtrength proportionable to their days; that they may be enabled to glorify him in the hotteſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, into which it is poſſible they ſhould be caſt.</p>
                  <p>To hear, (as I have heard from ſeveral perſons of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed character, who have lately had the happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near your ladyſhip,) of that meek reſignation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, of that calm patience, of that chriſtian courage, with which, in ſo weak a ſtate of health and ſpirits, you have ſupported under this awful providence, has given me great pleaſure but no ſurprize. So near a relation to ſo brave a man might have taught ſome degree of fortitude, to a ſoul leſs ſuſceptible of it than your ladyſhip's, Nor is there any doubt, but that the prayers he has ſo long been laying up in ſtore for you, eſpecially ſince the decay of his conſtitution gave him reaſon to expect a ſpeedy remove, will aſſuredly at ſuch a ſeaſon come into remembrance before God. And above all, the ſublime principles of the chriſtian religion, ſo deeply imbibed into your own heart as well as his, will not fail to exert their energy on ſuch an occaſion. Theſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, will teach you to view the hand of a wiſe, a righteous, and a gracious God in this event; and will ſhew you, that a friendſhip founded on ſuch a baſis, ſo very indearing, and ſo cloſely cemented, as that which has been here for many years a bleſſing to you both, can know only a very ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and will ſoon grow up into a union infinitely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more delightful, which never ſhall be liable to any ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, madam, it may comfort us not a little under the ſenſe of our preſent loſs, to think what religious improvement we may gain by it, if we are not wanting to ourſelves: And happy ſhall we be indeed, if we ſo hear the rod, as to receive the inſtructions it ſo naturally ſuggeſts and in forces. Perſons of any ſerious reflection will learn from
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808"/>
this awful event, how little we can judge of the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by the viſible diſpenſations of providence here: They will learn, (and it may be of great importance to conſider it, juſt in ſuch a criſis as this,) that no diſtinguiſhed degree of piety can ſecure the very beſt of men from the ſword of a common enemy: And they will ſee (written, alas, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the moſt precious blood, that war ever ſpilt in our iſland,) the vanity of the ſureſt protectors and comforters which mortality can afford, at a time when they are moſt needed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are general inſtructions, which I hope thouſands will receive, on this univerſally lamented occaſion: But to you, madam, and to me, and to all that were honoured with the moſt intimate friendſhip of this chriſtian hero, his death has a peculiar voice. Whilſt it leads us back into ſo many paſt ſcenes of delight, in the remembrance of which we now pour out our ſouls within us, it calls aloud, amidſt all this tender diſtreſs, for a tribute of humble thankfulneſs to God, that ever we enjoyed ſuch a friend, and eſpecially in ſuch an intimacy of mutual affection; and that we had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obſerving, in ſo many inſtances, the ſecret re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>es of a heart, which God had enriched, adorned, and ennobled with ſo much of his own image, and ſuch abundant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his grace: It calls for our redoubled diligence and reſolution, in imitating that bright aſſemblage of virtues, which ſhone ſo reſplendent in our illuſtrious friend: And ſurely it muſt, by a kind of irreſiſtible influence mortify our affections to this impoveriſhed world; and muſt cauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to concur with grace, in raiſing our hearts upwards to that glorious world, where he dwells triumphant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and waits our arrival with an ardor of pure and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated love, which it was impoſſible for death to quench.</p>
                  <p>Next to theſe views, nothing can give your ladyſhip greater ſatisfaction, than to reflect, how happy you made the amiable conſort you have loſt, in that intimate relation you ſo long bore to each other; in which, I well know, that growing years ripened and increaſed your mutual eſteem and friendſhip. Nor will your generous heart be inſenſible of that pleaſure, which may ariſe from reflecting, that the manner of his death (tho' in itſelf ſo terrible, that we dare not truſt imagination with the particular review,) was to him, in thoſe circumſtances, moſt glorious to religion, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028578_0071_0FD973BD873DA728"/>
ornamental, and to his country (great as its loſs is,) on various accounts beneficial. For very far be it from us to think, that Colonel Gardiner, tho' fallen by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of rebellion and treaſon, has ſought and died in vain. I truſt in God, that ſo her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I am well aſſured, that of the multitudes who lay up his memory in their inmoſt hearts with venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and love, not a few will be often joining their moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate prayers to God, for your ladyſhip, and the dear riſing branches of your family, with thoſe which you may, in conſequence of a thouſand obligations, always expect from</p>

                  <p>IT is a glory peculiar to the Chriſtian religion, that it is capable of yielding joy and triumph to the mind, amidſt calamities, in which the ſtrength of nature, and of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy that has no higher a ſupport, can hardly give it ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or even patience. Thoſe boaſted aids are but like a candle in ſome tempeſtuous night, which how artificially ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be fenced in, is often extinguiſhed amidſt the ſtorm, in which it ſhould guide and chear the traveller, or the mariner, whom it leaves on a ſudden, in darkneſs, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and fear: while the conſolation of the goſpel, like the ſun, makes a ſure day even when behind the thickeſt cloud, and ſoon emerges from it with an acceſſion of more ſenſible luſtre.</p>
                  <p>The obſervation is verified in theſe words, conſidered in connection with that awful providence, which has this day determined my thoughts to fix upon them, as the ſubject of my diſcourſe; the fall of that truly great and good man, Col. Gardiner: the endearing tenderneſs of whoſe friendſhip would have rendered his death an unſpeakable calamity to me, had his character been only of the common ſtandard; as on the other hand, the exalted excellency of his character makes his death to be lamented by thouſands who were not happy in any peculiar intimacy or perſonal acquaintance with him.</p>
                  <p>While we mourn the brave warrior, the exemplary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and the affectionate friend; loſt to ourſelves and our country, to the church and the world, at a time when we moſt needed all the defence of his bravery, all the edification of his example, all the comfort of his converſe: ſtruck with the various and aggravated ſorrow of ſo ſudden, and ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a blow methinks there is but one voice that can chear us, which is this of the great Captain of our ſalvation, ſo lately addreſſing him, and ſtill addreſſing us, in theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and animated words; "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="unknown:028578_0072_0FD963C7992A4A90"/>With regard to the connection of them, it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that our Lord in all theſe ſeven epiſtles to the Aſiatic churches repreſents the Chriſtian life as a warfare, and the bleſſings of the future ſtate as rewards to be beſtowed on conquerors. "To him that overcometh, will I give" ſuch and ſuch royal donatives. Purſuing the ſame allegory, he warns the church of Smyrna of an approaching combat, which ſhould be attended with ſome ſevere circumſtances. Some of them were to become captives: "the devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon:" and though the power of the enemy was to be limited, in its extent as well as its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the tribulation of ten days, it ſeems to be implied, that while many were harraſſed and diſtreſſed during that time, ſome of them ſhould before the cloſe of it be called to reſiſt unto blood. But their great Leader furniſhes them with ſuitable armour, and proportionable courage, by this gracious aſſurance, which it is our preſent buſineſs farther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</p>
                  <p>In which words you naturally obſerve a charge,—and a promiſe by which it is inforced—I ſhall briefly illuſtrate each, and then conclude with ſome reflections upon the whole.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, I am to open the charge here given: "Be thou faithful unto death."</p>
                  <p>Concerning which I would obſerve, that though it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addreſſed to the church at Smyrna, yet the nature of the thing and numberleſs paſſages of the divine word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to prove, that it is common in its obligation, to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and indeed to all men.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not be large in explaining the nature of faithfulneſs in general; concerning which I might ſhew you, that the word here rendered faithful has ſometimes a relation to the teſtimony which God has given us, and ſometimes to ſome truſt that he has repoſed in us. In the former ſenſe, it is properly rendered believing, and oppoſed to infidelity: "Be not faithleſs, but believing."<note n="*" place="bottom">John xx. 27.</note> In the latter, it is oppoſed to injuſtice: "He that is faithful in the which is leaſt, is falthful alſo in much;" whereas "he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much"<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xvi 10.</note> And it is in reference to this ſenſe of it, that our Lord repreſents himſelf, as ſaying to the man who had improved his talents aright, "Well
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028578_0072_0FD963C7992A4A90"/>
done good and faithful ſervant."<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 23.</note> Our deceaſed friend was ſo remarkably faithful in both theſe ſenſes; ſo ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and ſo zealous to defend "the faith once delivered to the ſaints;" and ſo active in improving thoſe various talents, with which, in mercy to many others as well as to himſelf, God had entruſted him; that it was very natural to touch upon theſe ſignifications of the word, though it has here a more particular view to another virtue, for which he was ſo illuſtriouſly conſpicuous; I mean, the courageous fidelity of a ſoldier in his warfare.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe of the word, it is oppoſed to treachery or cowardice deſertion or diſobedience to military orders. And thus it is uſed elſewhere in the ſame book of the Revelation, when ſpeaking of thoſe who war under the banner of the Lamb, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, the inſpired writer tells us, "they are called, and choſen, and faithful,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xvii. 14.</note> a ſelect body of brave and valiant ſoldiers.</p>
                  <p>This hint will alſo fix the eaſieſt and plaineſt ſenſe, in which the perſons, to whom the text is addreſſed, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be faithful unto death: which, though it does indeed in general imply, a patient continuance in well-doing,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 7.</note> in whatever ſcenes of life divine Providence may place us; yet does eſpecially refer to martial bravery, and expreſs a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to face death in its moſt terrible forms, when our great General ſhall lead us on to it. You well know this to be an indiſpenſable condition of our being acknowledged by him in the day of his final triumph: and of this he warned thoſe that gathered around him, when he was firſt raiſing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under the greateſt diſadvantages in outward appearance; expreſsly and plainly telling them, that they muſt be content to follow him to martyrdom, to follow him to crucifixion, when they receive the word of command to do it; or that all their profeſſion of regard to him would be in vain. "If any man," ſays he, "will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me:"<note n="§" place="bottom">Mark viii. 34.</note> For "he that loveth his own life more than me, is not worthy of me;"<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mat. x. 37, 39.</note> he does not deſerve the honour of bearing my name, and paſſing for one of my ſoldiers; indeed he cannot on any terms be my diſciple.<note n="**" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is in effect the language of our Lord, when
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028578_0073_0FD973C1565740E8"/>
he ſays, "Be thou faithful unto death:" It is as if he had ſaid, <q>Remember, all you of Smyrna, or of any other place and country, that call yourſelves Chriſtians, throughout all generations, that you were by baptiſm inliſted under my banners: Remember, that you have as it were ſealed and ſubſcribed your engagement to me, by every ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have ſince attended;</q> (as indeed it is well known, the word ſacrament originally ſignifies a military oath, which ſoldiers took as a pledge of fidelity to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:) <q>Remember therefore, that you are ever to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with me, and to march forward under my direction, whatever hardſhips and fatigues may lie in the way. And remember, that if I lead you on to the moſt formidable combat, you muſt cheerfully obey the word of command, and charge boldly, though you ſhould immediately die, whether by the ſword, or by fire. Should you dare to flee, I am myſelf your enemy; and the weapons which I bear, would juſtly be levelled at your own traitorous heads. But if you bravely follow me, I know how to make you am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amends, even though you fall in the action. When no human power and gratitude can reach you, it is my glorious prerogative to engage, that to thoſe who are thus faithful unto death, I will give a crown of life.</q> We are therefore,</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, To conſider the Promiſe, by which the Charge is enforced: "I will give thee a crown of life."</p>
                  <p>And here I might obſerve,—a Crown of Life is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward propoſed,—and it is to be received from the hand of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Crown of Life is the reward propoſed: which we are ſure in this connection implies, both grandeur, and felicity, here, though rarely connected together.</p>
                  <p>There is, no doubt, an alluſion in theſe words, to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and I think very prudent cuſtom, of animating the bravery of ſoldiers by honorary rewards, and particularly by crowns, ſometimes of laurel, and ſometimes, more rarely, of ſilver or gold; which they were permitted to wear on public occaſions, and in conſequence of receiving which they were ſometimes intitled to ſome peculiar immunities But here our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, conſcious of his own divine power and prerogative, ſpeaks with a dignity and elevation, which no earthly prince or commander could ever aſſume; promiſing a crown of life, and that (as was obſerved before) even to
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028578_0073_0FD973C1565740E8"/>
thoſe who ſhould fall in the battle: A crown of life in the higheſt ſenſe; not only one, which ſhould ever be freſh and fair, but which ſhould give immortality to the happy brow it adorned; and be for ever worn, not only as the monument of bravery and victory, but as the enſign of royalty too: A crown connected with a kingdom, and with what no other kingdom can give, perpetual life to enjoy it; perpetual youth and vigour to reliſh all its delights. And this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the language of other ſcriptures, where we read of "the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him;<note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. i. 12.</note> a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give;<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 8.</note> a crown of glory, which fadeth not away."<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 4.</note> We may alſo obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is ſaid to be given by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This ſome pious commentators have explained, as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it is the gift of the Redeemer's free and unmerited grace, and not a retribution due to the merit of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it. And this is an undoubted truth, which it is of the higheſt importance to acknowledge and conſider. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wages of ſin, is death; but eternal life is (in oppoſition to wages) "the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 23.</note> We ſhould humbly own it every day, that there is no proportion between the value of our ſervices, and the crown which we expect to receive: ſhould own, that it is mercy that pardons our ſins, and grace that accepts our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; much more, that crowns them. Grace, grace, ſhall (as it were) be engraven upon that crown, in characters large and indelible. Nor will that inſcription diminiſh its luſtre, or impair the pleaſure with which we ſhall receive it. I could not forbear mentioning this thought, as a truth of the utmoſt importance, which ſtands on the firmeſt baſis of very many expreſs ſcriptures; a truth, of which perhaps no man living had ever a deeper ſenſe, than our deceaſed friend. But I mention it thus obliquely, becauſe it may be doubted whether we can juſtly argue it from hence; ſince the word give is ſometimes uſed for rendering a retribution juſtly due, and that in inſtances where grace and favour have, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech, no concern at all.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Compare Mat. xx. 8.

And the apoſtle Paul evidently refers to the ſame circumſtance, in terms which ſhew how much he entered into the ſpirit of the thought, when he ſays, "The Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give it me:"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 8.</note> He himſelf, the great Judge of the conteſt, whoſe eye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that on the whole, when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life," methinks our devout meditations may expatiate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words, in ſome ſuch paraphraſe as this. It is as if he had ſaid to you, and to me, and to all his people, <q>Oh my faithful ſoldiers, fear not death in its moſt terrible array, for you are immortal.

Too great, too great, might the favour ſeem if I, who have ſo often lifted up my rebellious hand againſt thy throne, might be allowed to lay down this guilty head in the duſt, and loſe the memory of my treaſons, and the ſenſe of my puniſhment together, in everlaſting forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.

chriſtian hero, Colonel Gardiner; whoſe character was too well known to many of you, by ſome months reſidence here, to need your being informed of it from me; and whoſe hiſtory was too remarkable, to be confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe few remaining moments, which muſt be allotted to the finiſhing of this diſcourſe. Yet there was ſomething ſo uncommon in both, that I think it of high importance to the honor of the goſpel and grace of Chriſt, that they ſhould be delivered down to poſterity, in a diſtinct and particular view. And therefore, as the Providence of God, in concurrence with that moſt intimate and familiar friendſhip with which this great and good man was pleaſed to honor me gives me an opportunity of ſpeaking of many important things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially relating to his religious experiences, with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and certainty than moſt others might be capable of doing; and as he gave me his full permiſſion, in caſe I ſhould have the affliction to ſurvive him, to declare freely whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I knew of him, which I might apprehend conducive to the glory of God, and the advancement of religion: I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe publiſhing, in a diſtinct tract, ſome remarkable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life, illuſtrated by extracts from his own letters, which ſpeak in the moſt forcible manner the genuine ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his heart. But as I promiſe myſelf conſiderable aſſiſtance in this work, from ſome valuable perſons in the northern part of our iſland, and poſſibly from ſome of his own papers, to which our preſent confuſions forbid my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I muſt delay the execution of this deſign at leaſt for a few months; and muſt likewiſe take heed, that I do not too much anticipate what I may then offer to the public view, by what it might otherwiſe be very proper to mention now.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore ſuffice for the preſent to remind you, that Colonel Gardiner was one of the moſt illuſtrious inſtances of the energy, and indeed I muſt alſo add of the ſovereignty of divine grace, which I have heard or read of in modern hiſtory. He was, in the moſt amazing and miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without any divine ordinance, without any religious opportunity, or peculiar advantage, deliverance, or affliction, reclaimed on a ſudden, in the vigour of life and health, from the moſt licencious and abandoned ſenſuality, not only to a ſteady courſe of regularity and virtue, but to high devotion, and ſtrict though unaffected ſanctity of manners: A courſe, (in which he perſiſted for more than twenty-ſix years, that

Every one of theſe articles, with many more, I hope, (if God ſpare my life) to have an opportunity of illuſtrating, in ſuch a manner as to ſhew, that he was a living demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the energy and excellency of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor can I imagine how I can ſerve its intereſts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than by recording what I have ſeen and known upon this head, known to my own edification, as well as my joy.</p>
                  <p>But, Oh, how ſhall I lead back your thoughts, and my own, to what we once enjoyed in him, without too deep and tender a ſenſe of what we have loſt! To have poured out his ſoul in blood; to have fallen by the ſavage and rebellious hands of his own countrymen, at the wall of his own houſe; deſerted by thoſe, who were under the higheſt obligations that can be imagined to have defended his life with their own; and above all, to have ſeen with his dying eyes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our religion and liberties triumphant, and to have heard in his lateſt moments the horrid noiſe of their inſulting ſhouts;—is a ſcene, in the view of which we are almoſt tempted to ſay, Where were the ſhields of angels? Where the eye of Providence? Where the remembrance of thoſe numberleſs prayers, which had been offered to God for the preſervation of ſuch a man, at ſuch a time as this?—But let faith aſſure us, that he was never more dear and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eye of his divine leader, than in theſe dreadful moments, when if ſenſe were to judge, he might ſeem moſt neglected. That is of all others the happieſt death, which may moſt ſenſibly approve our fidelity to God, and our zeal for his glory. To ſtand ſingly in the combat with the fierceſt enemies, in the cauſe of religion and liberty, when the whole regiment he commanded fled; to throw himſelf with ſo noble an ardor to defend thoſe on foot, whom the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028578_0078_0FD973D76C89B3F0"/>
whole body which he headed were appointed to ſupport, when he ſaw that the fall of the neareſt commander expoſed thoſe brave men to the extremity of danger; were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that evidently ſhewed, how much be held honour and duty dearer than life. He could not but be conſcious of the diſtinguiſhed profeſſion he had made, under a religious character; he could not but be ſenſible, how much our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in circumſtances like theſe, needs all that the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous examples can do, to animate its officers and its ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: And therefore he ſeems deliberately to have judged, that although when his men would hear no voice but that of their fears, he might have retreated without infamy, it was better he ſhould die in ſo glorious a cauſe, than have it thought that his regard to religion and liberty was but a mere profeſſion, that was not ſtrong enough to make him faithful unto death. He had long felt the force of it; and had too high a value for his king and country, to think of deſerting the truſt committed to him; too great a love for the proteſtant religion, to think of exchanging it for the errors of popery; and rather than give way to a rebellious crew, by whoſe ſucceſs an inlet would be opened to the cruel ravages of arbitrary power, and to the bloody and relentleſs rage of popiſh ſuperſtition, he loved not his life unto the death<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xii. 11.</note>. And in this view his death was martyrdom, and has, I doubt not, received the applauſes and rewards of it: For what is martyrdom, but voluntarily to meet death, for the honour of God, and the teſtimony of a good conſcience? —And if it be indeed true, as it is reported on very conſiderable authority, that before he expired he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with the leader of the oppoſite party, and declared in his preſence <q>the full aſſurance he had of an immortal crown, which he was going to receive,</q> it is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fighting in defence of the religion and liberties of his country; or might have an opportunity of expreſſing his hopes and joys, as a chriſtian to the honour of his Lord, and the edification of thoſe about him, in his departing moments; and ſo might go off this earthly ſtage,</q> as in the letter that relates his death, it is expreſsly ſaid that he did, "triumphing in the aſſurance of a bleſſed immortality."</p>
                  <p>How difficult it muſt be in our preſent circumſtances, to gain certain and exact information, you will eaſily perceive: But enough is known, and more than enough, to ſhew how juſtly the high conſolations of that glorious ſubject which we have been contemplating, may be applied to the preſent ſolemn occaſion. From what is certain with relation to him, we may preſume to ſay, that after he had adorned the goſpel by ſo honorable a life, in ſuch a conſpicuous ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God ſeems to have condeſcended, as with his own hand, to raiſe him an illuſtrious theatre, on which he might die a venerable and amiable ſpectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 9.</note>; ballancing to his native land by ſuch an exit, the loſs of what future ſervices it could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from a conſtitution ſo much broken as his was, by the fatigues of his campaign in Flanders, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an illneſs, from which he never recovered.</p>
                  <p>On the whole therefore, whatever cauſe we have, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have great cauſe,) to ſympathize with his wounded family, and with his wounded country; and how decent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, like David, to take up our lamentation over the mighty fallen, and the brighteſt weapons of our war periſhed<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. i. 27.</note>; (and oh, how naturally might ſome of us adopt the preceding words too!) Yet after all, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſummon up a ſpirit, like that with which he bore the loſs of friends, eminent for their goodneſs and uſefulneſs. And while we glorify God in him<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. i. 24.</note>, as on ſo many accounts we have reaſon to do, let us be animated by ſuch an example to a reſolution of continuing like him, ſtedfaſt in our duty, amidſt deſertion and danger, and all the terrors that can beſet us around. As he, having been ſo eminently faithful unto death, has undoubtedly received a crown of life, which ſhines with diſtinguiſhed luſture, among thoſe who are come out of much tribulation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. vii. 14.</note>; let us be couragious followers of him, and of all the glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
