            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHILE my heart is following you with a truly pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Å¿olicitude, through all the dangers of military life, in which you are thus early engaged, anxious for your Å¿afety amidÅ¿t the inÅ¿truments of death, and the far more dangerous allurements of vice; I feel a peculiar pleaÅ¿ure in being able at length, though after Å¿uch long delays, to put into your hands the MEMOIRS with which I now preÅ¿ent you. They contain many particulars, which would have been worthy of your attentive notice, had they related to a perÅ¿on of the moÅ¿t diÅ¿tant nation or age: But they will, I doubt not, command your peculiar regard, as they are Å¿acred to the memory of that excellent man, from whom you had the honour to derive your birth, and by whoÅ¿e generous and affectionate care, you have been laid under all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the beÅ¿t of fathers could confer on a moÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Å¿on.</p>
                  <p>Here, Sir, you Å¿ee a gentleman, who with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a liberal and religious education, added to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural accompliÅ¿hment that could render him moÅ¿t agreeable, entered, before he had attained the Å¿tature of a man, on thoÅ¿e arduous and generous Å¿ervices to which you are devoted, and behaved in them with a gallantry and courage, which will always give a Å¿plendor to his name among the BritiÅ¿h Å¿oldiery, and render him an example to all officers of his rank. But alas! amidÅ¿t all the intrepidity of the Martial Hero, you Å¿ee him vanquiÅ¿hed by the blandiÅ¿hments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80"/>
and in chace of it plunging himÅ¿elf into follies and vices, for which no want of education or genius could have been a Å¿ufficient excuÅ¿e. You behold him urging the ignoble and fatal purÅ¿uit, unmoved by the terrors which death was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually darting around him, and the moÅ¿t Å¿ignal deliverances by which Providence again and again reÅ¿cued him from thoÅ¿e terrors; till at length he was reclaimed by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorable interpoÅ¿ition of divine grace. Then you have the pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing him become in good earneÅ¿t a convert to ChriÅ¿tianity, and by Å¿peedy advances growing up into one of its brighteÅ¿t ornaments; his mind continually filled with the great ideas which the goÅ¿pel of our Redeemer Å¿uggeÅ¿ts, and bringing the bleÅ¿Å¿ed influence of its Å¿ublime principles into every relation of military and civil, of public and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿tic life. You trace him perÅ¿evering in a Å¿teady and uniform courÅ¿e of goodneÅ¿s, through a long Å¿eries of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and proÅ¿perous years, the delight of all that were Å¿o happy as to know him, and, in his Å¿phere, the moÅ¿t faithful guardian of his country; till at laÅ¿t, worn out with honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able labours, and broken with infirmities which they had haÅ¿tened upon him before the time, you Å¿ee him forgetting them at once at the call of duty and Providence; with all the generous ardour of his moÅ¿t vigorous days ruÅ¿hing on the enemies of religion and liberty, Å¿uÅ¿taining their Å¿hock with the moÅ¿t deliberate fortitude, when deÅ¿erted by thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould have Å¿upported him, and chearfully Å¿acrificing the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remains of a mortal life, in the triumphant views of a glorious immortality.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, is the noble object I preÅ¿ent to your view; and you will, I hope, fix your eye continually upon it, and will never allow yourÅ¿elf for one day to forget, that this illuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man is COLONEL GARDINER, your ever honoured fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who having approved his <hi>fidelity to the death</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>a crown of life,</hi> Å¿eems as it were, by what you here read, to be calling out to you from amidÅ¿t <hi>the cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es</hi> with which you are Å¿urrounded, and urging you by every generous, tender, filial Å¿entiment, to mark the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teps of his ChriÅ¿tian race, and Å¿trenuouÅ¿ly to maintain that combat, where the victory is through divine grace certain, and the prize an eternal kingdom in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80"/>My hopes, Sir, that all theÅ¿e powerful motives will eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially have their full efficacy on you, are greatly encouraged by the certainty which I have of your being well acquainted with the evidence of ChriÅ¿tianity in its full extent; a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ignorance of which, in the midÅ¿t of great advantages for learning them, leaves Å¿o many of our young people a prey to DeiÅ¿m, and Å¿o to vice and ruin, which generally bring up its rear. My life would be a continual burthen to me, if I had not a conÅ¿ciouÅ¿neÅ¿s in the Å¿ight of God, that during the years in which the important truÅ¿t of your education was committed to my care, I had laid before you the proofs both of natural and revealed religion, in what I aÅ¿Å¿uredly eÅ¿teem to be, with regard to the judgment, if they are carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, an irreÅ¿iÅ¿table light; and that I had endeavoured to attend them with thoÅ¿e addreÅ¿Å¿es, which might be moÅ¿t likely to impreÅ¿s your heart. You have not, dear Sir, forgotten, and I am confident you can never entirely forget, the aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity with which I have laboured to form your mind, not only to what might be ornamental to you in human life, but above all to a true taÅ¿te of what is really excellent, and an early contempt of thoÅ¿e vanities by which the generality of our youth, eÅ¿pecially in your Å¿tation, are debaÅ¿ed, enerva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed, and undone. My private as well as public addreÅ¿Å¿es for this purpoÅ¿e will, I know, be remembered by you, and the tears of tenderneÅ¿s with which they have Å¿o often been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied: And may they be Å¿o remembered, that they who are moÅ¿t tenderly concerned, may be comforted under the loÅ¿s of Å¿uch an ineÅ¿timable friend as Colonel Gardiner, by Å¿eeing that his character, in all its moÅ¿t amiable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿plendent parts, lives in you; and that how difficult Å¿oever it may be to act up to that height of expectation, with which the eyes of the world will be fixed on the Å¿on of Å¿uch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are, in the Å¿trength of divine grace attempting it; at leaÅ¿t are following him with generous emulation, and with daily Å¿olicitude, that the Å¿teps may be leÅ¿s unequal!</p>
                  <p>May the Lord God of your father, and I will add, of both your pious and honourable parents, animate your heart more and more with Å¿uch views and Å¿entiments as theÅ¿e! May he guard your life amidÅ¿t every Å¿cene of danger, to be

                  <p n="1">Â§ 1. WHEN I promiÅ¿ed the public Å¿ome larger account of the life and character of this illuÅ¿trious perÅ¿on, than I could conveniently inÅ¿ert in my Å¿ermon on the Å¿ad occaÅ¿ion of his death, I was Å¿ecure, that, if providence continued my capacity of writing, I Å¿hould not wholly diÅ¿appoint the expectation. For I was furniÅ¿hed with a variety of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which appeared to me worthy of general notice, in conÅ¿equence of that intimate friendÅ¿hip with which he had honoured me during the Å¿ix laÅ¿t years of his life; a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip which led him to open his heart to me in repeated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ations with an unbounded confidence, (as he then aÅ¿Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, beyond what he had uÅ¿ed with any other man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) Å¿o far as religious experiences were concerned: And I had alÅ¿o received Å¿everal very valuable letters from him, during the time of our abÅ¿ence from each other, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained moÅ¿t genuine and edifying traces of his chriÅ¿tian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But I hoped farther to learn many valuable particulars from the papers of his own cloÅ¿et; and from his letters to other friends, as well as from what they more circumÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially knew concerning him: I therefore determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the execution of my promiÅ¿e, till I could enjoy theÅ¿e

Yet, (which to me appeared very aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing) he had little thoughts of humbling himÅ¿elf before God, and returning to him after the wanderings of a life Å¿o licentiouÅ¿ly begun.</p>

Expecting to be Å¿tripped, he firÅ¿t took out a handful of that clotted gore, of which he was frequently obliged to clear his mouth, or he would have been choaked; and putting it into his left-hand, he took out his money (which I think, was about nineteen piÅ¿toles) and Å¿hutting his hand, and beÅ¿mearing the back part of it with blood, he kept it in this poÅ¿ition till the blood dried in Å¿uch a manner, that his hand could not eaÅ¿ily fall open, though any Å¿udden Å¿urprize Å¿hould happen, in which he might loÅ¿e the preÅ¿ence of mind which that concealment otherwiÅ¿e would have required.</p>

and I have been told, that a great deal of the care of that admirably well adjuÅ¿ted ceremony fell upon him; Å¿o that he gained great credit by the manner in which he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Under the benign influences of his lordÅ¿hip's favour, (which to the laÅ¿t day of his life he retained,) a captain's commiÅ¿Å¿ion was procured for him, (dated July 22, in the year 1715,) in the regiment of dragoons commanded by Colonel Stanhope, (now Earl of Harrington;) and, in the year 1717, he was advanced to the majority of that regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in which office he continued till it was reduced, on November the 10th, 1718; when he was put out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion. But then his majeÅ¿ty King George I. was Å¿o tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly apprized of his faithful and important Å¿ervices, that he gave him his Å¿ign-manual, intituling him to the firÅ¿t majority that Å¿hould become vacant, in any regiment of horÅ¿e or dragoons; which happened, about five years after, to be in Croft's regiment of dragoons, in which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a commiÅ¿Å¿ion, dated June the 1Å¿t, 1724; and on the 20th of July the Å¿ame year, he was made major of an older re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, commanded by the Earl of Stair.</p>

He continued (if I remember right,) Å¿everal years under the roof of the brave and generous Earl of Stair; to whom he endeavoured to approve himÅ¿elf by every inÅ¿tance of diligent and faithful Å¿ervice. And his lordÅ¿hip gave no inconÅ¿iderable proof of the dependance which he had upon him, when, in the beginning of the year 1715, he intruÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the important diÅ¿patches, relating to a diÅ¿cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which by a Å¿eries of admirable policy he had made, of

a deÅ¿ign which the French king was then forming, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Great-Britain in favour of the pretender; in which the French apprehended they were Å¿o Å¿ure of Å¿ucceÅ¿s, that it Å¿eemed a point of friendÅ¿hip in one of the chief counÅ¿ellors of that court, to diÅ¿Å¿uade a dependant of his from accepting Å¿ome employment under his Britannic majeÅ¿ty, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed by his envoy there; becauÅ¿e it was Å¿aid, that in leÅ¿s than Å¿ix weeks there would be a revolution, in favour of what they called the family of the Stuarts. The captain diÅ¿patched his journey with the utmoÅ¿t Å¿peed; a variety of circumÅ¿tances happily concurred to accelerate it; and they, who remember how Å¿oon the regiments which that emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy required were raiÅ¿ed and armed, will, I doubt not, eÅ¿teem it a memorable inÅ¿tance, both of the moÅ¿t cordial zeal in the friends of the government, and of the gracious care of divine providence over the houÅ¿e of Hanover, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿h liberties, Å¿o inÅ¿eparably connected with its intereÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p n="21">Â§. 21. While Captain Gardiner was at London, in one of the journies he made upon this occaÅ¿ion, he, with that frankneÅ¿s which was natural to him, and which in thoÅ¿e days was not always under the moÅ¿t prudent reÅ¿traint, ventured to predict, from what he knew of the bad Å¿tate of the French king's health, that he would not live Å¿ix weeks. This was made known by Å¿ome Å¿pies who were at St. James's, and came to be reported at the court of VerÅ¿ailles; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived letters from Å¿ome friends at Paris, adviÅ¿ing him not to return thither, unleÅ¿s he could reconcile himÅ¿elf to a lodging in the baÅ¿tile. But he was Å¿oon free from that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ion; for, if I miÅ¿take not, before half that time was accompliÅ¿hed, Louis XIV. died, Sept. 1, 1715, and it is generally thought, his death was haÅ¿tened by a very acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumÅ¿tance, which had Å¿ome reference to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's prophecy. For the laÅ¿t time he ever dined in public, which was a very little while after the report of it had been made there, he happened to diÅ¿cover our BritiÅ¿h envoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Å¿pectators. The penetration of this illuÅ¿trious perÅ¿on was too great, and his attachment to the intereÅ¿t of his royal maÅ¿ter too well known, not to render him very diÅ¿agreeable to that crafty and tyrannical prince, whom God had Å¿o long Å¿uffered to be the diÅ¿grace of monarchy, and the Å¿courge of Europe. He at firÅ¿t appeared very languid, as

This gave occaÅ¿ion for Å¿ome humorous people to Å¿ay, that old Louis after all, was killed by a Briton. But if this Å¿tory be true, (which I think there can be no room to doubt, as the colonel, from whom I have often heard it, though abÅ¿ent, could Å¿carce be miÅ¿informed,) it might more properly be Å¿aid, that he fell by his own vanity; in which view I thought it Å¿o remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as not to be unworthy a place in theÅ¿e memoirs.</p>

Such was then his happineÅ¿s; and Å¿uch perhaps is that of hundreds more, who bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves higheÅ¿t in the contempt of religion, and glory in that infamous Å¿ervitude which they affect to call liberty, But theÅ¿e remonÅ¿trances of reaÅ¿on and conÅ¿cience were in vain; and, in Å¿hort, he carried things Å¿o far, in this wretched part of his life, that I am well aÅ¿Å¿ured, Å¿ome Å¿ober EngliÅ¿h gentlemen, who made no great pretences to religion, how agreeable Å¿oever he might have been to them on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, rather declined than Å¿ought his company, as fearing they might have been inÅ¿nared and corrupted by it.</p>

Indeed he never had any natural reliÅ¿h for that kind of intemperance, from which he uÅ¿ed to think a manly pride might be Å¿ufficient to preÅ¿erve perÅ¿ons of Å¿enÅ¿e and Å¿pirit; as by it they give up every thing that diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hes them from the meaneÅ¿t of their Å¿pecies, or indeed from animals the moÅ¿t below it. So that, if he ever fell into any exceÅ¿Å¿es of this kind, it was merely out of complaiÅ¿ance to his company, and that he might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Å¿tiff and Å¿ingular. His frank, obliging, and generous temper, procured him many friends; and theÅ¿e principles, which rendered him amiable to others, not being under the direction of true wiÅ¿dom and piety, Å¿ometimes made him, in the ways of living he purÅ¿ued, more uneaÅ¿y to himÅ¿elf, than he might perhaps have been if he could entirely have out-grown them; eÅ¿pecially as he was never a Å¿ceptic in his principles, but Å¿till retained a Å¿ecret apprehenÅ¿ion, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and revealed religion, though he did not much care to think of either, were Å¿ounded in truth.

His continual neglect of the great Author of his being, of whoÅ¿e perfections he could not doubt, and to whom he knew himÅ¿elf to be under daily and perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, gave him, in Å¿ome moments of involuntary reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inexpreÅ¿Å¿ible remorÅ¿e; and this, at times, wrought upon him to Å¿uch a degree, that he reÅ¿olved he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pay him Å¿ome acknowledgements.

This memorable event happened toward the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of July, 1719. but I cannot be exact as to the day. The major had Å¿pent the evening (and if I miÅ¿take not, it was the Sabbath,) in Å¿ome gay company, and had an unhappy aÅ¿Å¿ignation with a married woman, of what rank or quality, I did not particularly enquire, whom he was to attend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at twelve. The company broke up about eleven; and not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he went into his chamber, to kill the tedious hour, perhaps with Å¿ome amuÅ¿ing book or Å¿ome other way. But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book, which his good mother or aunt had, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Å¿lipped into his portmanteau. It was called, if I remember the title exactly, The ChriÅ¿tian Soldier, or Heaven taken by Storm; and was written by Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas WatÅ¿on. GueÅ¿Å¿ing by the title of it, that he Å¿hould find Å¿ome phraÅ¿es of his own profeÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿piritualized, in a manner which he thought might afford him Å¿ome diverÅ¿ion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved to dip into it: but he took no Å¿erious notice of any thing he read in it: And yet, while this book was in his hand, an impreÅ¿Å¿ion was made upon his mind (perhaps God only knows how,) which drew after it a train of the moÅ¿t important and happy conÅ¿equences.</p>

There is indeed a poÅ¿Å¿ibility, that while he was Å¿itting in this attitude, and reading in this careleÅ¿s and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane manner, he might Å¿uddenly fall aÅ¿leep, and only dream of what he apprehended he Å¿aw. But nothing can be more certain, than that, when he gave me this relation, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himÅ¿elf to have been as broad awake during the whole time, as he ever was in any part of his life; and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it to me Å¿everal times afterwards, as what undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly

[as being, when moÅ¿t real, Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural impreÅ¿Å¿ions on the imagination, rather than attended with any external object,] had Å¿ome influence upon him.

He thought he Å¿aw an unuÅ¿ual blaze of light fall on the book while he was reading, which he at firÅ¿t imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might happen by Å¿ome accident in the candle. But lifting up his eyes, he apprehended, to his extreme amazement, that there was before him, as it were Å¿uÅ¿pended in the air, a viÅ¿ible repreÅ¿entation of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t upon the croÅ¿s, Å¿urrounded on all Å¿ides with a glory; and was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed, as if a voice, or Å¿omething equivalent to a voice, had come to him, to this effect, (for he was not confident as to the very words,) <q>Oh Å¿inner, did I Å¿uffer this for thee, and are theÅ¿e the returns?</q> But whether this were an audible voice, or only a Å¿trong impreÅ¿Å¿ion on his mind equally Å¿triking, he did not Å¿eem very confident; though, to the beÅ¿t of my remembrance, he rather judged it to be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Struck with Å¿o amazing a phaenomenon as this, there remained hardly any life in him, Å¿o that he Å¿unk down in the arm-chair in which he Å¿at, and continued, he knew not exactly how long, inÅ¿enÅ¿ible; (which was one circumÅ¿tance, that made me Å¿everal times take the liberty to Å¿uggeÅ¿t, that he might poÅ¿Å¿ibly be all this while aÅ¿leep:) but however that were, he quickly after opened his eyes, and Å¿aw nothing more than uÅ¿ual.</p>

Nor did he, throughout all the remainder of the night, once recollect that criminal and deteÅ¿table aÅ¿Å¿ignation, which had before engroÅ¿Å¿ed all his

thoughts. He roÅ¿e in a tumult of paÅ¿Å¿ions, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and walked to and fro in his chamber, till he was ready to drop down, in unutterable aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment and agony of heart; appearing to himÅ¿elf the vileÅ¿t monÅ¿ter in the creation of God, who had all his life-time been crucifying ChriÅ¿t afreÅ¿h by his Å¿ins, and now Å¿aw, as he aÅ¿Å¿uredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by a miraculous viÅ¿ion, the horror of what he had done. With this was connected Å¿uch a view, both of the majeÅ¿ty and goodneÅ¿s of God, as cauÅ¿ed him to loath and abhor himÅ¿elf, and to repent as in duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave judgment againÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, that he was moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly worthy of eternal damnation: He was aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed, that he had not been immediately Å¿truck dead in the midÅ¿t of his wickedneÅ¿s: And (which I think deÅ¿erves particular remark,) though he aÅ¿Å¿uredly believed that he Å¿hould ere long be in hell, and Å¿ettled it as a point with himÅ¿elf for Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months, that the wiÅ¿dom and juÅ¿tice of God did almoÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily require, that Å¿uch an enormous Å¿inner Å¿hould be made an example of everlaÅ¿ting vengeance, and a Å¿pectacle as Å¿uch both to angels and men, Å¿o that he hardly durÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume to pray for pardon; yet what he then Å¿uffered, was not Å¿o much from the fear of hell, though he concluded it would Å¿oon be his portion, as from a Å¿enÅ¿e of that horrible ingratitude he had Å¿hewn to the God of his life, and to that bleÅ¿Å¿ed Redeemer, who had been in Å¿o affecting a manner Å¿et forth as crucified before him.</p>

Where I make any extracts as from Colonel Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's letters, they are either from originals, which I have in my own hands, or from copies, which were tranÅ¿mitted to me from perÅ¿ons of undoubted credit, chiefly by the right honorable the lady Frances Gardiner, through the hand of the Rev.

This I the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome letters have been brought to me as Colonel Gardiner's, concerning which, I have not only been very dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but morally certain, that they could not have been written by him.

I do not remember that I ever told to any other perÅ¿on. It was this; that after the aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing Å¿ight I had of my bleÅ¿Å¿ed Lord, the terrible condition in which I was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not Å¿o much from the terrors of the law, as from a Å¿enÅ¿e of having been Å¿o ungrateful a monÅ¿ter to him whom I thought I Å¿aw pierced for my tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions.</q> I the rather inÅ¿ert theÅ¿e words, as they evidently atteÅ¿t the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance which may Å¿eem moÅ¿t amazing in this affair, and contain Å¿o expreÅ¿s a declaration of his own apprehenÅ¿ion concerning it.</p>
                  <p n="35">Â§. 35 In this view it may naturally be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that he paÅ¿Å¿ed the remainder of the night waking; and he could get but little reÅ¿t in Å¿everal that followed His mind was continually taken up in reflecting on the divine purity and goodneÅ¿s; the grace which had been propoÅ¿ed to him in the goÅ¿pel, and which he had rejected; the Å¿ingular advantages he had enjoyed and abuÅ¿ed; and the many favours of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which he had received, particularly in reÅ¿cuing him from Å¿o many eminent dangers of death, which he now Å¿aw muÅ¿t have been attended with Å¿uch dreadful and hopeleÅ¿s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction. The privileges of his education, which he had Å¿o much deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, now lay with an almoÅ¿t inÅ¿upportable weight on his mind; and the folly of that career of Å¿inful pleaÅ¿ure, which he had Å¿o many years been running with deÅ¿perate eagerneÅ¿s and unworthy delight, now filled him with indignation againÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and againÅ¿t the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, by whom (to uÅ¿e his own phraÅ¿e,) he had been "Å¿o wretchedly and Å¿candalouÅ¿ly be fooled." This he uÅ¿ed often to expreÅ¿s in the Å¿trongeÅ¿t terms; which I Å¿hall not repeat Å¿o particularly, as I cannot recollect Å¿ome of them. But on the whole, it is certain, that by what paÅ¿Å¿ed before he left his chamber the next day, the whole frame and diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of his Å¿oul was new-modelled and changed; Å¿o that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and continued to the laÅ¿t day of his exemplary and truly chriÅ¿tian life, the very reverÅ¿e of what he had been before. A variety of particulars, which I am afterwards to mention, will illuÅ¿trate this in the moÅ¿t convincing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

But I cannot proceed to them, without pauÅ¿ing a while to adore Å¿o illuÅ¿trious an inÅ¿tance of the power and freedom of divine grace, and intreating my reader Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to reflect upon it, that his own heart may be Å¿uitably affected. For Å¿urely if the truth of the fact be admitted, in the loweÅ¿t views in which it can be placed, (that is, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the firÅ¿t impreÅ¿Å¿ion to have paÅ¿Å¿ed in a dream,) it muÅ¿t be allowed to have been little, if any thing, leÅ¿s than miraculous. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the courÅ¿e of nature be imagined, how Å¿uch a dream Å¿hould ariÅ¿e in a mind, full of the moÅ¿t impure ideas and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and (as he himÅ¿elf often pleaded,) more alienated from the thoughts of a crucified Saviour, than from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object that can be conceived: Nor can we Å¿urely Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, it Å¿hould, without a mighty energy of the divine power, be effectual to produce, not only Å¿ome tranÅ¿ient flow of paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, but Å¿o entire and Å¿o permanent a change in character and conduct.</p>
                  <p n="36">Â§. 36. On the whole therefore, I muÅ¿t beg leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s my own Å¿entiments of the matter, by repeating on this occaÅ¿ion what I wrote Å¿everal years ago, in my eighth Å¿ermon on regeneration, in a paÅ¿Å¿age dictated chiefly by the circumÅ¿tantial knowledge which I had of this amazing Å¿tory, and methinks Å¿ufficiently vindicated by it, if it Å¿tood entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alone; which yet, I muÅ¿t take the liberty to Å¿ay, it does not: for I hope the world will be particularly informed, that there is at leaÅ¿t a Å¿econd, that very nearly approaches it, whenever the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed church of England Å¿hall loÅ¿e one of its brighteÅ¿t living ornaments, and one of the moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful members, which that, or perhaps any other chriÅ¿tian communion, can beaÅ¿t: In the mean time, may his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life be long continued, and his zealous miniÅ¿try abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proÅ¿pered! I beg my reader's pardon for this digreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion. The paÅ¿Å¿age I referred to above is remarkably, though not equally, applicable to both the caÅ¿es, as it Å¿tands in page 263, of the firÅ¿t edition, and page 160, of the Å¿econd; under that head, where I am Å¿hewing, that God Å¿ometimes accompliÅ¿hes the great work of which we Å¿peak, by Å¿ecret and immediate impreÅ¿Å¿ions on the mind. After preceding illuÅ¿trations, there are the following words, on which the colonel's converÅ¿ion will throw the juÅ¿teÅ¿t light: <q>Yes I have known thoÅ¿e of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed genius, polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and great experience in human affairs, who, after

The mind of major Gardiner continued from this remarkable time till towards the end of October, (that is, rather more than three months, but eÅ¿pecially the two firÅ¿t of them,) in as extraordinary a Å¿ituation as one can well imagine; he knew nothing of the joys ariÅ¿ing from a Å¿enÅ¿e of pardon; but on the contrary, for the greater part of that time, and with very Å¿hort intervals of hope toward the end of it, took it for granted, that he muÅ¿t, in all probability, quickly periÅ¿h.

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028578_0017_0FD972FF095DFEB8"/>
well known in the grand and the gay world, I muÅ¿t beg leave to conceal,) who had imbibed the principles of deiÅ¿m, and valued herÅ¿elf much upon being an avowed advocate for them. The major, with his uÅ¿ual frankneÅ¿s, (though I doubt not with that politeneÅ¿s of manners, which was Å¿o habitual to him, and which he retained throughout his whole life,) anÅ¿wered her, like a man who perfectly Å¿aw through the fallacy of her arguments, and was grieved to the heart for her deluÅ¿ion. On this Å¿he briÅ¿kly challenged him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the matter at large, and to fix upon a day for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, when he Å¿hould dine with her, attended with any clergyman he might chuÅ¿e, whether of the proteÅ¿tant, or catholic communion. A Å¿enÅ¿e of duty would not allow him to decline this challenge; and yet he had no Å¿ooner accepted it, but he was thrown into great perplexity and diÅ¿treÅ¿s, left being (as I remember he expreÅ¿Å¿ed it, when he told me the Å¿tory,) only a chriÅ¿tian of Å¿ix weeks old, he Å¿hould prejudice Å¿o good a cauÅ¿e, by his unÅ¿kilful manner of defending it. However, he Å¿ought his refuge in earneÅ¿t and repeated pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that he who can ordain Å¿trength, and perfect praiÅ¿e, out of the mouth of babes and Å¿ucklings, would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouÅ¿ly enable him, on this occaÅ¿ion, to vindicate his truths in a manner which might carry conviction along with it. He then endeavoured to marÅ¿hal the arguments in his own mind, as well as he could; and apprehending that he could not Å¿peak with Å¿o much freedom before a number of perÅ¿ons, eÅ¿pecially before Å¿uch, whoÅ¿e province he might in that eaÅ¿e Å¿eem to invade, if he had not devolved the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the diÅ¿courÅ¿e upon them, he eaÅ¿ily admitted the apology of a clergyman or two, to whom he mentioned the affair and waited on the lady alone upon the day appointed. But his heart was Å¿o Å¿et upon the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, that he came earlier than he was expected, and time enough to have two hours diÅ¿courÅ¿e before dinner; nor did he at all decline hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two young perÅ¿ons, nearly related to the lady, preÅ¿ent during the conference.</p>

The major opened it, with a view of Å¿uch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the chriÅ¿tian religion as he had digeÅ¿ted in his own mind, to prove that the apoÅ¿tles were not miÅ¿taken themÅ¿elves, and that they could not have intended to impoÅ¿e upon us, in the accounts they give of the grand facts they atteÅ¿t; with the truth of which facts, that of the chriÅ¿tian

religion is moÅ¿t apparently connected. And it was a great encouragement to him, to find, that unaccuÅ¿tomed as he was to diÅ¿courÅ¿es of this nature, he had an unuÅ¿ual command, both of thought, and expreÅ¿Å¿ion; Å¿o that he recollected, and uttered every thing, as he could have wiÅ¿hed. The lady heard with attention; and though he pauÅ¿ed between every branch of the argument, Å¿he did not interrupt the courÅ¿e of it, till he told her, he had finiÅ¿hed his deÅ¿ign, and waited for her reply. She then produced Å¿ome of her objections, which he took up and canvaÅ¿Å¿ed in Å¿uch a manner, that at length Å¿he burÅ¿t out into tears, allowed the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and replies, and appeared, for Å¿ome time after, Å¿o deeply impreÅ¿Å¿ed with the converÅ¿ation, that it was obÅ¿erved by Å¿everal of her friends: and there is reaÅ¿on to believe, that the impreÅ¿Å¿ion continued at leaÅ¿t Å¿o far as to prevent her from ever appearing under the character of an unbeliever or a Å¿ceptic.</p>

And at length, (if I remember right, about the end of October, 1719,) he found all the burthen of his mind taken off at once, by the powerful impreÅ¿Å¿ion of that memorable Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon his mind; Rom iii 25, 26. <q>Whom God hath Å¿et forth for a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s in the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins,âthat he might be juÅ¿t, and the juÅ¿tifier of him that believeth in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us.</q> He had uÅ¿ed to imagine, that the juÅ¿tice of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the damnation of Å¿o enormous a Å¿inner, as he Å¿aw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to be. But now he was made deeply Å¿enÅ¿ible, that the divine juÅ¿tice might be, not only vindicated, but glorified, in Å¿aving him by the blood of JeÅ¿us, even that blood which "cleanÅ¿eth us from all Å¿in." Then did he Å¿ee, and feel, the riches of redeeming love and grace, in Å¿uch a manner, as not only engaged him, with the utmoÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to venture his Å¿oul upon it; but even Å¿wallowed up, (as it were) his whole heart in the returns of love, which from that bleÅ¿Å¿ed time became the genuine and delightful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his obedience, and animated him with an enlarged heart, to run the way of God's commandments. Thus God was pleaÅ¿ed, (as he himÅ¿elf uÅ¿ed to Å¿peak,) in an hour to turn his captivity.

His Å¿oul was Å¿o continually filled with a Å¿enÅ¿e of the love of God in ChriÅ¿t, that it knew little interruption, but when neceÅ¿Å¿ary converÅ¿e, and the duties of his Å¿tation, called off his thoughts for a little time: And when they did Å¿o, as Å¿oon as he was alone, the torrent returned into its natural channel again; Å¿o that from the minute of his awakening in the morning, his heart was riÅ¿ing to God, and triumphing in him; and theÅ¿e thoughts attended him through all the Å¿cenes of life, till he lay down on his bed again, and a Å¿hort parentheÅ¿is of Å¿leep (for it was but a very Å¿hort one that he allowed himÅ¿elf,) invigorated his animal powers, for renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with greater intenÅ¿eneÅ¿s and Å¿enÅ¿ibility.</p>

You may therefore command me in any of theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, and I Å¿hall take a pleaÅ¿ure in Å¿erving you. One piece of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I Å¿hall venture to give you, though your own good Å¿enÅ¿e will make my enlarging upon it leÅ¿s needful; I mean that you would, from your firÅ¿t Å¿etting<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> out carefully diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿h between the eÅ¿Å¿entials of real religion, and thoÅ¿e things which are commonly reckoned by its profeÅ¿Å¿ors to belong Å¿o it.

I think it very evident from the contents of this letter, that the major had not imparted to his mother the moÅ¿t Å¿ingular circumÅ¿tances attending his converÅ¿ion: And indeed there was Å¿omething Å¿o peculiar in them, that I do not wonder, he was always cautious in Å¿peaking of them,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028578_0021_0FD973056B9EDAD8"/>
and eÅ¿pecially, that he was at firÅ¿t much on the reÅ¿erve. We may alÅ¿o naturally reflect, that there Å¿eems to have been Å¿omething very providential in this letter, conÅ¿idering the debate in which our illuÅ¿trious convert was Å¿o Å¿oon engaged. For it was written but about three weeks, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the lady above mentioned in the defence of chriÅ¿tianity; or at leaÅ¿t, before the appointment of it. And as Å¿ome of the books recommended by Dr. Calamy, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Abadie and Du PleÅ¿Å¿is were undoubtedly within his reach, (if our EngliÅ¿h advocates were not) this might, by the divine bleÅ¿Å¿ing contribute conÅ¿iderably towards arming him for that combat, in which he came off with Å¿uch happy Å¿ucceÅ¿s. And as in this inÅ¿tance, Å¿o in many others, they who will obÅ¿erve the coincidence and concurrence of things, may be engaged to adore the wiÅ¿e conduct of providence in events, which, when taken Å¿ingly and by themÅ¿elves, have nothing very remarkable in them.</p>

I think it was about this time, that this reÅ¿olute and examplary chriÅ¿tian entered upon that methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, which be purÅ¿ued through Å¿o many Å¿ucceeding years of life, and I believe, generally, Å¿o far as the broken Å¿tate of his health would allow it in his latter days, to the very end of it. He uÅ¿ed conÅ¿tantly to riÅ¿e at four in the morning, and to Å¿pend his time till Å¿ix in the Å¿ecret exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿es of devotion, reading, meditation, and prayer; in which laÅ¿t he contracted Å¿uch a fervency of Å¿pirit, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve few men living ever obtained. This certainly tended very much to Å¿trengthen that firm faith in God, and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end animating Å¿enÅ¿e of his preÅ¿ence, for which he was Å¿o eminently remarkable, and which carried him through the trials and Å¿ervices of life, with Å¿uch Å¿teadineÅ¿s, and with Å¿uch activity; for he indeed endured, and acted, as always Å¿eeing him who is inviÅ¿ible. If at any time he was obliged to go out before Å¿ix in the morning, he roÅ¿e proportionably Å¿ooner; Å¿o that when a journey, or a march, has required him to be on horÅ¿e back by four, he would be at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at fartheÅ¿t by two. He likewiÅ¿e Å¿ecured time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in an evening; and that he might have it the more at command, and be the more fit to uÅ¿e it properly as well as the better able to riÅ¿e early the next morning, he gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally went to bed about ten: And, during the time I was

In conÅ¿equence of this, as well as of his admirably good conÅ¿titution, and the long habit he had formed, he required leÅ¿s Å¿leep than moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons I have known: And I doubt not, but his uncommon progreÅ¿s in piety was in a great meaÅ¿ure owing to theÅ¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olute habits of Å¿elf-denial.</p>

It was howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on his firÅ¿t return, to make any conÅ¿iderable abode in England, after this remarkable change.

the major made very little anÅ¿wer. But when the cloth was taken away, and the Å¿ervants retired, he begged their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for a few minutes, and then plainly and Å¿eriouÅ¿ly told them, what notions he entertained of virtue and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and on what conÅ¿iderations he had abÅ¿olutely determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by the grace of God he would make it the care and buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of life, whatever he might loÅ¿e by it, and whatever cenÅ¿ure and contempt he might incur. He well knew how improper it was in Å¿uch company, to relate the extraordinary manner in which he was awakened; which they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have interpreted as a demonÅ¿tration of lunacy, againÅ¿t all the gravity and Å¿olidity of his diÅ¿courÅ¿e: But he content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himÅ¿elf with Å¿uch a rational defence of a righteous, Å¿ober, and godly life, as he knew none of them could with any Å¿hadow of reaÅ¿on conteÅ¿t. He then challenged them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e any thing they could urge, to prove that a life of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and debauchery was preferable to the fear, love, and worÅ¿hip of the eternal God, and a conduct agreeable to the precepts of his goÅ¿pel. And he Å¿ailed not to bear his teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from his own experience, (to one part of which many of them had been witneÅ¿Å¿es) that after having run the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t round of Å¿enÅ¿ual pleaÅ¿ure, with all the advantages the beÅ¿t conÅ¿titution and Å¿pirits could give him, he had never taÅ¿ted any thing that deÅ¿erved to be called happineÅ¿s, till he had made religion his refuge and his delight. He teÅ¿tified calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly, the habitual Å¿erenity and peace that he now felt in his own breaÅ¿t, (for the moÅ¿t elevated delights he did not think fit to plead, leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould be eÅ¿teemed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuÅ¿iaÅ¿m,) and the compoÅ¿ure and pleaÅ¿ure with which he looked forward to objects, which the gayeÅ¿t Å¿inner muÅ¿t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be equally unavoidable and dreadful.</p>

And has he not promiÅ¿ed to be a God to me? A God in all his attributes, a God in all his perÅ¿ons, a God in all his creatures, and providences? And Å¿hall I dare to Å¿ay, What Å¿hall I do? Was he not the infinite cauÅ¿e of all I met with in the creatures? And were not they the finite effects of his infinite love and kindneÅ¿s? I have daily experienced, that the inÅ¿trument was, and is, what God makes it to be; and I know, that this God hath the hearts of all men in his hands, and the earth is the Lord's, and the fulneÅ¿s thereof.

It is however proper to remark, that as his habitual meekneÅ¿s, and command of his paÅ¿Å¿ions, prevented indecent Å¿allies of ungoverned anger towards thoÅ¿e in the loweÅ¿t Å¿tate of Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, (by which Å¿ome in high life do Å¿trangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, and loÅ¿e much of their authority,) Å¿o the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural greatneÅ¿s of his mind made him Å¿olicitous to render their inferior Å¿tations as eaÅ¿y as he could; and Å¿o much the rather, becauÅ¿e he conÅ¿idered all the children of Adam as Å¿tanding upon a level before their great Creator, and had alÅ¿o a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Å¿enÅ¿e of the dignity and worth of every immortal Å¿oul, how meanly Å¿oever it might chance to be lodged, than moÅ¿t perÅ¿ons I have known. This engaged him to give his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants frequent religious exhortations and inÅ¿tructions, as I have been aÅ¿Å¿ured by Å¿everal who were Å¿o happy as to live with him under that character. One of the firÅ¿t letters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he entered on his chriÅ¿tian courÅ¿e, expreÅ¿Å¿es the Å¿ame diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition; in which with great tenderneÅ¿s he recommends a Å¿ervant, who was in a bad Å¿tate of health, to his mother's care, as he was well acquainted with her condeÅ¿cending temper; mentioning at the Å¿ame time the endeavors he had uÅ¿ed, to promote his preparations for a better world, under an apprehenÅ¿ion that he would not continue long in this And we Å¿hall have an affecting inÅ¿tance of the prevalency of the Å¿ame diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, in the cloÅ¿ing Å¿cene of his life, and indeed in the laÅ¿t words he ever Å¿poke, which expreÅ¿Å¿ed his generous Å¿olicitude for the Å¿afety of a faithful Å¿ervant, who was then near him.</p>

I Å¿hall not here enlarge on his bravery in the field, though that was very remarkable, as I have heard from others: I Å¿ay, from others, for I never heard any thing of that kind from himÅ¿elf, nor knew, till after his death, that he was preÅ¿ent at almoÅ¿t every battle that was fought in Flanders, while the illuÅ¿trious Duke of Marlborough commanded the allied army there<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> I have alÅ¿o been aÅ¿Å¿ured from Å¿everal very credible perÅ¿ons, Å¿ome of whom were eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es, that at the Å¿kirmiÅ¿h with the rebels at PreÅ¿ton in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hire, (thirty years before that engagement at the other PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which deprived us of this gallant guardian of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,) he Å¿ignalized himÅ¿elf very particulaly: For he headed a little body of men, I think about twelve, and Å¿et fire to the barricado of the rebels in the face of their whole army, while they were pouring in their Å¿hot, by which eight of the twelve that attended him fell. This was the laÅ¿t action of the kind in which he was engaged, before the long peace which enÅ¿ued: And who can expreÅ¿s, how happy it was for him, and indeed for his country, of which he was ever Å¿o generous, and in his latter years Å¿o important a friend, that he did not fall then; when the profaneneÅ¿s which min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled itÅ¿elf with his martial rage, Å¿eemed to rend the heavens, and Å¿hocked Å¿ome other military gentlemen, who were not themÅ¿elves remarkable for their caution in this reÅ¿pect.</p>

But I inÅ¿iÅ¿t not on things of this nature, which the true greatneÅ¿s of his Å¿oul would hardly over permit him to mention, unleÅ¿s, when it tended to illuÅ¿trate the divine care over him in theÅ¿e extremities of danger, and the grace of God in calling him from Å¿o abandoned a Å¿tate. It is well known, that the character of an officer is not only to be approved in the day of combat. Colonel Gardiner was truly Å¿enÅ¿ible that every day brought its duties along with it; and he was conÅ¿tantly careful, that no pretence of amuÅ¿ement, friendÅ¿hip, or even devotion itÅ¿elf, might prevent their being diÅ¿charged in their Å¿eaÅ¿on.</p>

and fidelity, in all that related to the care of the troops over which he was Å¿et; whether with regard to the men, or the horÅ¿es. He knew, that it is incumbent on thoÅ¿e who have the honour of preÅ¿iding over others, whether in civil, eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical, or military offices, not to content themÅ¿elves with doing only Å¿o much as may preÅ¿erve them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The duties of the cloÅ¿et, and of the Å¿anctuary, were Å¿o adjuÅ¿ted, as not to interfere with thoÅ¿e of the parade, or any other place where the welfare of the regiment called him. On the other hand, he was Å¿oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, not to Å¿uffer theÅ¿e things to interfere with religion; a due attendance to which he apprehended to be the Å¿ureÅ¿t method of attaining all deÅ¿irable Å¿ucceÅ¿s in every other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t and concern in life. He therefore abhorred every thing, that Å¿hould look like a contrivance to keep his Å¿oldiers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about their horÅ¿es and their arms at the Å¿eaÅ¿ons of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worÅ¿hip; (an indecency, which I wiÅ¿h there was no room to mention:) Far from that, he uÅ¿ed to have them drawn up juÅ¿t before it began, and from the parade they went off to the houÅ¿e of God. He underÅ¿tood the rights of conÅ¿cience too well, to impoÅ¿e his own particular profeÅ¿Å¿ion in religion on others, or to uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e who differed from him in the choice of its modes, the leÅ¿s kindly or reÅ¿pectfully on that account. But as moÅ¿t of his own company, and many of the reÅ¿t choÅ¿e (when in England) to attend him to the diÅ¿Å¿enting chapel, he uÅ¿ed to march them thither in due time, Å¿o as to be there before worÅ¿hip began.

That his remarkable care to maintain good diÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline among them (of which we Å¿hall afterwards Å¿peak,) might be the more effectual, he made himÅ¿elf on all proper occaÅ¿ions acceÅ¿Å¿ible to them and expreÅ¿Å¿ed a great concern for their intereÅ¿t; which being Å¿o genuine and Å¿incere, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diÅ¿covered itÅ¿elf in a variety of inÅ¿tances.

laÅ¿t illneÅ¿s, at Harborough, and I found the man upon the borders of eternity; a circumÅ¿tance, which, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it himÅ¿elf, muÅ¿t add Å¿ome peculiar weight and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to his diÅ¿courÅ¿e. And he then told me, in his colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's abÅ¿ence, that he queÅ¿tioned not, but he Å¿hould have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaÅ¿ting reaÅ¿on to bleÅ¿s God on Colonel Gardiner's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for he had own a father to him in all his intereÅ¿ts, both temporal and Å¿piritual. He added, that he had viÅ¿ited him almoÅ¿t every day during his illneÅ¿s, with religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and inÅ¿truction, as well as taken care that he Å¿hould want nothing, that might conduce to the recovery of his health. And he did not Å¿peak of this, as the reÅ¿ult of any particular attachment to him, but as the manner in which he was accuÅ¿tomed to treat thoÅ¿e under his command. It is no wonder, that this engaged their affection to a very great degree. And I doubt not, that if he had fought the fatal battle of PreÅ¿ton-Pans at the head of that gallant regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he had the care for Å¿o many years, and which is allowed by moÅ¿t unexceptionable judges to be one of the fineÅ¿t in the BritiÅ¿h Å¿ervice, and conÅ¿equently in the world, he had been Å¿upported in a much different manner; and had found a much greater number, who would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in an opportunity of making their own breaÅ¿ts a barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the defence of his.</p>

It could not but greatly endear him to his Å¿oldiers, that Å¿o far as preferments lay in his power, or were under his influence, they were diÅ¿tributed according to merit; which he knew to be as much the dictate of prudence, as of equity. I find by one of his letters before me, dated a few months before his happy change, that he was Å¿olicited to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his intereÅ¿t with the Earl of Stair, in favour of one whom he judged a very worthy perÅ¿on; and that he had been Å¿uggeÅ¿ted by another who recommended him, that if he Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded he might expect Å¿ome handÅ¿ome acknowledgment. But he anÅ¿wers with Å¿ome degree of indignation; <q>Do you imagine, I am bribed to do juÅ¿tice?</q> For Å¿uch it Å¿eems he eÅ¿teemed it, to confer the favour which was aÅ¿ked from him, on one Å¿o deÅ¿erving.

                  <p n="90">Â§ 90. In the midÅ¿t of all the gentleneÅ¿s which Colonel Gardiner exerciÅ¿ed towards his Å¿oldiers, he made it very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that he knew how to reconcile the tenderneÅ¿s of a real faithful, and condeÅ¿cending friend, with the authority of a commander. Perhaps hardly any thing conduced more generally to the maintaining of this authority, than the Å¿trict decorum and good manners, with which he treated even the private gentlemen of his regiment; which has always a great efficacy towards keeping inferiors at a proper diÅ¿tance, and forbids, in the leaÅ¿t offenÅ¿ive manner, familiarities, which degrade the Å¿uperior, and enervate his influence. The calmneÅ¿s and Å¿teadineÅ¿s of his behaviour on all occaÅ¿ions, did alÅ¿o greatly tend to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e. He knew, how mean a man looks in the tranÅ¿ports of paÅ¿Å¿ion, and would not uÅ¿e Å¿o much freedom with any of his men, as to fall into Å¿uch tranÅ¿ports before them; well knowing, that perÅ¿ons in the loweÅ¿t rank of life are aware, how unfit they are to govern others, who cannot govern themÅ¿elves. He was alÅ¿o Å¿enÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how neceÅ¿Å¿ary it is in all who preÅ¿ide over others, and eÅ¿pecially in military officers, to check irregularities, when they firÅ¿t begin to appear: And that he might be able to do it, he kept a Å¿trict inÅ¿pection over his Å¿oldiers; in which view it was obÅ¿erved, that as he generally choÅ¿e to reÅ¿ide among them as much as he could, (though in circumÅ¿tances which Å¿ometimes occaÅ¿ioned him to deny himÅ¿elf in Å¿ome intereÅ¿ts which were very dear to him,) Å¿o when they were around him, he Å¿eldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has often been obÅ¿erved, that the regiment of which he was Å¿o many years lieutenant colonel, was one of the moÅ¿t regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and orderly regiments in the public Å¿ervice; Å¿o that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps none of our dragoons were more welcome than they, to the towns where their character was known.

It might be a pleaÅ¿ure to me, to make Å¿everal extracts from many others of his letters: But it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure which I ought to Å¿uppreÅ¿s and rather to reflect with unfeigned humility, how unworthy I was of Å¿uch regards from Å¿uch a perÅ¿on, and of that divine goodneÅ¿s which gave me Å¿uch a friend in him. I Å¿hall therefore only add two general remarks, which offer themÅ¿elves from Å¿everal of his letters. The one is, that there is in Å¿ome of them, as our freedom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿ed an agreeable vein of humour and pleaÅ¿antry; which Å¿hews, how eaÅ¿y religion Å¿at upon him, and how far he was from placing any part of it in a gloomy melancholy, or Å¿tiff formality. The other is, that he frequently refers to domeÅ¿tic circumÅ¿tances, Å¿uch as the illneÅ¿s or recovery of my children, &amp;c. which I am Å¿urprized how a man of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenÅ¿ive and important buÅ¿ineÅ¿s could Å¿o diÅ¿tinctly bear upon his mind. But his memory was good, and his heart was yet better; and his friendÅ¿hip was Å¿uch, that nothing which Å¿enÅ¿ibly affected the heart of one whom he honoured with it, left his own but Å¿lightly touched. I have all imaginable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on to believe, that in many inÅ¿tances his prayers were not only offered for us in general terms, but varied as our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Å¿ituation required. Many quotations might verify this; but I decline troubling the reader with an enumeration of paÅ¿Å¿ages, in which it was only the abundance of friendly Å¿ympathy, that gave this truly great, as well as good man, Å¿o cordial a concern.</p>

and charity made him eager and Å¿trenuous in oppoÅ¿ing, what he judged to be errors of Å¿o pernicious a nature. Yet I muÅ¿t declare, that according to what I have known of him, (and I believe he opened his heart on theÅ¿e topics to me, with as much freedom as to any man living,) he was not ready upon light Å¿uÅ¿picions to charge tenets which he thought Å¿o pernicious on any, eÅ¿pecially where he Å¿aw the appearances of a good temper and life, which he always reverenced and loved in perÅ¿ons of all Å¿entiments and profeÅ¿Å¿ions. He Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned cauÅ¿eleÅ¿s jealouÅ¿ies, and evil Å¿urmiÅ¿ings of every kind; and extended that charity in this reÅ¿pect, both to clergy, and laity, which good biÅ¿hop Burnet was Å¿o ready, according to his own account, to limit to the latter, <q>of believing every man good till he knew him to be bad, and his notions right till he knew them wrong.</q> He could not but be very Å¿enÅ¿ible of the unhappy conÅ¿equences, which may follow on attacking the characters of men, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoÅ¿e who are miniÅ¿ters of the goÅ¿pel: And if through a mixture of human frailty, from which the beÅ¿t of men in the beÅ¿t of their meanings and intentions are not entirely free, he has ever, in the warmth of his heart, dropped a word which might be injurious to any other on that account, (which I believe very Å¿eldom happened,) he would gladly retract it on better information; which was perfectly agreeable to that honeÅ¿t and generous frankneÅ¿s of temper, in which I never knew any man who exceeded him.</p>

of this, he honoured Å¿everal of his friends with commiÅ¿Å¿ions for the relief of the poor; and particularly, with relation to Å¿ome under my paÅ¿toral care, he referred it to my diÅ¿cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Å¿upply them with what I Å¿hould judge expedient, and frequently preÅ¿Å¿ed me in his letters to be Å¿ure not to let them want. And where perÅ¿ons Å¿tanding in need of his charity happened, as they often did to be perÅ¿ons of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably religious diÅ¿poÅ¿itions, it was eaÅ¿y to perceive, that he not only loved, but honoured them; and really eÅ¿teemed it an honour which providence conferred upon him, that he Å¿hould be made, as it were, the almoner of God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Å¿uch.</p>

There was in a village, about three miles from Northampton, and in a family which of all others near me was afterwards moÅ¿t indebted to him, (though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then Å¿een any member of it,) an aged and poor, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently good woman, who had with great difficulty, in the exerciÅ¿e of much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length, when worn out with age and infirmities, Å¿he lay upon her dying bed, Å¿he did in a moÅ¿t lively and affecting manner expreÅ¿s her hope and joy in the views of approaching glory. Yet amidÅ¿t all the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Å¿uch a proÅ¿pect, there was one remaining care and diÅ¿treÅ¿s which lay heavy on her mind; which was, that her journey and her Å¿tock of proviÅ¿ions were both ended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Å¿he feared, that Å¿he muÅ¿t either be buried at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h expence, or leave her moÅ¿t dutiful and affectionate daughters the houÅ¿e Å¿tripped of Å¿ome of the few moveables which remained in it, to perform the laÅ¿t office of duty to her, which Å¿he had reaÅ¿on to believe they would do.

She eÅ¿teemed it a Å¿ingular favor of Providence, Å¿ent to her in her laÅ¿t moments as a token for good, and greeted it as a Å¿pecial mark of that loving-kindneÅ¿s of God which Å¿hould attend her for ever.

The Colonel's laÅ¿t reÅ¿idence at Northampton was in June and July, 1742, when Lord Cadogan's regiment of dragoons was quartered here: And I cannot but obÅ¿erve that wherever that regiment came, it was remarkable not only for the fine appearance it made, and for the exactneÅ¿s with which it performed its various exerciÅ¿es (of which it had about this time the honor to receive the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious teÅ¿timonials;) but alÅ¿o for the great Å¿obriety and regularity of the Å¿oldiers. Many of the officers copied after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern, which they had daily before their eyes; and a conÅ¿iderable number of the private men Å¿eemed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, not only of Å¿trict virtue, but of Å¿erious piety. And I doubt not, but they found their abundant account in it; not only in the Å¿erenity and happineÅ¿s of their own minds which is beyond compariÅ¿on the moÅ¿t important conÅ¿ideration; but alÅ¿o in Å¿ome degree, in the obliging and reÅ¿pectful treatment which they generally met with in their quarters. And I mention this, becauÅ¿e I am perÅ¿uaded that if gentlemen of their profeÅ¿Å¿ion knew, and would reflect, how much more comfortable they make their own quarters by a Å¿ober order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obliging conduct, they would be regular out of more Å¿elf-love; if they were not influenced, as I heartily wiÅ¿h they may always be, by a nobler principle.</p>

I have now before me a letter dated from thence, October 16, 1742, in which he writes: <q>As for me, I am indeed in a dry and barren land, where no water is, Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauÅ¿e nothing is to be heard in our Sodom, but blaÅ¿pheming the name of my God; and I am not honoured as the inÅ¿trument of doing any great Å¿ervice.

him a regiment of dragoons, which was then quartered juÅ¿t in his own neighbourhood.

And it alÅ¿o deÅ¿erves obÅ¿ervation, that Å¿ome few days after the Colonel was thus unexpectedly promoted to the command of theÅ¿e dragoons, Brigadier Cornwallis's regiment of foot, then in Flanders, became vacant: now had this happened before his promotion to General Bland's, Colonel Gardiner in all probability would only have had that regiment of foot, and Å¿o have continued in Flanders.

Accordingly he paÅ¿Å¿ed through London, about the middle of June, 1743, where he had the honor of waiting on their royal highneÅ¿Å¿es the Prince and PrinceÅ¿s of Wales, and of receiving from both the moÅ¿t o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging tokens of favor and eÅ¿teem. He arrived at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton on Monday the 20th of June, and Å¿pent part of three days here. But the great pleaÅ¿ure which his return and preferment gave us, was much obated, by obÅ¿erving his countenance Å¿o Å¿adly altered, and many marks of languor, and remaining diÅ¿order, which evidently appeared; Å¿o that he really looked ten years older than he had done ten months before. I had however a Å¿atisfaction, Å¿ufficient to counter-balance much of the concern which this alteration gave me, in a renewed opportunity of obÅ¿erving, indeed more Å¿enÅ¿ibly than ever, in how remarkable a degree he was dead to the enjoyments and views of this mortal life.

The evening before our laÅ¿t Å¿eparation, as I knew I could not entertain the invaluable friend who was then my gueÅ¿t more agreeably, I preached a Å¿ermon in my own houÅ¿e, with Å¿ome peculiar reference to his caÅ¿e and circumÅ¿tances, from thoÅ¿e ever memorable words, than which I have never felt any more powerful and more comfortable: PÅ¿al. xci. 14, 15, 16. "BecauÅ¿e he hath Å¿et his love upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I deliver him; I will Å¿et him on high, becauÅ¿e he hath known my name: He Å¿hall call upon me, and I will anÅ¿wer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him: With long life (or length of days) will I Å¿atisfy him, and Å¿hew him my Å¿alvation." This Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not but lead our meditations to Å¿urvey the character of the good man, as one who Å¿o knows the name of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed God, (has Å¿uch a deep apprehenÅ¿ion of the glories and perfections of his nature,) as determinately to Å¿et his love upon him, to make him the Å¿upreme object of his moÅ¿t ardent and conÅ¿tant affection. And it Å¿uggeÅ¿ted the moÅ¿t Å¿ublime and animating hopes to perÅ¿ons of Å¿uch a character; that their prayers Å¿hall be always acceptable to God; that though they may, and muÅ¿t be called out to their Å¿hare in the troubles and calamities of life, yet they may aÅ¿Å¿ure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves of the divine preÅ¿ence in all; which Å¿hall iÅ¿Å¿ue in their deliverance, in their exaltation, Å¿ometimes, to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed honour and eÅ¿teem among men, and, it may be in a long courÅ¿e of uÅ¿eful and happy years on earth; at leaÅ¿t, which Å¿hall undoubtedly end in Å¿eeing, to their perpetual delight, the complete Å¿alvation of God, in a world where they Å¿hall enjoy length of days for ever and ever, and employ them all in adoring the great author of their Å¿alvation and felicity. It is evident, that theÅ¿e natural thoughts on Å¿uch a Å¿cripture were matters of univerÅ¿al concern. Yet had I known, that this was the laÅ¿t time I Å¿hould ever addreÅ¿s Colonel Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a miniÅ¿ter of the goÅ¿pel, and had I foreÅ¿een the Å¿cenes through which God was about to lead him, I hardly know what conÅ¿iderations I could have Å¿uggeÅ¿ted with more peculiar propriety.

An incident occurs to my mind, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that evening, which at leaÅ¿t for the oddneÅ¿s of it may deÅ¿erve a place in theÅ¿e memoirs. I had then with me one Thomas Porter, a poor, but very honeÅ¿t and religious man, (now living at Hatfield-Broadoak in EÅ¿Å¿ex,) who is quite unacquainted with letters, Å¿o as not to be able to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h one from another; yet is maÅ¿ter of the contents of the bible in Å¿o extraordinary a degree, that he has not only fixed an immenÅ¿e number of texts in his memory, but merely by hearing them quoted in Å¿ermons has regiÅ¿tered there the chapter and verÅ¿e, in which theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages are to be found: This is attended with a marvellous facility in directing thoÅ¿e that can read, to turn to them, and a moÅ¿t unaccountable talent of fixing on Å¿uch, as Å¿uit almoÅ¿t every imaginable variety of circumÅ¿tances in common life There are two conÅ¿iderations in his caÅ¿e, which make it the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: The one, that he is a perÅ¿on of a very low genius, having, beÅ¿ides a Å¿tammering which makes his Å¿peech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t unintelligible to Å¿trangers, Å¿o wild and aukward a manner of behaviour that he is frequently taken for an idiot, and Å¿eems in many things to be indeed Å¿o: The other, that he grow up to manhood in a very licentious courÅ¿e of living, and an entire ignorance of divine things, Å¿o that all theÅ¿e exact impreÅ¿Å¿ions on his memory have been made in his riper years. I thought it would not be diÅ¿agreeable to the Colonel, to introduce to him this odd phaaenomenon, which many hundreds of people have had a curioÅ¿ity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine:
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028578_0047_0FD97366B33200B8"/>
And among all the Å¿trange things I have Å¿een in him, I never remember any which equalled what paÅ¿Å¿ed on this occaÅ¿ion. On hearing the colonel's profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Å¿ome hints of his religious character, he ran through a vaÅ¿t variety of Å¿criptures, beginning at the Pentateuch and going on to the Revelation, relating either to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance to be fixed on God for the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of military pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I believe, he quoted more than twenty of theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages; and I muÅ¿t freely own, that I know not who could have choÅ¿e them with greater propriety. If my memory do not deceive me, the laÅ¿t of this catalogue was that from which I afterwards preached on the lamented occaÅ¿ion of this great man's fall: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. We were all aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed at Å¿o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a fact; and I queÅ¿tion not, but that many of my readers will think the memory of it worthy of being thus preÅ¿erved.</p>

But to return to my main Å¿ubject: The next day after the Å¿ermon and converÅ¿ation of which I have been Å¿peaking, I took my laÅ¿t leave of my ineÅ¿timable friend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attending him Å¿ome part of his way northward. The firÅ¿t Å¿tage of our journey was to the cottage of that poor, but very religious family, which I had accaÅ¿ion to mention above, as relieved, and indeed in a great meaÅ¿ure Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ted, by his charity. And nothing could be more delightful, than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve the condeÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, with which he converÅ¿ed with theÅ¿e his humble penÅ¿ioners. We there put up our laÅ¿t united pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together, and he afterwards expreÅ¿Å¿ed, in the Å¿trongeÅ¿t terms I ever heard him uÅ¿e on Å¿uch an occaÅ¿ion, the Å¿ingular pleaÅ¿ure with which he had joined in them. Indeed it was no Å¿mall Å¿atisfaction to me, to have an opportunity of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿uch a valuable friend to the divine protection and bleÅ¿Å¿ing, with that particular freedom, and enlargement on what was peculiar in his circumÅ¿tances, which hardly any other Å¿itua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleÅ¿s we had been quite alone, could Å¿o conveniently have admitted. We went from thence to the table of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of diÅ¿tinction in the neighbourhood; whoÅ¿e he had an opportunity of Å¿hewing, in how decent and graceful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

he could unite the ChriÅ¿tian and the gentleman, and give converÅ¿ation an improved and religious turn, without violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the rules of polite behaviour, or Å¿aying or doing any thing which looked at all conÅ¿trained or affected. Here we took our laÅ¿t embrace, committing each other to the care of the God of heaven; and the Colonel purÅ¿ued his journey to the north, where he Å¿pent all the remainder of his days.</p>

The more I reflect upon this appointment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the more I diÅ¿cern of the beauty and wiÅ¿dom of it not only as it led directly to that glorious period of life, with which God had determined to honour him, and in which, I think, it becomes all his friends to rejoice; but alÅ¿o, as the retirement on which he entered could not but have a happy tendency to favour his more immediate and compleat prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Å¿o Å¿peedy a remove. To which we may add, that it muÅ¿t probably have a very powerful influence to promote the intereÅ¿ts of religion (incomparably the greateÅ¿t of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿ts) among the members of his own family; who muÅ¿t Å¿urely edify much by Å¿uch daily leÅ¿Å¿ons as they received from his lips, when they Å¿aw them illuÅ¿trated and enforced by Å¿o admirable an example, and this for two compleat years. It is the more remarkable, as I cannot find from the memoirs of his life in my hands, that he had ever been Å¿o long at home Å¿ince he had a family, or indeed, from his childhood, ever Å¿o long at a time in any one place.</p>

and deÅ¿igned to have Å¿pent part of September at Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. The expectation of this was mutually agreeable; but providence Å¿aw fit to diÅ¿concert the Å¿cheme.

It was in the caÅ¿tle there, that his lady and eldeÅ¿t daughter enjoyed the laÅ¿t happy hours of his company; and I think, it was about eight or ten days before his death, that he parted from them there. A remarkable circumÅ¿tance attended that parting, which hath been touched upon by Å¿urviving friends in more then one of their letters to me. His lady was Å¿o affected when Å¿he took her laÅ¿t leave of him, that Å¿he could not forbear burÅ¿ting out into a flood of tears, with other marks of unuÅ¿ual emotion. And when he aÅ¿ked her the reaÅ¿on, Å¿he urged the apprehenÅ¿ion Å¿he had of loÅ¿ing Å¿uch an invaluable friend, amidÅ¿t the dangers to which he was then called out, as a very Å¿ufficient apology. Upon which Å¿he took particular notice, that whereas he had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally comforted her on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions, by pleading with

That heroic contempt of death which had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diÅ¿covered itÅ¿elf in the midÅ¿t of former dangers, was manifeÅ¿ted now in his diÅ¿courÅ¿e with Å¿everal of his moÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friends. I have reÅ¿erved for this place one genuine expreÅ¿Å¿ion of it many years before, which I thought might be mentioned with Å¿ome advantage here. In July, 1725, he had been Å¿ent to Å¿ome place, not far from Hamilton, to quell a mutiny among Å¿ome of our troops. I know not the particular occaÅ¿ion; but I remember to have heard him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it as Å¿o fierce a one, that he Å¿carce ever apprehended himÅ¿elf in a more hazardous circumÅ¿tance. Yet he quelled it, by his preÅ¿ence alone, and the expoÅ¿tulations he uÅ¿ed; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently putting his life into his hand to do it. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Å¿tory Å¿truck me much; but I do not Å¿o exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember them, as to venture to relate them here. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obÅ¿erve, that in a letter dated July 16, that year, which I have now before me, and which evidently refers to this event, he writes thus: <q>I have been very buÅ¿y, hurried about from place to place; but bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God, all is over without bloodÅ¿hed.

And as theÅ¿e were his Å¿entiments in the vigour of his days, Å¿o neither did declining years and the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a broken conÅ¿titution on the one hand, nor any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires of enjoying the honours and profits of Å¿o high a Å¿tation, or (what was much more to him,) the converÅ¿e of the moÅ¿t affectionate of wives and Å¿o many amiable children and friends on the other, enervate his Å¿pirits in the leaÅ¿t: But as he had in former years often expreÅ¿Å¿ed it, to me and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, as his deÅ¿ire, <q>that if it were the will of God, he might have Å¿ome honourable call to Å¿acrifice his life in defence of religion and the liberties of his country;</q> Å¿o when it appeared to him moÅ¿t probable that he might be called to it immediately, he met the Å¿ummons with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t readineÅ¿s. This appears in part from a letter which he wrote to the reverend Mr. Adams of Falkirk, juÅ¿t as he was on marching from Stirling, which was only eight days before his death: "The rebels," Å¿ays he, are <q>advancing to croÅ¿s the Firth; but I truÅ¿t in the Almighty God, who doth whatÅ¿oever he pleaÅ¿es, in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</q> And the Å¿ame gentleman tells me, that a few days after the date of this, he marched through Falkirk with his regiment; and though he was then in Å¿o languiÅ¿hing a Å¿tate, that he needed his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance as a Å¿ecretary to write for Å¿ome reinforcement, which might put it in his power to make a Å¿tand, (as he was very deÅ¿irous to have done,) he expreÅ¿Å¿ed a moÅ¿t genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and noble contempt of life, when to be expoÅ¿ed in the defence of a worthy cauÅ¿e.</p>

This affected Colonel Gardiner Å¿o much, that on the ThurÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before the fatal action at PreÅ¿ton Pans, he intimated to an officer of conÅ¿iderable rank and note, (from whom I had it by a very Å¿ure channel of conveyance) that he expected the event would be, as in fact it was.

to be in doubt: And on the whole, after the moÅ¿t accurate enquiry I could poÅ¿Å¿ibly make at this diÅ¿tance, I cannot get any convincing evidence of it. Yet I muÅ¿t here obÅ¿erve, that it does not appear impoÅ¿Å¿ible, that Å¿omething of this kind might indeed be uttered by him; as his Å¿ervant teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that he Å¿poke to him after receiving that fatal blow, which would Å¿eem moÅ¿t likely to have taken away the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Å¿peech; and as it is certain, he lived Å¿everal hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he fell. If therefore any thing of this kind did happen, it muÅ¿t have been juÅ¿t about this inÅ¿tant.

For his attendant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, aÅ¿Å¿ures me, that he himÅ¿elf immediately fled to a mill, at the diÅ¿tance of about two miles from the Å¿pot of ground on which the Colonel fell; where he changed his dreÅ¿s, and, diÅ¿guiÅ¿ed like a miller's Å¿ervant, returned with a cart as Å¿oon as poÅ¿Å¿ible; which yet was not till near two hours after the engagement. The hurry of the action was then pretty well over, and he found his much honored maÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only plundered of his watch and other things of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but alÅ¿o Å¿tripped of his upper garments and boots; yet Å¿till breathing: And adds, that though he were not capable of Å¿peech, yet on taking him up he opened his eyes; which makes it Å¿omething queÅ¿tionable, whether he were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inÅ¿enÅ¿ible. In this condition, and in this manner, he conveyed him to the church of Tranent, from whence he was immediately taken into the miniÅ¿ter's houÅ¿e, and laid in bed, where he continued breathing, and frequently groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till about eleven in the forenoon; when he took his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal leave of pain and Å¿orrow, and undoubtedly roÅ¿e to thoÅ¿e diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed glories, which are reÅ¿erved for thoÅ¿e who have been Å¿o eminently and remarkably faithful unto death.</p>

The remoteÅ¿t poÅ¿terity will remember, for whom the honour of Å¿ubduing this unnatural and pernicious rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was reÅ¿erved; and it will endear the perÅ¿on of the illuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious duke of Cumberland, to all but the open, or Å¿ecret abettors of it in the preÅ¿ent age, and conÅ¿ecrate his name to immortal honours among all the friends of religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty who Å¿hall ariÅ¿e after as. And I dare Å¿ay, it will not be imagined, that I at all derogate from his glory, in Å¿ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿ting, that the memory of that valiant and excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on whoÅ¿e memoirs I am now concluding, may in Å¿ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure have contributed to that Å¿ignal and compleat victory, with which God was pleaÅ¿ed to crown the arms of his royal highneÅ¿s: For the force of Å¿uch an example is very animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a painful conÅ¿ciouÅ¿neÅ¿s of having deÅ¿erted Å¿uch a commander in Å¿uch extremity muÅ¿t at lead awaken, where there was any Å¿park of generoÅ¿ity an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire to avenge his death on thoÅ¿e, who had Å¿acrificed his blood, and that of Å¿o many other excellent perÅ¿ons, to the views of their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, rapine, or bigotry.</p>
                  <p n="159">Â§ 159. The reflections I have made in my funeral Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on my honoured friend, and in the dedication of it to his worthy and moÅ¿t afflicted lady, Å¿upercede many things which might otherwiÅ¿e have properly been added here. I conclude therefore, with humbly acknowledging the wiÅ¿dom and goodneÅ¿s of that awful providence, which drew Å¿o thick a gloom around him in the laÅ¿t hours of his life, that the luÅ¿tre of his virtues might dart through it with a more vivid and obÅ¿ervable ray. It is abundant matter of thankfulneÅ¿s, that Å¿o Å¿ignal a monument of grace and ornament of the chriÅ¿tian profeÅ¿Å¿ion, was raiÅ¿ed in our age and country, and Å¿pared for Å¿o many honourable and uÅ¿eful years. Nor can all the tenderneÅ¿s of the moÅ¿t affectionote friendÅ¿hip, while its Å¿orrows bleed afreÅ¿h in the view of Å¿o tragical a Å¿cene, prevent my adoring the gracious appointment of the great Lord of all events, that when the day in which he muÅ¿t have expired without an enemy appeared Å¿o very near, the laÅ¿t ebb of his generous blood Å¿hould be poured out, as a kind of Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred libation, to the liberties of his country, and the honour of his God; that all the other virtues of his character, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed as it were by that precious Å¿tream, might diffuÅ¿e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round a more extenÅ¿ive fragrancy, and be tranÅ¿mitted to the moÅ¿t remote poÅ¿terity with that peculiar charm, which they
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028578_0059_0FD9738850813C28"/>
cannot but derive from their connection with Å¿o gallant a fall: An event, (as that bleÅ¿Å¿ed apoÅ¿tle, of whoÅ¿e Å¿pirit he Å¿o deeply drank, has expreÅ¿Å¿ed it,) according to his earneÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and his hope, that in him ChriÅ¿t might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all things whether by his life, or by his death.</p>

                  <p>IN the midÅ¿t of Å¿o many more important articles, I had really forgot to Å¿ay any thing of the perÅ¿on of Colonel Gardiner, of which nevertheleÅ¿s it may be proper here to add a word or two. It was, as I am informed, in younger life remarkably graceful and amiable: And I can eaÅ¿ily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, from what I knew him to be, when our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance began; though he was then turned of fifty, and had gone through Å¿o many fatigues as well as dangers, which could not but leave Å¿ome traces on his countenance. He was tall, (I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, Å¿omething more than Å¿ix foot,) well proportioned, and Å¿trongly built: His eyes of a dark grey, and not very large; his forehead pretty high; his noÅ¿e of a length and height no way remarkable, but very well Å¿uit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his other features; his cheeks not very prominent, his mouth moderately large, and his chin rather a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining (when I knew him) to be peaked. He had a Å¿trong voice, and lively accent; with an air very intriped, yet attempered with much gentleneÅ¿s: And there was Å¿omething in his manner of addreÅ¿s moÅ¿t perfectly eaÅ¿y and obliging, which was in a great meaÅ¿ure the reÅ¿ult of the great candor and benevolence, of his natural temper; and which, no doubt, was much improved by the deep humility which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace had wrought into his heart; as well as having been accuÅ¿tomed from his early youth, to the company of perÅ¿ons of diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed rank and polite behaviour.</p>
                  <p>The picture of him, was taken from an original done by Van DeeÅ¿t, (a Dutchman brought into Scotland by general Wade) in the year 1727, which was the 40th of his age;

and is Å¿aid to have been very like him then, though far from being an exact reÅ¿emblance of what he was when I had the happineÅ¿s of being acquainted with him. Perhaps he would have appeared to the greateÅ¿t advantage of all, could he have been exactly drawn on horÅ¿eback; as many very good judges, and among the reÅ¿t the celebrated MonÅ¿. Faubert himÅ¿elf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SO animating a Å¿ubject as the death of Å¿uch a man, in Å¿uch circumÅ¿tances, has occaÅ¿ioned a great deal of poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Some of this has already been publiÅ¿hed; eÅ¿pecially one large compoÅ¿ition, Å¿aid to be done by a worthy clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in LincolnÅ¿hire, in which there are many excellent lines and noble Å¿entiments: But I rather chooÅ¿e to refer to the piece itÅ¿elf, than to inÅ¿ert any extracts from it here. It may be more expedient to oblige my reader with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing copy of verÅ¿es, and an elegiack poem, compoÅ¿ed by two of my valuable friends whoÅ¿e names are annexed. I could not preÅ¿ume to attempt any thing of this kind myÅ¿elf; becauÅ¿e I knew, that nothing I was capable of writing could properly expreÅ¿s my Å¿enÅ¿e of his worth, or deÅ¿cribe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿s of my friendÅ¿hip; the Å¿entiments of which will (as I aÅ¿Å¿uredly believe,) mingle themÅ¿elves with the laÅ¿t ideas which paÅ¿s through my mind in this world, and perhaps with Å¿ome of the firÅ¿t which may open upon it in that which is to come.</p>

                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE intimate knowledge I had of Colonel Gardiner's private as well as public character, and of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared friendÅ¿hip which Å¿o long Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ted between him and your ladyÅ¿hip, makes me more Å¿enÅ¿ible than moÅ¿t others can be, both of the inexpreÅ¿Å¿ible loÅ¿s you have Å¿uÅ¿tained, and of the exquiÅ¿ite Å¿enÅ¿e you have of it. I might, in Å¿ome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, argue what you felt from the agony with which my own heart was torn by that ever to be lamented Å¿troke, which deprived the nation, and the church, of Å¿o great an ornament and bleÅ¿Å¿ing: And indeed, madam, I was Å¿o Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible of your calamity, as to be ready in my firÅ¿t thoughts to congratulate you, when I heard the report which at firÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prevailed, that you died under the Å¿hock. Yet cooler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections teaches me, on many accounts, to rejoice that your ladyÅ¿hip has Å¿urvived that deareÅ¿t part of yourÅ¿elf; though after having been Å¿o lovely and pleaÅ¿ant in your lives, it would have been matter of perÅ¿onal rejoicing, in death not to have been divided. The numerous and promiÅ¿ing offspring with which God hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed your marriage, had evidently the higheÅ¿t intereÅ¿t in the continued life of Å¿o pious and affectionate a mother: And I hope, and aÅ¿Å¿uredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there was a more important, and to you a much dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intereÅ¿t concerned, as God may be, and is Å¿ignally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the manner in which you bear this heavieÅ¿t and moÅ¿t terrible Å¿troke of his paternal rod.</p>
                  <p>God had been pleaÅ¿ed, madam, to make you both emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for a variety of graces; and he has proportionably diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿hed you both in the opportunity he has given you of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808"/>
exerciÅ¿ing thoÅ¿e, which Å¿uit the moÅ¿t painful Å¿cenes, that can attend a pious and an honourable life. But when I conÅ¿ider, what it is, to have loÅ¿t Å¿uch a man, at Å¿uch time, and in Å¿uch circumÅ¿tances, I muÅ¿t needs declare, that brave and heroic as the death of the colonel was, your ladyÅ¿hip's part is beyond all compariÅ¿on the hardeÅ¿t. Yet even here has the grace of ChriÅ¿t been Å¿ufficient for you; and I join with your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip in adoring the power and faithfulneÅ¿s of him, who has here Å¿o remarkably Å¿hewn, that he forgets not his promiÅ¿e to all his people of a Å¿trength proportionable to their days; that they may be enabled to glorify him in the hotteÅ¿t fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, into which it is poÅ¿Å¿ible they Å¿hould be caÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>To hear, (as I have heard from Å¿everal perÅ¿ons of diÅ¿tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed character, who have lately had the happineÅ¿s of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near your ladyÅ¿hip,) of that meek reÅ¿ignation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, of that calm patience, of that chriÅ¿tian courage, with which, in Å¿o weak a Å¿tate of health and Å¿pirits, you have Å¿upported under this awful providence, has given me great pleaÅ¿ure but no Å¿urprize. So near a relation to Å¿o brave a man might have taught Å¿ome degree of fortitude, to a Å¿oul leÅ¿s Å¿uÅ¿ceptible of it than your ladyÅ¿hip's, Nor is there any doubt, but that the prayers he has Å¿o long been laying up in Å¿tore for you, eÅ¿pecially Å¿ince the decay of his conÅ¿titution gave him reaÅ¿on to expect a Å¿peedy remove, will aÅ¿Å¿uredly at Å¿uch a Å¿eaÅ¿on come into remembrance before God. And above all, the Å¿ublime principles of the chriÅ¿tian religion, Å¿o deeply imbibed into your own heart as well as his, will not fail to exert their energy on Å¿uch an occaÅ¿ion. TheÅ¿e, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, will teach you to view the hand of a wiÅ¿e, a righteous, and a gracious God in this event; and will Å¿hew you, that a friendÅ¿hip founded on Å¿uch a baÅ¿is, Å¿o very indearing, and Å¿o cloÅ¿ely cemented, as that which has been here for many years a bleÅ¿Å¿ing to you both, can know only a very Å¿hort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and will Å¿oon grow up into a union infinitely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more delightful, which never Å¿hall be liable to any Å¿eparation.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, madam, it may comfort us not a little under the Å¿enÅ¿e of our preÅ¿ent loÅ¿s, to think what religious improvement we may gain by it, if we are not wanting to ourÅ¿elves: And happy Å¿hall we be indeed, if we Å¿o hear the rod, as to receive the inÅ¿tructions it Å¿o naturally Å¿uggeÅ¿ts and in forces. PerÅ¿ons of any Å¿erious reflection will learn from
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808"/>
this awful event, how little we can judge of the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by the viÅ¿ible diÅ¿penÅ¿ations of providence here: They will learn, (and it may be of great importance to conÅ¿ider it, juÅ¿t in Å¿uch a criÅ¿is as this,) that no diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed degree of piety can Å¿ecure the very beÅ¿t of men from the Å¿word of a common enemy: And they will Å¿ee (written, alas, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the moÅ¿t precious blood, that war ever Å¿pilt in our iÅ¿land,) the vanity of the Å¿ureÅ¿t protectors and comforters which mortality can afford, at a time when they are moÅ¿t needed.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e are general inÅ¿tructions, which I hope thouÅ¿ands will receive, on this univerÅ¿ally lamented occaÅ¿ion: But to you, madam, and to me, and to all that were honoured with the moÅ¿t intimate friendÅ¿hip of this chriÅ¿tian hero, his death has a peculiar voice. WhilÅ¿t it leads us back into Å¿o many paÅ¿t Å¿cenes of delight, in the remembrance of which we now pour out our Å¿ouls within us, it calls aloud, amidÅ¿t all this tender diÅ¿treÅ¿s, for a tribute of humble thankfulneÅ¿s to God, that ever we enjoyed Å¿uch a friend, and eÅ¿pecially in Å¿uch an intimacy of mutual affection; and that we had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obÅ¿erving, in Å¿o many inÅ¿tances, the Å¿ecret re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>es of a heart, which God had enriched, adorned, and ennobled with Å¿o much of his own image, and Å¿uch abundant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his grace: It calls for our redoubled diligence and reÅ¿olution, in imitating that bright aÅ¿Å¿emblage of virtues, which Å¿hone Å¿o reÅ¿plendent in our illuÅ¿trious friend: And Å¿urely it muÅ¿t, by a kind of irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible influence mortify our affections to this impoveriÅ¿hed world; and muÅ¿t cauÅ¿e na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to concur with grace, in raiÅ¿ing our hearts upwards to that glorious world, where he dwells triumphant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and waits our arrival with an ardor of pure and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated love, which it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible for death to quench.</p>
                  <p>Next to theÅ¿e views, nothing can give your ladyÅ¿hip greater Å¿atisfaction, than to reflect, how happy you made the amiable conÅ¿ort you have loÅ¿t, in that intimate relation you Å¿o long bore to each other; in which, I well know, that growing years ripened and increaÅ¿ed your mutual eÅ¿teem and friendÅ¿hip. Nor will your generous heart be inÅ¿enÅ¿ible of that pleaÅ¿ure, which may ariÅ¿e from reflecting, that the manner of his death (tho' in itÅ¿elf Å¿o terrible, that we dare not truÅ¿t imagination with the particular review,) was to him, in thoÅ¿e circumÅ¿tances, moÅ¿t glorious to religion, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ornamental, and to his country (great as its loÅ¿s is,) on various accounts beneficial. For very far be it from us to think, that Colonel Gardiner, tho' fallen by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of rebellion and treaÅ¿on, has Å¿ought and died in vain.

                  <p>IT is a glory peculiar to the ChriÅ¿tian religion, that it is capable of yielding joy and triumph to the mind, amidÅ¿t calamities, in which the Å¿trength of nature, and of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ophy that has no higher a Å¿upport, can hardly give it Å¿ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or even patience. ThoÅ¿e boaÅ¿ted aids are but like a candle in Å¿ome tempeÅ¿tuous night, which how artificially Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be fenced in, is often extinguiÅ¿hed amidÅ¿t the Å¿torm, in which it Å¿hould guide and chear the traveller, or the mariner, whom it leaves on a Å¿udden, in darkneÅ¿s, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and fear: while the conÅ¿olation of the goÅ¿pel, like the Å¿un, makes a Å¿ure day even when behind the thickeÅ¿t cloud, and Å¿oon emerges from it with an acceÅ¿Å¿ion of more Å¿enÅ¿ible luÅ¿tre.</p>
                  <p>The obÅ¿ervation is verified in theÅ¿e words, conÅ¿idered in connection with that awful providence, which has this day determined my thoughts to fix upon them, as the Å¿ubject of my diÅ¿courÅ¿e; the fall of that truly great and good man, Col. Gardiner: the endearing tenderneÅ¿s of whoÅ¿e friendÅ¿hip would have rendered his death an unÅ¿peakable calamity to me, had his character been only of the common Å¿tandard; as on the other hand, the exalted excellency of his character makes his death to be lamented by thouÅ¿ands who were not happy in any peculiar intimacy or perÅ¿onal acquaintance with him.</p>
                  <p>While we mourn the brave warrior, the exemplary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian, and the affectionate friend; loÅ¿t to ourÅ¿elves and our country, to the church and the world, at a time when we moÅ¿t needed all the defence of his bravery, all the edification of his example, all the comfort of his converÅ¿e: Å¿truck with the various and aggravated Å¿orrow of Å¿o Å¿udden, and Å¿o ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a blow methinks there is but one voice that can chear us, which is this of the great Captain of our Å¿alvation, Å¿o lately addreÅ¿Å¿ing him, and Å¿till addreÅ¿Å¿ing us, in theÅ¿e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ive and animated words; "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</p>

                     <pb n="142" facs="unknown:028578_0072_0FD963C7992A4A90"/>With regard to the connection of them, it may be Å¿ufficient to obÅ¿erve, that our Lord in all theÅ¿e Å¿even epiÅ¿tles to the AÅ¿iatic churches repreÅ¿ents the ChriÅ¿tian life as a warfare, and the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the future Å¿tate as rewards to be beÅ¿towed on conquerors. "To him that overcometh, will I give" Å¿uch and Å¿uch royal donatives. PurÅ¿uing the Å¿ame allegory, he warns the church of Smyrna of an approaching combat, which Å¿hould be attended with Å¿ome Å¿evere circumÅ¿tances. Some of them were to become captives: "the devil Å¿hall caÅ¿t Å¿ome of you into priÅ¿on:" and though the power of the enemy was to be limited, in its extent as well as its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the tribulation of ten days, it Å¿eems to be implied, that while many were harraÅ¿Å¿ed and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed during that time, Å¿ome of them Å¿hould before the cloÅ¿e of it be called to reÅ¿iÅ¿t unto blood. But their great Leader furniÅ¿hes them with Å¿uitable armour, and proportionable courage, by this gracious aÅ¿Å¿urance, which it is our preÅ¿ent buÅ¿ineÅ¿s farther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</p>
                  <p>In which words you naturally obÅ¿erve a charge,âand a promiÅ¿e by which it is inforcedâI Å¿hall briefly illuÅ¿trate each, and then conclude with Å¿ome reflections upon the whole.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, I am to open the charge here given: "Be thou faithful unto death."</p>
                  <p>Concerning which I would obÅ¿erve, that though it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately addreÅ¿Å¿ed to the church at Smyrna, yet the nature of the thing and numberleÅ¿s paÅ¿Å¿ages of the divine word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to prove, that it is common in its obligation, to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, and indeed to all men.</p>
                  <p>I Å¿hall not be large in explaining the nature of faithfulneÅ¿s in general; concerning which I might Å¿hew you, that the word here rendered faithful has Å¿ometimes a relation to the teÅ¿timony which God has given us, and Å¿ometimes to Å¿ome truÅ¿t that he has repoÅ¿ed in us. In the former Å¿enÅ¿e, it is properly rendered believing, and oppoÅ¿ed to infidelity: "Be not faithleÅ¿s, but believing."<note n="*" place="bottom">John xx. 27.</note> In the latter, it is oppoÅ¿ed to injuÅ¿tice: "He that is faithful in the which is leaÅ¿t, is falthful alÅ¿o in much;" whereas "he that is unjuÅ¿t in the leaÅ¿t, is unjuÅ¿t alÅ¿o in much"<note n="â " place="bottom">Luke xvi 10.</note> And it is in reference to this Å¿enÅ¿e of it, that our Lord repreÅ¿ents himÅ¿elf, as Å¿aying to the man who had improved his talents aright, "Well
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028578_0072_0FD963C7992A4A90"/>
done good and faithful Å¿ervant."<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 23.</note> Our deceaÅ¿ed friend was Å¿o remarkably faithful in both theÅ¿e Å¿enÅ¿es; Å¿o ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and Å¿o zealous to defend "the faith once delivered to the Å¿aints;" and Å¿o active in improving thoÅ¿e various talents, with which, in mercy to many others as well as to himÅ¿elf, God had entruÅ¿ted him; that it was very natural to touch upon theÅ¿e Å¿ignifications of the word, though it has here a more particular view to another virtue, for which he was Å¿o illuÅ¿triouÅ¿ly conÅ¿picuous; I mean, the courageous fidelity of a Å¿oldier in his warfare.</p>
                  <p>In this Å¿enÅ¿e of the word, it is oppoÅ¿ed to treachery or cowardice deÅ¿ertion or diÅ¿obedience to military orders. And thus it is uÅ¿ed elÅ¿ewhere in the Å¿ame book of the Revelation, when Å¿peaking of thoÅ¿e who war under the banner of the Lamb, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, the inÅ¿pired writer tells us, "they are called, and choÅ¿en, and faithful,"<note n="â " place="bottom">Rev. xvii. 14.</note> a Å¿elect body of brave and valiant Å¿oldiers.</p>
                  <p>This hint will alÅ¿o fix the eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t and plaineÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e, in which the perÅ¿ons, to whom the text is addreÅ¿Å¿ed, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be faithful unto death: which, though it does indeed in general imply, a patient continuance in well-doing,<note n="â" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 7.</note> in whatever Å¿cenes of life divine Providence may place us; yet does eÅ¿pecially refer to martial bravery, and expreÅ¿s a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s to face death in its moÅ¿t terrible forms, when our great General Å¿hall lead us on to it. You well know this to be an indiÅ¿penÅ¿able condition of our being acknowledged by him in the day of his final triumph: and of this he warned thoÅ¿e that gathered around him, when he was firÅ¿t raiÅ¿ing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿advantages in outward appearance; expreÅ¿sly and plainly telling them, that they muÅ¿t be content to follow him to martyrdom, to follow him to crucifixion, when they receive the word of command to do it; or that all their profeÅ¿Å¿ion of regard to him would be in vain. "If any man," Å¿ays he, "will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, and take up his croÅ¿s, and follow me:"<note n="Â§" place="bottom">Mark viii. 34.</note> For "he that loveth his own life more than me, is not worthy of me;"<note n="Â¶" place="bottom">Mat. x. 37, 39.</note> he does not deÅ¿erve the honour of bearing my name, and paÅ¿Å¿ing for one of my Å¿oldiers; indeed he cannot on any terms be my diÅ¿ciple.<note n="**" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is in effect the language of our Lord, when
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028578_0073_0FD973C1565740E8"/>
he Å¿ays, "Be thou faithful unto death:" It is as if he had Å¿aid, <q>Remember, all you of Smyrna, or of any other place and country, that call yourÅ¿elves ChriÅ¿tians, throughout all generations, that you were by baptiÅ¿m inliÅ¿ted under my banners: Remember, that you have as it were Å¿ealed and Å¿ubÅ¿cribed your engagement to me, by every Å¿acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have Å¿ince attended;</q> (as indeed it is well known, the word Å¿acrament originally Å¿ignifies a military oath, which Å¿oldiers took as a pledge of fidelity to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:) <q>Remember therefore, that you are ever to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with me, and to march forward under my direction, whatever hardÅ¿hips and fatigues may lie in the way. And remember, that if I lead you on to the moÅ¿t formidable combat, you muÅ¿t cheerfully obey the word of command, and charge boldly, though you Å¿hould immediately die, whether by the Å¿word, or by fire. Should you dare to flee, I am myÅ¿elf your enemy; and the weapons which I bear, would juÅ¿tly be levelled at your own traitorous heads. But if you bravely follow me, I know how to make you am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amends, even though you fall in the action. When no human power and gratitude can reach you, it is my glorious prerogative to engage, that to thoÅ¿e who are thus faithful unto death, I will give a crown of life.</q> We are therefore,</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, To conÅ¿ider the PromiÅ¿e, by which the Charge is enforced: "I will give thee a crown of life."</p>
                  <p>And here I might obÅ¿erve,âa Crown of Life is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward propoÅ¿ed,âand it is to be received from the hand of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Crown of Life is the reward propoÅ¿ed: which we are Å¿ure in this connection implies, both grandeur, and felicity, here, though rarely connected together.</p>
                  <p>There is, no doubt, an alluÅ¿ion in theÅ¿e words, to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and I think very prudent cuÅ¿tom, of animating the bravery of Å¿oldiers by honorary rewards, and particularly by crowns, Å¿ometimes of laurel, and Å¿ometimes, more rarely, of Å¿ilver or gold; which they were permitted to wear on public occaÅ¿ions, and in conÅ¿equence of receiving which they were Å¿ometimes intitled to Å¿ome peculiar immunities But here our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, conÅ¿cious of his own divine power and prerogative, Å¿peaks with a dignity and elevation, which no earthly prince or commander could ever aÅ¿Å¿ume; promiÅ¿ing a crown of life, and that (as was obÅ¿erved before) even to
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028578_0073_0FD973C1565740E8"/>
thoÅ¿e who Å¿hould fall in the battle: A crown of life in the higheÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e; not only one, which Å¿hould ever be freÅ¿h and fair, but which Å¿hould give immortality to the happy brow it adorned; and be for ever worn, not only as the monument of bravery and victory, but as the enÅ¿ign of royalty too: A crown connected with a kingdom, and with what no other kingdom can give, perpetual life to enjoy it; perpetual youth and vigour to reliÅ¿h all its delights. And this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the language of other Å¿criptures, where we read of "the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiÅ¿ed to them that love him;<note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. i. 12.</note> a crown of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, which the Lord the righteous Judge Å¿hall give;<note n="â " place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 8.</note> a crown of glory, which fadeth not away."<note n="Â§" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 4.</note> We may alÅ¿o obÅ¿erve,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is Å¿aid to be given by ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>This Å¿ome pious commentators have explained, as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it is the gift of the Redeemer's free and unmerited grace, and not a retribution due to the merit of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it. And this is an undoubted truth, which it is of the higheÅ¿t importance to acknowledge and conÅ¿ider. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wages of Å¿in, is death; but eternal life is (in oppoÅ¿ition to wages) "the gift of God through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t our Lord."<note n="â" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 23.</note> We Å¿hould humbly own it every day, that there is no proportion between the value of our Å¿ervices, and the crown which we expect to receive: Å¿hould own, that it is mercy that pardons our Å¿ins, and grace that accepts our Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; much more, that crowns them. Grace, grace, Å¿hall (as it were) be engraven upon that crown, in characters large and indelible. Nor will that inÅ¿cription diminiÅ¿h its luÅ¿tre, or impair the pleaÅ¿ure with which we Å¿hall receive it. I could not forbear mentioning this thought, as a truth of the utmoÅ¿t importance, which Å¿tands on the firmeÅ¿t baÅ¿is of very many expreÅ¿s Å¿criptures; a truth, of which perhaps no man living had ever a deeper Å¿enÅ¿e, than our deceaÅ¿ed friend. But I mention it thus obliquely, becauÅ¿e it may be doubted whether we can juÅ¿tly argue it from hence; Å¿ince the word give is Å¿ometimes uÅ¿ed for rendering a retribution juÅ¿tly due, and that in inÅ¿tances where grace and favour have, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Å¿peech, no concern at all.<note n="Â¶" place="bottom">Compare Mat. xx. 8.

                     <pb n="146" facs="unknown:028578_0074_0FD973C38F555AA0"/>But it is certain, that this expreÅ¿Å¿ion, "I will give thee a crown of life," is intended to lead our thoughts to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant circumÅ¿tance; that this crown is to be received from the hand of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf. And the apoÅ¿tle Paul evidently refers to the Å¿ame circumÅ¿tance, in terms which Å¿hew how much he entered into the Å¿pirit of the thought, when he Å¿ays, "The Lord the righteous Judge Å¿hall give it me:"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 8.</note> He himÅ¿elf, the great Judge of the conteÅ¿t, whoÅ¿e eye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that on the whole, when our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿ays, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life," methinks our devout meditations may expatiate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words, in Å¿ome Å¿uch paraphraÅ¿e as this.

chriÅ¿tian hero, Colonel Gardiner; whoÅ¿e character was too well known to many of you, by Å¿ome months reÅ¿idence here, to need your being informed of it from me; and whoÅ¿e hiÅ¿tory was too remarkable, to be confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoÅ¿e few remaining moments, which muÅ¿t be allotted to the finiÅ¿hing of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e. Yet there was Å¿omething Å¿o uncommon in both, that I think it of high importance to the honor of the goÅ¿pel and grace of ChriÅ¿t, that they Å¿hould be delivered down to poÅ¿terity, in a diÅ¿tinct and particular view. And therefore, as the Providence of God, in concurrence with that moÅ¿t intimate and familiar friendÅ¿hip with which this great and good man was pleaÅ¿ed to honor me gives me an opportunity of Å¿peaking of many important things, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially relating to his religious experiences, with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneÅ¿s and certainty than moÅ¿t others might be capable of doing; and as he gave me his full permiÅ¿Å¿ion, in caÅ¿e I Å¿hould have the affliction to Å¿urvive him, to declare freely whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I knew of him, which I might apprehend conducive to the glory of God, and the advancement of religion: I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e publiÅ¿hing, in a diÅ¿tinct tract, Å¿ome remarkable paÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life, illuÅ¿trated by extracts from his own letters, which Å¿peak in the moÅ¿t forcible manner the genuine Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his heart. But as I promiÅ¿e myÅ¿elf conÅ¿iderable aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in this work, from Å¿ome valuable perÅ¿ons in the northern part of our iÅ¿land, and poÅ¿Å¿ibly from Å¿ome of his own papers, to which our preÅ¿ent confuÅ¿ions forbid my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s, I muÅ¿t delay the execution of this deÅ¿ign at leaÅ¿t for a few months; and muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e take heed, that I do not too much anticipate what I may then offer to the public view, by what it might otherwiÅ¿e be very proper to mention now.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore Å¿uffice for the preÅ¿ent to remind you, that Colonel Gardiner was one of the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious inÅ¿tances of the energy, and indeed I muÅ¿t alÅ¿o add of the Å¿overeignty of divine grace, which I have heard or read of in modern hiÅ¿tory. He was, in the moÅ¿t amazing and miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without any divine ordinance, without any religious opportunity, or peculiar advantage, deliverance, or affliction, reclaimed on a Å¿udden, in the vigour of life and health, from the moÅ¿t licencious and abandoned Å¿enÅ¿uality, not only to a Å¿teady courÅ¿e of regularity and virtue, but to high devotion, and Å¿trict though unaffected Å¿anctity of manners: A courÅ¿e, (in which he perÅ¿iÅ¿ted for more than twenty-Å¿ix years, that

is, to the cloÅ¿e of life,) Å¿o remarkably eminent for piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, diffuÅ¿ive humanity and ChriÅ¿tian charity, lively faith, deep humility, Å¿trict temperance, active diligence in improving time, meek reÅ¿ignation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the will of God, Å¿teady patience in enduring afflictions, unaffected contempt of Å¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereÅ¿t and reÅ¿olute and couragious zeal in maintaining truth, as well as in reproving and (where his authority might take place) reÅ¿training vice and wickedneÅ¿s of every kind; that I muÅ¿t deliberately declare, that when I conÅ¿ider all theÅ¿e particulars together, it is hard to Å¿ay where, but in the book of God, he found his example, or where he has left his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. Every one of theÅ¿e articles, with many more, I hope, (if God Å¿pare my life) to have an opportunity of illuÅ¿trating, in Å¿uch a manner as to Å¿hew, that he was a living demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration of the energy and excellency of the ChriÅ¿tian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor can I imagine how I can Å¿erve its intereÅ¿ts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than by recording what I have Å¿een and known upon this head, known to my own edification, as well as my joy.</p>
                  <p>But, Oh, how Å¿hall I lead back your thoughts, and my own, to what we once enjoyed in him, without too deep and tender a Å¿enÅ¿e of what we have loÅ¿t! To have poured out his Å¿oul in blood; to have fallen by the Å¿avage and rebellious hands of his own countrymen, at the wall of his own houÅ¿e; deÅ¿erted by thoÅ¿e, who were under the higheÅ¿t obligations that can be imagined to have defended his life with their own; and above all, to have Å¿een with his dying eyes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our religion and liberties triumphant, and to have heard in his lateÅ¿t moments the horrid noiÅ¿e of their inÅ¿ulting Å¿houts;âis a Å¿cene, in the view of which we are almoÅ¿t tempted to Å¿ay, Where were the Å¿hields of angels? Where the eye of Providence? Where the remembrance of thoÅ¿e numberleÅ¿s prayers, which had been offered to God for the preÅ¿ervation of Å¿uch a man, at Å¿uch a time as this?âBut let faith aÅ¿Å¿ure us, that he was never more dear and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eye of his divine leader, than in theÅ¿e dreadful moments, when if Å¿enÅ¿e were to judge, he might Å¿eem moÅ¿t neglected. That is of all others the happieÅ¿t death, which may moÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿ibly approve our fidelity to God, and our zeal for his glory. To Å¿tand Å¿ingly in the combat with the fierceÅ¿t enemies, in the cauÅ¿e of religion and liberty, when the whole regiment he commanded fled; to throw himÅ¿elf with Å¿o noble an ardor to defend thoÅ¿e on foot, whom the

whole body which he headed were appointed to Å¿upport, when he Å¿aw that the fall of the neareÅ¿t commander expoÅ¿ed thoÅ¿e brave men to the extremity of danger; were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances that evidently Å¿hewed, how much be held honour and duty dearer than life. He could not but be conÅ¿cious of the diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed profeÅ¿Å¿ion he had made, under a religious character; he could not but be Å¿enÅ¿ible, how much our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in circumÅ¿tances like theÅ¿e, needs all that the moÅ¿t ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous examples can do, to animate its officers and its Å¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: And therefore he Å¿eems deliberately to have judged, that although when his men would hear no voice but that of their fears, he might have retreated without infamy, it was better he Å¿hould die in Å¿o glorious a cauÅ¿e, than have it thought that his regard to religion and liberty was but a mere profeÅ¿Å¿ion, that was not Å¿trong enough to make him faithful unto death. He had long felt the force of it; and had too high a value for his king and country, to think of deÅ¿erting the truÅ¿t committed to him; too great a love for the proteÅ¿tant religion, to think of exchanging it for the errors of popery; and rather than give way to a rebellious crew, by whoÅ¿e Å¿ucceÅ¿s an inlet would be opened to the cruel ravages of arbitrary power, and to the bloody and relentleÅ¿s rage of popiÅ¿h Å¿uperÅ¿tition, he loved not his life unto the death<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xii. 11.</note>. And in this view his death was martyrdom, and has, I doubt not, received the applauÅ¿es and rewards of it: For what is martyrdom, but voluntarily to meet death, for the honour of God, and the teÅ¿timony of a good conÅ¿cience? âAnd if it be indeed true, as it is reported on very conÅ¿iderable authority, that before he expired he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with the leader of the oppoÅ¿ite party, and declared in his preÅ¿ence <q>the full aÅ¿Å¿urance he had of an immortal crown, which he was going to receive,</q> it is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How difficult it muÅ¿t be in our preÅ¿ent circumÅ¿tances, to gain certain and exact information, you will eaÅ¿ily perceive: But enough is known, and more than enough, to Å¿hew how juÅ¿tly the high conÅ¿olations of that glorious Å¿ubject which we have been contemplating, may be applied to the preÅ¿ent Å¿olemn occaÅ¿ion.
