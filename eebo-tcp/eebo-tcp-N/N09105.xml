            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE completion of a <hi>century</hi> of years ſince the incorporation of this town deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to bring you a diſcourſe on this opportunity of the ſeveral ſocieties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations being aſſembled together. You will ſuffer me to introduce the memorable occaſion of the enſuing diſcourſe, and my deſign of giving a brief hiſtorical account of the town, with a few reflections on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, extent, duration and morality of divine providence; grounded on the following words of the pſalmiſt,
<q>
                  <bibl>PSALM CXLVI.10.</bibl>
                  <p>THE LORD SHALL REING FOR EVER, EVEN THY GOD, O ZION, UNTO ALL GENERATIONS. PRAISE YE THE LORD.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. FIRST, Of the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence—the admiſſion of which is eſſential to natural religion, as on the ſuppoſition of it all revelation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011622_0004_0F8777439F019388"/>FROM the things that are made we as clearly ſee, as we do that there is a GOD, a ſupream director at the head of the univerſe; ſuſtaining every part of it, every being in it, and <hi>working all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> That GOD is, and that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world, are coincident principles, proveable the ſame way, Conſequently, the antient <hi>Epicurians,</hi> who profeſſed to believe a GOD, while they denied a providence, were, in truth, atheiſts.</p>
            <p>WE ſee, indeed, but few of GOD's works— only <hi>parts of his ways</hi>: We are but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature and deſign, uſe and references, of many, of moſt of thoſe we do ſee: However, we know enough to beget an undoubting faith in the unlimitted dominion of JEHOVAH—that the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNETH—Reigneth in heaven, on earth, in all worlds, celeſtial, terreſtrial and infernal. "The heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of GOD: The firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto day ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge. There is no ſpeech nor lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, where their voice is not heard." The air, earth and ſea proclaim his being and providence. The rank of <hi>ſenſitive</hi> creatures riſes, by an imperceptible gradation, from the loweſt degree to the full perfection of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011622_0005_0F88E15E8103CFB8"/>
animal life. <hi>Here,</hi> we perceive "inactive matter creeping into life:" <hi>There,</hi> ſtronger appearances of life and ſenſe; till we come to thoſe animals whoſe inſtincts approach ſo near rationality as to be ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from it. Not to mention the various kinds of animals—the multitudes of each kind—eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of ſome ſorts.</p>
            <p>In the next rank of beings, the <hi>human ſpecies,</hi> what countleſs numbers of theſe are there, to whom <hi>the inſpiration of the</hi> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY <hi>hath given underſtanding,</hi> in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the common inſtincts and appetites of animal creatures? whom the creator hath formed <hi>in his own image?</hi> How different and various alſo are the capacities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the human kind?</p>
            <p>FURTHER, we are pretty certain, that <hi>we</hi> are far from being the higheſt order of finite creatures, however ſuperior to the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this viſible world. Reaſon and philoſophy fully acquieſce in the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given us in the ſacred oracles, of <hi>angels that excel in ſtrength</hi>—of "thrones and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, principalities and powers, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places"—of a "train which fills GOD's temple" above, ſurrounding the throne of his glory. For althô we are ignorant "what varied beings people other worlds," yet the declarations of ſcripture are credible; where
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011622_0006_0F8777457208DA68"/>
we read, "Thouſand thouſands ſtand before him, ten thouſand times ten thouſand mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto him."—With reſpect to whom the SUPREAM is deſcribed as <hi>ruling in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all the variety and harmony, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and magnificence, viſible in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial creation; all this great family in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; while they evidence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite intelligence, the "eternal power and godhead," of the former and diſpoſer of 'em, witneſs alike the energy and extent of his providence. Shall we aſcribe to <hi>fate</hi> or <hi>chance</hi> the revolutions of the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? the alternate return of "day and night, ſummer and winter," ſpring and autumn; "ſeed-time and harveſt?" material things adapted to the enjoyment of ſenſitive and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures? the various uſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, and bounds within which it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? There is no medium between aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the continuance of the material world as it is to fate or chance, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a ſuperintending providence; thro' which things continue in their original relations and ſubſerviency to each other.— The heavenly luminaries according to his ordinance who firſt bid 'em ſhine—the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the ſeaſons by his appointment, who "has ſet all the borders of the earth,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011622_0007_0F877745E1713FB0"/>
and made ſummer and winter" in virtue of whoſe promiſe "ſeed-time and harveſt, cold and heat, day and night, do not ceaſe"—who "renews the face of the earth," and "cloths the graſs of the field"—The ſea, according to the "decree" he firſt gave it—who, as he gave, continues the inſtincts in the lower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals—"hears the young ravens when they cry"—without whom "a ſparrow does not fall to the ground"—who "preſerveth man and beaſt. The eyes of all wait on him," to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his liberal hand the ſupply of their various and conſtantly returning wants. The ſubjection of the lower animals to mankind, (many of which, did they know their own ſtrength, were they laid under no reſtraint, could eaſily deſtroy us) is one ſignal proof of that providence we are conſidering.</p>
            <p>THAT GOD actuates the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that beings animate, rational and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic are neceſſarily dependent on the power that formed 'em, are indeed truths, which, perhaps, no reaſoning can make plainer than they are on the bare propoſal. The ſettled, uniform courſe of things, no leſs than parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſtriking interpoſitions, demonſtrate the uncontroulable power and providence of him, who "ſiteth on the circle of the earth, and counteth the inhabitants of it as graſs-hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers." Indeed, the deſign of ſpecial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011622_0008_0F87774766A04E40"/>
ſeems to be to rouſe the attention of unthinking mortals to thoſe general evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his being and providence, which they have every day before their eyes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes are ſometimes ſuſpended and over ruled, that the world may ſee they are under the direction and controul of the firſt cauſe; dependent on him for their operations and effects. Sometimes we <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of GOD,</hi> while the moſt probable means are unſucceſsful: Thô, in a more general way, the providence of GOD concurs to favor juſt means and endeavors. GOD is reſtricted to no particular manner of working. And if in every common inſtance we may trace his operation, how much more in thoſe great events, which determine the ſtate of kingdoms? in "enlarging the nations, and ſtraitning them again?" in "ſetting up and puting down kings?" "For GOD is judge," and "ruleth in the kingdoms of men." His power over the nations is reſembled to that of the potter over the clay. They "are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance: Behold, he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the iſles as a very little thing: And Lebanon is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt-offering. All nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011622_0009_0F8777481CC449D0"/>As all power is of GOD, derived from him, and ſubject to him, and "the hearts of all men in his hands," he can "turn them," with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infringing the moral agency of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and make them miniſter to his deſigns, beſide their own intention. Nothing can happen, in any part of the univerſe, among the infinite variety of creatures, without his appointment or permiſſion "Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the victory, and the majeſty: For all that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine: Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all."</p>
            <p n="2">II. IN regard to the <hi>duration,</hi> or <hi>perpetuity</hi> of divine providence, this ſeems to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in the general doctrine already laid down. For in admitting that GOD ſupports and governs all, we ſuppoſe his <hi>continual</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. If he withdraw his ſuſtaining pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one moment, the frame of nature would be out of courſe, and things at once fall into confuſion. "The ſpirit would fail before him, and the ſouls which he hath made." They can as well ſubſiſt altogether without him, and exiſt forever as they are, as be ſelf preſerved a ſingle moment. No <hi>poſitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion</hi> of the Deity is neceſſary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all things. Let the governor of the world <hi>ſuſpend</hi> his influence and ſupport,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011622_0010_0F87774A47985218"/>
and inſtant ruin muſt follow. What we are wont to aſcribe to natural or ſecond cauſes, is more properly the agency of the Deity on material things; and his concurrence with his creatures, at leaſt ſo far as to uphold their powers of exertion. GOD's kingdom has been ſet up ever ſince there have been any beings to govern. "The watchmen of Iſrael neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps." "His king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is an everlaſting kingdom." Thô the heavens, and earth, and elements ſhall at length be diſſolved; yet he <hi>ſhall reign for ever.</hi> And hence "there is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord."</p>
            <p n="3">III. BUT let us, in the next place, make a few reflections on the particular <hi>character</hi> of this extenſive providence we have been taking a general ſurvey of. Though the preſent ſtate is by no means the completion of it, and <hi>our</hi> world but a ſmall part of the dominions of the ALMIGHTY, whence we muſt needs be very incompetent judges of his adminiſtration, and very much in the dark with regard to many things in it; yet that it is of a <hi>moral</hi> kind, we cannot doubt. The operations of our own minds, and what we may obſerve of it in this dark ſtate, fully evidence it to be ſo. From the natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices GOD hath given us of himſelf, we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer, that <hi>the ſceptre of his kingdom is a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011622_0011_0F87774B1E3C0168"/>
righteous ſceptre that he loves righteouſneſs, and hates wickedneſs.</hi> Conſcience witneſſeth this when ever it applauds or reproaches us. Theſe ſentiments are alſo confirm'd from what we ſee in the courſe of providence. <hi>Righteouſneſs evermore exalteth a nation: But ſin is the unfailing reproach of any people.</hi> We moreover obſerve in particular perſons, that "the eyes of the Lord run to and fro thrô the earth, that he may ſhew himſelf ſtrong in behalf of 'em whoſe hearts are perfect with him. His eyes are upon the righteous, and his ears open to their cry. But the face of the Lord is againſt 'em that do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth." While virtue tends to lengthen life, and contributes to the eaſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it—while it procures eſteem and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from men, even from the vicious 'emſelves; it appears, on the other hand, that ſuch as are "wicked over-much die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time"—that "bloody and deceitful men do not live out half their days." Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the puniſhments inflicted on profligate offenders by the hands of <hi>civil juſtice</hi>; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ſhame and miſery are the <hi>natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of many ſorts of wickedneſs. <hi>This</hi> at leaſt, which the prophet declares, holds true of all wicked men, in an higher or lower degree, that they "are like the troubled ſea,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011622_0012_0F87774CA8B13898"/>
when it cannot reſt—There is no peace to the wicked. They travel with pain all their days, and in the midſt of their ſufficiency are in ſtraits." This "wounded ſpirit" is more than all the evils of life. "The good man," on the contrary, "is ſatisfied from himſelf." The conſcious approbation of the Deity, and hope of the celeſtial kingdom, fixeth his heart; ſo that inſtead of fearing any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſufferings, he even "glorieth in tribulation. Having nothing, he poſſeſſeth all things."</p>
            <p>THESE things, which I can only hint at, without mentioning others, ſhew what ſort of providence GOD exerciſeth over the world. They verify the declaration of the prophet, "I am the Lord, which exerciſe <hi>loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, judgment and righteouſneſs</hi> in the earth." Whatever inſtances may ſeem at preſent to militate againſt the ſuppoſition of ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, we may be aſſured will be found to comport here with, when we come into that world where they "ſee not thrô a glaſs darkly." Let us patiently wait the iſſue of things for the manifeſtation of GOD's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. <hi>He is the rock, his work is perfect, and all his ways are judgment: A</hi> GOD <hi>of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY taking a view of our text, we ſhall have a particular illuſtration of the foregoing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011622_0013_0F87774D65E059A0"/>
idea of divine providence. <hi>The Lord ſhall reign for ever, even</hi> THY GOD, O ZION! While GOD is the father of <hi>all mankind,</hi> the profeſſors of the true religion are, in a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd</hi> ſenſe, "his people, and children of the living GOD." The Jews were "a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to him above all people. He ſhewed his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and judgments unto Iſrael, and dealt not ſo with any nation: The Lord hath choſen ZION! He hath deſired it for his habitation. This is my reſt forever." And hence the children of ZION are ſtired up to "be joyful" in him who is in a peculiar ſenſe "THEIR king." To them eſpecially are thoſe words apply'd, THIS GOD IS MY GOD FOR EVER AND EVER.</p>
            <p>BUT is not this a <hi>partial</hi> diſtinction? Does it not prove, contrary to what is above ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that "there is reſpect of perſons with GOD?" To this we reply, that what was heretofore the prerogative of the Jews, is now under the goſpel the privilege of all that call upon the name of the LORD.—That thô the Jews' advantage was, that "to 'em were committed the oracles of GOD, and that to them pertained the promiſes;" yet the original promiſe to the father of that nation expreſſly comprehended <hi>all nations and families of the earth.</hi>—That when the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011622_0014_0F87774E2946B620"/>
ſeed promiſed to Abraham, which was the hope of Iſrael, appeared, and gave direction for the promulgation of his religion, it was in theſe terms: "Go teach ALL NATIONS" —Go into ALL THE WORLD, and preach the goſpel to EVERY CREATURE—That the <hi>higheſt</hi> and moſt <hi>important</hi> ſenſe, in which GOD declares himſelf "the GOD of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob," is a privilege belonging to thoſe only who have <hi>the ſame ſpirit of faith</hi> —are conform'd to the divine moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For "they are not all Iſrael, who are of Iſrael: Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all children." Yea, "many ſhall come from the eaſt, and from the weſt, from the north, and from the ſouth, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the kingdom of GOD: But the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs." The reaſon is plain: "For the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt." He is a <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> GOD and <hi>portion</hi> to thoſe only who have the power as well as form of godlineſs. All to whom the goſpel kingdom is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a witneſs, have the neceſſary means of obtaining this higheſt honor and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ZION's king will be <hi>their</hi> GOD, in the moſt <hi>eminent</hi> ſenſe—their exceeding great and everlaſting reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011622_0015_0F87774EDD413648"/>DOTH it not hence follow, that <hi>happineſs</hi> is the great <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>rule,</hi> of the divine adminiſtration? The proviſion and miſſion of a SAVIOR to the redemption of all mankind, that GOD might be <hi>juſt,</hi> as well as <hi>merciful,</hi> in the juſtification of penitent believers in JESUS—His being anointed <hi>king</hi> in ZION—having the promiſe of "the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion" —the aſſurance we have that his kingdom of truth, peace and righteouſneſs ſhall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevail, call upon us to rejoice in the divine government; and to expreſs our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by our higheſt praiſes for the great things done for us, and for all mankind. "Juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of ſaints! Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy." The ſcriptures inſtruct us, that the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, (who is "<hi>in him</hi> the father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and GOD of all grace") in conſequence of his humiliation and vicarious ſufferings, "hath highly exalted him;" "given him all power in heaven and earth;" and "will judge the world in righteouſneſs by him"— That "he muſt reign, till he hath put down all rule, and all authority and power, and ſubdued all enemies under his feet." In
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011622_0016_0F87774F9DDD9588"/>
the hands of this mighty Savior, having the promiſe of his guardianſhip, the children of ZION need not doubt the ſecurity of the church, and ſafety of all their intereſts—that the kingdom of righteouſneſs and peace will triumph over all oppoſition. Founded on a rock, thô the rain deſcend, and the floods come, and winds blow, they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. For <hi>thy</hi> GOD, O ZION, <hi>ſhall reign for ever, and of his kingdom there is no end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE kingdom of the Redeemer, ſmall in it's beginnings, made a moſt rapid progreſs under the miniſtry of the apoſtles and firſt diſciples, notwithſtanding every poſſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. To the firſt preachers of it (whoſe induſtry and zeal in ſpreading it is wonderful to think of) the apoſtle applies what is ſaid of the heavenly luminaries, "Their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world." And thô many nations have fallen off from chriſtianity, and others have not as yet had it preached to 'em; yet, according to ſcripture prophecy, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the time when "the kingdoms of this world ſhall all become the kingdoms of our LORD, who ſhall reign for ever and ever." How diſtant this period is, belongs not to us to conjecture; "the Father having reſerved the times and ſeaſons in his own power." Thus much is clear from ST. PAUL, that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011622_0017_0F8777505B95AD10"/>
as "the caſting away of the Jews was the riches of the world, the receiving of them will be <hi>life from the dead</hi> to the Gentiles." The Jews are not yet reſtored. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the fulneſs of the Gentiles is an event yet to be looked for. When theſe events ſhall take place, then there will be no difference between the peculiar title of ZION's GOD, and his being the GOD of <hi>all the families of the earth.</hi> For "all people, nations and languages ſhall ſerve and obey him."</p>
            <p>BUT while this univerſal prevalence of true religion is an event we cannot but exult in the proſpect of, and for which we daily pray when we uſe thoſe words, THY KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM COME; it is, at the ſame time, a moſt melancholy reflection, which we are obliged to make, on the amazing corruption of chriſtianity, which hath been permitted. The cauſe the apoſtle aſſigns; "They received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe GOD ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhou'd believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs." You readily perceive I allude to the riſe of "the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called GOD, or that is worſhiped"—and "whoſe coming is after
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011622_0018_0F8777511EC36978"/>
the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders; and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs." This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable prediction is ſo exactly adapted to the ROMISH HIERARCHY, that no intelligent reader can fail to make the application. For near a thouſand years, all chriſtendom was in the groſſeſt ignorance, and moſt abject ſubmiſſion to the grand uſurper of divine prerogatives. During this long period, the few ſervants of Chriſt, who "had not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped the beaſt, nor received his mark in their foreheads," might be tempted to think, that the promiſe of ZION's king, to defend his church, had failed; or at leaſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, "How long, O LORD, holy and true!"</p>
            <p>AT length (thô ſo late as the beginning of the XVIth. century) the ſervants of Chriſt were ſpirited to ſet forward the REFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION; and the glorious work was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſucceeded in their hands. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the reformation, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Among whom MELANCTHON makes the firſt figure, for his <hi>excellent ſpirit.</hi>
               </note> thoſe lights of the church and world, will be had in eſteem as long as Chriſt hath a church on earth. The kingdom of Anti-Chriſt has been gradually weakening ever ſince this memorable period. The PONTIFF is now compelled to take up with an empty title, without the civil power the popes poſſeſſed for many hundred years.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011622_0019_0F877751DD284B60"/>
The diſſolution of the order of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in one place and another, gives us the proſpect, that the empire of the beaſt may be haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it's end; as this order of men is the great, if not only, ſupport of the authority of the <hi>Pontiff,</hi> and the religion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is to be remembred, at the ſame time, ("thô to the opprobrium of humanity) that, of all the errors of that anti-chriſtian church, from which the" proteſtants "were, with deriſion, expelled, the moſt abominable of all, PERSECUTION FOR OPINIONS, ſtuck the faſteſt, and in it's turn tarniſhed the ſplendor of almoſt every proteſtant communion." It was this ſpirit, predominant in our mother country, that drave our progenitors from thence hither—prefering a deſolate coaſt, an uncultivated deſert, and conſtant wars with the barbarians inhabiting it, to a ſacrifice of the rights of conſcience, a ſubmiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious oppreſſion.

How many flouriſhing churches are there now in this wilderneſs, where Satan's ſeat was! In New-England only (containing but four provinces) near 700 of the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations. About 500 of which are on the <hi>congregational plan,</hi> properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>I might touch at the hardſhips, diſtreſſes and dangers of our anceſtors in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this country, but it wou'd detain me too long from my purpoſe, which I cannot, without abuſing the patience of my hearers, poſtpone.</p>
            <p>THE reaſon, as before hinted, of my bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you a diſcourſe this day, is, that we have compleated 100 years ſince the incorporation of this town by the General Aſſembly of the colony: On which occaſion you will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expect ſome hiſtorical account of it's ſettlement. This I promiſed to give you, when I entred on my preſent diſcourſe, and wou'd now proceed to my propoſed deſign.</p>
            <p>I MUST begin with a few ſketches of the town of <hi>New-Haven</hi> to ſhew the riſe of <hi>this</hi>; as our firſt ſettlers came from thence, and the greater part of our preſent bounds were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally comprehended within <hi>that</hi> town.</p>
            <p>THE Rev. Mr. John Davenport, firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of New-Haven, with between 40 and 50 free planters who came with him, arriv'd at Boſton in 1637, and came to New-Haven
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011622_0021_0F8777535E00CD28"/>
(then <hi>Quinaypiack</hi>) in 1638. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Davenport had been a ſettled conformiſt miniſter for many years in Coleman-Street, London. He died March 16. 1670. Aet. 73.</note> A civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was agreed upon and ſolemnly come into, <note n="‖" place="bottom">New-Haven (including the towns ſettled to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, and Branford and Guilford eaſtward) was for 27 years a diſtinct government. On the appointment of Mr. Winthrop governor of Connecticut by charter from Charles II. A. D. 1662. New-Haven for three years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed coming under the juriſdiction, and continued ſeperate till 1665, when it was united, by mutual conſent, with Connecticut. The New-England planters ſettled what form of government they pleaſed. The authority of the nation never interpoſed in this matter till upwards of forty years after the firſt adventurers planted themſelves at New-Plymouth.</note> and a church formed June 4. 1639. The church was gathered in the following manner: It was propoſed that all the free planters (who probably were chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors before) ſhou'd make choice of 12 leading men, who ſhou'd out of themſelves chuſe 7, to model the church; (grounded, as I am told, on that text, "Wiſdom hath builded her houſe: She hath hewn out her <hi>ſeven</hi> pillars.") and having embody'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhou'd admit the reſt. <note n="§" place="bottom">The 7 were Mr. Theophilus Eaton, Mr. John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport, Mr. Robert Newman, Mr. Matthew Gilbert, Thomas Fugill, John Punderſon, and Jeremiah Dixon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FROM ſome records of diſcipline, &amp;c. it appears, that the church, when form'd, choſe a <hi>paſtor,</hi> with a <hi>ruling elder,</hi> and a <hi>teaching elder,</hi> diſtinct. Mr. Davenport removed to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011622_0022_0F8777541D193FD0"/>
Boſton 1667. And it doth not appear that they had any paſtor till July 2. 1685, when the Rev. Mr. Pierpont was ordained; who died Nov. 14. 1714. He was ſucceeded by the Rev. Joſeph Noyes, who was ordain'd July 4. 1716. and continued ſole paſtor till March 1. 1758; when the Rev. Chauncy Whittelſey (the preſent paſtor of the firſt church) was ordained colleague with Mr. Noyes, who died June 14. 1761.</p>
            <p>MR. William Hook (who in 1644 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been teaching elder in this church) was the firſt in that office, choſen, no doubt, at the formation of the church; thô no account of his ordination can yet be found. He was ſent for by Protector Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and return'd to England about the year 1656. Mr. Nicholas Street was ordain'd teacher, i. e. teaching elder, the 26th of the 9th month, 1659. The practice of a ruling elder and teaching elder, diſtinct from the paſtor, does not appear to have been retain'd after Mr. Pierpont's introduction. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Sundry towns in this colony were ſettled before New Haven.

            <p>THE undertakers covenanted to come and ſettle in the town the ſpring following their incorporation, having begun the ſettlement
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011622_0025_0F87775A23C96080"/>
ſome time before. The firſt town-meeting was held April 6. 1671. How many of the firſt undertakers had families when they came to reſide here, we cannot aſcertain. The number of ſouls, in the ſpring of 1671, did not, probably, exceed 100. I don't find a record of any one born in the town till September 19. 1671 <note n="‖" place="bottom">Samuel, ſon of Samuel Potter.</note>—Or of any death till March 12. 1673 <note n="†" place="bottom">Samuel, ſon of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer Peck.</note>—And June 5th, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of the firſt planters [Thomas Hall] was married.</p>
            <p>ONE of their firſt acts was to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the maintenance of public worſhip. I am told, that Mr. Davenport of New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preached the firſt ſermon here, at the bottom of the hill on which the town ſtands, from thoſe words, ISAIAH v.i. <hi>My beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</hi> But this information, as to the gentleman that preached, is moſt probably a miſtake, ſince Mr. Davenport removed to Boſton 1667.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the Rev. Mr. Street, Mr. John Herriman (one of the New-Haven commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee) preached to this people, and, I am told, ſome others. Mr. Street, [one of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers and committee for ſettlement] was firſt paſtor, and near 40 years of age when he firſt preached to this people, 1672. He was ſon to the aforeſaid Nicholas Street,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011622_0026_0F87775AEBE9C688"/>
teaching elder of New-Haven church. He moved with his family hither, April 1673, the town having agreed to build him an houſe. He had an annual ſalary before any church was gather'd here. The 3d day of the 2d month, 1674, was obſerved as a day of faſting and prayer, previous to the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a church of Chriſt in the place. And on the 15th of the ſame month, the following year, the town voted,
<q>That as there had been conſent about eſtabliſhing a church of Chriſt in the aforeſaid town, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day ſet apart and obſerved by the town unanimouſly to ſeek GOD's guidance in ſo great a work, they have now alſo actually and unanimouſly concluded, if it be the will of GOD, that there ſhall be a church gathered, <hi>and to walk according to the</hi> CONGREGATIONAL WAY; and have alſo actually and unanimouſly left the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the ſame in the hands of Mr. Moſs, Mr. Samuel Street, Mr. Brocket, Eliaſaph Preſton, John Hall ſen'r. John Hall jun'r. Thomas Yale, Nehemiah Royce, Nathan Andrews, Benjamin Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, Lieut. Merriman, Sergt. Doolittle, John Beach; that, if it be the will of GOD to incline their hearts, ſo many of them as may be a competent number for that work may, in his time, lay the foundation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:011622_0027_0F87775B9D97D610"/>NO doubt the church was form'd ſoon after this, and under Mr. Street's paſtoral care: Thô no record is to be found of the preciſe time of either.</p>
            <p>YOU ſee the church was form'd on the <hi>congregational plan</hi>—differing from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of New-Haven church in this, that it had no teaching or ruling elder diſtinct from the paſtor—Which diſtinction was probably laid aſide in the church of New-Haven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt planters of this town came and ſettled here—even immediately on Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport's removal; as there are no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it afterwards. Our firſt planters proceeded much according to the method of New-Haven in gathering a church. They choſe 13 leading men, with inſtructions to thoſe, that "as many of them as might be a competent number for that work, would lay the foundation"—Very well comporting with the account before given of the New-Haven planters procedure in this matter.</p>
            <p>THE idea our fathers had of a church of Chriſt appears from hence to have been this: "The voluntary, explicit, ſolemn covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a number of perſons to walk together in the profeſſion and order of the goſpel— that their <hi>own</hi> act and engagement with each other conſtitutes them a church of Chriſt— that they have, therefore, full power to form
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011622_0028_0F87775D8A174850"/>
themſelves into a church ſtate, and declare for themſelves what form of worſhip and diſcipline they will maintain, conformable to their own apprehenſions of the mind of Chriſt; <hi>without dependence on other churches, or their officers.</hi>" This I take to be the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of all churches properly <hi>congregational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE doth not appear to have been the leaſt deviation from, or alteration in, this plan, but an entire conformity to it, in this church, at and after the ordination of the Rev. Mr. Whittelſey, A. D. 1710, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the confederacy of the churches at Say-Brook, eighteen months before. At a town-meeting previous to Mr. Whittelſey's ordination, among other things relative there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I find the following words in their votes —"And what churches ſhall be ſent to" [to attend the ordination] "is wholly left by the town to the committee, with the advice of Mr. Street and Mr. Whittelſey, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of." In the original ſtipulation (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited) between the committee of New-Haven and the firſt undertakers, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly provided, <hi>that none of the ſettlers and ſucceſſive planters ſhall by any means diſturb the church, when ſettled there, in their choice of miniſter or miniſters, or other church officers; or in any of their other church rights, liberties, or adminiſtrations: Nor ſhall refuſe or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

due maintenance from ſuch miniſtry.</hi> The firſt church is ſtill on it's <hi>original</hi> plan. It gives us pleaſure to find, that we are in the good old way of our progenitors: Eſpecially as we doubt not they were <hi>built on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the apoſtles.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">The firſt conſociation of this county, convened at Branford, April 1709, (a few months after the Say-Brook agreement, at which were preſent ſome of the <hi>compilers</hi> of the articles of diſcipline) on the requeſt of ſome churches preſent, declared it as their ſenſe, that the articles were no more then a <hi>recognition</hi> of the obligations which the <hi>goſpel of Chriſt</hi> brings diſtinct ſocieties of chriſtians under to afford each other <hi>mutual advice and aſſiſtance,</hi> when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.

Such was the ſpirit of liberty then in the churches!</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT was an uſage in this church, for about 40 years, for perſons who made a chriſtian profeſſion, to give, at the ſame time, ſome relation of their chriſtian experience. Soon after Mr. Whittelſey's ordination, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was left to the election of the perſons concern'd, and not long after entirely diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. It is now practiſed in but few New-England churches.</p>
            <p>TILL April, 1680, the firſt ſettlers aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for religious worſhip in a private houſe.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lieut. Nathanael Merriman's. The firſt vote of the town to build an houſe of public worſhip was December 27. 1676, of 34 by 30 feet—upon which nothing appears to have been executed. Nov. 17. 1679, their former vote was reſcinded, and it was agreed to build an houſe of 28 by 24 feet, and 10 feet poſt. Sep. 5. 1681, a further rate was laid to finiſh the houſe, which, however, was not compleated. In 1690 an addition of 16 feet was made to the breadth of it; and the following year concluded to ſeal the whole inſide, from ſell to plate. Such was the deep poverty of the firſt inhabitants. A ſingle farmer among us now cou'd build ſuch an houſe with one year's profits of his farm, beſides ſupporting his family well.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011622_0030_0F87775E9EE2EBE0"/>
The work of their ſmall meeting-houſe was then ſo far carried on, that they aſſembled in it. They manifeſted a chearfulneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ability, in ſupporting GOD's public worſhip, from the very firſt. But their poverty in this world rendred them unable, for many years to do much more than provide mean ſhelters for their families. Next to their timely care in regard to the maintenance of public worſhip (the principal concern of a chriſtian people) the inſtruction of their children, in the firſt rudiments of knowledge, appears to have been an object of attention with 'em, from their annual proviſion for the ſupport of ſchools—eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the education of their children of more value than outward poſſeſſions. An incident or two, which evidence the regard our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had to juſtice and equity, I can't paſs without mentioning; ſince in matters ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly trivial a righteous principle may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover itſelf, as well as in greater. Several perſons, employ'd by the town in different ways, had undertaken the buſineſs by the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011622_0031_0F87775F5C722A60"/>
great, as we are wont to ſpeak; but finding they had an hard bargain, petition'd for an additional allowance, which was readily made 'em.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants had repeated apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the incurſions of the barbarians. Aug. 27. 1675, two houſes were ordered to be fortified; <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Street's and Lieut. Merriman's.</note> the whole town to begin the work the day following this meeting, and continue till effected. Every man alſo was requir'd to bring arms and ammunition on the ſabbath. The following October, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortification was added at the lower end of the town, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Serjeant Doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little's houſe</note> and perſons appointed to keep garriſon at each place. But it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the inhabitants of this town were ever immediate ſufferers by the depredations of the ſavages. What gave occaſion to the apprehenſions of our fathers at this time, no doubt was, the breaking out of Philip's war this ſummer. Philip, youngeſt ſon of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoiet, ſucceeding his brother, took unweary'd pains to "engage the Indians, in all parts of New-England, to unite againſt the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>[The Indians about Hadly confeſſed ſuch a plot. The Narraganſetts had engaged to bring 4000 men. They did not expect to be prepared before the ſpring of 1676. But Philip precipitated his own nation and his
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011622_0032_0F87776153518E80"/>
allies into a war before they were prepared. This was evident from the diſtraction of the Indians in all parts of New-England, upon the firſt news of the diſturbance from Philip.]</p>
            <p>He was a man of high ſpirit, and cou'd never reſt until he brought on the war, which iſſued in his deſtruction. He was the object on whoſe life or death war or peace, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Firſt or laſt moſt of the Indians in New-England join'd him. And it was a queſtion with ſome whether the Indians wou'd not prevail to a total extirpation of the Engliſh inhabitants." The colonies of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Maſſachuſetts, and Connecticut, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, attacked with 1000 men a ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the Indians in Narraganſett, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a bloody battle took and deſtroyed it, Dec. 19. 1675. Mr. Treat was a Major of this colony troops, and ſoon after choſen governor of the colony.</p>
            <p>By this ſingle acquiſition, and repeated ſucceſsful encounters with the ſavages in ſmaller parties the following year, they "were ſo reduced, that they were continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in on promiſe of mercy. Philip fled from one ſwamp to another, divers times very narrowly eſcaping, looſing one chief coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor after another. He was killed Aug. 12. 1676, as he was flying from his purſuers. One of his own men, whom he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011622_0033_0F87776226658F30"/>

            <p>IN 1681, forts were renewed in this town. In 1690 February 26th, was an order of the town to fort in the meeting-houſe. In 1702 the apprehenſions from the ſavages were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and the inhabitants brought arms on Lord's-day. We may take occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on divine goodneſs in freeing us from the enemy of the wilderneſs, and from an inſidious foe ever ready to inſtigate 'em, to every kind of barbarity. We have not to get our bread in jeopardy of life, as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did; but ſit under our own vine and fig-tree, having none to make us afraid. The ſignal extirpation of the ſavages, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the conſideration of their reſiſting all attempts to convert 'em to the Chriſtian faith, renders it not improbable, that they may be a devoted people. One of the more ſenſible and ſerious natives is reported to have aſk'd "For what wickedneſs of their fathers GOD had abandon'd 'em?" or to this effect. The uſe it behoves us to make of the favor of heaven in driving out the heathen before our fathers, and planting 'em in this land— in making it at length "a quiet habitation," and cauſing this "wilderneſs to bloſſom as the roſe," is that <hi>being deliver'd out of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011622_0034_0F8777625C12C480"/>
hands of our enemies, we ſerve</hi> GOD <hi>without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE it may be proper to remind you, that the New-Haven planters made a fair pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of any excluſive right the Indians might have to Quinnipiack, which (as before ſaid) contained the greater part of the bounds of this town. Their deed of it is dated Dec. 1638—which was renewed 1645. But on pretence of the Indians, that they had made a reſerve of ſome appurtenances in former grants, another purchaſe was made, and a valuable conſideration given for an unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved deed of "12 large miles long, and 8 broad;" the breadth extending from "Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's brook, to Pilgrim's harbor." The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of 3 miles to the breadth, from the laſt mention'd place; was made by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This Indian deed is dated at Hartford, May 24. 1681, acknowledged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Treat, then governor of the colony. The purchaſe was made by Samuel Street, John Moſs, Nathanael Merriman, John Brocket, Abraham Doolittle. <note n="‖" place="bottom">John Brocket died March 12. 1690, Aet. 80.—Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Doolittle Auguſt 11. of the ſame year.

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:011622_0038_0F877766443C0F88"/>IN the month of March 1732, (a little more than eight years after the ſociety of New-Cheſhire was formed) the <hi>ſmall-pox</hi> "broke out in the centre of the ſociety." How it came there is to this day a ſecret.
<q>Being an unuſual diſeaſe, and many opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it, people went upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and other public days, to ſee the ſick. After ſome time, when it began to ſpread, ſome were afraid it was the ſmall-pox, and ſent for thoſe who had had the diſtemper to know whether it was the ſmall-pox, who all agreed it was not; which made people careleſs, till Dr. Harpin came and told 'em it was—Thus the infection was ſpread in many families, and they were brought into the greateſt diſtreſs for want of experienced nurſes—yea, had ſcarcely help to bury their dead.</q>
For a further account, I refer you to a printed diſcourſe of the Rev. Mr. Hall's on the occaſion—by which it appears, that 124 perſons had the diſtemper, (one third, probably, of the ſouls then in the ſociety) and, all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis ſurprizing, that of theſe but 17 died.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ſociety was formed 1725, by the name of MERIDEN. It conſiſted at firſt of between 30 and 40 families. They had preaching only in the winter ſeaſon for the

The 22nd of October, the year following, a church was gather'd on a faſt day obſerved by the ſociety; and the 29th of the ſame month Mr. Hall was ordained their paſtor.

            <p>A number of families belonging to the firſt ſociety had permiſſion to worſhip by themſelves in 1759; a paſtor <note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev.

The church members at firſt were 50, and 61 at the ordination of their paſtor; who hath admitted to communion 49, baptized in the town 125, (moſt of 'em in his own pariſh) beſides 10 baptized in his ſociety by other miniſters.

preſent communicants are 209. Deaths in this ſociety ſince October 12. 1758, 186— [excluſive of 11 deaths in this time among the people called ſeperates.] The firſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of this antient church were Eliaſaph Preſton, (grandfather to the preſent Capt. Ephraim Preſton) and John Hall ſenr. On deacon Preſton's death ſucceeded Samuel Hall, brother to deacon John, and father to the late honorable John Hall <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and the preſent very aged Samuel Hall <abbr>Eſq</abbr>—John Peck (but lately deceaſed) was choſen on the death of deacon John Hall. Samuel Moſs (father to Meſſrs. Theophilus, Samuel, and Iſaiah Moſs) ſucceeded deacon Samuel Hall. In a few years, deacon Moſs being taken blind, John Hall (ſon to the firſt of that name, and father to the captains Peter, John and Aſahel Hall, and to Meſſrs. Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Benjamin and Eliſha Hall) was choſen. On deacon Peck's reſigning, Samuel Hall the 3d. grandſon to the former deacon of that name, was elected: And on the death of the late deacon John Hall, Capt. Benjamin Atwater ſucceeded—which two laſt are the preſent deacons of the firſt church in the town. <note n="‖" place="bottom">The two firſt paſtors were each forty two years in the miniſtry. But three deacons had died when the preſent paſtor was ordained. (1758.) Three have died ſince. The age of the ſix deceaſed amounts to 501, or 83 ½ for each. Deacon Preſton died A. D. 1705, aged about 70. Deacon John Hall, February 2. 1721, Aet. 82.—Deacon Samuel Hall, March 5. 1725, Aet. 80.—Deacon John Peck, June 29. 1768, Aet. 99.—Deacon John Hall, April 28. 1766, Aet. 86.—Deacon Moſs, July 30. 1765, Aet. 85. Adding in the age of the two paſtors, with the ſix deacons, deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the amount is 649, or near 81 for each paſtor and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con deceaſed of the firſt church.</note>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:011622_0045_0F87776F24D12008"/>THUS I have given you, my hearers, as ſuccinct an hiſtory of the town as the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe wou'd admit. I take this opportunity to return my thanks to any gentlemen who have favored me with their intelligence. The calculation of births is founded on probable general principles. For the firſt half century 'tis probable they were all (or nearly all) ſeaſonably recorded. The laſt 50 years, it appears that people have been more careleſs in getting the births of their children recorded. I have given you the exact number of deaths in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third ſocieties ſince their formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the firſt and fourth ſocieties, and church of England, ſince my ſettlement in the town. Yet in ſuming up the whole number for the century now compleated, I have been able to proceed on probable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples only.</p>
            <p>I muſt wave the matter (and, indeed, had no deſign) of giving any directions relating to the particular buſineſs before you. Moſt of you, I preſume, came determin'd as to the diſtribution of your votes—on <hi>juſt</hi> principles, I hope. To attempt the conviction of any who may have determin'd on other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wou'd, I fear, be a fruitleſs labor. I
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011622_0046_0F87776FE9162488"/>
wou'd only remind you of the advice of one, who knew how to aſſert and improve his freedom. "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only uſe not liberty for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another."</p>
            <p>NOR is there time left for thoſe reflections, which the preceeding diſcourſe and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it ſuggeſt: I muſt, however, beg your patience while I only mention a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of uſes and inferences, which a review of both brings to mind.</p>
            <p>WE are caution'd againſt attributing to means and inſtruments, what is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the energy of Almighty GOD, who worketh all in all.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, we may not indulge to negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſloth under a nation that events are ſo fixed and determined as to ſuperſede human endeavors.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of prying into the ſecrets of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government, we are taught to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what lies plain to our view, and concerns the regulation of our hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>WE are moreover taught to truſt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who ruleth ſupreme over all, with our intereſts—reſigning ourſelves to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal—and walking with GOD.</p>
            <p>GOD's government being moral inſtructs

us what conſtitutes the proſperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a people.</p>
            <p>WE are alſo taught to view the reference, which the ſcheme of divine providence at preſent hath to a future ſtate, and more compleat manifeſtation of GOD's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>THE particular recollection of the favors of heaven to the Britiſh nation, to New-England, to this colony, to our progenitors of this town, to ourſelves, is adapted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with gratitude and praiſe. Let us evidence ſuch a temper by imitating the piety of our anceſtors, that GOD may be with us, as he was with them. They came to this country on religious motives. They were ſignally protected and proſpered. From being "few in number," <hi>their latter end has greatly increaſed.</hi> We deny not but they had miſtakes—ſuch as the beſt of frail mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals have been incident to. If in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects we have a more improved knowledge, yet have we not abated in chriſtian zeal and purity of life? Inſtances of the neglect of family worſhip cou'd ſcarce be found in their days; how numerous are ſuch inſtances in ours? How are family government and good order, and religious education of children, wherein they ſhewed a laudable care, now diſregarded? How ſtrict were they in their
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011622_0048_0F87777164E897D8"/>
obſervation of the Lord's-day? how careleſs and looſe are we? And are not profaneneſs and intemperance vices continually growing in the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us "remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our firſt works."</p>
            <p>THE retroſpect we have taken in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe reminds us of the brevity of life, and ſhould ſerve to quicken us in the work for which we were born, and ſent into the world. "One generation paſſeth away, and another generation cometh. Our fathers where are they?" They have "told us what GOD did for them in their day:" And
<q>the mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him; and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto childrens children: To ſuch as keep his covenant, and to thoſe that remember his commandments to do 'em.</q>
In a little time <hi>we</hi> muſt "go to the generation of our fathers." Let us be ambitious to act our part well on the ſtage —to tranſmit the beſt of bleſſings to thoſe that come after us: That "inſtead of the fathers, there may be the children," who ſhall "be to the LORD for a generation:" That when we ſhall have done with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things, we may join the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world above, in "worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that ſitteth on the throne, and
