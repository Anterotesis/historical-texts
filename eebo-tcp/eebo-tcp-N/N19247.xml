            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>FROM THE CRITICAL REVIEW, For September, 1788.</head>
            <q>
               <p>OUR Author, with great candour and extenſive knowledge of the ſubject, diſcuſſes the doctrine of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhments. He thinks that there will be a period when every ſinner will be reſtored to the Divine favour. This doctrine is perfectly conſiſtent with the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Deity. It is ſupported by many wiſe and good men; nor is there any reaſon to ſuppoſe that it will be perverted to ſerve the purpoſes of vice and immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Mr. Wincheſter, in his defence of it, ſhews much charity, much humanity, and no little ſhare of learning: The fifth Dialogue alone, which relates to the deſign and tendency of puniſhment, might furniſh ſome little foundation for a difference of opinion; but, in a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo greatly above human attainment, the mind would be loſt in the enquiry, and not greatly benefited by the diſcuſſion. The queſtion of the univerſal Reſtoration, muſt be examined as Mr. Wincheſter has done, by the word of God, as revealed at different times, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Goſpel.</p>
            </q>
            <p>N. B. A conſiderable part of the fifth Dialogue, being printed in the Lectures on the Prophecies, is left out of this edition, and the remaining part is included in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <head type="sub">TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AS I now preſent my Friends and the Public with a new edition of the Dialogues on the UNIVERSAL RESTORATION, which by many has been long deſired, perhaps it may be acceptable to ſome for me to give a brief account how I came firſt to the knowledge of this part of the counſel of God, which I have not ſhunned freely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, both by word and writing, as I have found opportunity and neceſſity.</p>
            <p>I think it was in the beginning of the year 1778, being in South Carolina, upon the River <hi>Pee Dee,</hi> where I was at that time Miniſter, that I called to ſee a friend, who firſt put into my hands that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable book written by <hi>Paul Siegvolk,</hi> and which is called <hi>The Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> of which I have lately publiſhed a new edition. I was deſired to tell what it meant to hold forth, as my friend could not tell by any means what to make of it on the account of the ſingularity and ſtrangeneſs of the ſentiments therein contained; although the language is very plain and clear, and by no means dark, myſtical, or obſcure.</p>
            <p>I opened the book as I was deſired, and dipping into it here and there, for half an hour perhaps, was very ſoon able to tell what the Author aimed at, viz. <hi>that there would be a final end of ſin and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025050_0004_102D75B2C3F7DE80"/>
miſery, and that all fallen creatures would be reſtored, by Jeſus Chriſt, to a ſtate of holineſs and happineſs, after ſuch as were rebellious had ſuffered in proportion to their crimes.</hi> I had never ſeen any thing of the ſort before in all my life; and I ſeemed ſtruck with ſeveral ideas that I glanced over, ſuch as the inconſiſtency and impoſſibility of both good and evil always exiſting in the univerſe; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his obſervations upon the word <hi>eternal</hi> or <hi>everlaſting,</hi> ſhewing that it was uſed for what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a beginning, and would never have an end, as the being and perfections of God; and that it was alſo applied to things which had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but ſhould never have an end, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and happineſs of the righteous; and, that it was alſo frequently uſed to expreſs things, times, and ſeaſons which had both beginning and end. which he therefore called <hi>periodical eternities,</hi> and gave a great number of inſtances of this ſort, which could not be denied; and he contended that the <hi>everlaſting puniſhment</hi> threatened to the wicked, did not belong to the firſt, nor to the ſecond, but to the third claſs of theſe durations.</p>
            <p>But as I was only deſired to tell what the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor meant, when I had ſatisfied my friend in that reſpect, I laid the book down, and I believe, we both concluded it to be a pleaſant ingenious hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, but had no ſerious thoughts of its being true; and for my part, I determined not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myſelf about it, or to think any thing more of the matter. And as the book had been ſent a conſiderable diſtance for my friend to read, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was ſoon after ſent back; for I ſaw it no more, nor heard any thing farther about it. The The following ſummer I went a journey into <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:025050_0005_102D702A9D161F08"/>
and happening to mention the ſubject to a miniſter there, he told me that a few years before, it had been a ſubject of controverſy in the public papers, between a clergyman, who defended, and a gentleman of the law, who denied the proper <hi>endleſs</hi> eternity of puniſhment; and he told me that this gentleman who denied it, had advanced, that the tranſlators of the Bible had rendered the very ſame Greek word, by very different Engliſh words, ſometimes rendering it <hi>for ever,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>world;</hi> and that if they had always uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly rendered it by one Engliſh word, it would have been evident to all readers, that no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> could have been drawn therefrom. I was told alſo while I was in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> that a clergyman of the epiſcopal church, had a few years before, given out that he had ſome wonderful thing to make known to his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which he would preach upon ſome Sunday, but did not mention when. This raiſed the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic curioſity, and great numbers attended his place of worſhip in hopes of hearing what this wonderful thing might be; but for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time the matter was undiſcovered. But at laſt he gave out, that on the next Sunday he would open this great ſecret. Vaſt numbers of people flocked to hear what it could be; When he came to declare what it was, behold! it was a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of news indeed, ſuch as had never been heard before in any pulpit in <hi>Virginia.</hi> It was nothing ſhort of the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtoration.</hi> I think, to the beſt of my remembrance, they told me, that he opened and enlarged upon it for two Sundays, and never preached any more, being immediately after ſeized with ſickneſs, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:025050_0006_102D75B4FB4293F8"/>
in his death. And this was generally eſteemed as a judgment that fell upon him for daring to preach ſuch a wicked, falſe, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinion; and that God cut him off from the land of the living, to teſtify his diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and to terrify others from daring to follow his example, or believe his ſentiments. But perhaps this might have been ſome worthy, learned, pious man, who had long concealed this grand truth in his heart, and had derived much ſatisfaction therefrom, and longed to proclaim it to others, for their good. And at laſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oppoſition that he might expect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſo to do; and accordingly was enabled, juſt before his time came to depart out of this world, to bear a faithful teſtimony to this moſt grand and important of all God's purpoſes. And having performed his duty, his maſter called him to receive his reward, and gave him the glorious plaudit of, 'Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant;—enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'</p>
            <p>As for the vain judgments of men they are not to be regarded. 'For they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither underſtand they his counſel.' 'But the ſouls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there ſhall no torment touch them. In the ſight of the unwiſe they ſeemed to die; and their departure is taken for miſery. And their going from us to be utter deſtruction; but they are in peace. For though they be puniſhed in the ſight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little chaſtiſed, they ſhall be greatly rewarded; for God proved them, and found them worthy for himſelf. As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and hath received them as a burnt-offering.
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:025050_0007_102D702C4A7DAB40"/>
And in the time of their viſitation, they ſhall ſhine, and run to and fro, like ſparks among the ſtubble. They ſhall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord ſhall reign for ever. They that put their truſt in him ſhall underſtand the truth; and ſuch as be faithful in love ſhall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his ſaints, and he hath care for his elect.' 'But though the righteous be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented with death, yet ſhall he be in reſt.'</p>
            <p>I am apt to think therefore, that this miniſter was one of uncommon faith and love, and as he be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed God, ſo he loved mankind, and wiſhed them to know the amazing riches of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's love towards them: and when he had openly delivered this teſtimony, he was called to his reſt.</p>
            <p>Indeed if the enemies of this doctrine had been true prophets, I ſhould have died and gone to hell long ago; for no ſooner was it known I had embraced it, but ſome gave out that I would not live a year; but I have already lived eleven. One of my old friends deſired me to take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he ſaid, which he expreſſed in theſe words, 'Mind what I tell you. In ſix months from this time, you will turn Deiſt, and deny all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion: and in twelve months you will turn Atheiſt, deny the being of God, and abandon yourſelf to all kinds of open wickedneſs.' Bleſſed be God, this has alſo proved falſe. And they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeemed to agree to propheſy certain dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to me whenever I ſhould depart out of this world. But I truſt this is equally falſe, 'For I know whom I have believed, (or truſted) and am
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:025050_0008_102D75B6EF00D258"/>
perſuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.'</p>
            <p>But to return to my narrative,</p>
            <p>Sometime after I returned back to <hi>South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> a Phyſician with whom I had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Virginia,</hi> came to live in the pariſh where I was miniſter; and among his books I found <hi>the Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> by <hi>Paul Siegvolk;</hi> this was the ſecond copy that had fell in my way, and I read a little more therein, but as yet had not the leaſt thought that ever I ſhould embrace his ſentiments; yet ſome of his arguments appeared very conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and I could not wholly ſhake them off, but I concluded to let them alone, and not inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the matter; and therefore I never gave the book even ſo much as one curſory reading, till with great difficulty I procured one in the city of Philadelphia, more than two years afterwards.</p>
            <p>In the year 1779, I found myſelf much ſtirred up to exhort my fellow creatures to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey the Goſpel, and began to adopt a more open and general method of preaching than I had uſed for ſome years before; having been deemed one of the moſt conſiſtent Calviniſts upon the continent, much upon the plan of Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> whom I eſteemed almoſt as an oracle. But now my heart being opened, and viewing the worth of ſouls, I felt great compaſſion towards them, and invited them with all my might to fly for mercy to the arms of Chriſt, who died for them, and who was willing to ſave them. I was gradually led into this way of preaching, without conſidering any thing about its conſiſtency with ſtrict calviniſm, but finding myſelf very happy and comfortable in my own mind, and that this

method of preaching was highly uſeful, I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to go in the ſame courſe.</p>
            <p>About this time I began to find uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for the converſion and ſalvation of the poor negroes, who were very numerous in that part of the country; but whom none of my predeceſſors, that I could learn, had ever taken pains to inſtruct in the principles of Chriſtianity; neither had any ſingle ſlave, either man, or woman been baptized until that ſummer, in the whole pariſh (which was very large) that I ever heard of.</p>
            <p>The prejudices which the ſlaves had againſt Chriſtianity, on account of the ſeverities practiſed upon them by profeſſing Chriſtians, both miniſters and people, might be one principal reaſon why they could not be brought to attend to religious inſtructions. But they had no prejudice againſt me on that ſcore, as I never had any thing to do with ſlavery, but on the contrary condemned it; and this being pretty generally known, operated ſo upon the minds of thoſe poor creatures, that they ſhewed a diſpoſition to attend my miniſtry, more than they had ever ſhewed to any other. But ſtill I never had addreſſed them in particular, and indeed had hardly any hopes of doing them good. But one evening ſeeing a great number of them at the door of the houſe where I was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I found myſelf conſtrained as it were, to go to the door, and tell them, That Jeſus Chriſt loved them, and died for them, as well as for us white people, and that they might come and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and welcome. And I gave them as warm and preſſing an invitation as I could, to comply with the glorious goſpel. This ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe addreſſed immediately to them, took great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:025050_0010_102D75B8DA85BFC8"/>
effect than can well be imagined. There were about thirty from one plantation in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood preſent; (beſides others) theſe returned home, and did not even give ſleep to their eyes, as they afterwards informed me, until they had ſettled every quarrel among themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their form of marriage, had married e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to the woman with whom he lived; had reſtored whatever one had unjuſtly taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and determined from that time to ſeek the Lord diligently. From that very evening they began conſtantly to pray to the Lord, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and he was found of them. I continued to inſtruct them, and within three months from the firſt of June, I baptized more than thirty blacks belonging to that plantation, beſides as many others, as in the whole made up one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, of which ſixty three were men, and thirty-ſeven were women, all which were born in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> or immediately deſcended from ſuch as were natives of that unhappy country.</p>
            <p>My preaching was not only uſeful to the poor ſlaves, but alſo to great numbers of the white people, of whom I baptized upon profeſſion of repentance and faith in Chriſt, about one hundred and thirty-nine perſons within the ſame ſpace. This was a ſummer of great ſucceſs, and I ſhall remember that happy ſeaſon with pleaſure while I live. This ſummer I received ſome farther dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the day of the general Reſtoration in my mind, for upon conſidering ſeveral Scriptures, ſuch as theſe, 'He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied; by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many; for he ſhall bear their iniquities,' Iſai. liii. 11. 'After this I beheld,
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:025050_0011_102D702FECBDF6D8"/>
lo, a great multitude, which no man could num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, ſtood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands' Rev. vii. 9. I became fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the number of the finally ſaved would equal, if not exceed the number of the loſt. And I was ſo forcibly impreſſed with this new and very joyful diſcovery, that I not only converſed in that ſtrain privately, but boldly preached it in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which generally conſiſted of nearly a thouſand perſons upon Sundays. Some of the people to whom I had mentioned ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſentiment, thought that I was going at once to declare myſelf in favour of the <hi>general Reſtoration.</hi> But that was as yet far from being the caſe; though ſome of the arguments which I had glanced upon in that book, <hi>the Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> would frequently preſent themſelves to my mind in ſuch a forcible manner that I could ſcarcely withſtand their evidence.</p>
            <p>In the month of September I left <hi>South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> on a viſit to my friends in <hi>New England,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending however to return to my people again; but to prevent their being left deſtitute, I procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rev. Mr. <hi>Botsford</hi> to come and ſupply them, upon this condition, that whenever I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he ſhould reſign the congregation to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if I required it. But he has remained the conſtant Paſtor ever ſince. I then travelled ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the continent preaching to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and converſing with my friends, to whom ſometimes in private I propoſed ſome of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in favour of the <hi>general Reſtoration,</hi> which I had read in the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> on purpoſe
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:025050_0012_102D75BA6F587FA8"/>
ſee what anſwers they could give; and this I did eſpecially to able miniſters; but to my ſurpriſe often found them quite at a ſtand, not knowing what to ſay. And ſome were almoſt overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with even the weak manner in which I was capable of holding forth the arguments in favour of the <hi>Reſtoration.</hi> And oftentimes the anſwers that ſome of the greateſt men gave, were ſuch as tended to increaſe my doubts reſpecting <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> rather than to remove them. I remember once, that I aſked the Rev. Mr. <hi>Manning,</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> College, and who was at that time one of my deareſt friends, what was the ſtrongeſt argument that he could uſe in favour of the doctrine of endleſs miſery? He anſwered, That it was the nature of God, to lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible reſtraint upon ſin, and therefore he had threatened it with <hi>endleſs puniſhment,</hi> as the higheſt reſtraint he could poſſibly lay upon it. This argument is anſwered in the third Dialogue. Thus after much ſeeking I could find no ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the matter; but ſtill my doubts increaſed. Notwithſtanding, I withſtood the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> with all my might, and ſometimes preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publicly againſt it with all the force I could muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet there was ſomething in its favour that gained gradually upon my mind, and ſometimes brought me to be almoſt willing to embrace it. I plainly ſaw that it would reconcile almoſt, if not quite, all the difficulties of other ſyſtems; and I thought if I ſhould ever receive it, I ſhould be able to preach much eaſier, and more freely than ever, and with far greater ſatisfaction, which by experience, I have ſince found to be true. The ideas were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo tranſporting to me, even while I profeſſed
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:025050_0013_102D758CE78366F8"/>
to oppoſe the ſentiment, that I have been conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet them forth in the moſt ſublime manner that I was able; and ſometimes ſo as actually to bring them who heard me converſe upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to believe and rejoice in the <hi>Univerſal Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> while I thought myſelf an oppoſer of it, and only propoſed the arguments in its favour to ſee what effect they would have on ſuch who never heard them before. And I was often carried away before I was aware, even while I intended only to let my friends hear what might be ſaid. I remember once, while I was at my father's table in the year 1780, that I mentioned the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> and finding that none in company had ever ſo much as heard of ſuch a ſcheme, I began to hold it forth, produced many arguments in its favour, brought up many objections, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in ſuch a manner as aſtoniſhed all preſent, and I was amazed at myſelf, I ſpoke with ſo much eaſe and readineſs as I had hardly ever experienced before on any occaſion. Nay, I was ſo much ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the ſubject that I ſaid, That I did not doubt but that in ſixty years time, that very doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine would univerſally be preached, and generally embraced in that very country, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail over all oppoſition.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe made a greater impreſſion upon the minds of thoſe who heard it, and upon my own alſo, than I intended; and though I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards uſed the beſt arguments I could in favour of the common opinion, yet I found them inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wholly to remove the effects of what I had before ſaid.</p>
            <p>After ſpending about twelve months in the moſt delightful manner, conſtantly journeying and
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:025050_0014_102D75BC95E17890"/>
preaching with great ſucceſs, to vaſt multitudes of people in my native country, I ſet off with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return towards <hi>South-Carolina.</hi> On the way I tarried ſome time at the houſe of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Samuel Waldo,</hi> in <hi>Pawling's Precinct,</hi> ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> whoſe kind and friendly behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me I remember with pleaſure, and mention with gratitude. I had a great deal of very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation with him upon the matter, and he did not ſeem to oppoſe the ideas hardly at all; but only gently cautioned me againſt receiving any thing erroneous. He is a man of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit, and his family was upon the whole the moſt delightful, agreeable, and happy family that I ever knew. While I was at his houſe one of his children, then about twenty years of age, ſeemed fully convinced of the truth of the doctrine, by liſtening to our converſation, and was filled with great joy at the idea. Several religious men who were on a journey, lodged at the houſe while I was there, got a hint of the matter, and wiſhed to hear all that I could ſay in defence of it; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly gave them ſome of the principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in its favour, and obviated ſome of the moſt capital objections that could be brought againſt it; and I afterwards overheard them wiſhing that they had not been ſo curious as to have enquired ſo far into the ſubject, for they could not reſiſt the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although they ſeemed reſolved to treat the ſentiment as an error.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of mind, half a convert to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> I arrived in the city of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> on the 7th of October, 1780. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have left the city in a few days, and to have gone on towards <hi>South-Cnrolina,</hi> but the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:025050_0015_102D758EC8815A58"/>
church being deſtitute of a miniſter, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to ſtop and preach with them, to which I was at length perſuaded, and for ſome time I was much followed, and there were great additions to the church. The congregations increaſed in ſuch a manner, eſpecially on Sunday-evenings, that our place of worſhip, though large, would by no means contain them; at length leave was aſked by ſome of my friends for me to preach in the church of St. Paul, in that city, which was granted. This was one of the largeſt houſes of worſhip in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and equal in bigneſs to moſt of the churches in <hi>London.</hi> I think I preached there about eighteen ſermons, and generally to very crowded audiences, frequently more than could poſſibly get into the houſe; moſt of the clergy, of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination in the city, heard me there, and many thouſands of different people. I am inclined to think, that I never preached to ſo many before nor ſince as I did ſometimes in that houſe, and with almoſt univerſal approbation. But now the time of my trouble and caſting down came on, and thus it was.</p>
            <p>Soon after I arrived in the city I had enquired of ſome friend for <hi>The Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which I could not light on for ſome time, but they lent me Mr. <hi>Stonehouſe's</hi> book upon the <hi>Reſlitution of all Things,</hi> which I had never ſeen nor heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; this very learned work I read with great care, and his reaſoning, arguments, and ſcripture-proofs ſeemed to me entirely ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>The friends who procured me the works of Mr. <hi>Stonehouſe,</hi> were concerned at my having an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to read any thing upon ſuch a ſubject; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, though there were ſeveral of them with
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:025050_0016_102D75BEC18E4120"/>
whom I converſed pretty freely upon the matter, and who knew of my reading Mr. <hi>Stonehouſe's</hi> works, yet they behaved in ſo friendly a manner towards me, that they never mentioned a word of it to any, until by other means it come to be known and talked of.</p>
            <p>In the houſe where I lodged, when I firſt came to the city I had, in the freedom of converſation, and with ſome appearance of joy, expreſſed myſelf in general terms upon the ſubject, but always in the exact words of Scripture, or in ſuch a manner as this, viz. That I could not help hoping that God would finally bring <hi>every knee to bow,</hi> and <hi>every tongue</hi> to <hi>ſwear:</hi> and that <hi>at the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth; and things under the earth; and that every tongue</hi> ſhould <hi>confeſs</hi> JESUS CHRIST to be <hi>Lord to the glory of God the Father.</hi> And that I hoped, <hi>that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such paſſages as theſe I mentioned in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hoping that they would be fulfilled. The people of the houſe ſeemed ſurpriſed, and aſked me if I believed ſo: I anſwered, 'That ſometimes I could not help hoping that it might be ſo.' I could hardly have imagined among friends, that any danger could have ariſen from my expreſſing a hope that the Scriptures were true.</p>
            <p>However theſe falſe friends told a miniſter, whom for a number of years I had eſteemed as my beſt and moſt intimate friend, that I was turned heretic, and believed the doctrine of the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration,</hi> and deſired him to convince me. Some
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:025050_0017_102D75908BBF7240"/>
time after he met with me in the ſtreet, and in a very abrupt manner told me, that he had wanted to ſee me for ſome time, that he might give me a piece of his mind; that he had been informed by ſuch a perſon, that I was inclined to the doctrine of the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration,</hi> and then, inſtead of uſing any argument to convince me, or taking any method for my recovery, added this <hi>laconic</hi> ſpeech, 'If you embrace this ſentiment, I ſhall no longer own you for a brother.' And he has hitherto been as good as his word, having never written nor ſpoken to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from that day to this; and when I have ſince offered to ſhake hands with him, he has refuſed; and yet he was one whom I eſteemed above any other on earth, as a hearty, ſincere, long-tried, and faithful friend. If my intimate friend treated me in ſuch a manner, what had I not to expect from my open and avowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</p>
            <p>I now foreſaw the ſtorm, and I determined to prepare for it, not by denying what I had ſaid, but by examining and determining for myſelf, whether the ſentiment was according to Scripture or not. If I found that it was not, I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to retract, but if it was, to hold it faſt, let the conſequences be what they might. I had now no time to loſe, I expected in a ſhort time to be called to an account, and examined reſpecting this doctrine, and obliged either to <hi>defend</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> it; I was already too well perſuaded that it was true, to do the latter without heſitation, and yet not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for the former. For this purpoſe, I ſhut myſelf up chiefly in my chamber, read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and prayed to God to lead me into all truth, and not ſuffer me to embrace any error; and I
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:025050_0018_102D75C08906E5D8"/>
think that with an upright mind, I laid myſelf open to believe whatever the Lord had revealed. It would be too long to tell all the teachings I had on this head; let it ſuffice, in ſhort, to ſay, That I became ſo well perſuaded of the truth of the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration,</hi> that I was determined never to deny it, let it coſt me ever ſo much, though all my numerous friends ſhould forſake me, as I expected they would, and though I ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from men, and obliged to dwell in caves or dens of the earth, and feed on wild roots and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and ſuffer the loſe of all things, friends, wealth, fame, health, character, and even life itſelf. The truth appeared to me more valuable than all things, and as I had found it, I was determined never to part with it, let what would be offered in exchange.</p>
            <p>I had now formed my reſolution, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how to act when the trial came. Hitherto I had ſaid nothing about the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> in public, and but little in private; but I preached up the death of Chriſt, and ſalvation for mankind through him, without reſtriction. This free manner of preaching gave offence to ſome, who came to hear me no more. On the evening of the 22d of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1781, a number of the members of the church, who had heard that I held the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> met me at a friend's houſe, to aſk me the queſtion, Whether I did or not? I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that I did, but did not wiſh to trouble any body with my ſentiments. They deſired me neither to preach them in public, nor to converſe of them in private. I told them, That if they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent people from aſking me, I would ſay nothing upon the matter; but if people aſked me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:025050_0019_102D75928D393D18"/>
my ſentiments, I could not deny them, and if they wiſhed to know the reaſons, I muſt inform them. And thus the matter was to reſt; but ſome that were preſent, wiſhed to know the foundation of my ſentiments, others oppoſed it, not wiſhing to hear any thing in its favour. At length it was agreed that I might read the paſſages of Scripture upon which I judged the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be founded, but muſt not add a ſingle word of explanation on my part, and on their parts they were not to aſk any queſtions, or make the leaſt oppoſition, for if they did, I inſiſted upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of defending.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I took the Bible, and read many paſſages in the Old and New Teſtaments, which I judged to contain the doctrine; and the very read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them convinced ſeveral of the company of the truth of the <hi>Reſtoration.</hi> There was nothing farther took place at that time: we parted with a mutual agreement; I was not to preach it in the pulpit, nor to introduce it in converſation, but I would not be obliged to deny it, when aſked, nor to refuſe to vindicate it, if oppoſed: and on their parts they were not to ſpeak of it to my prejudice, but to endeavour as much as poſſible, to keep the the matter cloſe, and ſo we parted. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the pains that could be taken, the matter got abroad, and ſeveral came to diſcourſe with me on my principles, to whom I gave ſuch reaſons as I was able for what I believed. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after this time, I met with another copy of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which I then read through with attention for the firſt time, and found much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the arguments and Scripture proofs therein contained, ſeemed to me ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:025050_0020_102D75C2393C6F70"/>
all that would read with candour and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſtill continued to act only on the defenſive, not preaching upon the ſubject, nor going about to private houſes to make intereſt in my favour; but if any came to me and wiſhed me to diſcourſe upon it, I would not refuſe; and thus a number were convinced of its truth, while others violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it. And thus matters continued until the latter end of March. Having heard that the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Baptiſts in <hi>Germantown,</hi> about 8 miles from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> held the doctrine of the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> I had appointed to ſpend the firſt Sunday in April with them; and this engagement had been made ſometime. Juſt as I was ready to go out of the city on Saturday, I found that ſome of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church had privately ſent into the country, and collected a number of the ableſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who were arrived in the city on purpoſe to debate, I gave them the liberty of my pulpit as they pleaſed for the next day, and went out of the city to go to <hi>Germantown;</hi> and took that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to go and viſit that ancient, venerable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, Dr <hi>George De Benneville,</hi> who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in the moſt kind, open, and friendly manner; and his converſation was moſt highly edifying to me. Afterwards I went to <hi>Germantown,</hi> and lodged there all night, ready to preach the next day. As ſoon as my enemies in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> found that I was gone out of the city, they ſpread a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that I had fled to avoid an interview with theſe miniſters, who had come on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me. Nothing could have been more falſe, than ſuch a report, for I had been engaged to go to <hi>Germantown,</hi> on that day, for ſeveral weeks
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:025050_0021_102D759428B2DA90"/>
beforehand: I knew nothing of theſe Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for until they came to town; and I had no fear but I ſhould be able, by God's aſſiſtance, to defend the cauſe before them; and beſides, I had appointed to return on Monday, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn accordingly. The whole Church met, both my friends and my oppoſers, and theſe Miniſters met with them. I was called to attend a funeral at the time, and was at the houſe of mourning, when a meſſenger was ſent in haſte, to deſire my immediate attendance at the meeting without any delay. I found that thoſe who were my enemies in the aſſembly, had been greatly vaunting over my friends, becauſe I was not preſent. They ſaid I had abſconded merely to avoid a debate, in which I was ſure to be confuted, as here was an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that might never preſent itſelf again; and ſeven wiſe, able, and learned Miniſters had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on purpoſe to diſpute with me, but that I had gone, and left my adherents in the lurch, from a conſciouſneſs that I was not able to defend my cauſe; with abundance more to the ſame purpoſe. My friends, on the other hand, told them, That I was afraid of nothing but ſin, and that they doubted not of my being able and willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with any one of the gentlemen, or all of them, one by one, if they choſe it. O, no; they repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they knew better than that, I was gone out of the way on purpoſe, where I could not be found. My friends told them, That if there was a vote paſt in the aſſembly that I ſhould diſpute with any one, they would engage that I would be among them in a few minutes. It was accordingly una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly voted, that I ſhould diſpute with the <hi>Rev. Mr. Boggs,</hi> upon my ſentiments, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:025050_0022_102D75C454842E98"/>
of theſe Miniſters, and of the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But when in a few minutes I came in, and took my place, what different countenances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the congregation? All my friends were highly pleaſed, and the others were as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and diſappointed, at ſeeing me come in ſo chearfully and quickly, after they had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſure, that I would not come. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I might have been looked upon with pity; alone to anſwer for myſelf, no one to ſupport me; while my antagoniſts were ſeven of the ableſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that could be obtained. I felt, however, that inward compoſure, from a conſciouſneſs of having acted uprightly and ſincerely in the whole affair, that even cauſed my countenance to appear eaſy and chearful.</p>
            <p>The vote was then publicly read, and I ſtood up, and declared my readineſs to comply with what was required. The worthy gentleman who was choſen to diſpute with me, then roſe up, and ſaid theſe words, 'I am not prepared to diſpute with <hi>Mr. Wincheſter,</hi> I have heard that he ſays, That it would take ſix weeks to canvaſs all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fairly on both ſides; and I ſuppoſe he has been ſtudying upon the ſubject for a week or more, and I have not ſtudied it at all; and therefore I muſt beg to be excuſed.'</p>
            <p>When I found that he, and all the reſt wholly declined diſputing with me, I begged liberty to ſpeak for two hours upon my ſentiments, and lay them fairly open, and the ground upon which I maintained them. But this was denied me; I then deſired them to give me one hour for this purpoſe; but this was alſo refuſed. One of the Miniſters got up, and ſaid, That their buſineſs
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:025050_0023_102D7595C205F1C0"/>
was not to debate with me, but to aſk me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I believed the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of bad men and angels, finally to a ſtate of holineſs and happineſs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if they did not come to diſpute with me, why was the vote paſſed by their party, as well as by my friends, that I ſhould diſpute with them? This ſpeaks for itſelf. The miniſters inſiſted upon putting the queſtion to me, Do you believe the doctrine of the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration?</hi> My friends objected to my anſwering the queſtion, unleſs I might be allowed to vindicate my ſentiments. But I ſaid, That I did not fear any uſe that could be made of my words; that I had always freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed what my thoughts were, when aſked; and therefore I told them, that I did heartily believe the <hi>General Reſtoration,</hi> and was willing to defend it. The gentleman that was choſen to diſpute with me, then aſked me, whether I thought it ſtrange, conſidering my change of ſentiments, that there ſhould be ſuch a noiſe and uproar made upon the occaſion? &amp;c. I told him, That I did not think it ſtrange at all; and gave him a little hiſtory of the affair, and how the matter came abroad, through the treachery of ſome whom I had eſteemed as my friends; that when I mentioned it to them I was not fully perſuaded of it myſelf, and perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might have been, if I had not been oppoſed and threatened; that I never had intended to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people with my ſentiments, but was willing to live and die with them, if they could bear with me; but that I could not uſe ſo much deceit, as to deny what I believed, when aſked by any one; that I never had yet done ſo, and by the grace of God never would, let the conſequences be what
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:025050_0024_102D75C61AF94DD0"/>
they might. What I ſaid was in the preſence of all my accuſers, and none of them could contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict me, nor had aught to lay to my charge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in this matter of the Goſpel of my Saviour. My diſcourſe took ſuch an effect upon him, that he then publicly declared, that my behaviour in the whole affair had been as became a <hi>man</hi> and a <hi>chriſtian,</hi> and that no one could accuſe me of any improper conduct. I ſtood ſometime, and as none appeared to have any thing farther to ſay to me, I took my leave, and went out. He accompanied me to the door, and told me that he would write to me upon the ſubject; but whatever was the reaſon, he never did, nor have we ſpoken together ſince.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters then adviſed the people to get an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Miniſter; but my friends being numerous, inſiſted it ſhould be fairly determined by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers at large; but this the other party would not agree to. Several very fair offers were made by my friends to them, but they refuſed them all; and finally, by force they kept us out of the houſe, and deprived us of our part of the property, which was at laſt confirmed to them by law, though I think unjuſtly, as we were the majority at firſt; but they took uncommon pains in carrying about a <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt me, to every member of the church, both in the city and in the country, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all with excommunication who would not ſign it; by which ſome were intimidated, and by theſe and other means they ſtrengthened their party. But on the other hand, I took no pains, either to proſelyte people to believe my ſentiments or to make my party ſtrong. But I believe near an hundred of the members ſuffered themſelves to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:025050_0025_102D759819918840"/>
rather than to ſign the <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt me, and the doctrine that I preached. When we were deprived of our houſe of worſhip, the <hi>truſtees</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> gave us the liberty of their hall, where we quietly worſhipped God for about four years, until we purchaſed a place for ourſelves. But to return. After this meeting of the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the whole affair was open, and I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to vindicate the doctrine which they had condemned unheard, not only in private, but in the pulpit. Accordingly, on the 22d day of April, I preached a ſermon on Gen. iii. 15. in which I openly aſſerted the doctrine of the <hi>Final</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration</hi> of all fallen intelligences. This was publiſhed by particular deſire, with a liſt of the plaineſt Scripture paſſages in favour of the doctrine; and a number of the moſt common and principal objections, fairly ſtated, and anſwered. This was my firſt appearance in the world as a <hi>proſe</hi> writer, which was what I never expected to be, and probably ſhould never have been but for this occaſion; ſtill leſs a writer of controverſy, to which I had naturally a great averſion.</p>
            <p>After I had preached this ſermon, I had the <hi>Chevalier Ramſey's Philoſophical Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Revealed Religion</hi> put into my hands; I read the ſame with great pleaſure and advantage, and I muſt acknowledge it to be a work of great merit, and I have reaſon to bleſs God that ever I had opportunity of reading it. I can heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, as one of the beſt works in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and I muſt ſay, that in moſt things I fully agree with that very intelligent author. On the fourth day of January 1782, I preached the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon called, <hi>The Outcaſts Comforted;</hi> from Iſaiah
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:025050_0026_102D75C8206C52D0"/>
lxvi. 5. to my friends who had been caſt out, and excommunicated, for believing this glorious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. This was ſoon after printed, and the next year it was republiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Richard Clark,</hi> and was the firſt of my works ever printed here.</p>
            <p>I have thus given a brief, plain, and ſimple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the means that have brought me to think and write in the manner that I have done, and which account may be conſidered as an hiſtorical ſketch of nearly four years of my life.</p>
            <p>I have every year ſince printed and publiſhed ſomething, which I judged might be uſeful to my fellow-creatures; but as my works are in the hands of moſt of my friends, it is not neceſſary to give a particular account of any of them here, except this book of <hi>Dialogues on the Univerſal Reſtoration.</hi> I have had many diſcourſes with various perſons upon this ſubject, and many objections have been propoſed to me, which I have endeavoured to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and I can truly ſay, that theſe diſcourſes, their queſtions, and my anſwers, their objections, and my ſolutions, form the bulk of theſe Dialogues. I have endeavoured to give all the poſſible force to their objections, and if any of them are weak, I can aſſure the Public, that I have not made them ſo (as ſome have inſinuated) merely that I might be able to anſwer them, but the weakeſt of them have been propoſed to me, and I have fairly ſet down the moſt powerful that I ever heard, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the very words in which they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to me, whether in converſation, or by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I am willing if ſtronger objections can be made, to put them in the place of thoſe which I have ſet down, or add them to the number; and I
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:025050_0027_102D759A0430A5A8"/>
have in this new edition added a few, which I have heard ſince the work was firſt published, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially one which was ſent me by a venerable Miniſter, from <hi>America,</hi> and which I have largely anſwered.</p>
            <p>I have the ſatisfaction of knowing not only that theſe Dialogues have been well received, but that they have been the means of bringing many perſons to the belief of the truth of the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration,</hi> and have ſtrengthened and confirmed others, as will plainly appear from the following extracts of letters, which I have received from ſeveral Miniſters in different parts of the kingdom, ſince their publication.</p>

                  <p>'I HOPE you will excuſe the freedom I have taken in writing to you.</p>
                  <p>'I have for ſeveral years embraced your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and have often ſtood up in defence of them.</p>
                  <p>'I have frequently met with learned and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did men, who have given me much ſatisfaction in this important ſubject. When your Dialogues were publiſhed, I procured and read them with the greateſt avidity. I found the ſubject handled much to my mind. The ſtrongeſt objections raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:025050_0030_102D75CC1B4E5B40"/>
in all their weight and importance, and anſwered clearly and candidly. I read the book, over and over, with freſh pleaſure and ſatisfaction. I ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arguments, treaſured them up in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and determined to become a defender of this part of truth. My heart burnt in love to God and mankind. I found exalted views of God, raiſed exalted ſtrains of gratitude and praiſe. It was one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt attracting views that ever I met with ſince I knew the Saviour's love. I ſoon entered the field, and was obliged to prove my armour againſt the ſtrongeſt objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, backed with prejudices almoſt of an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible nature. When I was hard put to it, I had recourſe to your Magazine, and from thence brought forth new pieces of artillery. You will eaſily ſuppoſe I had many trials from perſons of different diſpoſitions. By perſuading ſeveral of my acquaintance, Miniſters of the Goſpel, to read over your book, I became an inſtrument of winning them over to the truth.</p>
                  <p>'One of my brethren in the miniſtry proteſted much againſt our notions, and declared he would never believe them. Knowing him to be a ſenſible man, and one who might be wrought upon by the force of truth properly ſtated, I uſed ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſuade him to read the book. At length he conſented, and ſaid, that he would do it to oblige me, but was determined not to believe it. I told him, it would ſatisfy me for him to give it a candid reading.</p>
                  <p>'When we met again, I began to enquire what he thought of the book. He pauſed a little, and then freely acknowledged the effect that it had had upon him—He frankly declared that his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:025050_0031_102D759D2AA03F28"/>
was juſt the ſame, as though he had reſolved to look up to the Heavens when the ſun ſhone at noon, and not to believe that it ſhone. I have ſecretly engaged ſeveral, and find when they are ſenſible, candid men, they fall in with your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at once.</p>
                  <p>'I am acquainted with about half a ſcore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who firmly believe and heartily embrace the doctrine; beſides many private chriſtians of different denominations. Moſt of us Miniſters, who fall in with your ſentiments, are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For my own part, I am determined to ſtand by this truth, whether I can continue my place among the people where I am or not. Rather than give up this (through grace) I would give up life.</p>
                  <p>'I have ſo much zea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>'I hope you will muſter up all your reſolution, and ſtand forth boldly again in vindication of the cauſe of truth, and the moſt glorious and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected part of that truth that all men ought to embrace. I fear leſt the enemy ſhall cauſe a ſhout of triumph if you refuſe again to engage, and do not come forth to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty.

                  <p>'AN anxious deſire of a more intimate acquaintance with you induces me to take this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of writing to you, hoping you will excuſe my freedom; undoubtedly it will appear ſtrange, that one you never ſaw nor heard of, ſhould take ſuch liberty. But as a foe to flattery, I juſt give you this ſhort account of my firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of you; which was only by the hearing of the ear.</p>
                  <p>'Something more than a year ago, I was told that there was a preacher juſt come to <hi>London, an American</hi> by birth, who had undertaken to preach an <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration</hi> to loſt ſouls. As it was new to me, I was much ſurpriſed at this ſtrange account, and I thought and ſaid, (though with ſome degree of candour) that I looked upon it to be ſome one that could not dig, and was aſhamed to beg, ſo to procure a living he had written this book. Here I reſted for ſome time, thinking that much hurt would be done thereby; till the laſt time I ſaw Mr. <hi>Atkins,</hi> (who I underſtand is now in connection with you) he gave me ſome further
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:025050_0033_102D759FAE6F7380"/>
account of you and your doctrine. But I could not underſtand it from his account; yet he perſiſted I ſhould believe it, if I was to read your <hi>Dialogues.</hi> I told him I would give them a fair reading, if I could ſee them. Still I entertained the ſame ſtrange idea as before. The next account I had was from a young man of <hi>Berkhampſtead,</hi> who came to ſee me, and in our diſcourſe, I ſaid, 'Some of your people have imbibed a new doctrine, I hear.' He ſaid, 'Yes, and I verily believe it a truth.' I was now more ſurpriſed than before; but he ſaid, if I was to ſee it he had no doubt but I ſhould believe it alſo. 'Well,' ſaid I 'if I could ſee the book I would lay prejudice aſide, and give it a fair read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let it be what it may.' He very kindly told me, that as ſoon as he could get it home, (for he had lent it to a friend) he would ſend it to me. I thanked him, and promiſed to read it impartially, knowing that where party ſpirit reigns, blindneſs takes place.</p>
                  <p>'According to promiſe, he ſent the book: and as I had done before, I now laid the matter before the Lord, with this petition, that he would not ſuffer me to be miſled, or wander out of the way, as I knew that he knew my deſire and intention. I was delivered from fear, and with candour and confidence I began to read my new book, and to my great aſtoniſhment, yet to my greater joy, I found what I had many times wiſhed for ſecretly in my heart, namely, the poſſibility of a releaſe for thoſe poor ſufferers, and not only ſo, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the certainty of it; for as I read on, I could not but ſee, that it was the determination of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH to make all men, as his creatures, happy in himſelf. O with what eyes did I now view the
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:025050_0034_102D75CFA4EF1FB8"/>
Deity, and what ideas did I entertain of him to what I had ever done before! (though I was on the general plan) O how my ſoul was filled with love! what gratitude did I feel to that God, who I now ſaw ſo loved all his creatures, as to give his only Son to die, with a pure deſign to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſalvation of every ſoul! I now ſaw him a God of love indeed, but it is out of my power to tell fully the happy effect it had, and has now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my mind; but it is ſomething like what I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, when the Lord firſt ſet my ſoul at liberty; as I was then ſwallowed up, as in the viſion of God. But the bigneſs of this ſheet is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to tell you all I could wiſh, but I truſt I ſhall ſee you in perſon, as I ſhould eſteem it a privilege indeed to hear you preach, and to converſe with you, and I fully intended coming to <hi>London</hi> about laſt May, on purpoſe, but as I had already a large family which, through the bleſsing of God, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with my labour; finding it likely to increaſe, I could not well ſpare time to come, or I had been with you at that ſeaſon, as I had nothing elſe in my way to hinder. Mr. <hi>John Holder,</hi> of <hi>Tring,</hi> an acquaintance of mine, has lent me a few little tracts of yours, which I am now reading with pleaſure and profit, and he has kindly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to accompany me at any time that I ſhall appoint to come and ſee you, but the ſame difficulty is now in the way as before. If ever Providence ſhould open a way, I ſhall gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the opportunity. Though I have no doubt of the truth of the doctrine of the Reſtoration, as to myſelf, I have never ſpoke of it in public as yet, not knowing whether that may be the beſt way to make this glorious ſalvation known; but I

have ſpoke to ſeveral of the people in private, thoſe whom I judged to have the beſt underſtanding, and the moſt candour; and moſt of theſe ſeem to be glad at the news, and my own wife in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar embraces it with all thankfulneſs, and joins with me in love to you and yours.

all the friends of this doctrine in theſe kingdoms. I know ſeveral other Miniſters in England, who believe and preach the <hi>Univerſal Reſtoration,</hi> and I truſt their numbers will increaſe. In <hi>America,</hi> where I once ſtood almoſt in theſe views alone, (among thoſe who ſpeak the Engliſh tongue) there are now many who teſtify this Goſpel of the free univerſal grace of God, and they have formed a connection of ſocieties on this plan, who meet by their repreſentatives in convention yearly, at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> and I could wiſh a plan of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be adopted in this country.

               <item>OBJECTION.—That the words <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eternal, &amp;c.</hi> are applied to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked 2</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—Theſe words are but ſeldom appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the miſery of the wicked; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected therewith only twice in the Old Teſtament, and but ſix times in the New; and are full as often connected with things and times that certainly have had, or will have an end, as they are with the miſery of the wicked; which cannot therefore be certainly inferred from thoſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ds being applied to it. The word <hi>forever,</hi> from which the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is derived, is frequently uſed in a limited ſenſe; more than fifty paſsages of Scripture referred to where it is evidently uſed in that manner 4 5 9</item>
               <item>Objection.—But the words <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> are applied to the miſery of the wicked; three inſtances of which are produced, which are all that can be found 10</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—This is a very ſtrong phraſe, and would be judged unanſwerable, but for certain conſiderations. 10</item>
               <item>1 If the phraſe <hi>forever and ever</hi> intends any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or periods longer than the word <hi>forever,</hi> then there muſt be a proportion, and conſequently both muſt be limited 11</item>
               <item>

2 This phraſe as applied to future miſery can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend <hi>endleſs duration,</hi> ſince a time will come, when death, pain, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be no more Page. 11</item>
               <item>3. It is more than probable that the lake of fire, in which the wicked will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the ſecond death, will be the earth diſſolved by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration; and that the new earth will be formed out of the ſame maſs, and conſequently the lake of fire ſhall at laſt be no more Page. 12</item>
               <item>4. There will come a total ceſſation of night Page. 12</item>
               <item>5. The ſame words are uſed full as often, if not oftener, for periods that muſt come to an end, as they are for the ages of future miſery Page. 13</item>
               <item>6. Unleſs we allow this phraſe, however ſtrong, to intend ages and periods, we ſhould ſet the Scripture at variance with itſelf, neither would it be poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſeveral paſſages that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Page. 14</item>
               <item>Objection.—<hi>Forever</hi> when applied to things of this life and world may end, but being applied to things of another ſtate <hi>muſt</hi> mean <hi>endleſs.</hi> Page. 15</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—The word <hi>forever</hi> applied to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and circumſtances of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate muſt not be always underſtood to mean <hi>endleſs</hi> Page. 15</item>
               <item>Objection.—But does not the phraſe <hi>forever and ever,</hi> in the New Teſtament always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>endleſs?</hi> Page. 16</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—It doth not. An undeniable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:025050_0039_102D75A4CF7D8BB0"/>
brought in proof, to which ſeveral more might have been added Page. 16</item>
               <item>Objection.—But is not the Scripture chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with a deſign to miſlead men in theſe words when applied to future miſery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they intend <hi>endleſs duration?</hi> and does the limiting theſe words accuſe Chriſt of duplicity and deceit in his threatenings? Page. 16</item>
               <item>This anſwered, by ſhewing that the Jews might make the ſame objection againſt the whole ſyſtem of Chriſtianity, which puts an end to the diſpenſation which is talled <hi>everlaſting</hi> Page. 17</item>
               <item>The Hebrew word rendered <hi>everlaſting,</hi> properly intends a <hi>hidden duration,</hi> or period, but not <hi>endleſs</hi> Page. 17</item>
               <item>Objection.—The ſame word <hi>everlaſting</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> is in the very ſame verſe applied both to the miſery of the wicked and to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the righteous Page. 19</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—The very ſame word is in other places applied to very different things, and whoſe natures and durations are entirely diſſimilar Page. 20</item>
               <item>The kingdom given by the Father to Chriſt ſhall end, and ſo alſo the kingdom giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Chriſt to his ſaints ſhall end; but this ſhall not diminiſh the glory of Chriſt, nor endanger the happineſs of the ſaints. If the kingdom of Chriſt and his ſaints ſhall end, then certainly much more the kingdom of Satan Page. 21</item>
               <item>Objection.—But upon the ſuppoſition that the doctrine of <hi>endleſs damnation</hi> was true, in what manner might one expect it to be
<pb n="xl" facs="unknown:025050_0040_102D75D58D250550"/>
expreſt in the Bible? Page. 22</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—If it was true, there could be no promiſes, intimations, or even diſtant hints to the contrary. And it is therefore ſhewn to be falſe by a number of poſitive proofs. If there were not promiſes and intimations of the <hi>General Reſtoration</hi> in the Scripture, the doctrine of <hi>endleſs damnation</hi> might be then concluded to be true, however dark; but the <hi>endleſs happineſs</hi> of the righteous is ſet forth in much ſtronger language, and with more abundant force of expreſſion. As for inſtance, St. John, who never applies the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> once in all his writings to the miſery of the wicked, uſes the word far oftener in his Goſpel alone, as connected with the happineſs of the righteous, than it is uſed in the whole Bible to expreſs the miſery of the wicked. And there are many ſtrong and powerful expreſſions made uſe of to expreſs the duration of happineſs that are never applied to miſery Page. 23 26 27 28</item>
               <item>The <hi>endleſs</hi> happineſs of the righteous ſtands upon ſuch foundations that can never be overthrown or deſtroyed; ſuch as their indiſſoluble union with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſource of life and happineſs their being heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt, and the promiſe that they ſhall live becauſe he lives; and his life is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>endleſs</hi> Page. 30 31 31</item>
               <item>Objection.—That ſince the wicked have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen evil and perſevered in it through life, it is become a fixed habit in them, from
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:025050_0041_102D75A70096C990"/>
which it would ſeem as impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, as to draw off the juſt from their attachment to God and goodneſs Page. 32</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—This reaſoning founded upon the old pagan ſyſtem of good and evil being two eternal co-exiſting principles Page. 33</item>
               <item>All men are God's creatures, and therefore he will not contend for ever, nor be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wroth with the ſouls that he hath made Page. 34</item>
               <item>Satan's kingdom and all evil ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore <hi>endleſs miſery</hi> cannot have the ſame permanent foundation as <hi>endleſs happineſs</hi> Page. 35</item>
               <item>Two things diametrically oppoſite to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot both exiſt together to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity Page. 35</item>

               <item>Objecion.—But does not the word <hi>all</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intend a part only? Page. 38</item>
               <item>Anſwered.—By giving certain never-failing rules, whereby it may be known when the word <hi>all</hi> means ſtrictly <hi>all,</hi> or the whole univerſally without any exception; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by plain inſtances out of St. Paul's writings Page. 38</item>
               <item>Objection.—That perhaps by <hi>all</hi> things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put under Chriſt, nothing farther may be meant than their being brought into a ſtate of forced ſubjection, or made ſubject to his controul Page. 40</item>
               <item>Anſwer.—They are now put under him in this

reſpect, but they are not yet put under him in the ſenſe that they ſhall be, which implies a ſtate of willing ſubjection Page. 40</item>

               <item>All things were <hi>created</hi> by Chriſt; all rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious beings ſhall be <hi>ſubdued</hi> by him, and all without exception ſhall be <hi>reconciled</hi> by him, and through him to God Page. 43</item>

               <item>Anſwer.—This objection is entirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for, though in one place he prays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively for his apoſtles, yet a little after he prays for all that ſhould believe on him, through their word; and, finally, that the world might come to believe and know that he was the true Meſſiah; which ſhall be the caſe when all believers ſhall be <hi>one,</hi> as the Father and Son are <hi>one</hi> Page. 100</item>

Fourthly, It is proved, That the doctrine of the Reſtoration is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, becauſe the belief of it tends to fill our hearts with all amiable tempers; as humility, meekneſs, univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp;c. and is calculated to deſtroy ſelfiſhneſs, envy, pride, malice, rage, &amp;c. Page. 121</item>
               <item>Fifthly, The doctrine of the Reſtoration is vindicated from the charge of licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by an appeal to facts, eſpecially by the amiable conduct of the <hi>Tunkers</hi> or German Baptiſts, in America, who univerſally hold theſe ſentiments Page. 123</item>

               <item>Anſwered.—1. By ſhewing that God doth not always lay the greateſt poſſible reſtraint upon ſin Page. 129</item>
               <item>2. The idea of limited puniſhment by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing more juſt and reaſonable to the mind, is more calculated to reſtrain ſin and iniquity than the doctrine of endleſs miſery Page. 130</item>
               <item>3. That, in fact, though the greater part have profeſſed to believe endleſs damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet their belief appears not to have much reſtrained them from ſin, Page. 131</item>
               <item>4. The great number of heathen people that die without ever hearing the Goſpel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, ideots, perſons born deaf, &amp;c. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

it probable that many are reclaimed in a future ſtate Page. 132</item>
               <item>5. That the intention of God is not ſo much to reſtrain ſin, as to ſhew its enormity; and, finally, to deſtroy it out of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe Page. 132</item>
               <item>6. If the doctrine of the Reſtoration ſhould be abuſed, that can be no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as the Goſpel itſelf has been perverted, yet is the greateſt bleſſing to mankind Page. 132</item>
               <item>Therefore it is evident that this glorious doctrine cannot juſtly be charged with the leaſt tendency towards licentiouſneſs Page. 133</item>
               <item>Objection.—It would not be prudent in God, even if he intended finally to reſtore the wicked, to let them know his gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns before hand; it is time enough to let them know his gracious purpoſes towards them, when his former threatenings have failed of their effect, but not before Page. 133</item>
               <item>Anſwered.—God has thought it the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wiſdom and prudence to make known to his ſaints this myſtery of his will, even his purpoſe to rehead all things in Chriſt.

               <item>Anſwer.— The firſt part of this objection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects only the ſtate of the body in the grave, but cannot be brought to diſprove the conſciouſneſs of the ſoul in the ſeparate ſtate, the reſurrection of the body, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of exiſtence, or the final Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Page. 168</item>

Objection. The deplorable eſtate of wicked men, their averſion to good, their love of vice, their hardneſs of heart, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every method taken to reclaim them, ſeems to render their Reſtoration an event hardly to be hoped for Page. 184</item>

               <item>4. The idea of every ſin being abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and deſerving infinite puniſhment, or endleſs miſery, entirely confounds and deſtroys all the different kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſin, and all thoſe diſtinctions which God hath made, and revealed to us in the Scriptures Page. 210</item>
               <item>5.

                  <p>Theſe texts, together, form ſuch an objection to the doctrine of the Reſtoration, that I can by no means believe it, unleſs this can be fairly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proofs brought from the Scriptures to ſhew, that the words <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> (which are tranſlations of the ſame word and ſynonimous) being connected with the puniſhment of the wicked, and their future miſery, do not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply the continuance of the ſame while God exiſts.</p>

                  <p>I am glad that you have ſo fairly and fully ſtated the matter; and I highly commend your reſolution, not to believe the <hi>univerſal doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> unleſs this can be anſwered fully, without any torturing or twiſting the Scriptures; and if I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025050_0060_102D75E80CAA7E20"/>
am not able, with God's aſſiſtance, to remove this difficulty, I will publicly recant my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But, before I come to give a direct anſwer, I would beg leave to remark how very ſeldom this word is uſed to expreſs the duration of puniſhment. We ſhould think, by ſome ſermons we hear, that <hi>everlaſting</hi> is applied to miſery in every book of the New Teſtament, if not in every chapter. A friend of mine told me, that he was once preaching in Maryland, and after ſermon a man came and aſked him, of what denomination he was? To which he anſwered, A Baptiſt. I think, ſays the man, that you do not preach up ſo much <hi>everlaſting damnation,</hi> as the Baptiſts and Methodiſts, among us, do. To which my friend replied, <hi>Everlaſting damnation</hi> is found in the Scripture. True, anſwered the man; but ſome preachers give us more of it in one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than is to be found in the whole Bible. The truth of this remark will appear, if we conſider that St. Luke, never uſes the word <hi>aionion,</hi> or <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as connected with the miſery of the wicked, in his goſpel; nor St. Mark but once, and then in a particular caſe only: In the goſpel of St. John, it is not to be found at all, in that connection, nor in any of his epiſtles: In the account of the preaching of the apoſtles through the world, in the firſt age of Chriſtianity, we do not find it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in that light, ſo much as once: No, not in all the ſermons, and parts of ſermons, which St. Luke has preſerved in the Book of the Acts: though the doctrine of <hi>everlaſting damnation</hi> is the ſubſtance of many modern diſcourſes. St. Paul never mentions <hi>everlaſting deſtraction</hi> but once, though his writings form ſuch a conſiderable part
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025050_0061_102D7617B319B5F8"/>
of the New Teſtament. Neither are ſuch words found in the epiſtle of St. James, or in thoſe of St. Peter; and but three times in the goſpel of St. Matthew: And only twice in all the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But was the word <hi>aionion</hi> applied to miſery but once, in the whole Bible, it would deſerve a ſerious conſideration; and unleſs the force of it can be removed by the authority of Scripture, it muſt remain an unanſwerable objection. But I ſhall proceed to anſwer it, by bringing an equal number of paſſages where the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is applied to <hi>things</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> that have had, or muſt have, an end. As in the following paſſages: Gen. xvii. 7, 8. 'And I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, for an <hi>everlaſting</hi> covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of Canaan, for an <hi>everlaſting</hi> poſſeſſion; and I will be their God.'

                  <p>Here note, that the land of Canaan is called an <hi>everlaſting</hi> poſſeſſion; and the covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in their fleſh, an <hi>everlaſting</hi> covenant, though it is certain that the land of Canaan, as well as the other parts of the earth muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved or melted, in the general confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:025050_0062_102D75E9AE0DFE48"/>
Of the ſame kind are the following paſſages: Gen. xlviii. 3, 4. 'And Jacob ſaid unto Joſeph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and bleſſed me; and ſaid unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thee, and I will make of thee a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people: and will give this land to thy ſeed after thee, for an <hi>everlaſting</hi> poſſeſſion.' And in the bleſſing of Joſeph, he ſays, 'The bleſſings of thy father have prevailed above the bleſſings of my progenitors, up to the utmoſt bound of the <hi>everlaſting</hi> hills.' By which, I ſuppoſe, the hills of the land of Canaan were meant.</p>
                  <p>God ſaith to Moſes, Exod. xl. 15. 'And thou ſhalt anoint them (Aaron's ſons) as thou didſt anoint their father, that they may miniſter unto me in the prieſt's office: for their anointing ſhall ſurely be an <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood, throughout their generations.' Lev. xvi. 34. 'And this ſhall be an <hi>everlaſting</hi> ſtatute unto you, to make an atonement for the Children of Iſrael, for all their ſins, once a year; and he did as JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH commanded Moſes.'</p>
                  <p>The apoſtle declares, that theſe <hi>everlaſting</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were only <hi>till the time of reformation,</hi> Heb. ix. 10. And this <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood of Aaron's ſons has ceaſed long ago: 'For the prieſthood being changed, (by Chriſt) there is, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity a change alſo of the law: For he of whom theſe things are ſpoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar: For it is evident, that our Lord ſprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moſes ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning prieſthood. And it is yet far
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025050_0063_102D7619AE859778"/>
more evident: For that, after the ſimilitude of Melchiſedec, there ariſeth another prieſt, who is made not after the law of a carnal command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but after the power of an endleſs life: For he teſtifieth, Thou art a prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec: For there is verily a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulling of the commandment going before for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs thereof.' Heb. vii. 12—18. The whole ſum of the apoſtle's argument, in this epiſtle, tends to prove, that the <hi>everlaſting</hi> ordinance is now no more; and the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> prieſthood of Aaron and his ſons, is now aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Another paſſage where the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is evidently uſed in a limited ſenſe, is, Numb xxv. 11, 12, 13. where we read thus: 'Phinehas, the ſon of Eleazar, the ſon of Aaron the prieſt, hath turned my wrath away from the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael while he was zealous for my ſake among them, that I conſumed not the Children of Iſrael in my jealouſy. Wherefore ſay, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: And he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of an <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood; becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the Children of Iſrael.'</p>
                  <p>If the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> intends <hi>endleſs duration,</hi> how ſhould we be able to reconcile this promiſe with the total ceſſation of the Levitical prieſthood? As for the family of Phinehas, with whom this covenant of an <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood was made, it was entirely deprived of the benefit of the ſame, within the ſpace of four hundred years: For when the ſons of Eli tranſgreſſed the covenant, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning it, God ſent him word, that as they had
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025050_0064_102D75EBAD748150"/>
broken it on their parts, it was entirely, and to all intents and purpoſes diſſolved. Read 1 Sam. ii. from the beginning of the 12th verſe to the end of the 17th, and from the 27th verſe to the end of chapter: And alſo, chap. iii. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>I will tranſcribe verſe 30, of the ſecond chapter, in proof of my point. 'Wherefore, JEHOVAH, God of Iſrael, ſaith, I ſaid, indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father, ſhould walk before me <hi>for ever:</hi> But now JEHOVAH ſaith, Be it far from me, for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed.' Hophni, and Phinehas, were ſoon after ſlain in one day; and Saul, the king of Iſrael, ſent Doeg, the Edomite, who fell upon the prieſts, and ſlew fourſcore and five perſons, who wore a linen ephod, in one day. 'And Nob, the city of the prieſts, ſmote he with the edge of the ſword; both men, and women, and children, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and oxen, and aſſes, and ſheep, with the edge of the ſword.' 1 Sam. xxii. 19. The whole houſe of Phinehas ſeems to have been deſtroyed at this time, except Abiathar; and when Solomon came to the throne, he thruſt him out from being prieſt, 'that he might fulfil the word of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, which he ſpake concerning the houſe of Eli, in Shiloh,' 1 Kings, ii. 27. From this time, the houſe of Ithamar had the prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo evident that the word which is tranſlated <hi>everlaſting,</hi> cannot in the nature of things, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſignify, <hi>without end,</hi> that I ſhould not think it worth while to quote any more paſſages in proof of its intending <hi>age,</hi> or <hi>ages,</hi> only, were it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed as a great objection againſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſal Reſtora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025050_0065_102D761BB57F1180"/>
or three more in particular, in this place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to a great number of others, of the ſame kind; all tending to prove the ſame thing. Hab. iii. 6. 'The <hi>everlaſting</hi> mountains were ſcattered, the <hi>perpetual</hi> hills did bow.' The goſpel is called, the <hi>everlaſting</hi> goſpel,' Rev. xiv. 6. yet it muſt ceaſe to be preached, when it ſhall be needed no longer. Jonah ſaith, 'The earth with her bars was about me, <hi>for ever:</hi> yet haſt thou brought up my life from corruption, O JEHOVAH, my God.' Jonah, ii. 6. But it would be the higheſt abſurdity upon the ſuppoſition that the word <hi>Legnolam,</hi> here rendered, <hi>for ever,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>without end,</hi> for him to ſay, that his life was brought up from corruption; and, therefore, we know that he could not uſe it in that ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, on the third day, he was delivered from his dreadful priſon. There is no doubt but the time that he was there, ſeemed an age, and, while he was thus ſhut up, there was no intermiſſion to the darkneſs, and diſtreſs, that overwhelmed him; and, therefore he might ſay, with propriety, that the earth, with her bars, was about him, for ever,' (i. e. <hi>perpetually without ceſſation</hi>) during the period he remained in the fiſh's belly; which appeared to him, as a long age indeed. But, as it would be a work of much time and labour to mention all the paſſages where the word tranſlated <hi>for ever,</hi> evidently intends only an age, or period, I ſhall juſt direct you to the following; which you may look over at your leiſure.</p>
                  <p>Gen. xiii. 15. xliii. 9. xliv. 32.—Exod. xii. 14, 17, 24. xxi. 6. xxvii. 21. xxviii. 43. xxix. 9, 28. xxx. 21. xxxi. 16, 17. xxxii. 13.—Lev. iii. 17. vi. 13, 18, 20, 22. vii. 34, 36. x. 9, 15. xvi. 29,

31, xxiii. 14, 21, 31, 41. xxiv. 3. xxv. 30, 46.—Numb. x. 8. xv. 15. xviii. 8, 19. xix. 10.—Deut. iv. 40. xv. 17. xviii. 5. xxviii. 46.—Joſhua iv. 7. xiv. 9.—1 Sam. ii. 30. iii. 13. xxvii. 12. xxviii. 2.—1 Kings, xii. 7.—2 Kings, v. 27.—2 Chron. x. 7.</p>
                  <p>Here are more than fifty paſſages, where the word rendered <hi>for ever</hi> intends only <hi>age,</hi> or <hi>ages;</hi> to which many more might be added.</p>
                  <p>Now, the rule for underſtanding words is this: What <hi>muſt</hi> be the meaning of the word, in <hi>many</hi> places, and what <hi>may</hi> be the meaning in <hi>all;</hi> is the true ſenſe of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Although the ſingle word <hi>forever,</hi> in theſe paſſages, ſeems evidently to intend certain unknown, <hi>limited</hi> periods; yet, what can you do with thoſe texts that ſay, the miſery of the wicked ſhall endure <hi>for ever and ever?</hi>

                  <p>But, do you imagine that ſuch paſſages as the following can intend leſs than <hi>endleſs miſery?</hi> Rev. xiv. 11. 'And the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up, <hi>for ever and ever:</hi> and they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name.' Rev. xix. 3. 'And her ſmoke roſe up <hi>for ever and ever.'</hi> Rev. xx. 10. 'And the devil, that deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be tormented, day and night, <hi>for ever and ever.'</hi>

                     <hi>1ſt,</hi> If <hi>for ever and ever</hi> is a longer time than <hi>for ever,</hi> which muſt be granted; then is there ſome proportion between them: Thus, if <hi>for ever</hi> intends an <hi>age, period,</hi> or ſometimes <hi>ages; for ever and ever,</hi> may intend <hi>ages,</hi> an <hi>age</hi> of <hi>ages,</hi> or <hi>ages</hi> of <hi>ages:</hi> But any <hi>proportion</hi> at all between two periods, ſuppoſes both <hi>to have an end,</hi> or there could <hi>be no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

And he that ſat upon the throne ſaid, Behold, I make all things, new. And he ſaid unto me, (John) Write; for theſe words are true and faithful.' Rev. xxi. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> I think there is ſufficient reaſon, from the words of St Peter, in his ſecond epiſtle, third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 verſes, to conclude, that as the earth was once overflowed with water, and became truly a lake of water, wherein the world of ungodly men periſhed; ſo, by the general confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, the ſame ſhall become literally the lake of fire and brimſtone, in which the wicked ſhall be puniſhed after the day of judgment: But I alſo think, that the 13th verſe of the ſame chapter, compared with Rev. xxi. 1. Iſaiah lxv. 17. lxvi. 22. more than intimates, that the new heaven and earth ſhall be created out of the ſubſtance of the old, diſſolved by the fire; that the <hi>new earth</hi> ſhall no more have a <hi>ſea</hi> therein, ſeems to imply, that in its former ſtate, it had a <hi>ſea,</hi> or why this expreſſion, 'And there was no <hi>more</hi> ſea.'—Now, if this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis is right, the following will be the true ſtate of the caſe; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:025050_0068_102D75EF07843990"/>
The lake of fire is expreſsly declared to be 'the ſecond death,' Rev. xx. 14. The earth, in its burnt, melted, and diſſolved ſtate, will be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral lake of fire and brimſtone; according to the verſes above cited from St. Peter. There will be a new heaven and a new earth, created out of the ſubſtance of the old, in which there will be no more ſea, either of water, or of liquid fire; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the lake of fire, or ſecond death, (which are declared to be ſynonimous) muſt end; and, of courſe, the puniſhment of the ſecond death muſt then ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> The <hi>ſmoke</hi> of their torment is to aſcend up <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> and they are to be tormented day and night: But, as the ſmoke of the burning earth muſt ceaſe, when its ſubſtance is entirely diſſolved or melted, and all combuſtible bodies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; and as it is intimated in Job xxvi. 10. that day and night ſhall come to an end: and in Rev. xxi. 25. it is ſaid of the New Jeruſalem, 'And the gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day, for there ſhall be no night there.' For all theſe reaſons, I cannot be altogether perſuaded, that their being tormented <hi>day and night, for ever and ever,</hi> during which time the ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall conſtantly aſcend, is quite equal to <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> eſpecially as there ſhall come a time when <hi>death</hi> ſhall be no more, <hi>pain</hi> ſhall be no more, <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhall be no more, <hi>ſmoke</hi> ſhall probably aſcend no more, and, peradventure, <hi>night</hi> ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5thly,</hi> But the great reaſon of all, why I do not conceive that <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> doth certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>endleſs duration,</hi> is, becauſe I find the words as often uſed for <hi>times</hi> and <hi>periods,</hi> that muſt have

an end, as you find them uſed for the miſery of the wicked. You bring three paſſages, which are all that are to be found in the whole Bible, where they are uſed in that ſenſe; I ſhall now invalidate thoſe evidences for <hi>endleſs damnation,</hi> by bringing an equal number of texts, where you will allow the words are uſed in a limited ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>It is certain, that when the word <hi>for ever</hi> is applied to things of this life and world, it intends <hi>a period;</hi> but when applied to ſpiritual matters, and things of another world, it muſt be <hi>endleſs,</hi> according to my judgment; and I am apt to think, you will find it ſo too.</p>

                  <p>I am certain that you will ſoon be convinced to the contrary. The apoſtle, ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſays, 'But this man, after he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one ſacrifice for ſins, <hi>for ever</hi> ſat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting till his enemies be made his footſtool," Heb. x. 12, 13. You will pleaſe to notice, that Chriſt's ſitting down in the heavens, on the right hand of God, is not a circumſtance belonging to <hi>this world,</hi> or <hi>the things of time;</hi> and he is is to ſit there <hi>for ever;</hi> and yet that period, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your hypotheſis, muſt be <hi>endleſs,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly limited by the ſacred writings: The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have received him, 'until the times (ſeaſons, or ages) of reſtitution of all things,' (that is, till the beginning, and not the ending of thoſe times) which God hath ſpoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince world began,' Acts, iii. 21. And the whole New Teſtament teacheth us, to wait for the coming of Jeſus, from heaven; (1 Theſ. i. 10.) which would be highly abſurd, upon the ſuppoſition, that he is <hi>always</hi> to abide

me to know it. The ſame objection that you make againſt the Reſtoration, the Jews make againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his religion;</hi> for they argue thus: God is an unchangeable Being, and he declared, in the moſt ſolemn manner, that the ordinances of the Levitical diſpenſation ſhould be <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and the anointing of Aaron's ſons ſhould be an <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood, throughout their generations; (See Exod. xl. 15. and Lev. xvi. 34.) and, therefore, we muſt reject the Meſſiah of the Chriſtians, as an impoſtor; inaſmuch, as he pretends to aboliſh thoſe ſtatutes, which God hath called <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and to ſet himſelf up as a Prieſt, contrary to the expreſs promiſe of the LORD, who cannot lye, nor repent, that Aaron and his ſons ſhould have an <hi>everlaſting</hi> prieſthood; and, therefore, if this is the true Meſſiah, God meant to deceive us, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed theſe <hi>everlaſting</hi> bleſſings, and privileges, which, we muſt ſuppoſe were only <hi>for a time,</hi> if Chriſtianity be true; therefore, we reject it, as being inconſiſtent with the promiſes of God.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, from this view of the matter, that the Jews reject Chriſt and his religion, upon as good ground, as you reject the univerſal Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perhaps better; for you have nothing to plead againſt the Reſtoration, but ſome threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of puniſhments, which are called <hi>everlaſting,</hi> or <hi>eternal,</hi> in our tranſlation; but they plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs promiſes of the <hi>everlaſting</hi> continuance of their church-ſtate and worſhip, in oppoſition to Chriſtianity. But, if it be true, that both the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek words, which our tranſlators have rendered by the Engliſh word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> do not intend <hi>endleſs duration,</hi> but, a <hi>hidden period,</hi> or <hi>periods;</hi> then the ground is changed at once, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025050_0074_102D75F5478041F0"/>
the Jews have no right to object againſt Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe God, promiſed a continuance of their temple worſhip, for a <hi>certain age, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, hidden period;</hi> nor the Chriſtians to reject the univerſal Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe God hath threatened the rebellious with ſuch dreadful puniſhments, which ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure through periods, expreſſed in the ſame terms. It is indeed confeſſed by ſome of the moſt learned Jews, that they have no word in their language, which abſolutely ſignifies <hi>endleſs duration;</hi> and therefore, they can only argue the <hi>endleſs</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any thing from its nature, and not merely from the words rendered <hi>for ever,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting.</hi> And, if this is the truth of the caſe, (as who can deny it?) then, neither did JEHOVAH ſpeak to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Children of Iſrael, when he promiſed them bleſſings of ſuch long continuance, which have ended long ago, and which are never to be reſtored by virtue of that covenant which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of Egypt: but by the new covenant, which he <hi>will</hi> make with them, when he ſhall return them to their own land; nor did the Son of God ſpeak to deceive, when he threatened the wicked with thoſe puniſhments, which ſhall not end <hi>till they have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the purpoſes for which it ſeems reaſonable to believe they ſhall be inflicted;</hi> viz. to bring them down, and humble their proud and ſtubborn hearts; which ſhall be done, during the periods of his kingdom, before he ſhall have delivered it up to the Father, that God may be ALL IN ALL.</p>

                  <p>But if I ſhould grant that the word <hi>aionion</hi> doth not even in the New Teſtament always ſignify <hi>endleſs duration,</hi> yet what would you gain by it, ſince it is plain that Chriſt hath ſet <hi>the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

of the righteous,</hi> and <hi>the miſery of the wicked,</hi> one againſt the other; and hath expreſſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of both, by the ſame word, <hi>aionion,</hi> in St. Matth. xxv. 46? Here, the puniſhment of the wicked, and the life of the righteous, are both declared to be <hi>aionion,</hi> or <hi>eternal,</hi> without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now, can you ſhew me any paſſage of Scripture, where the ſame word is applied to two different things, whoſe exiſtence is not the ſame, or the time of their continuance not alike?</p>

                  <p>Fairly ſtated! And, if it be not as fairly anſwered, it ſhall be looked upon as an inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable difficulty. But, happily, there is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in Hab. iii. 6. where the ſame word is uſed for very different things; 'He ſtood, and meaſured the earth: he beheld, and drove aſunder the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the <hi>everlaſting</hi> mountains were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the <hi>perpetual</hi> hills did bow: his ways are <hi>everlaſting.</hi>' In our tranſlation, the mountains, and the ways of God, are called <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and the hills <hi>perpetual;</hi> but, in the original, the word <hi>gnad</hi> is applied to the mountains, and the word <hi>gnolam</hi> to the hills, and the ways of God. But whether we argue from the original, or from the tranſlation, it makes no difference: The queſtion is, Are the mountains, or the hills, <hi>eternal</hi> in the ſame ſenſe in which the ways of God are? If ſo, the earth muſt have exiſted <hi>coeval</hi> with the ways of JEHOVAH, and the hills, and mountains, muſt never be removed, while his ways endure; and, as his ways can never be deſtroyed, the abſolute eternity, not of the earth only, but of its preſent form, its mountains and hills, muſt be inferred: contrary to Iſaiah xl. 4. xliv. 10—Ezek. xxxviii. 20.—2 Pet. iii. 7, 10, 11, 12.—Rev. xvi. 2c. xx.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025050_0076_102D75F6DB3604C8"/>
11.—Nay, even in this very text, the ways of God are ſpoken of as being of a 'different nature from the mountains, which were <hi>ſcattered,</hi> and the hills, which did <hi>bow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, no ſolid argument can be drawn from the application of the ſame word to <hi>different</hi> things, to prove that they ſhall be equal in their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, unleſs their nature be the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in the <hi>Greek</hi> New Teſtament, in Rom. xvi. 25. we read of the myſtery which hath been kept ſecret, from <hi>Chronois aioniois,</hi> and, in the 26th verſe, we find, that it is now made known by the commandment <hi>Tou aionion Theou.</hi> But muſt it be argued that becauſe <hi>aioniois</hi> is applied to times, and <hi>aionion</hi> to God; therefore, <hi>times</hi> are as ancient as JEHOVAH, and muſt continue while he exiſts? The abſurdity of this is too glaring. Our tranſlators have rendered <hi>Chronois aioniois, 'ſince the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,'</hi> inſtead 'of <hi>eternal times;</hi>' and have thereby ſhewn their judgement to be, that words cannot change the ſubjects to which they are applied, but the meaning of the words muſt be determined by the nature of the ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>In Jer. xxviii. 8. the word <hi>hegnolam</hi> is uſed in the Hebrew; but the tranſlators did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to render it <hi>'from everlaſting,'</hi> or, <hi>from eternity;</hi>' as it would have been highly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to have read, <hi>eternal</hi> prophets, or prophets which were from <hi>eternity;</hi> and have therefore ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it <hi>'of old,'</hi> though it is a ſtronger word than <hi>gnad,</hi> which they have tranſlated <hi>'eternity,'</hi> in Iſa. lvii. 15.</p>
                  <p>Many other inſtances of the like nature, might be brought; but theſe are fully ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any unprejudiced mind, that nothing can be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025050_0077_102D762675F9EAB8"/>
concluded in favour of <hi>endleſs puniſhment,</hi> from the word <hi>aionion</hi> being uſed to ſet forth the duration of it, as well as the duration of that life which our Saviour promiſes to the righteous.</p>
                  <p>But upon the ſuppoſition that our Saviour intends no more by the 'life eternal,' in the 46th verſe of the xxvth of St. Matthew's goſpel, than he doth in the 34th verſe, by 'the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.' (which it would be hard to prove) then an anſwer might be given, without all this labour, in this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> that as the Father hath appointed Chriſt a kingdom, ſo he hath alſo appointed his ſaints a kingdom; (See St. Luke, xxii. 29, 30. Rev. ii. 26, 27. iii. 21.) but as the kingdom which the Father hath given to Chriſt, as Mediator, and as Judge, ſhall <hi>end,</hi> when he ſhall have ſubdued all things, and put down all rule, and authority, and power; (See 1. Cor. xv. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.) ſo, of conſequence, that kingdom which is given to the ſaints or overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to ſubdue the nations, ſhall alſo <hi>end,</hi> when they ſhall be all ſubdued, and brought to ſubmit. But as the glory of Chriſt ſhall not be <hi>leſſened,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,</hi> when God ſhall be ALL in ALL; ſo the happineſs of the ſaints ſhall be ſo far from end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or being <hi>diminiſhed,</hi> at that period, that it ſhall then arrive at the ſummit of perfection; but ſhall never cloſe, nor decreaſe, while JEHOVAH endures.</p>
                  <p>Some time ago, a woman came to hear me, and I happened to mention in my ſermon, that Chriſt's mediatorial kingdom was called <hi>everlaſting,</hi> or <hi>ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onion;</hi> but that <hi>it muſt come to an end,</hi> when the kingdom ſhould be delivered up to the Father, when he ſhould have put down all rule, and all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025050_0078_102D75F8D246F098"/>
authority and power. After ſermon, ſhe was aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſhe liked? She anſwered, 'Not at all: he ſays, The <hi>everlaſting</hi> kingdom of Chriſt ſhall end; and I never heard of ſuch a thing before in all my life; and I am ſure it muſt be contrary to Scripture.' The perſon who aſked her, told her, that there was ſuch a text ſomewhere, ſhe could not tell exactly where to find it. But the woman perſiſted in it, that there was no ſuch text; and went away, full of prejudice. Now, had this paſſage of Scripture been in the Book of the Revelations, it would not have been ſo much to be wondered at, that ſhe had never heard of it; but when we conſider, that this is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that part of the 15th chapter of St. Paul's firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, which is in the <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſervice</hi>—what ſhall we ſay?</p>
                  <p>Thus, if <hi>Chriſt's</hi> kingdom <hi>ſhall end,</hi> much more <hi>Satan's!</hi> If <hi>rewards,</hi> as ſuch, ſhall ceaſe; how much more <hi>puniſhments!</hi> If the <hi>everlaſting</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſaints, which they ſhall poſſeſs <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> (See Dan. vii 18, 27.) ſhall end, or be ſwallowed up in that kingdom of boundleſs love, where God ſhall be ALL IN ALL; how much much more, ſhall all ſin, pain, ſorrow, and death, ceaſe, and have no more a name in God's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>

                  <p>I ſhould have a right to expect, in the firſt place, that there would be no promiſes in the Scripture to the contrary; no ſuch paſſages as theſe: 'For I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025050_0079_102D7628CCF9CAE8"/>
ſhall not return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that unto me every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear;' Iſaiah xlv. 23. Mind well, EVERY TONGUE SHALL SWEAR. Swearing allegiance, as every civilian will tell you, implies <hi>pardon, reception,</hi> and <hi>protection,</hi> on the part of the king; and a hearty <hi>renouncing of rebellion, true ſubjection,</hi> and <hi>willing obedience,</hi> on the part of the rebels. Kings of the earth may be deceived, but God cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he will never accept of any feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubjection; and therefore, all that ſwear, ſhall ſwear in truth and righteouſneſs; ſo ſhall rebellion ceaſe, and diſobedience be no more.</p>
                  <p>The apoſtle St. Paul, ſeems to quote this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture with ſome variation, in his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Philippians, chap. ii. 9, 10, 11; where, ſpeaking of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the ſame, he ſays, 'Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a a name, which is above every name; that at (<hi>or</hi> in) the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.' Now, this confeſſion appears to me to imply <hi>a willing ſubjection to the authority of the Saviour,</hi> brought about by the operation of the bleſſed Spirit; for the ſame apoſtle ſaith, Wherefore, I give you to underſtand, that no man, ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus accurſed; and no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt,' 1 Cor. xii. 3.</p>
                  <p>Then the argument, thrown into a ſyllogiſtical form, will run thus:</p>
                  <p>If every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025050_0080_102D75FB2AC57E50"/>
and thing in earth, and things under the earth; then ſhall all rebellion ceaſe.</p>

                  <p>I have, indeed, heard ſome aſſert the ſame: But as the glory of God is the ultimate end of all that he doth, we may properly aſk, why he ſhould take any pains to ſave mankind?</p>
                  <p>But, above all, there is one objection that may be brought againſt this idea, which is hard to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and that is, God hath ſaid, 'For I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025050_0081_102D762A9E1F3E20"/>
Lord GOD. Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord GOD, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael? Ezek. xviii. 23. xxxiii. 11. It is evident to me, that God muſt take pleaſure in what glorifies his name; and as he hath ſworn, that he takes no pleaſure at all in the death of the wicked, it muſt be ſet down for a truth, that <hi>puniſhment,</hi> without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reformation and ſubjection of rebels for its end, is unworthy of the Being we adore; and even now, it is called, <hi>'his ſtrange work,'</hi>and <hi>'his ſtrange act.'</hi> But to proceed: If <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery were a truth, I ſhould not expect that the myſtery of the will of God, which he hath made known unto his choſen, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, would be, 'That, in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together in one, (<hi>or</hi> rehead) all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth,' Epheſ. i. 9, 10. Far leſs ſhould I expect to find, that 'It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell; and having made peace by the blood of his croſs, by him, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all things to himſelf; by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.' Col. i. 19, 20. And I am not able to imagine, how St. John's viſion (Rev. v. 13.) could be juſt, if <hi>endleſs damnation</hi> is true, where he ſays, 'And every creature who is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.' In the nature of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025050_0082_102D75FCF36C17D0"/>
things, it appears impoſſible to me to believe theſe paſſages to be ſtrictly and literally true, if <hi>endleſs miſery</hi> be a truth: Therefore I ſay, that I ſhould not expect any <hi>intimations,</hi> far leſs <hi>abſolute promiſes,</hi> that God would deſtroy death, the works of the devil, and make all things new, with many others of the like nature.</p>
                  <p>We find it promiſed, that every knee ſhall bow: and leſt ſome might ſay, that <hi>every</hi> knee, meant only <hi>ſome</hi> knees, it is explained by the inſpired apoſtle, to mean <hi>all</hi> things in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth: and not only ſo, but every tongue ſhall <hi>ſwear,</hi> and <hi>confeſs</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; which could not be, except all were reconciled to him, whether things in heaven, or things in earth: Wherefore, this is alſo promiſed; and, in conſequence of their being ſubdued, humbled, made obedient, and reconciled, they ſhall be <hi>reheaded in Chriſt;</hi> never more to go aſtray, nor break that band of eternal union, which ſhall bind all together in one body, joined to one head; and all ſhall give never-ceaſing praiſe to God and the Lamb, <hi>world without end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As endleſs damnation appears to me to be <hi>againſt the promiſes,</hi> I cannot hold it as an article of my faith; but were there no promiſes or intimations to the contrary in Scripture, I ſhould not require it to be threatened in any ſtronger terms than it is; I ſhould believe it as a truth, though I might not be able, at preſent, to ſee the propriety and equity thereof; I ſhould never ſuffer my weak reaſon to gainſay Divine Revelation: But my difficulty ariſes from theſe expreſs promiſes of God, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo great a part of that book which is given us as a rule of faith and practice; and which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025050_0083_102D762C30D2FA48"/>
expreſsly aſſert a future ſtate of things beyond ſin, ſorrow, pain, and death of every kind; when all things ſhall be made new; and death, the laſt enemy of God, Chriſt, and man, ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſwallowed up in victory; and ſin, which is its ſting, ſhall be no more in exiſtence; and tears ſhall be all wiped away, from all faces.</p>
                  <p>But though I have acknowledged that I ſhould not dare to diſpute the doctrine of <hi>endleſs damnation,</hi> unleſs God had given <hi>intimations,</hi> and even <hi>promiſes,</hi> to the contrary; ſince I find ſeveral dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings in Scripture, in which the word <hi>aionion,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting,</hi> is joined with the puniſhment of the wicked; yet, a very little attention will ſhew us, that the felicity of the righteous is promiſed in much ſtronger language, than the miſery of the wicked is threatened, in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I remark, in the firſt place, that the word <hi>aio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> rendered <hi>everlaſting,</hi> or <hi>eternal</hi> is uſed much oftener in St. John's goſpel alone, to expreſs the continuance of the life, or well-being, of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, than it is uſed in the whole Bible, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the miſery of the wicked; and this remark is ſtrengthened by obſerving, that he never once uſes the word in his whole goſpel, nor in his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, to ſet froth the duration of puniſhment. See St. John, iii. 15, 16, 36. iv. 14. v. 24. vi. 27, 40, 47, 54, 68. x. 28. xii. 25, 50. xvii. ver. 2, 3. in all which paſſages, the word <hi>aionion</hi> is uſed to expreſs the continuance of the well-being of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>But, not to inſiſt on this: I obſerve, that there are many ſtronger expreſſions (even in our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to ſet forth the well-being of the righteous, than any that are uſed as connected with the miſery
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025050_0084_102D75FE8AE32F88"/>
of the wicked. I ſaiah, xlv. 17. we read, 'Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſhall be ſaved in JEHOVAH, with an <hi>everlaſting</hi> ſalvation; ye ſhall not be aſhamed, not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>world without end.</hi>' But where do we read, that the miſery of the wicked ſhall have <hi>no end?</hi> The word <hi>endleſs,</hi> or <hi>world without end,</hi> is never once uſed by our tranſlators, to expreſs the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of puniſhment, in the whole Bible.</p>
                  <p>We read, in 1 Pet. i. 4. of 'an inheritance, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,</hi> and undefiled; and that <hi>fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> reſerved in heaven:' and in chap. v. 4. of 'a crown of glory, that <hi>fadeth not away:</hi>' and, Heb. xii. 28. of a 'kingdom, which cannot be moved:' And our bleſſed Saviour's words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſtrong upon this ſubject, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as in St. Luke's goſpel, chap. xx. 35, 36, where he ſays, 'But they who ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the (firſt) reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, neither marry, nor are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in marriage: neither <hi>can they die any more:</hi> for they are equal unto the angels; and are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, being the children of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:' And in St. John, x. 27, 28, 29. we read thus: 'My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life: and they ſhall <hi>never periſh,</hi> neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who gave them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e, is greater than all; and none in able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.' In chap. xi. 25, 26. Chriſt ſays, 'I am the reſurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; And whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, ſhall <hi>never die.</hi>' And, in chap. vi. 50. he ſays, 'This is the bread that cometh down from heaven, that a man
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025050_0085_102D762E4461A0B8"/>
may eat thereof, and <hi>not die.</hi>' And he expreſſes the perpetuity of heavenly bliſs, and of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the ſame, by adviſing us, ſaying, 'Lay up for yourſelves treaſures in heaven; where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor ſteal. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give alms: provide yourſelves bags which wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens that faileth not; where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,' St. Matth. vi. 20. and St. Luke, xii. 32, 33. This is that which St. Paul calleth 'a better and an enduring ſubſtance,' Heb. x. 34. But what ſhall I ſay of the apoſtle's words, 2 Cor. iv. 7? 'For our light affliction, which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh for us, <hi>

                  <p>But it is not ſo much by the different words made uſe of to denote the permanency of the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the righteous, from thoſe which are uſed to expreſs the duration of the miſery of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I judge of the <hi>continuance of the one</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other; ſo much as from the different ſources from whence they flow, and of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures.</p>
                  <p>The happineſs of thoſe who are reconciled to God, ariſes from their union to Chriſt; in which if they continue grounded and ſettled during this preſent life, wherein they paſs through ſo many ſore trials, the union will become ſo permanent,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025050_0086_102D7600C6E4F038"/>
as that it will be impoſſible to diſſolve it; and the very nature of things ſhews, that if we abide firm to the end, through all difficulties, and overcome all thoſe things that would ſeek to ſeparate us from Chriſt, when we come into that ſtate where we ſhall meet with no more temptations, nor any thing that hath the leaſt tendency to draw our minds from God, we muſt, of conſequence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main attached, or united, to him, while we have an exiſtence. This doctrine was known to David; and, therefore, he ſaid, 'While I live, will I praiſe JEHOVAH; I will ſing praiſes unto my God, while I have any being,' Pſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> cxlvi. 2. civ. 33. It may be proved, that the union ſhall continue between Chriſt and his faithful ones after this life, and ſhall become indiſſoluble; and that neither 'tribulation, nor diſtreſs, nor perſecution, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nor nakedneſs, nor peril, nor ſword; neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us (who abide in him) from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord?' See Rom. viii. 35—39. See alſo St. John, xv. 4, 5, 7, 9, 10. 1 John, ii, 24—28.</p>
                  <p>The never-ending continuance of the life, or ſtate of well-being of the righteous, may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inferred, with the greateſt eaſe, from the continuance of the life of Chriſt; who is made an high-prieſt, 'not after the law of a carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but after the power of an endleſs life,' Heb. vii. 16. And he hath expreſsly declared, 'Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,' St. John xiv. 19. Thus, as long as the cauſe remains, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt continue; but the cauſe, even the life
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025050_0087_102D76304764E608"/>
of Chriſt, muſt undoubtedly continue to endleſs periods; therefore alſo, the effect, or the life of thoſe who are joined to him in an indiſſoluble uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall continue. The apoſtle Paul underſtood logic as well as any in our days: and he thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon this glorious truth; 'The ſpirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we (who are led by the Spirit of God, and have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father) 'are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together,' Rom, viii. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Now, as Chriſt, the principal heir, cannot be diſinherited; ſo, neither can thoſe who are joint heirs with him. The Holy Spirit is given us as the earneſt of our inheritance, and to ſeal us to the day of redemption, 2 Cor. v. 5. Epheſ. i. 13, 14, and iv. 30. Chriſt is the head, and the overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers through the blood of the Lamb, are the members of his body, and ſhall inherit all things; he will be their God, and they ſhall be his children: he is their life, and he 'will make them pillars in the temple of God, and they ſhall go no more out,' Rev. iii. 12. St. Paul ſays, 'When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 4. And St. John ſays, 'Behold what manner of love the Father hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but we know, that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peap, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is,' 1 John iii. 1, 2. Thus, we are ſure, from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025050_0088_102D7602DEDF88B0"/>
the Scriptures, and from the nature of things, that thoſe who are drawn by the Father, united to the Son, ſealed by the Holy Ghoſt, willingly chooſe the Lord for their portion, and conſtantly adhere to him to the end, ſhall never be ſeparated from him in the future ages; for he himſelf ſaith, 'As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me,' St. John, vi. 57. And as Chriſt is the great attracting loadſtone, that ſhall finally draw all things to him; it is evident, that he will preſerve <hi>for ever,</hi> thoſe whom he hath thoroughly drawn to himſelf, and who have adhered to him through the time of trial. Thus is the life eternal of the righteous, or their endleſs ſtate of well-being, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in much ſtronger language than the miſery of the wicked; and, moreover, has its foundation in the union between Chriſt and his church, and in the nature of things.</p>

                  <p>But if the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and thereby cauſing us to adhere to Chriſt, and to follow him through all trials, makes our union to him ſo perfect, that nothing ſhall be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from him to all eternity; ſince we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in habits of goodneſs by free choice, and by oft repeated exerciſes; why, by the ſame rule, ſhall not the miſery of the wicked be <hi>endleſs,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have choſen and adhered to evil through life, and by conſtant practice are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed therein?

                  <p>Your reaſoning would be concluſive, upon the ſuppoſition that <hi>there are two eternal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> viz. <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> if it can be proved, that evil is coexiſtent with goodneſs, that it hath always been: then, the abſolute eternity of ſin and miſery may be eaſily inferred. This is the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> and it came from the Pagan theology: The Heathens believed in <hi>two eternal principles,</hi> ever warring againſt each other, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fully prevailing; that men had the liberty of enliſting under which they pleaſed; and that thoſe who in life choſe virtue, ſhould enjoy endleſs feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; while thoſe who choſe, and adhered to vice, ſhould eternally remain under its dominion, and of conſequence be always miſerable. Thus, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal deities being judged by the poor Pagans to be as eternal as the good gods, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; they ſacrificed more to the evil principle than to the good, out of fear, and to appeaſe the anger of thoſe abhorred, malevolent agents; hence, the frequency of human ſacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the Chriſtian religion triumphed over Paganiſm in the Roman empire, many of the philoſophers embraced and profeſſed it, but withal, retained many of their Pagan notions; among which was the <hi>eternity</hi> of theſe two oppoſite princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: hence aroſe the ancient ſect of the Manichees, who believed not only the eternal exiſtence of two contrary eternal Gods, one good and the other evil; but alſo, that all viſible things were created by the devil; and upon this principle, they might argue the univerſality of damnation, with as much eaſe and certainty, as we, upon the contrary, may argue the certainty of the univerſal Reſtoration, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that glorious promiſe of God, Iſaiah, lvii. 16,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025050_0090_102D7604A616F230"/>
17, 18, 19, 'For I will not contend for ever, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I always be wroth: for the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made. For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth; and he went on frowardly, in the way of his heart. I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him, and to his mourners. I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith JEHOVAH; and I will heal him.'</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who venture to contradict their Maker, and ſay, that <hi>he will contend for ever, and be always wroth;</hi> ought to give as good a reaſon, at leaſt, why he <hi>will,</hi> as he hath given why he <hi>will not;</hi> and, conſequently, muſt prove him not to be the Father of all ſpirits, and the Creator of all ſouls: If, therefore, it can be demonſtrated, that Satan is an eternal, ſelf-exiſtent, immutable, evil being, and that he hath created all, or a part of mankind, (as ſome aſſerted formerly, and as I myſelf have heard lately) or that he hath drawn ſome of God's creatures into ſuch an union with himſelf, that they cannot be ſeparated from him; and that he will maintain his crown, throne, and kingdom, in oppoſition to God, to all endleſs duration; then, and not till then, may the <hi>eternity</hi> of ſin and miſery be concluded, from the nature of things, with equal eaſe and certainty, as the perfection and happineſs of the ſaints.</p>

And all kingdoms (not excepting that of the prince of the power of the air) ſhall be broken and deſtroyed by the kingdom of Chriſt, which ſhall itſelf be yielded up into the kingdom of boundleſs love, where <hi>judgment</hi> ſhall be no more: What ſhall we ſay of that doctrine, that teaches us the <hi>endleſs duration of evil?</hi> So far is the <hi>endleſs ſin</hi> and miſery of the wicked from being inferred from the <hi>endleſs</hi> holineſs and felicity of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the kingdom of the Father, that every proof and demonſtration of the latter, concludes equally againſt the former.</p>
                  <p>One of the firſt arguments that ever began to take hold of my mind, and to bring me to think ſeriouſly of the ſyſtem of the Reſtoration, was, what I read in a little book upon the ſubject call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. and is there thus expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>'It is as impoſſible that there ſhould be two end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs contrary things, as that there ſhould be two real contrary deities, a good God and a bad one, or two ſorts of contrary creatures, both of truly divine original, ſome being made good by God, and others bad.

duration, which, although it has a beginning, yet ſhall have no end, can only be the property of thoſe creatures, that are of divine original. For as theſe, according to the language of the ſcripture, are of divine origin, and therefore are rooted in God, or in his almighty creating power, which has no beginning, they can alſo be everlaſting, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> duration can alſo be without end in God. But whatſoever has not its eternal root in God, or in his eternal creating power, but is ſprung up in the creature in this world, by its voluntary turning away from God, and againſt his holy will, and conſequently is an abomination and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to the Moſt High, and is only ſuffered by him, ſuch as ſin, and the puniſhment depending thereon, theſe things cannot poſſibly be of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute endleſs exiſtence and duration, or remain ſo long as GOD ſhall exiſt; but muſt of neceſſity once ceaſe and be annihilated. For as God is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe creatures which he created good, and which exiſt through his will, wherein they may ſubſiſt and be preſerved without end; ſo he is on the contrary, to iniquity and ſin, (which againſt his will, is ſprung up in and ſticks to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) a conſuming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We will now ſtate ſome of the arguments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>endleſs</hi> continuance of the happineſs of the ſaints, in the kingdom of their Father; and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025050_0093_102D76366BBF14D8"/>
thoſe which prove that the ſtate of miſery ſhall come to an end</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath promiſed, that the happineſs of the ſaints ſhall have no end; becauſe <hi>his life</hi> ſhall have no end, and he is <hi>their life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The miſery of the wicked ſhall end, becauſe the kingdom of evil ſhall end.</p>
                  <p>The power of God ſtands engaged to preſerve and keep thoſe who commit themſelves to him; and thus their union with him ſhall always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is engaged to deſtroy that covenant with death, and that agreement with hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſinners are held in ſubjection to Satan, and thus to take the prey from the mighty, and the captives from the terrible.</p>
                  <p>The ſubjects of Chriſt are his natural ſubjects; he is their rightful ſovereign: but Satan's ſubjects are ſlaves, led captive by him at his will; he is an uſurper, and all that are in bondage to him belong to Chriſt, who will finally draw them all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are in bliſs ſhall be eternally attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and ſhall always chooſe that which is good; but when evil is broken, its influence ſhall no more prevail over thoſe that are captivated by it; and they ſhall feel the conſequences of ſin in ſuch a manner as to loathe it; and they ſhall heartily return, and ſwear allegiance to their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King.</p>
                  <p>There ſhall be no influence to draw the ſaints in bliſs from Chriſt, and thereby diſſolve his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but all the influence of God and goodneſs, ſhall tend to diſſolve the kingdom of darkneſs, and

to put an end to the thraldom and miſery of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I might go on with a long train of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this ſubject; but theſe may ſuffice.</p>

                  <p>But can you prove from the writings of the apoſtles, that they uſed the word ALL in this large and univerſal ſenſe?</p>

                  <p>Yes, my friend, very eaſily, and in the moſt unexceptionable manner, Hear what the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews ſays upon this matter: 'Thou haſt put ALL <hi>things</hi> in ſubjection under his feet: for in that he put ALL in ſubjection under him; he left <hi>nothing that is not put under him,</hi>' Heb. ii. 8.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that the apoſtle's reaſoning would be very inaccurate, if not entirely falſe, upon the ſuppoſition that ALL <hi>things</hi> did not intend ALL, in the largeſt ſenſe: for how would this concluſion naturally and neceſſarily follow, 'For in that he put ALL in ſubjection under him, he left <hi>nothing</hi> not put under him;' unleſs it be premiſed, that ALL is uſed in the <hi>univerſal</hi> ſenſe of the word?</p>

                  <p>Yes, truly; but it is ſuch an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as juſtifies this ſenſe of the word, more than a thouſand arguments: 'For he hath put ALL <hi>things</hi> under his feet; but when he ſaith, ALL <hi>things</hi> are put under him, it is manifeſt, that <hi>he is excepted which did put</hi> ALL <hi>things under him.</hi>' 1 Cor. xv. 27. Here God the Father being alone excepted, proves all other beings to be included in the words ALL <hi>things;</hi> and that in ſo convincing a manner, that I am aſtoniſhed that I did not perceive it long before I did.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that nothing can be plainer, than that ALL <hi>things,</hi> in theſe places, muſt mean ALL beings, except God; but then, perhaps, St.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025050_0096_102D760A6351DEC0"/>
Paul only meant, that they ſhould be ſubject <hi>to his controul,</hi> and not brought <hi>willingly to obey:</hi> If you can prove this point as clearly as you have the other, and from the ſame authority, it will ſeem to put the matter with me beyond diſpute.</p>

                  <p>This is very eaſily done; for it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged by all Chriſtians, that all things are now, and have ever been ſubject to his controul; for when he was upon earth, in his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtate of humiliation, even the unclean ſpirits, the moſt rebellious of beings, obeyed his word; which made thoſe who ſaw his miracles cry, with amazement, 'What thing is this? what new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean ſpirits, and they obey him,' St. Mark, i. 27. The devils obeyed him univerſally, in whatever he commanded them; and could not enter into the ſwine without his permiſſion; and how diſagreeable ſoever his words were to them, they were <hi>forced</hi> to comply, without daring to complain; yea, they frequently ſeemed like hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuppliants; and once we read, they went ſo far as to adjure our bleſſed Lord not to torment them: See St. Mark, v. 7. The winds, waves, fiſhes, all obey him; all diſeaſes, and even death itſelf, heard his voice, and departed at his bidding; and to his diſciples he ſaid, All power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth,' Matth. xxviii. 18. and certainly now, he is at 'the right hand of God, angels, and authorities, and powers, are made ſubject unto him,' 1 Pet. iii. 22. God hath exalted him far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named; not only in this <hi>age,</hi> (for ſo I render the word <hi>aio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church," Epheſ. i. 21, 22. But, as though the apoſtle had known that the ſenſe would be diſputed, he hath ſaid, 'But now we ſee <hi>not yet all things put under him,</hi>' Heb. ii. 8. All things were ſubject to his controul, <hi>even on earth;</hi> and they cannot be leſs ſo, now he is exalted to heaven, to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was; and yet, many years after his aſcenſion, the apoſtle ſays, 'But now we ſee not <hi>yet</hi> all things put under him;' by which he muſt certainly mean their being <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubject</hi> unto him; for, in all other ſenſes, all things are <hi>now</hi> put under him, in the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited manner, as we have ſeen already. But the apoſtle goes on to tell how far the important work is accompliſhed, and that a ſure foundation is laid for its entire completion; ſaying, 'But we ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he, by the grace of God, ſhould taſte death for ALL;' (for ſo the word <hi>pantos</hi> ought to be rendered.) There was anciently a manuſcript in uſe, in which the words were <hi>choris Theou</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>chariti Theou,</hi> that is, <hi>for all,</hi> EXCEPT GOD. And there is little doubt of its being the true ſenſe; becauſe St. Paul makes the ſame exception, with reſpect to thoſe who are put under Chriſt, as we have before noted, 1 Cor. xv. 27.</p>
                  <p>Then the apoſtle adds, 'For it became him, for whom are <hi>all things,</hi> and by whom are <hi>all things,</hi> in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,' Heb. ii. 9, 10.</p>

Inſtead of the word <hi>all</hi> intending only <hi>a part,</hi> we find, in ſeveral places, that the word <hi>many</hi> intends <hi>all,</hi> as in Rom. v. 15, 16, 19. 'For if through the offence of one, <hi>many</hi> be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto <hi>many.</hi> The free gift is of <hi>many</hi> offences unto juſtification. For, as by one man's diſobedience <hi>many</hi> were made ſinners; ſo, by the obedience of one, ſhall <hi>many</hi> be made righteous.' Iſaiah liii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, 12. 'By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify <hi>many</hi> (or <hi>the</hi> many) for he ſhall bear their iniquities. And he bare the ſins of <hi>many</hi> and made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.' Theſe <hi>many</hi> are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>all,</hi> in the 6th verſe: <hi>All</hi> we, like ſheep have gone aſtray; we have turned every one to his own way: and JEHOVAH hath laid on him he iniquity of us <hi>all.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>But, to return to our ſubject: St. Paul aſſures us, that though <hi>all things,</hi> without exception, are put under him, in <hi>one</hi> ſenſe; yet in <hi>another,</hi> he ſays,' But now we ſee not yet <hi>all things</hi> put under him.' But he leaves us not in the dark about the matter; but ſpeaks of that effectual 'working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue <hi>all things</hi> unto himſelf,' Phil. iii. 21. And when <hi>all things</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſubdued</hi> unto himſelf, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put <hi>all things</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, that God may be ALL IN ALL,' 1 Cor. xv. 28. Here we plainly find, a very neceſſary diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between all things being <hi>put under him;</hi> and all things being <hi>ſubdued unto him,</hi> the former is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, in the fulleſt manner; and the latter <hi>ſhall</hi> be as perfectly and as fully accompliſhed, in due time: 'Becauſe the creation itſelf ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know, that the whole creation groaneth and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in pain together, until now,' Rom. vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Though what hath already been ſpoken, may ſeem more than enough to prove the point reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>all;</hi> yet there is one paſſage more, full to the purpoſe, that I would not omit; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of itſelf, fully ſufficient to ſettle the diſpute for ever:— The apoſtle, ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, 'Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt-born of <hi>every creature:</hi> for by him were <hi>all things</hi> created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; <hi>all things</hi> were created by him, and for him: and he is before <hi>all things,</hi> and by him <hi>all things</hi> conſiſt. And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead: that in <hi>all things</hi> he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould <hi>all</hi> fulneſs dwell; and having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him, to reconcile <hi>all things</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf; by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven,' Col. i. 15—20.</p>
                  <p>As the word <hi>all</hi> is generally acknowledged to be uſed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The words of our Saviour, recorded by St. Mark, chap. ix. 43—49, form a very ſerious, and to me an unanſwerable objection againſt the univerſal Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>'And if thy hand offend thee (<hi>or</hi> cauſe thee to offend) cut it off: it is better for thee to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell; into the fire that never ſhall be quenched (<hi>or</hi> that is unquenchable): where their worm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and the fire is not quenched.

                  <p>Here our Lord repeats five times, that 'the fire is not, or never ſhall be quenched, or is unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;' words of nearly ſimilar meaning: Three times he ſpeaks of hell, as a <hi>place</hi> where 'their worm dieth not:' and, to ſhew the perpetuity of the ſufferings of the miſerable, he ſays, 'For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall be ſalted with fire;' <hi>i. e.</hi> preſerved by the fire, as ſalt preſerves meat.

And ſeven months ſhall the Houſe of Iſrael be burying of them, that they may cleanſe the land.' (See Ezek. xxxix. 4, 5, 11, 12.) 'And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is left of all the nations which came againſt Jeruſalem, ſhall even go up, from year to year, to worſhip the King, JEHOVAH, of Hoſts, and to keep the feaſt of tabernacles.'

It is alſo intimated by Ezekiel, that a fire ſhall be kindled, to burn their weapons of war, &amp;c. which ſhall laſt for ſome time. Hear his words: 'And they that dwell in the cities of Iſrael ſhall go forth, and ſhall ſet on fire and burn the weapons, both the ſhields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand-ſtaves and the ſpears; and they ſhall burn them with fire ſeven years: ſo that they ſhall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the foreſts; for they ſhall burn the weapons with fire.' See Ezek. xxxix. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I endeavoured to give the plain ſenſe of the text to which our Lord alluded; and I have not the ſmalleſt doubt of its being hereafter literally fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>I will now endeavour to give what appears to me the meaning of the text before us:—Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> threatened that thoſe who would not deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cut off thoſe things that led them into ſin, ſhould hereafter ſuffer infinitely greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, by being caſt into hell fire. And, Oh! who can conceive how dreadful a portion is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to ſome tranſgreſſors! that they 'ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſhall be tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up ages of ages; and they have no reſt, day nor night.' Rev. xiv. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as the enemies of God, who ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed near Jeruſalem, ſhall have their carcaſes expoſed, full of worms, and be an abhorring unto
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025050_0106_102D766574B721E8"/>
all that behold them; ſo thoſe who are caſt into the burning lake, ſhall be publicly expoſed to ſhame, and ſhall ſuffer openly for their crimes; and the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend up <hi>continually,</hi> during thoſe ages that the lake of fire, or the ſecond death, ſhall continue.</p>
                  <p>But when I conſider that this terraqueous globe itſelf is probably to become the lake of fire, when the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; and yet after that dreadful ſcene is paſt, the earth itſelf ſhall be renewed, and become the habitation of righteouſneſs; I can hardly have any doubts, but all the rational part of the creation, 'ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.' See Rom. viii. 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus, if the lake of fire, or ſecond death itſelf, ſhall be deſtroyed, ſhall ceaſe, and be no more; there is an <hi>end</hi> to <hi>tormenting pain;</hi> though, perhaps, ſuch <hi>inward reflections,</hi> ſhall continue for ſome time longer, (if not to eternity) which, though they ſhall tend exceedingly to increaſe the love of God in the ſouls thus delivered, ſhall fill them with ſhame, ſimilar, or perhaps more pungent than we feel here on earth, when we are melted under a deep ſenſe of our manifold tranſgreſſions, and of the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of God at the ſame time.—This ſeems to me to be the meaning of ſuch paſſages as theſe:</p>
                  <p>'O my God, make them like a wheel; as the ſtubble before the wind. As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame ſetteth the mountains on fire; ſo perſecute them with thy tempeſt, and make them afraid with thy ſtorm. Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;

                  <p>'They ſhall be aſhamed, and alſo confounded, all of them: they ſhall go to confuſion together, that are makers of idols, ' Iſa. xlv. 16. 'And all are incenſed againſt him, (JEHOVAH) ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, ' verſe 24.</p>
                  <p>'For thus ſaith Adonai JEHOVAH; I will even deal with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the oath in breaking the covenant.

                  <p>But when God ſays, that a fire ſhall not be quenched, does it not neceſſarily imply, that it ſhall never ceaſe burning?</p>

                  <p>By no means: for we read in ſeveral places of Scripture of fires that have ceaſed, ages ago, that were ſpoken of in as ſtrong terms as are uſed by Chriſt, reſpecting the fire of hell.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance: In Lev. vi. 13. we read, 'The fire ſhall ever be burning upon the altar: it ſhall <hi>never</hi> go out.' This is a much ſtronger expreſſion than if it had been ſaid, 'It ſhall not be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;' for it is ſaid, <hi>'It ſhall never go out:'</hi> But ſurely, it muſt be uſed with ſome limitation; for for we know that it hath ceaſed, ages ago: And we read, that Daniel propheſied of the Meſſiah, that he ſhould 'cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe,' Dan. ix. 27; but it would certainly have been a weak argument againſt Daniel's prophecy, that as Moſes had ſaid, The fire ſhould never go out upon the altar, therefore the Meſſiah could never cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe; but it would be juſt as good an argument againſt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel's prophecy, as the words of Chriſt are againſt Iſaiah's: 'For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made. I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of

my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, That unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear. Surely ſhall ſay, In JEHOVAH have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength; to him ſhall come; and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,' Iſa. lvii. 16. xlv. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>In Jer. xvii. 27. we read: 'But if you will not hearken unto me, &amp;c. then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it ſhall devour the palaces of Jeruſalem, and <hi>it ſhall not be quenched.</hi>' See alſo chap. iv. 4, xxi. 12. Amos v. 6. 2 Kings xxii. 17.</p>
                  <p>Similar threatnings we find poſitively pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Ezekiel, at the command of God: 'More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the word of JEHOVAH came unto me ſaying, Son of man, ſet thy face towards the ſouth, and drop thy words towards the ſouth, and propheſy againſt the foreſt of the ſouth field, and ſay to the foreſt of the ſouth, Hear the word of JEHOVAH; Thus ſaith Adonai JEHOVAH, Behold I will kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire in thee, and it ſhall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame ſhall not be quenched, and all faces from the ſouth to the north, ſhall be burnt therein; and all fleſh ſhall ſee that I JEHOVAH have kindled it; <hi>it ſhall not be quenched.</hi>' Ezek. xx. 45, 46, 47, 48. See alſo Jer. vii. 20.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe threatnings were ſurely executed; for the people did not hearken to God: he did certainly kindle a fire, and it burnt, and was not quenched, but conſumed Jeruſalem and all her palaces; and the beautiful foreſts that were ſo much eſteemed, ſhared the ſame fate: But what perſon will argue, that the whole city and country muſt be now in flames; and muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025050_0110_102D76695EFAE498"/>
from the days of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, becauſe of theſe expreſſions, 'The flaming flame ſhall not be quenched,' &amp;c. ſince we know that Jeruſalem, and the country round about, have been ſince inhabited, and will be again, in a more glorious manner than ever?</p>
                  <p>Neither will it help the matter to ſay, that we muſt underſtand the fire <hi>figuratively,</hi> for the anger of God, &amp;c. for he declares by Zechariah, after the ſeventy years captivity, that he was 'returned to Jeruſalem <hi>with mercies.</hi>' See Zech. i. 16. And though the preſent deſolation of that land is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, Deut. xxix. 23—28. And Ezekiel not only ſpeaks of it as deſolate and waſte, but as having been always ſo; though we know it was formerly filled with inhabitants: (See Ezek. xxxvi. 34, 35, xxxviii. 8.) Yet all the prophets ſpeak of a time to come, when it ſhall be much more flouriſhing than ever it hath been; and Iſaiah ſays, 'Whereas thou haſt been forſaken and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Thou ſhalt no more be termed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; neither ſhall thy land be termed Deſolate; but thou ſhalt be called Hephzibah <hi>(my delight is in her)</hi> and thy land Beulah <hi>(married);</hi> for JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH delighteth in thee, and thy land ſhall be married,' Iſaiah lx. 15. lxii 4.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may ſee, by theſe and many other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that predictions apparently directly contrary one to the other, may be all fulfilled upon the ſame land, people and perſons; only allowing a proper time to each, without which we can never make ſenſe of many prophecies.</p>

Iſaiah, ſpeaking of the land of Bozrah, ſays, 'And the ſtreams thereof ſhall be turned into pitch, and the duſt thereof into brimſtone: and the land thereof ſhall become burning pitch. It ſhall not be quenched, night nor day; the ſmoke thereof ſhall go up for ever: from generation to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſhall lie waſte; none ſhall paſs through it, for ever and ever. But the cormorant and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſhall poſſeſs it; the owl alſo, and the raven, ſhall dwell in it:' (birds that cannot live in fire, pitch, and brimſtone, any better than men.) 'And thorns ſhall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortreſſes thereof: and it ſhall be an habitation for dragons, and a court for owls. The wild beaſts of the deſart ſhall alſo meet with the wild beaſts of the iſland, and the ſatyr ſhall cry to his fellow: the ſcreech-owl alſo ſhall reſt there, and find for herſelf a place of reſt. There ſhall the great owl make her neſt, and lay and hatch, and gather under her ſhadow: there ſhall the vultures alſo be gathered, every one with his mate. Seek ye out of the book of JEHOVAH, and read: no one of theſe ſhall fail, none ſhall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his Spirit it hath gathered them. And he hath caſt the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they ſhall poſſeſs it for ever, from generation to generation ſhall they dwell therein,' Iſaiah xxxiv. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Now, in this paſſage, there are ſuch things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as are impoſſible to be fulfilled at once, without as great a miracle as was wrought for the three children in the furnace; and which there is no reaſon to expect will be wrought in favour of

cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, dragons, ſatyrs, wild beaſts, thorns, nettles, and brambles. In the 10th verſe we read of a period, called <hi>for ever,</hi> wherein this land is to be on fire and is not to be quenched, night nor day: and the ſmoke of it is to aſcend up <hi>for ever;</hi> but in the 17th verſe, it is ſaid, that the before-mentioned birds and beaſts ſhall poſſeſs it <hi>for ever,</hi> even from generation to generation ſhall they dwell therein. But one of theſe periods muſt end, before the other can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; the fire muſt ceaſe to burn, and the ſmoke to aſcend, before beaſts can take up their conſtant dwelling there, and birds can lay and hatch, and gather their young ones under their ſhadow, and enjoy the ſociety of their mates. And thus the whole prophecy may be fulfilled; not in the <hi>ſame,</hi> but in <hi>different</hi> periods: And thus alſo, may all the threatenings, and all the promiſes, in the ſacred book, be accompliſhed; not at once, but each in their ſeaſon.</p>

                  <p>As to the expreſſion of being <hi>ſalted with fire,</hi> as <hi>every ſacrifice was ſalted with ſalt;</hi> I am not ſo clear, what might have been our Saviour's intent in this expreſſion; but I think, in the firſt place, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

                  <p>Had thoſe <hi>unquenchable</hi> fires never gone out while earth endured, or while time laſted, there might have been ſome force in this argument; but ſince the continuance of the fire does not depend upon the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> in which it is kindled, but upon the <hi>combuſtibles</hi> that feed and ſupport it, this can be no objection: Therefore, ſince thoſe unquenchable fires that have been mentioned, were kindled on earth, and yet not burn while earth laſted, but have gone out long ago; there is no neceſſity of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025050_0114_102D766CF94C9058"/>
granting, (even though we ſhould admit your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the fire of hell being kindled in eternity) that the unquenchable fire of the burning lake <hi>muſt</hi> unavoidably burn to <hi>all eternity,</hi> merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuppoſed to belong to that ſtate: But if puniſhments only belong to thoſe ages of ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſhall reſign the kingdom to the Father, and the lake of fire ſhall be this terraqueous globe, diſſolved, or melted, with fervent heat; then the ground is changed, and the whole objection va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes of courſe.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall bring my objection from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſtate it with the utmoſt preciſion that I am able:—It is the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, of which our Saviour ſpeaks in the moſt awful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſaying, 'Wherefore I ſay unto you, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall (<hi>or</hi> may) be forgiven him; but whoſoever ſpeaketh
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025050_0115_102D763DABBD6B10"/>
againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world (<hi>or</hi> age) neither in the world (<hi>or</hi> age) to come. Verily, I ſay unto you, all ſins ſhall (<hi>or</hi> may) be forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies wherewith ſoever they ſhall blaſpheme: but he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs, (<hi>or</hi> hath not forgiveneſs to the age) but is in danger of eternal damnation,' St. Matth. xii. 31, 32. St. Mark, iii. 28, 29. This is ſuch a matter of importance, that three of the evangeliſts notice it. St. Luke hath it thus: 'And whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall (<hi>or</hi> may) be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; but unto him that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven,' St. Luke, xii. 10. St. Matthew ſaith, this ſin ſhall not be forgiven in this world, nor in that to come; St. Mark, that ſuch an one hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation; and St. Luke poſitively ſaith, it ſhall not be forgiven: And, to confirm the matter ſtill more, if poſſible, St. Paul ſaith, 'For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they ſhall fall away, (<hi>or,</hi> and have fallen away) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again to repentance; ſeeing they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. For if we ſin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes's law, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025050_0116_102D766EF93635B0"/>
mercy, by the mouth of two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit of grace?' Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6, x. 26, 27, 28, 29. And the ſame Apoſtle directs us, ſaying; 'Looking diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God; leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Leſt there be any fornicator, or profane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat ſold his birthright. For ye know how that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected; for he found no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though he ſought it with tears.' Heb. xii. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>And St. John, the beloved diſciple, ſays; 'If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall aſk, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin unto death: I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it,' 1 John v. 16.</p>
                  <p>Now here is a ſin for which there is no forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither in this world (<hi>or</hi> age) or in that to come; which ſhall not be forgiven at all; he that committeth it hath never forgiveneſs, is in danger of eternal damnation; he cannot be renewed again to repentance, becauſe he hath crucified Chriſt to himſelf afreſh, and hath put him to an open ſhame: having ſinned wilfully and maliciouſly, after receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge of the truth, to ſuch no more ſacrifice for ſins remaineth; judgment and fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation are his certain portion, he is an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025050_0117_102D763FA8F0F118"/>
and muſt be devoured: a ſorer puniſhment than death without mercy awaits him, of which he is worthy, for that he hath trodden under foot the Son of God, the only Saviour, and hath count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the precious blood of the covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, and which alone is able to cleanſe from ſin, an unholy thing; and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of grace, which is only able to renew the heart, and therefore the caſe of ſuch muſt be deſperate; for if ſuch an one, like Eſau, ſhould wiſh to repent and gain what he had loſt, it could not be, for he would find no place for repentance, though he might ſeek it carefully with tears; for having committed the ſin unto death, for which no prayer is to be made, no interceſſion offered up, he is bound over to the ſecond death, the lake of fire and brimſtone, and muſt bear the puniſhment of his ſins for ever and ever!!!—What ſay you to this?</p>

                  <p>As when Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel his dream, he was aſtoniſhed for one hour at the greatneſs of the puniſhment which he ſaw would inevitably come upon the King; much more muſt all thoſe be, who read and conſider theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatenings, which muſt ſurely come upon all thoſe who have ſinned in the manner deſcribed! I ſhall make a few obſervations upon theſe moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible paſſages of Scripture; partly to prevent fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds from falling into deſpair, that may ſee them collected in one ſtriking view; partly to cure proud minds of preſumption; and partly to ſhew that the doctrine of the Reſtoration may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, notwithſtanding.
<list>
                        <item>1. We are ſure that the Scribes and Phariſees of our Saviour's time, who blaſphemouſly aſcribed
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025050_0118_102D767090BA7C68"/>
his miracles to the power of the devil, did, in the moſt direct and undeniable manner, commit that ſin; and ſome are doubtful whether it can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by any in theſe days.</item>
                        <item>2. It is generally acknowledged, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews were in danger of committing that ſin, by openly and wilfully apoſtatizing from Chriſtianity, and publicly renouncing Chriſt and his ſalvation, and blaſpheming againſt the Holy Ghoſt, after having been partakers of its extraordinary gifts.</item>
                        <item>3. It cannot be committed by ignorant perſons, nor without a conſiderable degree of malice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; light in the underſtanding, and malice in the heart, are neceſſary ingredients of this dreadful crime; and it appears to me, it muſt be committed openly, and that it cannot be committed in thought only.</item>
                        <item>4. Under the Levitical diſpenſation there were many unpardonable ſins—crimes that could not be forgiven or overlooked, and for which no atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be made, and which were puniſhed with death, without mercy; other crimes, unleſs ſacrifices were offered, and repentance took place, ſubjected the parties to death alſo; but, under the goſpel, there is but one crime that is properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, and that abſolutely ſubjects the perſon guilty of it to the ſecond death; yet many other ſins are threatened with the ſame puniſhment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, but they may be forgiven, and not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at all; but this one muſt as certainly be puniſhed with the ſecond death, as murder or any other crime, was by the law of Moſes puniſhed with the death of the body without mercy or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. <hi>Forgery</hi> is the unpardonable ſin of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: people frequently ſuffer death for other
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025050_0119_102D764138F47D78"/>
crimes, as well as this; but other offences are ſometimes forgiven, but this never; it is always puniſhed with death. This circumſtance may il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate my meaning. The ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is an offence of that kind, that, either owing to its uncommon malignity (as is moſt likely,) or ſome other cauſe, expoſes the guilty perſon to the age of judgment, from which he cannot eſcape by repentance, pardon, and ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt, as other ſinners may; neither can he be at preſent born of the Spirit, to which he hath done deſpite; nor can he be reclaimed by any poſſible means, in this age, or in the age that is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this, but is inevitably bound over to ſuffer the inconceivable torments of the ſecond death, or lake of fire and brimſtone, after the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                        <item>5. There is no kind of diſpute between us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the certainty of the puniſhment of ſuch; in this we both agree: he that ſinneth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is in danger of eternal damnation, or judgment, or the ſecond death:—The queſtion is, Shall there ever come a time, when the ſecond death, or lake of fire, ſhall no more exiſt? If this can be proved, the concluſion will be evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that not one ſhall remain under the power thereof to all eternity: Upon this, and this alone, depends the ſolution of this awful, intereſting, and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion: and I conſider all other anſwers as mere quibbles, compared with this. And if it cannot be proved that a time will come, when all that bears the name of death ſhall be deſtroyed, thoſe who commit the ſin unto death, muſt, at leaſt, be allowed to ſtand as exceptions to the general rule; and, I am apt to think, the rule itſelf will
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025050_0120_102D7672224B3490"/>
be overthrown. I ſhall therefore labour this point a little; and if I ſhould be ſo happy as to prove to your ſatisfaction the total deſtruction of death, it will anſwer many other objections as well as this. My only refuge is Scripture; if that fails me, I ſhall not preſume to purſue the ſubject farther.</item>

                  <p>Iſa. xxv. 8. 'He will ſwallow up <hi>Death</hi> in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and Adonai JEHOVAH will wipe away tears from off all faces.' Hoſ. xiii. 14. 'I will ranſom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death, O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, (<hi>or</hi> hell) I will be thy deſtruction: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhall be hid from mine eyes.' 1 Cor. xv. 26. 'The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is <hi>Death</hi> '—or rather, as the words may more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be arranged, <hi>'Death,'</hi> the laſt enemy, ſhall be deſtroyed.' The ſecond death is infinitely more the enemy of man than the firſt, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be conſidered as an enemy which God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.—Now,</p>
                  <p>If the laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, there will not be one left.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt is true; therefore alſo the laſt. As,</p>
                  <p>Would it not be highly abſurd to ſay, that, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the very laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, yet, many millions ſhall remain to all eternity?</p>
                  <p>Verſe 56. 'The ſting of <hi>Death</hi> is ſin.' While ſin remains in exiſtence, death will be able to ſhew its ſting; but the time will come when death ſhall have no ſting to boaſt of; therefore ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently death of every kind, ſhall be deſtroyed. 1 John iii. 8. 'For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.' Unleſs Chriſt finally deſtroys the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025050_0121_102D764310312440"/>
works of the devil, even all ſin out of the univerſe, his purpoſe muſt be eternally fruſtrated:</p>
                  <p>But the laſt can never be; therefore the firſt is true.</p>
                  <p>Heb. ii. 14. 'Foraſmuch, then, as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame; that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.'—Now what death has the devil power over? the death of the body? or that of the ſoul, which conſiſts in enmity againſt God, and ſeparation from him? 'To be carnally minded is death; but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace. Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,' Rom. viii. 6, 7. If this death, with the conſequence of it, is that which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath the power of, then muſt this death be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>But, I think, the firſt is true; therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Rev. xxi. 4. we read, 'And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there ſhall be no more <hi>Death,</hi> neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things are paſſed away.' Here is a ſtate ſpoken of beyond all death; a ſtate wherein, ſorrow, crying, and pain ſhall be no more. This ſtate is cotemporary with the new heaven and earth, after the lake of fire hath ceaſed.</p>

                  <p>We have always underſtood this paſſage to relate to the death of the body, and even to the death of the righteous only; but making this ſtate cotemporary with the new heavens and earth, ſeems to throw a new light upon the ſubject.</p>

                  <p>Moſt certainly the word <hi>Death</hi> here implies the ſecond death; for we are informed, in the foregoing chapter, of the firſt reſurrection, even that of the martyrs, who were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God; and ſuch as had not worſhipped the beaſt and his image, neither had received his mark in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, or in their hands; then we read of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years between this reſurrectien, and the reſt of the dead living again: after this, we find, that the dead, ſmall and great, ſtood before God, and were judged; and ſuch as were not found written in the book of life, were caſt into the lake of fire, which is expreſsly called 'the ſecond death;' which as before obſerved, is probably the earth in its melted ſtate. In this chapter we find, that all things are to be made new; and <hi>Death</hi> is to be no more, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither any more pain. But this muſt be the ſecond death, or lake of fire; for the reſurrection of all the bodies, both of the juſt and unjuſt, had been ſpoken of before.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as all ſin, and all that bears the name of death, ſhall be entirely deſtroyed at laſt; the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of endleſs miſery ſeems to fall to the ground, or, at leaſt, cannot be certainly proved from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rather the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The time muſt come when all things ſhall be ſubject to Chriſt, when he ſhall deſtroy death, the laſt enemy, by deſtroying ſin, which is the ſting of death; ſo this dreadful ſin, as well as others, ſhall be no more. For if this was not to be the caſe, it never could be true, that 'where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound:' for it never would abound quite ſo much; neither would death and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025050_0123_102D76456341C5A8"/>
hell be ſilent when God ſhall aſk the great queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 'O death where is thy ſting? O grave, (<hi>or</hi> hell) where is thy victory?' for death could ſay, Here is my ſting, that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which muſt endure to all eternity, and which even divine grace ſhall never deſtroy; I have, therefore, the victory and dominion over theſe ſinners who have committed it, and will hold it while God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf exiſts. Then death could never be deſtroyed, nor ſwallowed up in victory; neither would ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, crying, and pain ceaſe; neither could God ever be ALL IN ALL, in any other ſenſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, than he is now; nor would <hi>every tongue ſwear;</hi> neither would all things wholly be made new, nor all the former things ever paſs away! neither could the univerſal chorus of praiſe ever be ſung by every creature, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and throughout God's wide domain; and, finally, many Scriptures would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeem to be fulfilled, in the fulleſt ſenſe. Rom. v. 20, 21. 'But where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as ſin hath reigned unto death; even ſo might grace reign, through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.' Now, if grace ſhall abound more than ſin, it ſhall be as univerſal, and more powerful: But the firſt is true; therefore alſo the laſt. If grace ſhall be as extenſive as ſin, and more powerful, all who have ſinned ſhall be reſtored: But the firſt is true; therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
                  <p>What conſequences muſt follow from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that ſome of God's creatures ſhall always remain his enemies! Either God created ſome to be miſerable to endleſs ages, or muſt be fruſtrated
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025050_0124_102D767481EB2A48"/>
eternally in his deſigns, or all muſt be reſtored at laſt, and made happy by love and free love.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is blaſphemous, the ſecond is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God: therefore, the third muſt be true: For I cannot think of a fourth concluſion.</p>

                  <p>What do you think of the deplorable caſe of Eſau, 'who, for one morſel of meat, ſold his birthright; and afterwards, when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully, with tears?'</p>

                  <p>He certainly loſt, or rather ſold, his birth-right; in conſequence of which, he loſt the bleſſing belonging to the firſt-born: But leſt any ſhould be led to conclude from this, that poor <hi>Eſau</hi> had no bleſſings at all, the ſame apoſtle informs us, that, 'By faith, Iſaac bleſſed Jacob and Eſau, concerning things to come," Heb. xi. 20.

                  <p>Yes, moſt certainly: But then this love and hatred, ſo called, was manifeſted to their poſterity, and not to their perſons, in the manner deſcribed by the prophet: 'I have loved you, ſaith JEHOVAH: yet ye ſay, Wherein haſt thou loved us? Was not Eſau Jacob's brother? ſaith JEHOVAH: yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Eſau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waſte, for the dragons of the wilderneſs.' This manifeſtation of hatred did not affect the eternal ſtate of their ſouls, but their condition in this world: God declared, that Jacob's ſeed ſhould exiſt: as a diſtinct people to the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025050_0125_102D7646F1443E60"/>
end of time, but that Eſau's ſhould not: and this difference is evident; for the remains of Eſau's ſeed were, in the days of the Maccabees, incorporated with the ſeed of Jacob, and exiſted no more for ever, as a nation by themſelves. From Jacob's race the Meſſiah was to come, and all nations were to be bleſſed in the ſeed of Iſrael. In all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and in many others, there was a manifeſt preference of Jacob to Eſau; but nothing like po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive hatred can be intended.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſays, (St. Luke, xiv. 26.) 'If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.' But we cannot ſuppoſe our Lord intended poſitive, but comparative hatred; according to St. Matth. x. 37. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth ſon or daughter more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me.'</p>

                  <p>I believe, that with <hi>man</hi> it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but with God all things are poſſible: And I believe, that Jeſus Chriſt was not only able to paſs, but that he actually did paſt that gulph, which was impaſſable to all <hi>men,</hi> but not to him: And he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures St. John, that he had paſſed it, and not only ſo, but that he had the keys of the ſame in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; for he ſaith, 'Fear not, I am the firſt and the laſt; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and death.' And St. Peter informs us; that 'Chriſt once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, (that he might bring us unto God); being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit; by which alſo he went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon; who ſometime were diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, when once the long ſuffering of God waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,' And he alſo tells us, that we 'ſhall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. For, for this cauſe was the goſpel preached alſo to them that are dead,' (in diſtinction from them that are quick) 'that they might be judged according to men in the fleſh, but live according to God in the ſpirit.' See Rev. i. 18. 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19, 20. iv. 5, 6.</p>

He actually journeyed to the place of confinement, <hi>and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>each<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſpirits,</hi> &amp;c. He preached <hi>the goſpel</hi> no doubt, not to men in the body, but to <hi>the ſpirits,</hi> to thoſe in a diſembodied ſtate; not only ſo, but to <hi>the ſpirits in priſon:</hi> Had they not been in the priſon, Chriſt would not have gone into the priſon to preach to them. But, who were theſe ſpirits? St. Peter informs us, that they are thoſe who were <hi>ſometime diſobedient;</hi> but this expreſſion intimates, that the time is perfectly paſt; as, 'Ye <hi>were</hi> the ſervants of ſin: for when ye <hi>were</hi> the ſervants of ſin, ye <hi>were</hi> free from righteouſneſs,' Rom. vi. 17, 20. St. Peter tells us when they were diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; <hi>when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing:</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:025050_0128_102D76781820E140"/>
Here he evidently diſtinguiſhes the two periods of their viſitation; one is called the preaching of Chriſt, by his ſpirit, after he was put to death in the fleſh; and the other is called the long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, which waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing. The long-ſuffering of God waited upon them, before they were drowned, while the ark was building; but Chriſt preached to them when they were ſpirits in priſon. They were diſobedient to God's long-ſuffering; but it is not certain that they were ſo when Chriſt preached to them; but the contrary is intimated in theſe words: <hi>'For, this cauſe was the goſpel preached alſo to them that are dead,'</hi> &amp;c. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend thoſe that are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> dead only, but thoſe whoſe bodies are dead; becauſe we here find <hi>the dead</hi> ſet in oppoſition to <hi>the quick,</hi> or thoſe whoſe bodies are alive, and not thoſe that are <hi>ſpiritually alive;</hi> for we may obſerve, that whenever the words <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead</hi> occur, by <hi>quick,</hi> we always underſtand thoſe whoſe bodies are alive; and by <hi>dead,</hi> thoſe who have ceaſed to exiſt here.</p>
                  <p>Acts, x. 40, &amp;c. St. Peter, in his ſermon to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius and his family, informed them of Jeſus, who was ſlain, whom 'God raiſed from the dead, and ſhewed him openly: not to all the people, but unto witneſſes, choſen before of God; even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he roſe from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtify, that it is he, who was ordained of God to be the judge of <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead.</hi>' And St. Paul ſays to Timothy, I charge thee, therefore, before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the <hi>quick</hi> and the <hi>dead</hi> at his appearing, and his kingdom;
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025050_0129_102D764ACBD8CA88"/>
preach the word,' &amp;c. See 2 Tim. iv. 1. So, in 1 Pet. iv. 5. the words <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead</hi> are uſed in the ſame manner; and then immediately, while the idea is warm in our minds, the apoſtle gives us the reaſons why the goſpel was preached to <hi>the dead,</hi> (<hi>or</hi> the ſpirits in priſon) of which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore informed us, and now repeats again, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that it was, <hi>that they might be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to men, in the fleſh;</hi> or, as though they had heard it while they were alive in the fleſh: but alſo, that they might <hi>live according to God, in the ſpirit.</hi> The goſpel not only <hi>was,</hi> but <hi>is,</hi> preached to them that are dead, in a <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe. It need not have been ſaid; <hi>For, for this cauſe was the goſpel preached</hi> ALSO <hi>to them that are dead,</hi> if only the ſpiritually dead are intended; for it is rarely preached to any other but ſuch. Why ſhould it be ſaid, <hi>that they might be judged according to men in the fleſh,</hi> if they were men in the fleſh at the time when it was preached to them?</p>
                  <p>This paſſage proves the exiſtence of the ſoul after the death of the body: for unleſs the ſouls of the antedeluvians exiſted after the drowning of their bodies, Chriſt could not have preached to them in priſon: But the <hi>dead</hi> being oppoſed to the <hi>quick</hi> in this paſſage, ſufficiently, and even inconteſtibly, determines the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>With a little attention, we may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that Chriſt was not only deſigned to be a Covenant of the people, (meaning the Jews) and a Light to the Gentiles; which two deſcriptions comprehend all the living: but alſo, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon-houſe; which (if it
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025050_0130_102D767BF18569F8"/>
be not a repetition) muſt intend the <hi>dead,</hi> as all the <hi>living</hi> were mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>'And he ſaid, It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the ends of the earth. Thus ſaith JEHOVAH, In an acceptable time have I heard thee and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee: and I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the earth, to cauſe to inherit the deſolate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritages.' Thus far the Redeemer's work ſeems li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the earth, and reſpects the living: But the prophet goes much farther, and ſays, 'That thou mayeſt ſay to the priſoners, Go forth: to them that are in darkneſs, Shew yourſelves: they ſhall feed in the ways, and their paſtures ſhall be in all high places. They ſhall not hunger, nor thirſt neither ſhall the heat nor ſun ſmite them; for he that hath mercy upon them ſhall lead them, even by the ſprings of water ſhall he guide them.' See Iſaiah, xlii. 6, 7, xlix. 6, 8, 9, 10. Compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Rev. vii. 14, 15, 16, 17. The work of the Saviour, as deſcribed by the elegant pen of Iſaiah, (chap. lxi. 1, 2, 3.) ſeems to comprehend a great variety of particulars; all which he hath performed already, or ſhall execute in due time.</p>
                  <p>'The Spirit of Adonai JEHOVAH is upon me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe JEHOVAH hath anointed me, (1) to preach good tidings to the meek: (2) He hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted; (3) to proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the captives, (4) and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound: (5) To proclaim the acceptable year of JEHOVAH, (6) and the day
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025050_0131_102D764CC6B1B308"/>
of vengeance of our God: (7) To comfort all that mourn: (8) To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them, <hi>Firſt,</hi> beauty for aſhes; <hi>Secondly,</hi> the oil of joy for mourning; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs: that they might be called, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The planting of JEHOVAH; (<hi>and</hi> ALL <hi>for this great end</hi>)—that he might be glorified.'</p>
                  <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his proceſs, hath laid a foundation for the recovery of all men; 'For to this end Chriſt both died, roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord, both of the dead and living,' Rom. xiv. 9. He paſſed through all our ſtates, that he might redeem us. He came down from Heaven—he was conceived in the womb of Mary—he was born of her—he lived in the world unknown —he ſympathized with us in our ſorrows—he bare our ſins in his own body, on the tree—he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried—he deſcended into <hi>Hades</hi>—He aroſe—aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —ſitteth at the right hand of God—and maketh continual interceſſion for us.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed neceſſary, that our Saviour ſhould viſit men in all ſituations, that he might redeem them. The apoſtle informs us, ſaying, 'Foraſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame: that through death, he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them, who, through fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage,' Heb. ii. 14, 15. It was not only neceſſary that he ſhould die, to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh death, and to redeem us from its power; but it was equally needful for him to go into thoſe places, where ſpirits were confined in the regions of darkneſs, that he might gain univerſal domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025050_0132_102D767DB948FA60"/>
ſpoil principalities, and redeem the captives whom he had bought with his blood, in order that he might aſcend up to Heaven, and open to his followers the gates of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>'Wherefore he ſaith, When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he aſcended, what is it but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth? He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things,' Epheſ. iv. 8, 9, 10. 'And having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it,' Col. ii. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thus our Saviour by his divine proceſs, hath obtained a right to open the priſon doors, and let the captives go free: and though the rich man was in torments, where he could not get a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool his tongue, and had <hi>judgment without mercy,</hi> becauſe he had <hi>ſhewed no mercy;</hi> yet it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that, by the blood of the covenant, he may be ſent forth out of the pit wherein is no water. See Zech. ix. 11. The Lord Jeſus is able to take the prey from the mighty, and to deliver the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful captive, Iſa. xlix. 24.</p>
                  <p>'Such as ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in affliction, and iron; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they rebelled againſt the words of God, and contemned the counſel of the Moſt High; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.'— This evidently points out the deplorable, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of ſinners, cut off in their ſins; having rebelled againſt God's words, and contemned his counſels; for which reaſon he hath ſhut them up
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025050_0133_102D764EC5E77598"/>
in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death; in ſuch a ſituation, that no power but his own, can give them the leaſt help, much leſs <hi>releaſe.</hi> Such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſeldom occur in this life; but theſe words are a lively and affecting deſcription of the miſeries of the future ſtate.</p>
                  <p>'Then they cried unto JEHOVAH in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he ſaved them out of their diſtreſſes. He brought them out of darkneſs, and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and brake their bands in ſunder. O that men would praiſe JEHOVAH for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for his wonderful works to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men! For he hath broken the gates of braſs, and cut the bars of iron in ſunder,' Pſal. cvii. 10—16.</p>
                  <p>This amazing deliverance ſeems to be deſcribed in ſuch language, as correſponds much better with the deliverance of the ſpirits from their dreadful priſon, than with any temporal mercies that are beſtowed on mankind <hi>here on earth.</hi> 'The righteous ſhall ſee it, and rejoice; and all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall ſtop her mouth: Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving kindneſs of JEHOVAH,' ver. 42, 43.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the Divine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and ſee his deſigns of mercy towards his creatures, ſhall rejoice in the ſame: They that are wiſe, ſhall obſerve theſe things, and ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his loving kindneſs; and that 'JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works,' Pſal. cxlv. 9.</p>
                  <p>Thus, how impoſſible ſoever it might appear to us, that the rich man ſhould ever be delivered, we muſt remember, that 'with God nothing ſhall
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025050_0134_102D767F55F907D0"/>
be impoſſible,' St. Luke i. 37. 'Is there any thing too hard for JEHOVAH?' Gen. xviii. 14. 'Behold (ſays he) I am JEHOVAH, the God of all fleſh: Is there any thing too hard for me?' Jer. xxxii. 27.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour ſays, (St. Matt. xix. 24, St. Mark x. 25. St. Luke xviii. 25.) 'It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.' Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word here uſed, intends a camel or a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it certainly implied the greateſt difficulty imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, even amounting in the view of his diſciples, to a natural impoſſibility, or they would not have been as the evangeliſt expreſſes it, <hi>exceedingly amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſtoniſhed out of meaſure</hi> at his words, ' ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among themſelves, Who then can be ſaved?' But, though Jeſus meant to repreſent the matter as in itſelf a kind of natural impoſſibility, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible to men; yet he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereby, that it never ſhould be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he immediately adds, 'With men, this is impoſſible; but not with God: For with God all things are poſſible,' St. Mark x. 27. Therefore, though it was impoſſible for <hi>men</hi> to paſs the gulph between <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and <hi>Gehenna;</hi> yet, as we have ſeen, Chriſt was able, and therefore as we know not the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of his power to ſave, we cannot poſitively conclude <hi>againſt the Reſtoration,</hi> from this inſtance of the rich man, unleſs we could find ſome paſſages of Scripture, where God has promiſed never to reſtore, or to reconcile ſuch to himſelf, whom he hath once caſt off: the contrary to which, I think, may be proved: but I am at preſent conſidering, that, in the nature of things, it is not impoſſible for God to reſtore the rich
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025050_0135_102D76508B1887C8"/>
man, if he ſo pleaſes; and, conſequently, others that are in the ſame ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Behold the rich man in another world!—He ſeems <hi>now</hi> to have much more true benevolence in him, than in his life-time; for when he could not obtain a drop of water for his tongue, he pleads much more earneſtly for Lazarus to be ſent to his five brethren, to teſtify to them, leſt they alſo ſhould come into the ſame place of torment with himſelf. Here he urges the matter moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and does not ſeem willing to be denied. This ſhews him not to have been ſo loſt to virtue as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; ſince he and his angels, though miſerable themſelves, ſeek to make all men ſo too, though their torments are increaſed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, that Abraham called the rich man, <hi>'Son,'</hi> and bade him remember, that in his life-time he had his good things: and likewiſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, evil things; and that therefore it was but reaſonable that the ſcene ſhould be changed: that Lazarus ſhould be comforted, and he tormented. And I think, nothing can be fairly argued from his caſe, in favour of <hi>endleſs damnation:</hi> For in caſe he was doomed to ſuffer <hi>while God exiſts,</hi> there could be no proportion between the ſufferings, torments, and evil things of Lazarus on earth, and thoſe which <hi>he</hi> endured in hell; whereas it is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the Scriptures, that all things are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by number, weight, and meaſure. Let us hear what our Lord has ſaid upon the ſubject. St. Luke xii. 47, 48. 'And that ſervant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY ſtripes. But he that knew not, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025050_0136_102D76815F1A8A28"/>
FEW ſtripes: for unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will aſk the more.' But what difference, ſo much to be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, could there be, if both were to be beaten <hi>to all eternity?</hi> or how could either be ſaid to have FEW, if there never was to be an end?

All this appears juſt and reaſonable: But to ſuppoſe a poor ignorant Heathen, or a child of ten years old, will remain in miſery as long as the moſt perſecuting Tyrant, or apoſtate Chriſtian, ſeems to contradict all the ideas we have of juſtice and equity, as well as of goodneſs; for in this caſe, who can ſuppoſe that each one is exactly rewarded according to his works?

St. Mark, xiv. 21. If Judas ſhould ever be reſtored, how could the Saviour ſay, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born?' I think you wil find it difficult to remove this objection; for, if he is ever to be happy, (though after many ages) it will be good for him that he was born.</p>

                  <p>I cannot think that this is ſo ſtrong an argument againſt the general Reſtitution, as moſt that uſe it imagine. It was a common proverb among the Jews, when any great misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to a man, or his family, to ſay, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.' And thus our Saviour uſed it with great propriety reſpecting Judas: for who, that thinks with any reaſon at all, would not have wiſhed that he had never been born, rather than to have betrayed the dear Redeemer?</p>

                  <p>But can any thing leſs than <hi>endleſs</hi> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be ſufficient to juſtify the expreſſion of 'Good were it for that man, that he had never been born?'</p>

                  <p>I am of opinion that even worldly troubles (ſhort as they are) may ſufficiently juſtify the expreſſion. There are a thouſand circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into which the children of Adam fall, that make their caſe infinitely worſe than though they had never been born, even without ſuppoſing a ſtate of future puniſhment at all. I had rather, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, never have been born, than to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Chriſt, even upon the ſuppoſition that I had never been doomed to ſuffer for it beyond this life. Job, when he had loſt his ſubſtance, his children, and his eaſe, opened his mouth, and, through exceſs of grief curſed the day of his birth: though it does not appear that he had any fear of future damnation, but the reverſe.</p>
                  <p>'And Job ſpake, and ſaid, 'Let the day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh wherein I was born; and the night in which it was ſaid, There is a man-child conceived. Let that day be darkneſs; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light ſhine upon it. Let darkneſs and the ſhadow of death ſtain it; let a cloud dwell upon it: let the blackneſs of day ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify it. As for that night, let darkneſs ſeize upon it: let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. Lo! let that night be ſolitary; let no joyful voice come therein. Let them curſe it that curſe the day, who are ready to raiſe up their mourning. Let the ſtars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it ſee the dawning of the day; becauſe it ſhut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid ſorrow from mine eyes. Why died I not from the womb? Why did not I give up the ghoſt, when I came out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025050_0139_102D7654767DD058"/>
me? or, why the breaſts that I ſhould ſuck? For now ſhould I have been ſtill, and been quiet; I ſhould have ſlept; then had I been at reſt, with kings and counſellors of the earth, who built deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late places for themſelves; or with princes, that had gold, who filled their houſes with ſilver: Or, as an hidden, untimely birth, I had not been; as infants, who never ſaw light. There the wicked ceaſe from troubling; and there the weary be at reſt. There the priſoners reſt together: they hear not the voice of the oppreſſer. The ſmall and great are there; and the ſervant is free from his maſter,' See Job, iii. 2—19.</p>
                  <p>From this diſcourſe, it ſeems, that Job thought it would have been better for him never to have been born, than to have fallen into ſuch fore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in this preſent life, without taking the other into his account; but if he had known that he had been doomed to ſuffer the amazing torments of the ſecond death, in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, what would he have ſaid? Even upon the ſuppoſition that it was only to laſt for ages, he would have thought that his being born into this world, to be fitted for ſuch a puniſhment, would have been the greateſt curſe that could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him.</p>
                  <p>If Job, who could ſay, 'I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day upon the earth: And, though after my ſkin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for myſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another; though my reins be conſumed within me. He knoweth the way that I take; and when he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as gold. My foot hath held his
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025050_0140_102D7684F941F580"/>
ſteps; his way have I kept, and not declined; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I gone back from the commandment of his lips: I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more than my neceſſary food. Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He alſo ſhall be my ſalvation. My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go: my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.' (See Job, xix. 25, 26, 27. xxiii. 10, 11, 12. xiii. 15, 16. xxvii. 6.) And who could make ſuch a ſolemn proteſtation of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and uprightneſs, before God and man, as we find in the xxix. xxx. xxxi. chapters of that book. If ſuch a man had reaſon to ſay, 'Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then, haſt thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh! that I had given up the ghoſt, and no eye had ſeen me! I ſhould have been as though I had not been; I ſhould have been carried from the womb to the grave,' (See Job x. 18, 19.) with what amazing propriety might Chriſt ſay of Judas, the traitor, who ſinned in ſuch a dreadful manner, and had ſuch horrible guilt on his conſcience: who died in black deſpair, periſhed in ſuch an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſituation, in his ſins, and, probably, by his own hands: who ſuffered the moſt violent agitations of mind, died under the power of the horrid ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the great enemy of men, without one ſmile, or look of forgiveneſs, from Jeſus, or even daring to ſeek it; whoſe ſorrow in this life far exceeded Job's, (for Job had no ſenſe of guilt, treaſon, and ingratitude; nor was he filled with rage, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and deſpair)—and who muſt probably have his portion in the ſecond death;—'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born! even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025050_0141_102D76567615D340"/>
on the ſuppoſition that his torments are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to continue <hi>while God exiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeremiah is another inſtance much to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; who wiſhed that he had never been born, even at the very time when he knew the Lord was his helper; only becauſe he had been put in the ſtocks by Paſhur, and had ſuffered a little pain and ſhame in a good cauſe. He was not afraid of <hi>end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs damnation,</hi> nor yet of any future puniſhment: for he thus expreſſed himſelf, in all the language of full aſſurance; 'But JEHOVAH is with me, as a mighty terrible One: therefore, my perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors ſhall ſtumble, and they ſhall not prevail; they ſhall be greatly aſhamed, for they ſhall not proſper; their everlaſting confuſion ſhall never be forgotten. But, O JEHOVAH of Hoſts, that trieſt the righteous, and ſeeſt the reins and the heart, let me ſee thy vengeance on them (<hi>or,</hi> thou wilt let me ſee, &amp;c.) for unto thee have I opened my cauſe. Sing unto JEHOVAH, praiſe ye JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH: for he hath delivered the ſoul of the poor from the hand of evil doers. How ſtrong his faith! how full his aſſurance! Yet it is evident, that he thought it would have been much better for him, perſonally, never to have been born; for he immediately adds, 'Curſed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be bleſſed. Curſed be the man who brought tidings to my father, ſaying, A man child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that man be as the cities which JEHOVAH overthrew, and repented not: And let him hear the cry in the morning, and the ſhouting at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide; becauſe he ſlew me not from the womb: or that my mother might have been my grave: and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025050_0142_102D7686F37EDC80"/>
her womb to be always great with me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came I out of the womb, to ſee labour and ſorrow, that my days ſhould be conſumed with ſhame?' See Jer. xx. 11-18.</p>
                  <p>Here is not a word about a ſtate of future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, much leſs <hi>endleſs damnation,</hi> and yet the good prophet Jeremiah thought, that if he had never been born, it would have been far better for him.</p>

                  <p>I muſt confeſs, I never before conſidered it poſſible to anſwer this objection; you have done much towards ſolving it: but you muſt conſider, that both Job and Jeremiah paſſionately exclaimed, and, through ſorrow, uttered ſuch raſh words, as, in their cooler moments, they repented of; and therefore, what they ſpake of themſelves cannot wholly ſet aſide the objection. Had they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe expreſſions as general truths, and declared, that men had much better never have been born, than to have ſuffered ſuch degrees of worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, it would have more than anſwered the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, when men under grief exclaim in ſuch a manner, we cannot ground a matter of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance upon what they ſay reſpecting themſelves; as their minds, being overwhelmed with trouble, and the immediate ſenſations of pain, are biaſſed, and cannot utter the calm dictates of ſober reaſon. But Chriſt, though under great ſorrows himſelf, ſaw the caſe of Judas ſo deplorable, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf thus reſpecting him; which was the ſober truth, without exaggeration; and could this be ſaid of him, or of any other of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, upon the ſuppoſition that miſery is not abſolutely endleſs?</p>

                  <p>We do not find that Job or Jeremiah ever recanted, in their cooler moments, what they uttered in their ſorrows; and our Lord, ſpeaking of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, ſays, 'And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give ſuck in thoſe days,' See St. Matth. xxiv. 19. St. Mark, xiii. 17. Not becauſe of their future, endleſs damnation, in diſtinction from others; but on account of their preſent trouble and ſorrow; as is explained, Luke xxi. 23. 'But, woe to them that are with child, and to them that give ſuch, in thoſe days: for there ſhall be great diſtreſs in the land, and wrath upon this people.' And when the Saviour was led to death, we read, 'And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who alſo bewailed and lamented him. But Jeſus, turning unto them, ſaid, Daughters of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but for yourſelves, and for your children. For behold the days are coming, in the which they ſhall ſay, Bleſſed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck. Then ſhall they ſay to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do theſe things in a green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?' St. Luke, xxiii. 27—31.</p>
                  <p>And who would not, a thouſand times, chooſe rather never to have been born, than even to ſee, far leſs experience, the miſeries which came upon Jeruſalem and its inhabitants? Would it not have been better for mothers never to have been born, than to have killed and eaten their own children in the ſiege? And would it not have been better for the children never to have been born, than to have been food for their mothers?</p>

But Solomon not only repreſents a ſtate of great miſery and affliction in this life, as worſe than not to have been born, but alſo, a ſtate of the greateſt proſperity, if it ends in diſgrace; for he ſays, 'If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, ſo that the days of his years be many, and his ſoul be not filled with good; and alſo, that he have no burial; I ſay, that an untimely birth is better than he. For he (the untimely birth) cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkneſs; and his name ſhall be covered with darkneſs. Moreover, he hath not ſeen the ſun, nor known any thing: this hath more reſt than the other. Yea, though he live a thouſand years twice told, yet hath he ſeen no good:' (<hi>i. e.</hi> no equivalent good, to balance his diſgrace). 'Do not all go to one place?' All came from duſt, and turn to duſt again. See Eccleſ. vi. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate here deſcribed by Solomon, is not only infinitely better than the damnation of hell, though limited by certain periods; but far preferable to many, if not to moſt ſituations of men in this life: and yet he prefers an untimely birth to a man who lives more than twice the age of Methuſelah, and has an hundred children of his own, if he has not his ſoul filled or ſatisfied with good; and that he hath no burial, or has not honour, (credit, <hi>or</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation) at his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Long life</hi> and <hi>many children,</hi> were formerly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed as the greateſt of bleſſings: but as the things of this life cannot fill the ſoul with good; ſo a man had better never have been born, than to have enjoyed the good things of this world in the greateſt profuſion, if he dies in diſgrace, and has no burial, or is not honoured at his death. Yet,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025050_0145_102D765A0007C448"/>
this is not worthy to be named in the ſame day with the damnation of hell; yet, is frequently threatened as a great and terrible judgment; which, if it falls upon a man, however he may have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed long life, health, wealth, and all kinds of proſperity; it makes it worſe for him than if he had never been born, according to the deciſion of God himſelf; and, therefore, no wonder that Chriſt ſaid of wicked Judas; 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.'</p>
                  <p>Though I have anſwered you ſo largely, yet one word might have ſufficed to have anſwered the whole objection at firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> Had Judas died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had been born, and periſhed from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's womb, he would never have ſinned, far leſs betrayed Chriſt; he would have entered into peace immediately, 'where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary are at reſt:' In that caſe, he would have eſcaped the judgment that came upon him, and would have had more reſt than thoſe who ſhould live in all the affluence of life two thouſand years, and beget each an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred children, and yet ſhould not be honoured at their death.</p>
                  <p>Some would have anſwered the objection ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by ſaying, Chriſt promiſed twelve thrones to his twelve apoſtles, among whom Judas was one; and therefore, he muſt be reſtored, or the promiſe cannot be fulfilled: See St. Matth. xix. 28. But this I do not inſiſt upon; nevertheleſs, thoſe who anſwer the objection this way, make an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may be worth attention; <hi>viz.</hi> that Peter, ſpeaking of Judas, ſaith, 'Let his habitation be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and let no man dwell therein;' that is, Let
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025050_0146_102D768ABB145420"/>
his manſion be reſerved for him, let no man take poſſeſſion of it; but 'His biſhopric, or office, let another take.' See Acts, i. 20. compared with Pſal. lxix. 25. cix. 8. But I am rather of opinion that the deſolation of the habitation of the wicked, and the want of inhabitants in their tents, reſpects this ſtate, and is part of the curſe pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all traitors; and may therefore in an eminent ſenſe, be applied to Judas, and alſo to the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious nation of the Jews at large; and therefore, as theſe words do not intend their Reſtoration, ſo neither are they any objection to it; for St. Paul applies part of the lxixth Pſalm to the Jews, as truly as St. Peter applies it to Judas: See Rom. x. 9, 10. And yet he ſays, 'I ſay then, Have they ſtumbled, that they ſhould fall? God forbid: But rather, through their fall, ſalvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealouſy. Now, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulneſs?' And thus, form the 11th verſe to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, goes on to ſpeak of their being again received, reconciled, and grafted again into their own olive tree; and that their blindneſs is only for a time: 'And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved: There ſhall come out of Sion a deliverer, and ſhall turn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs form Jacob:' That God's covenant, or promiſe, is to take their ſins away; that they are beloved for the fathers ſakes; that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance; that, therefore, they ſhall obtain mercy at laſt; and that, for this very purpoſe, God hath concluded them all (<hi>or</hi> ſhut them up) in unbelief, that he might
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025050_0147_102D765BCB547B70"/>
not only puniſh them thereby for their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and alſo, through their unbelief, cauſe the the Gentiles to obtain mercy and ſalvation; but alſo, that he might have mercy upon all thoſe whom he had thus ſhut up in unbelief, without exception. See the whole chapter.</p>
                  <p>Here, then, are three deſigns, worthy of a God of infinite wiſdom, power and goodneſs, in this one dark diſpenſation, the rejection of the Jewiſh church and nation:—1. That he might puniſh them for their iniquity:—2. That others might come in their room, ſtand in their office, and be made partakers of their privileges: and 3. That they might be reſerved to mercy and forgiveneſs at laſt. And what happened to a whole nation of traitors, might happen to an individual of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>

'And the ſerpent ſaid unto the woman, Ye ſhall not ſurely die:' and that it is a doctrine calculated to give encouragement to the wicked to continue in their evil ways; that it is 'ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace;' and that this doctrine is as dangerous as that of the wicked propheteſſes of Ezekiel's time, of whom GOD ſays, 'With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad; and ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he

ſhould not return from his wicked way, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him life. They ſay unto them that deſpiſe me, JEHOVAH hath ſaid, Ye ſhall have peace; and they ſay unto every one that walketh after the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own heart, No evil ſhall come upon you,' Jer. viii. 11.

                  <p>It is ſaid, that it is the nature of God to lay the higheſt poſſible reſtraint upon ſin, and, therefore, he has threatened it with eternal, or <hi>endleſs</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and this is even found too weak to prevent the prevailing of iniquity.

Would not the reſtraints be wholly taken off from the luſts and paſſions of the wicked, if once this doctrine ſhould become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent? Will you be ſo kind as to give a fair and candid reply to this objection?</p>

                  <p>This objection is ſtated with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, I ſhall, therefore endeavour to anſwer it as well as I can; putting in this caveat, that if I ſhould not anſwer it to your ſatisfaction, do not imagine that no ſolid anſwer can be given; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to my not being ſufficiently maſter of my ſubject, or not being able to expreſs my mind ſo clearly as I could wiſh. As this objection is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made, and often uſed, by people who mean well, but have not conſidered the ſubject thoroughly, I ſhall be as explicit as poſſibly I can upon it.</p>
                  <p>I would firſt obſerve, that the great truths, or firſt principles, upon which the Reſtoration is founded, and form which it is derived by natural and eaſy conſequences, are far from tending to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs:
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025050_0151_102D76BD1825CEF8"/>
But, in order to make this evident, it will be proper here to ſet them down in their order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt Principles, upon which the Doctrine of the final and univerſal Reſtitution is founded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. GOD <hi>is the univerſal and only creator of all:</hi> contrary to the opinion of the <hi>Manichees</hi> of old, who believed the <hi>devil</hi> to be the creator of moſt, if not all viſible beings: The <hi>Mugglet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> lately, aſſert nearly the ſame ſentiments; contrary to Rev. iv. 11. Col. i. 16. Pſal. c. 3. Numb. xvi. 22. Iſai. lxiv. 8. Ezek. xviii. 4. Zech. xii. 1. and a vaſt number of other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Now, who can ſay, that this noble thought, which St. Paul enlarges upon ſo beautifully, (Acts, xvii. 24—30.) tends, in the leaſt, to make men wicked? Does it not tend to dignify and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble human nature, to be told, that GOD is our Father, Creator and Firſt Cauſe; and that we were made by his power, according to his will, and for his pleaſure; and that the <hi>chief end</hi> for which he made us, was, <hi>to glorify his name, and to enjoy him for ever?</hi>—as the Aſſembly's Catechiſm beautifully declares. This is one of the principles from which GOD himſelf deduces the certainty of the final end of wrath, as I have obſerved before:—'For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made,' Iſai. lvii. 16.—Thoſe who venture to contradict their Maker, and ſay, that he <hi>will contend for ever, and be always wroth;</hi> ought to be able, at leaſt, to give as good
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025050_0152_102D7690C1C63D28"/>
a reaſon why <hi>he will,</hi> as he has aſſigned why <hi>he will not;</hi> and conſequently prove, that he hath <hi>not made all ſouls;</hi> which is the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which endleſs miſery muſt be founded, and the only doctrine which is perfectly conſiſtent with it.</p>
                  <p>The poor untutored <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> argued (with a miſſionary that was ſent from <hi>Sweden</hi> to convert them) from the univerſal providence of GOD, that he, who was ſo kind a Father as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their bodies all things needful, had not wholly neglected their ſouls: But this I do not inſiſt upon, though, I think, the argument has weight in it; and, certainly, the providential good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, and his long-ſuffering, tends to lead men to repentance: Rom. ii. 4. 2 Pet. iii. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The univerſal benevolence of the Deity,</hi> or the <hi>love</hi> of GOD to his creatures, is one of the firſt principles from which the general Reſtoration is deduced: and who can ſay, that this leads to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs? If thoſe who believe that GOD loves them, in particular, find <hi>that</hi> conſideration the ſtrongeſt obligation on them to love him again, and to obey his will; by the ſame rule, if all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the whole human race, were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that GOD loved each one of them, would not the ſame cauſe produce the ſame effect? And if ſo, can this be charged as a licentious doctrine, which is expreſsly grounded upon a cauſe which power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully operates to produce holineſs? Is there any thing like argument in this reaſoning: I know that GOD loves me, and ſeeks to do me good; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I muſt hate him. What ſhould we think of a woman who ſhould leave her huſband, and do all in her power againſt him, and ſhould be able
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025050_0153_102D76BF296657C8"/>
to give no better reaſon for it than the following: My huſband loves me, and I know it, and he has always loved me, and always will; and, therefore, I am determined to hate, ridicule, deſpiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him, and have left him for this very cauſe, and am determined never to love or obey him more? Bad as human nature is, I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch inſtances often occur. We commonly ſay, that love begets love: 'We love him, becauſe he firſt loved as;' ſays the Apoſtle, 1 John, iv. 19. Therefore, the doctrine of GOD'S univerſal <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> cannot lead to licentiouſneſs, in any light in which it can be viewed; for, if he really loves us, he will do all in his power to bring us to love him again, and to be like him; and I am ſure, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his love to us, goes as far as moral ſuaſion can go, to induce us to love him again, nay, the belief of it is acknowledged to be one of the ſtrongeſt motives to obedience; and the love of GOD, ſhed abroad in the heart, produces the beſt effects, and is the moſt powerful principle, and ſpring, of good and virtuous actions, that we are acquainted with. This being a firſt principle, from which the univerſal Reſtoration is concluded, we are happy to find, that 'GOD is love:' and that he 'ſo loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life: For, GOD ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world, through him, might be ſaved,' See 1 John, iv. 16. St. John, iii. 16, 17. But it is not ſo much my buſineſs now to ſhew, that the ſentiment is ſcriptural, as to ſhew that it is not of a dangerous tendency. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, however, are ſo beautiful, that I
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025050_0154_102D769251B58220"/>
take the liberty to mention them:—'But thou haſt mercy upon all; for thou canſt do all things, and winkeſt at the ſins of men, becauſe they ſhould amend. For thou loveſt all the things that are, and abhorreſt nothing which thou haſt made: for never wouldeſt thou have made any thing, if thou hadſt hated it, And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thy will: or been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if not called by thee? But thou ſpareſt all; for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of ſouls. For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chaſteneſt thou them, by little and little, that offend, and warneſt them, by putting them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance wherein they have offended, that leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wickedneſs, they may believe on thee, O LORD. For thy power is the beginning of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and becauſe thou art the LORD of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all. But thou, O GOD, art gracious and true: long-ſuffering, and in mercy ordering all things. For if we ſin, we are thine, knowing thy power; but <hi>we will not ſin,</hi> knowing that we are counted thine:' Wiſdom of Solomon, xi. 23—26. xii. 1, 2, 16. xv. 1, 2. 'JEHOVAH is gracious and full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger, and of great mercy. JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH; and thy ſaints ſhall bleſs thee,' Pſal. cxlv. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another great principle, upon which the Reſtoration depends, is, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>died for all;</hi> 'We ſee <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he, by the grace of GOD, ſhould taſte death for <hi>every man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heb. ii. 9. 'If <hi>any man</hi> ſin, we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the <hi>Father, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the <hi>whole world,'</hi> 1 John, ii. 1, 2. 'For there is one GOD, and one <hi>Mediator</hi> between GOD and <hi>men,</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS: who gave himſelf a ranſom for <hi>all</hi> to be teſtified in due time,' 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>I need not multiply paſſages to prove that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for <hi>all;</hi> for though the univerſality of his <hi>death</hi> is not expreſsly aſſerted, in every text where it is mentioned that he died, it muſt always be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; becauſe it is never denied in any place, and is plainly, and pointedly declared in thoſe which I have quoted: And, beſides, it is evident that in the apoſtles time, the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the death of Chriſt was a firſt principle, univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and, therefore, St. Paul reaſons from it as ſuch; which it would have been highly prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous for him to do, if that had not been the caſe: As, for example, 'For the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us; becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for <hi>all,'</hi> (which is not diſputed by any, and which we know to be a truth) 'then were <hi>all</hi> dead: And that he died for <hi>all;</hi> that they who live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again,' 2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</p>

                  <p>But have you never heard it argued that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not <hi>die</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> becauſe he did not <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>all?</hi>

                  <p>I remember, when a lad, I was ſeat to a neighbour's houſe, and overheard the good man, the maſter of the family, read in a book, after this manner: <hi>'Chriſt</hi> did not die for <hi>all,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025050_0156_102D769416F574E8"/>
he did not pray for <hi>all:</hi> I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine,' St. John, xvii. 9. And I then thought the argument concluſive: But I am now at a loſs whether the author of that book meant to deceive his readers; or, whether he had never read the chapter through critically: for, had he read the 20th verſe, he would have found theſe words, which would have overthrown his hypotheſis:—'Neither pray I for theſe <hi>alone;</hi> but for them <hi>alſo,</hi> who ſhall believe on me through their word.' If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had prayed for all, in the 9th verſe, for whom he died, he could not have enlarged his prayer ſo much in the 20th verſe, as to take in not them only, but all that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him through the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> word: Neither does he ſtop here, but goes on to pray for thoſe that believe, in theſe words: 'That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us:' And, why is all this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prayed for among believers? Surely, it hath never been accompliſhed; but it ſhall be, for this great and admirable purpoſe <hi>viz.</hi> 'That the <hi>world may believe</hi> that thou haſt ſent me. And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the <hi>world may know</hi> that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me,' verſes 21, 22, 23.</p>

                  <p>When all that believe ſhall be <hi>one,</hi> as the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are <hi>one:</hi> When the great marriage of the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſhall be celebrated, and his

Bride ſhall be <hi>one,</hi> in the bond of univerſal love and fellowſhip, as the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> now are: When the Church ſhall be perfected in <hi>one;</hi> ſhall dwell in love, and dwell in <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Father</hi> dwells in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father:</hi> When <hi>Zion's</hi> watchmen ſhall ſee eye to eye: When all believers ſhall ſpeak the ſame thing; when there ſhall be no more diviſions among them; when they ſhall be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſtate that St. Paul beſought the Corinthians to preſs after, and wiſhed them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but he had the mortification to ſee them fall ſhort of it, as all the Chriſtian churches have, from that day to this. But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall give that glory and honour to his Bride, which the <hi>Father</hi> gave to him, and ſhall thus unite her to himſelf, in an indiſſoluble union, and the ſeveral members of his body, the Church, ſhall be as much united one to another, as the members of the natural body are; or, to expreſs it in his own words, 'As thou, <hi>Father,</hi> art in <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> in <hi>thee;'</hi> When thus the Church ſhall be one, in ſpirit, love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, judgment, &amp;c. as the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> are; then ſhall the <hi>world believe,</hi> and believing, have life; then ſhall the <hi>world know</hi> him, whom to know is life eternal: See verſes 2 and 3, But as this great <hi>cauſe</hi> has never yet exiſted, the <hi>effect</hi> has not yet followed; but when the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be, the <hi>laſt</hi> ſhall take place in conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The petitions in that moſt excellent prayer, that may, with great propriety, be called the LORD'S Prayer, may be divided into four claſſes: 1. For himſelf, verſes 1ſt and 5th: 2. For his apoſtles, 9—19: 3. For them that ſhould believe, through

                  <p>Proceed, if you pleaſe, to ſhew, that the doctrine of the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> does not lead to licentiouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>It is evident that it doth not; but, on the contrary, it is the ſtrongeſt motive to all who believe it, to love and live to him who died for them, and roſe again : We <hi>are not our own, but are bought with a price;</hi> therefore, we are exhorted not to be the ſervants of ſin, ſlaves to our paſſions, and ſervants to men: but to glorify GOD in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſprits, which are his: and the apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches us, by the mercies of GOD, to preſent our bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto GOD; which is our reaſonable ſervice. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as we know that we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold; but with the precious blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as of a <hi>Lamb</hi> without blemiſh, and without ſpot; See 2 Cor. v. 15, Rom. vi. 12, 13. 1 Cor. vii. 23. vi. 19, 20. Rom. xii. 1. 1 Peter, i. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>What a horrid thought would it be, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be the miniſter of ſin, and that his blood-ſhedding ſhould cauſe wickedneſs to abound? The love of GOD, in giving his <hi>Son</hi> to die, is enough to move an heart of ſtone; 'For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time, <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for the ungodly: for, ſcarcely for a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will one die; yet, peradventure, for a good (kind, benevolent, generous) man, ſome would even dare to die. But GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:025050_0159_102D76C44C7B6F40"/>
ſinners, <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for us. Much more, being now juſtified through his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to GOD by the death of his <hi>Son;</hi> much more, being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,' Rom. v. 6—10.</p>
                  <p>Here the death of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is laid as the ground, and the ſalvation of men inferred from it, with the greateſt poſſible certainty; yet, will any one ſay, that becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath died for him, therefore he will indulge himſelf in ſin? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Some ſay that if they believed this doctrine, they would live in ſin, and indulge themſelves in their luſts and paſſions: but then it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that thoſe who ſay ſo are its enemies, and thoſe who oppoſe the view, and not thoſe who receive it.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething ſo brutiſh and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſuch diſpoſitions, as would lead men to hate their beſt friends, merely becauſe they are ſo; that would lead them to hate GOD, becauſe he loved them; and deſpiſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> merely becauſe he died for them; that, for the honour of human nature, I would hope, theſe inſtances are rare. But to the point. I have converſed with many who believed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and yet I never heard them ſay, that they hated him for it; but, on the contrary, that they loved him exceedingly. Now, is not the ſame cauſe likely to produce the ſame effect? If a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons, for inſtance, all believing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for them, find their hearts conſtrained to love him for it, would it not have the ſame effect upon ten thouſand, ten millions, or ten millions of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions? And if it would cauſe licentiouſneſs to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025050_0160_102D7697AEB23D28"/>
abound in the world, to preach that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for all, if it was univerſally believed; by the ſame rule it muſt cauſe it to prevail, in a leſſer degree, to preach that he died for a ſmall part, at leaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who believe themſelves to be of the the number; and, therefore, it muſt not be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all, that he died for any? Who can deny the conſequence? It ſeems to be evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has done and ſuffered too much for thoſe that he died for, to loſe them finally: and thus the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reſtoration ſtands connected neceſſarily with the univerſality of the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therefrom, in the eaſieſt manner; therefore, the doctrine of the <hi>former</hi> cannot tend to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as it ſtands upon the ground of the <hi>latter,</hi> which hath been demonſtrated to have no ſuch tendency.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another principle upon which the univerſal doctrine depends, is, <hi>the unchangeableneſs of God:</hi> Whom he loves once, he always loves; he loved his creatures when he made them, as none can well deny; their ſins he never loved, nor ever will; he hath declared, that he loved us when ſinners, but never <hi>as</hi> ſinners. His eternal and conſtant hatred of all ſin, and his unchangeable love of all his creatures, are of the nature of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary truths; from which the doctrine of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſtoration may be eaſily and plainly infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In this view we may underſtand thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dreadful threatenings and gracious promiſes, made to the ſame people and perſons: Both ſhall be fulfilled; the firſt, while they continue as rebels, which are deſigned to humble and ſubdue them; the laſt, when they ſhall have accepted of the puniſhment of their iniquity; when their
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025050_0161_102D76C6A072EE38"/>
uncircumciſed hearts are humbled, when their ſtubborn knees ſhall bow to JEHOVAH, and their former rebellious tongues ſhall ſwear allegiance to him.</p>
                  <p>Does this idea lead to licentiouſneſs, that GOD hates ſin, and determines to purſue it to entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and never to put up his ſword, ſo long as there is a rebel in the univerſe; yet, at the ſame time, has no poſitive hatred to the ſouls which he has made, but only wiſhes them to return to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?—This idea appears to me, equally to check preſumption and deſpair; and tends to put an end to licentiouſneſs, rather than to encourage it: For, if rebels are aſſured that their rightful ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign hates them, and will never ſuffer them to be reconciled to him, it naturally cauſes them to fight with tenfold rage, as all warriors will teſtify; as, on the other hand, if they believe he is too weak, or undetermined, to conquer them, they will be preſumptuous, and continue the war. It cannot, therefore, be affirmed, by any perſons of reaſon, that the declaration that GOD will deſtroy ſin, tends to promote it; or, that his love of order, and hatred of evil, being compatible with his love to the creatures he has made, is a doctrine that encourages men to rebel; the contrary is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and yet theſe are the very grounds of the univerſal Reſtoration; which cannot, therefore, be licentious.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another of the firſt principles of the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, the <hi>immutability of</hi> GOD'S <hi>counſels;</hi> which he hath confirmed by an oath, 'That by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, (<hi>viz.</hi> his word and oath) in which it was impoſſible for GOD to lie, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to

lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,' Heb. vi. 17, 18. 'God hath abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence, having made known unto us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf. That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together (<hi>or</hi> rehead) in one, all things in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both which are in heaven, and which are on earth: even in him: in whom we have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh <hi>all things</hi> according to the counſel of his own WILL,' Epheſ. i. 8, 9, 10, 11. GOD is our Saviour, (<hi>or Soteros,</hi> Reſtorer) who will have all men to be ſaved, (<hi>ſothenai,</hi> reſtored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,' 1 Tim. ii. 3, 4. This is the will and counſel of that GOD, who 'doeth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?' Dan. iv. 35. He hath ſworn by himſelf, the word is gone out of his mouth in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſhall not return, that unto him 'every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear,' Iſai. xlv. 23. The counſel of GOD ſhall ſtand; he will perform his pleaſure, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that men can make: 'GOD is not a man, that he ſhould lie, neither the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent: Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or, hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?' Numb, xxiii. 19. If GOD will have all men to be ſaved, or reſtored, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, if it is his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, to rehead all
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025050_0163_102D76C8A466F458"/>
things in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in heaven and on earth; if he hath ſworn, that unto him every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear; and if he worketh all things after the counſel of his own will, and is determined to perform all his pleaſure, which he is able to do; and with him nothing that he pleaſes is impoſſible: I ſay, if all theſe things are true, (as who, that believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can deny?) then, is not the doctrine of the Reſtoration true? And who will venture to charge that with licentiouſneſs, which GOD, in the counſel of his will, hath purpoſed, and is determined to perform? We know, the will of GOD is a will to all goodneſs, and that he cannot do any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, or contrary to his holy nature, or inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his plan of moral government, or that ſhall tend to promote rebellion; therefore, if GOD had ſeen that this great work had been, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, injurious to his perfections, character, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp;c. he would not have propoſed it; and if he had foreſeen that the knowledge of it would have been hurtful to mankind, he would not have revealed it: But ſince he hath done both, we may certainly argue, that it is not a licentious doctrine to declare, that GOD will finally make all his intelligent creatures happy; by making them all his ſubjects, by deſtroying their ſins, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them holy, in a way perfectly conſiſtent with all his perfections and attributes; without doing the leaſt injury to his character, or rendering his moral government weak, or making any of his words void, whether threatenings or promiſes, or in the leaſt ſetting aſide the ſanctions of his law or goſpel, or a future ſtate of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; without derogating at all from the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025050_0164_102D769B821CA258"/>
glory of the Mediator, but rather exalting it to the higheſt poſſible pitch; without ſaddening the hearts of the righteous, or diminiſhing, in the leaſt, from the happineſs of Heaven, but rather cauſing it to increaſe; for if there is joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, there muſt be more over many, in exact proportion; and as God will certainly give the greateſt poſſible joy to his choſen, and there is no doubt but it will receive addition from every one that is reſtored, or brought home to himſelf; therefore, it can only be brought to its higheſt poſſible pitch by the <hi>univerſal Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which doctrine cannot, therefore, be licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as God has appointed and revealed it, and all holy beings (except ſome weak good men on earth) rejoice therein exceedingly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another of the principles on which the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſtoration</hi> is founded, is, <hi>that</hi> God <hi>hath given all things into the hand of</hi> Chriſt, who hath declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that it is the Father's will, that of all that he gave him, he ſhould loſe nothing:</hi> and that power was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him over all, that he ſhould give the knowledge of God, even eternal life, to all that the <hi>Father</hi> had given him; and that <hi>all,</hi> without exception, whom the <hi>Father</hi> hath given, ſhall come in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as not to be caſt out: But as all theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have been recited, and reaſoned upon before, I ſhall only now obſerve, that as GOD the FATHER hath given <hi>all</hi> things to CHRIST, and as he hath engaged to bring <hi>all</hi> back, without exception, and hath both <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to perform this work, and came into the world on purpoſe to accompliſh it, it muſt, of conſequence, be finally performed; yet, it cannot tend to licentiouſneſs, or the God of Heaven, and the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> would never

have planned it approved of it, or ſought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it.</p>
                  <p>Many more firſt principles, on which the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> is founded, might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and ſhewn to be far from tending to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: but I ſhall mention but one more; and that is—<hi>The Scriptures muſt be fulfilled; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot be broken:</hi> None or the words of God can fail of being accompliſhed; and he hath not only denounced dreadful threatnings, but made many gracious promiſes to the ſame people: Theſe cannot be fulfilled together; and, if there is no truth in the Reſtoration, I cannot ſee how the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will ever be fulfilled at all; and if ſins are not puniſhed in the perſons who commit them, I am equally at a loſs what ſenſe or truth there can be in the <hi>former.</hi> It would be a great taſk to collect all the texts which juſtify the remark, that threatenings and promiſes belong to the ſame people in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods, ſome ſpecimens of which have been given in the courſe of theſe dialogues. Now, it cannot lead to licentiouſneſs, to ſuppoſe that the Scriptures ſhall all be fulfilled; but it muſt lead to infidelity, and all kinds of evil, to ſuppoſe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the firſt principles upon which the doctrine of the Reſtoration ſtands, and by which it is ſupported; and as theſe have all been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proved to have no tendency to encourage ſin, ſeparately, much leſs can they have any ſuch tendency, jointly; and then it evidently follows, that a doctrine which ſeems neceſſarily deduced, or inferred by undeniable conſequences, from all theſe conſiderations united, cannot be falſe, or have any evil tendency.</p>

                  <p>You have brought my own experience to my mind:—It pleaſed GOD, by an incident too trifling to mention, to bring me to ſeek earneſtly for an unfading treaſure; and, by a train of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, fixed the concern deeply upon my mind; and I laboured night and day, but could obtain no reſt, till one morning—a time never to be forgotten!—as I was walking on a journey, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great diſtreſs, and when deliverance ſeemed farther from me than ever, all at once, I was brought to reſign my ſoul into the hands of GOD, and thus I expreſſed myſelf: 'Lord, here I am: a poor helpleſs ſinner: I reſign myſelf into thine hands; take me, and deal with me, juſt as thou pleaſeſt: I know thou canſt do me no injuſtice.' Immediately theſe words came into my mind, with great power and ſweetneſs: 'In an acceptable time have I heard thee; and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee,' Iſai. xlix. 8. and I had then ſuch a view of CHRIST, as made me to cry out 'Glory to God in the higheſt! This is ſalvation; I know this is ſalvation!' Then thoſe paſſages which you have mentioned, came into my mind with great energy; and I ſaw the fulneſs, ſufficiency, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs of CHRIST to ſave me, and all men, in ſuch a manner as conſtrained me to venture my ſoul into his arms; and if I had had ten thouſand ſouls, I
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025050_0169_102D76CE7AD2F1D8"/>
could have truſted them all in his hands. And, O how did I long, that every ſoul of Adam's race might come to know the love of God in CHRIST JESUS! And I thought, I could not be willing to live any longer on earth, unleſs it might pleaſe God to make me uſeful to my fellow-creatures.

                  <p>This is a little abſtract of what God did then graciouſly teach me by his Spirit; but I had been brought up in the particular ſyſtem, and in the courſe of a few years came to be ſo firmly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, as to refuſe in my preaching, to make ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral invitations to mankind at large; rightly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with myſelf, that if proviſion was only made for a ſmall part, I had no warrant to call or invite the whole to come and partake; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only preſſed the duty on ſuch and ſuch charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>hungry, thirſty, weary, heavy-laden,</hi> ſuch as were <hi>without money, ſenſible ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. all of which I concluded to be of the <hi>elect,</hi> becauſe I judged the Spirit had begun to operate ſavingly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts; and that to theſe, and theſe only, the Scriptures directed invitations to be made; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidering that text—'Hearken unto me, ye ſtout-hearted, that are far from righteouſneſs. I bring near my righteouſneſs; and it ſhall not be far off, and my ſalvation ſhall not tarry,' Iſa. xlvi. 12, 13. During the time that I remained in this cloſe-hearted ſyſtem, labouring with all my might to maintain it, I chanced to come to a houſe,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025050_0170_102D76A187A45450"/>
where, as far as I can judge, was a very ſenſible and pious young woman, whom I never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince: She gave a very judicious account of the work of grace upon her heart: but when ſhe came to that part, where ſhe ſaid ſhe beheld an infinite fulneſs in CHRIST for ALL the world, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her, and told her, That could not be; for there was no proviſion made for all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was impoſſible that ſhe could have any ſuch diſcoveries made to her by the Spirit of God. This I inſiſted upon, according to my ſyſtem, contrary to my experimental knowledge; (O the miſchiefs of bigotry, prejudice, and vain attachment to ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem!) ſhe, on the contrary, maintained, that ſhe clearly viewed matters in that light; and that ſhe certainly was taught to believe, that in Chriſt there was a fulneſs and freeneſs for all: This I denied; and ſhe was thereby prevented from finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhe had begun. I can never forgive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the oppoſition I made to what I knew to be truth by experience; and as I did not enquire the name of the perſon, I have had no opportunity of making a recantation by letter, as I ought to have done; and having never been in the place ſince, and it being highly improbable that ever I ſhall again, I feel myſelf extremely hurt, whenever I think of it.</p>

                  <p>I am not able to gainſay this reaſoning; it ſeems almoſt undeniable: But can you ſhew that the doctrine of the Reſtoration ſtands connected with practical religion, or the keeping of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I can very eaſily do that, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but ſhall only attend to the following, as a ſpecimen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Lord has commanded us to <hi>love all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> not our brethren and friends only, but even
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025050_0173_102D76D1E90966D0"/>
our greateſt enemies; and all for this purpoſe, that we may be the children of our Father, who is in Heaven, whoſe love is univerſal, and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works: See St. Matth. v. 44—48. St. Luke, vi. 27—36. But if God doth not love all himſelf, Chriſt hath commanded us to be <hi>more perfect,</hi> in that reſpect, than our Father, who is in Heaven; which, to ſuppoſe, is highly abſurd. What ſhall we ſay to that doctrine that teaches us, that God hates, with a perfect hatred, many of thoſe whom he hath commanded us to love as ourſelves?</p>
                  <p>Therefore, there is nothing in the doctrine of the Reſtoration, contrary to the love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; which on the contrary is promoted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are commanded to <hi>do good to all men,</hi> as we have opportunity. This is recommended to us by the example of our heavenly Father, who mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt;' and no perſon can ſay, that the belief of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine tends, in the leaſt, to hinder us from doing good to all our fellow-creatures; but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages us ſo to do, from the conſideration that God loves them all, and does good to all, and is determined to make them all the ſubjects of his kingdom at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are commanded to <hi>forgive all men their treſpaſſes,</hi> and to pray; ſaying, 'Forgive us our (debts, <hi>or</hi>) treſpaſſes, as we forgive (our debtors, <hi>or</hi>) them that treſpaſs againſt us;' St. Matth. vi. 12. St. Luke, xi. 4. And our Lord ſays, 'For, if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will alſo forgive you: But if ye forgive not
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025050_0174_102D76A527A75248"/>
men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give your treſpaſſes;' St. Matth. vi. 14, 15. See alſo, chap. xviii 21—35. St. Mark, xi. 25, 26. St. Luke, vi. 37.</p>
                  <p>Now, is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, with any degree of reaſon, that our Lord would command us, upon pain of his higheſt diſpleaſure, to <hi>forgive</hi> thoſe whom he hated, and determined to puniſh while he ſhould exiſt, without having the leaſt deſire or deſign to do them good? Has he promiſed us the greateſt bleſſings, if we will forgive all men; and will he never forgive them? He that can believe this, let him believe it. However, ſince forgiving all men is a plain command, which none can deny; I truſt, no one will venture to ſay, that believing the final Reſtoration of all men, at laſt, will have any tendency to make us break this precept of our <hi>Saviour's,</hi> upon which he lays ſo much ſtreſs; but, I think, the contrary is evident.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are commanded to <hi>pray for all men:</hi> St. Paul ſays, 'I exhort, therefore, that, firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men: For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God, our Saviour, (<hi>or</hi> Reſtorer) who will have all men to be ſaved, (<hi>or</hi> reſtored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and men, the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.' This is the great doctrine of the Goſpel, the very foundation of Chriſtianity:— 'Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apoſtle; (I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, and lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.' The apoſtle not only believed, but taught; not only
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025050_0175_102D76D3B58877C0"/>
taught, but commanded others to teach and preach this great doctrine, of God's being the Saviour, or Reſtorer, of all men: In this he gloried, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labour and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour (<hi>or</hi> Reſtorer) of all men, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe that believe. Theſe things command and teach.'</p>
                  <p>Upon this grand foundation, St. Paul recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends prayer to all men; ſaying, 'I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting,' 1 Tim. ii. 1—8. iv. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, the apoſtle recommends prayer for all men: and wills, that men ſhould pray every where, at all times, and in all places, lifting up holy hands, without <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>doubting.</hi> How nearly forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men, and praying for all men, ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected! and both are plainly and peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by our Lord; who ſays, 'Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.'</p>
                  <p>We are commanded to pray for all men, becauſe it is the will of God that all men ſhould be ſaved; (<hi>or</hi> reſtored) and becauſe Chriſt hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſon for all: And we are bid to pray <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting:</hi> O, what a word is this! May we, ought we, to pray for the ſalvation of all men, without <hi>doubting?</hi> Surely, God would never have commanded us to do this, unleſs it was his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reſtore all men, in his own time; and no man can ſay, that the belief of the Reſtoration will prevent our praying for all men.</p>
                  <p>

I was once on a journey, and called in at the houſe of one of my former good friends: Several religious perſons were there; and, after ſome time, my ſentiments came to be ſpoken of, and they ſeemed to wonder how I could embrace the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all men, finally, would be ſaved! I told them, however many might preach againſt it, that no perſon, under the influence of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, could pray <hi>againſt it;</hi> but, on the contrary, we could pray <hi>for it</hi> in faith, nothing wavering, as God had commanded, and as his Spirit naturally inſpired: that no perſon could pray God not to ſave or reſtore all mankind, without being ſhocked at the blaſphemy and impiety of ſuch a prayer; but that our Lord had ſaid, that all things whatſoever we aſked in prayer, believing that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſhould be granted, let them be things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ever ſo impoſſible; that if we aſked any thing according to his will, it ſhould be done; and that it was his poſitive and declared will, that all men ſhould be ſaved, (<hi>or</hi> reſtored) and come to the knowledge of the truth: that we were ordered to pray for it in faith, without doubting; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was as evident as the nature of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that it would be done; ſince God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordered us to pray for any thing that he was not able and willing to do. This, and much more, I ſaid, and they ſeemed exceedingly well ſatisfied; eſpecially, when I informed them, that it was through the blood of Chriſt, the blood of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that the priſoners ſhould be ſent forth out of the pit wherein is no water, and that all ſhould be reſtored through his mediation.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:025050_0177_102D76D5B9BC6D10"/>
of Jeſus, and through his blood-ſhedding. I have heard it objected againſt your ſcheme, that it tended to ſet at nought the whole mediatorial plan, and to depreciate the blood of Jeſus, which he ſhed to purge our ſins away; though I never obſerved any thing like this in your diſcourſes, either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or in private.</p>

                  <p>No: God forbid that I ſhould ever ſet aſide the blood that cleanſeth from all ſin; nor can I be charged with it, unleſs having a much higher idea of its merit than my oppoſers, may be looked upon as tending to depreciate it. They hold that it ſhall cleanſe a ſmall number from their ſins; I believe that it ſhall cleanſe, heal, and reſtore the whole human race. They believe that its virtue endures for a little ſeaſon; I maintain that it ſhall continue to all ages, until all evil ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the univerſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſatisfied that you do not mean to ſet at nought the powerful blood of the dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but on the contrary, you ſuppoſe that your views tend more to exalt it. Pray proceed in your diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>I need not ſay much more upon this matter; Our <hi>Saviour</hi> has ſaid, 'If any man will do his (the Father's) will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf,' St. John vii. 17. This is the ſureſt rule: practiſe religion; love, revere, and ſerve God; love all men, even your enemies; do good to all, forgive all, and pray for all; and then aſk, Is the doctrine of the final Reſtoration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this manner of life? If it be, reject it; for theſe commands are plain: and if theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are inconſiſtent with the obſervation of theſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025050_0178_102D76A8E43103C0"/>
precepts, then avoid them, as you would death and hell. But, I truſt, it has been ſhewn, that they have no ſuch tendency; but the contrary. For inſtance, Does this doctrine tend to make us hate God, and his character? Does it naturally fill our minds with <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> and prevent <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> from ruling within us? Does it fill us with <hi>pride,</hi> and cauſe us to look down with contempt upon thoſe that are beneath us in life; and baniſh <hi>humility</hi> from our hearts? Does the belief of this, cauſe our breaſts to ſwell with pale <hi>envy,</hi> and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous malice, at the happineſs of others? Does it cauſe us to burn with helliſh <hi>rage,</hi> fury, and madneſs, againſt mankind? Does it tend to deſtroy <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and increaſe <hi>wrath?</hi> If theſe queſtions require (either from the nature of things, or from known facts) the anſwers to be in the affirmative; then I would abhor ſuch a ſyſtem, and wiſh it to be univerſally deteſted: But if, on the contrary, the candid enquirer muſt anſwer in the negative, and ſay, That the doctrine of the final Reſtoration does not tend to produce <hi>ſelfiſhneſs, envy, pride,</hi> or <hi>wrath;</hi> but, on the contrary, 'Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good-will towards men;' that it cauſes <hi>benevolence, meekneſs, humility, forbearance, forgiveneſs, charity,</hi> and all <hi>goodneſs,</hi> to abound and increaſe; then it cannot be a licentious doctrine, and is not to be diſcarded on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for it is a maxim with St. John, that 'He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occaſion of ſtumbling in him,' 1 John, ii. 10. That is, he cannot receive, hold, maintain, or do, any thing eſſentially or materially wrong; and, therefore, can give no juſt occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: 'For, all the law is fulfilled in one word,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025050_0179_102D76D787810540"/>
even in this; Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. For he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying: Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. Love work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ill to his neighbour: therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law,' Gal. v. 14. Rom. xiii. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only from reaſoning, but from facts, that I am able to prove that the belief of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the univerſal Reſtoration, does not lead men to ſin. The Tunkers, or German Baptiſts, in Pennſylvania, and the ſtates adjacent, who take the Scriptures as their only guide, in matters both of faith and practie, have always (as far as I know) received, and univerſally, at preſent, hold theſe ſentiments: But ſuch Chriſtians I have never ſeen as they are; ſo averſe are they to all ſin, and to many things that other Chriſtians eſteem lawful, that they not only refuſe to ſwear, go to war, &amp;c. but are ſo afraid of doing any thing contrary to the commands of Chriſt, that no temptation would prevail upon them even to ſue any perſon at law, for either name, character, eſtate, or any debt, be it ever ſo juſt: They are induſtrious, ſober, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, kind, charitable people; envying not the great, nor deſpiſing the mean: They read much, they ſing and pray much, they are conſtant attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants upon the worſhip of God; their dwelling-houſes are all houſes of prayer: They walk in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs both in public and private: They bring up
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025050_0180_102D76AAAA0BF250"/>
their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; no noiſe of rudeneſs, ſhameleſs mirth, loud, vain laughter, is heard within their doors: The law of kindneſs is in their mouths: no ſourneſs, or moroſeneſs, diſgraces their religion; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they believe their Saviour commands, they practiſe, without enquiring or regarding what others do.</p>
                  <p>I remember the Rev. Morgan Edwards, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſter of the Baptiſt Church in Philadelphia, once ſaid to me, 'GOD always will have a viſible people on earth; and theſe are his people at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, above any other in the world.' And in his Hiſtory of the Baptiſts in Pennſylvania, ſpeaking of theſe people, he ſays: 'General redemption they certainly held, and, withal, general ſalvation; which tenets (though wrong) are conſiſtent. In a word, they are meek and pious Chriſtians; and have juſtly acquired the character of <hi>The harmleſs Tunkers.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>Thus have I proved that this doctrine is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious; both from the firſt principles on which it is founded, from the nature of experimental and practical religion, and from fats. As to that part of the objection, which ſuppoſes this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be the ſame that the ſerpent preached to Eye, ſaying, 'Ye ſhall not ſurely die;' it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unworthy of notice: But as it has been glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in by ſome writers, as unanſwerable, merely becauſe it was paſſed over unnoticed, as being nothing to the purpoſe; I ſhall make a few remarks upon it.
<list>
                        <item>1. I ſay, that <hi>Satan</hi> was a liar, and GOD was true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For man and woman did <hi>die,</hi> in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, on the very day that they ſinned; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025050_0181_102D76D947F9DEC0"/>
dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; they loſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life, and became earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh; darkneſs in their underſtandings, ſtubbornneſs in their wills, and diſorder in their affections, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them unfit, unable, and unworthy, to have fellowſhip with their God. But do they contradict JEHOVAH, and join with the ſerpent, who aſſert, that JESUS, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> hath quickened, and is able to quicken, thoſe who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins? If ſo, St. Paul joined with the ſerpent, in Epheſ. ii. 1.</item>
                        <item>2. The ſentence of death was pronounced upon man, even the death of the body, in thoſe words: 'In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it waſt thou taken: for duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return,' Gen. iii. 19. But, would it be juſt and right for any one to ſay, that thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the reſurrection of the body, contradicted God, and, joining with the ſerpent, declared, that men ſhould not die; merely, becauſe they aſſerted, according to the promiſes, that they ſhould riſe again? Would not thoſe who preach <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the reſurrection, have a right to look upon it as a vile and wilful ſlander, if any one ſhould ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the matter? What! muſt I be accuſed of ſaying, that no man ever died, becauſe I believe and teach, that ſome have riſen, and that all ſhall be raiſed, at laſt: when even the very idea of a reſurrection, preſuppoſes a ſtate of death?</item>
                        <item>3. I confeſs, that God has threatened ſinners with the ſecond death: but do I ſay, that they ſhall never taſte of the ſecond death, becauſe I declare, that the time will come when it ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt no more? This is curious reaſoning, indeed.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="unknown:025050_0182_102D76AC3A18E108"/>
As well may I ſay, that no man ever lived on earth, becauſe ſo many have died; that no one ſleeps in the night, who wakes in the morning; or, that no fiſh was ever in the water, that was caught and taken out.</p>
                  <p>Did St. Paul join with the ſerpent, when he ſaid, 'For as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, even ſo in CHRIST ſhall all be made alive?' 1 Cor. xv. 22. Will any ſuppoſe that we affirm, that the dreadful threatenings denounced by God, never were, nor ever will be executed, becauſe we declare, that his promiſes ſhall alſo be fulfilled? Can any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man ſuppoſe, becauſe Chriſt is the Saviour of men, that, therefore, they were not in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? How abſurd! when he declares, that he came to ſeek and to ſave the loſt!</p>
                  <p>Thus, though mankind died a moral death, in the day wherein they ſinned; yet, CHRIST is able to quicken and raiſe them up from the ſame: and though their bodies die, in conſequence of the fall; yet ſhall he cauſe all that are in the graves, to hear his voice, and come forth: and, by the ſame rule of arguing, though many ſhall fall under the power of the ſecond death, which is threatened to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yet as he has promiſed to deſtroy all that bears the name of <hi>death,</hi> their Reſtoration may be fairly concluded, without either contradicting God, or joining with the ſerpent. Had the Scriptures, indeed, contained nothing but threatenings of <hi>death,</hi> without any promiſes of <hi>ſalvation, reſurrection,</hi> or <hi>reſtoration;</hi> it would have been preſumptuous for us to have entertained any hopes for the human race, or their deliverance, either from <hi>ſin, death,</hi> or <hi>hell:</hi> but, ſince <hi>promiſes</hi> are found, as well as <hi>threatenings,</hi> we muſt not, under pretence or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:025050_0183_102D76DB9E0BDD30"/>
of believing the <hi>latter,</hi> reject the <hi>former,</hi> leſt we are found contradictors and oppoſers of God; for it is as poſſible that we may make him a liar, in refuſing to believe the record he has given of his Son, and his intentions of grace and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind, as in diſregarding his threatenings, denounced againſt them becauſe of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>As for this doctrine making the <hi>hearts of the righteous ſad whom</hi> GOD <hi>would not have made ſad,</hi> nothing can be more contrary to fact; for if it be the will of God to reward and puniſh, and finally to reſtore mankind, none of the righteous will be ſorry, but, on the contrary, will greatly rejoice. It is not God's truth, but men's lies, of which the prophet ſpeaks; which made the hearts of the righteous ſad, and ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way, by promiſing him life: But we are ſo far from ſtrengthening the hands of the wicked, and ſaying, that no evil ſhall come upon them; that we declare from the Scripture, that 'the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs; unto them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil; of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile,' Rom. i. 18. ii. 8, 9. And that 'there is no peace to the wicked,' Iſai. xlviii. 22. lvii. 20, 21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are called to repent, and turn to God; for in ſin they never can be happy: no unholy, or unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And ſo far are we from promiſing them life in their wicked ways, that we teſtify, from the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025050_0184_102D76AE4E7E2CB0"/>
Scripture, that 'He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life,' while he continues in that ſtate; 'but the wrath of God abideth on him,' St. John, iii. 36.</p>

                  <p>I had intended to propoſe that text as an objection to your ſyſtem; it is, indeed, one that Dr. WHITBY inſiſts much upon: But I ſee how you will anſwer it—that the unbeliever, as ſuch, <hi>and while he ſo continues,</hi> cannot ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him, while he remaineth in unbelief; but that God can take away the cauſe, in his own time, and then the effect ſhall ceaſe.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, this muſt be the meaning: for St. John only meant to deſcribe the difference between believers and unbelievers, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> but could not mean to intimate, that thoſe who were unbelievers, in his time, ſhould always continue ſo.</p>
                  <p>But I now paſs to conſider the latter part of this objection, upon which I have dwelt ſo long; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the nature God to lay the higheſt poſſible reſtraint upon ſin, and, therefore he has threatened it with <hi>everlaſting damnation,</hi> which muſt intend <hi>endleſs miſery;</hi> and as this reſtraint is found too weak, wholly to prevent evil, what an amazing increaſe would there be, if this reſtraint ſhould be taken off, in any degree; as it muſt be, if it ſhould come to be known that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were only <hi>for certain ages or periods,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the <hi>amendment</hi> of the ſufferers?</p>
                  <p>I once aſked a Reverend Divine, what was his ſtrongeſt argument in favour of <hi>endleſs puniſhment?</hi> and he told me, this which is mentioned above; and, therefore as it is of conſiderable importance, I ſhall give it a brief conſideration.

                        <item>1. It is not quite clear to me, that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God to lay the higheſt poſſible reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſin; and that he always doth ſo, in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. He ſometimes has higher deſigns in view, than barely to reſtrain ſin: he ſometimes, perhaps, ſuffers it to prevail for a time, that his power might be more manifeſt in deſtroying it: hence we read, 'Moreover, the law entered'—not merely to reſtrain ſin, but—'that the offence might abound: but where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign, through righteouſneſs, unto eternal llfe, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord. Wherefore, then, ſerveth the law? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, till the ſeed ſhould come, to whom the promiſe was made,' Rom. v. 20, 21, Gal. iii. 19. St. Paul ſays; 'Sin, taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; for, without the law, ſin was dead. Was, then, that which was good, made death unto me? God forbid: But ſin, that it might appear ſin, working death in me, by that which is good; that ſin, by the commandment, might become exceeding ſinful,' Rom. vii. 8, 13. Perhaps, if the puniſhment of ſins immediately followed the commiſſion of them, it would be a ſtronger and more effectual reſtraint than any threatenings of future miſery; yet God does not think it neceſſary to reſtrain ſin by that mean, though it is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted that, 'Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore is the heart of the ſons of men fully ſet in them to do evil.' Eccleſ. viii. 11. There is no doubt but if the awful puniſhments of the future ſtate were
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025050_0186_102D76B01A250228"/>
made viſible to our ſenſes, by any means, they would prove a powerful reſtraint to ſin; yet God has not thought fit to reſtrain it by thoſe, and perhaps many other poſſible ways; Wherefore, I have a right to doubt the premiſes; for, if the ſtrongeſt poſſible reſtraints were laid upon ſin, it might not be ſo conſiſtent with a ſtate of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thoſe reaſonable reſtraints which God hath thought fit to lay upon it.</item>
                        <item>2. But it may be queſtioned, whether there is not ſomething in the idea of limited, yet certain pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo juſt, equitable, reaſonable, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; that is much more calculated to produce belief, and conſequently more effectual to deſtroy falſe hopes of eſcaping it, and alſo to check that daring preſumption, which riſes out of the idea of <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> than can be found in the contrary doctrine. <hi>Endleſs puniſhment</hi> ſeems to ſhock ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der minds, at leaſt. I heard of a little boy, to whom his mother conſtantly kept preaching dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation without end, for every ſin; one day, after ſhe had been diſcourſing with him in that manner, he went to work, but ſoon returned back, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly opened the door, and with an air of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, cried out; 'Why, mother, the law ſays, <hi>'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot;</hi> but you ſay, ten thouſand for one, and that puniſhment ſhall never end.' I have heard of numbers that had no better excuſe for ſinning greedily, than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was no hopes of their being ſaved; that, therefore, they were determined to ſin as much as poſſible, ſince it could make no difference. I have reaſon to ſay, from what I know of mankind, that more perſons refuſe to believe in Divine Revelation,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025050_0187_102D703350E69D48"/>
becauſe it is commonly thought to contain the doctrine of <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> than from any other cauſe: And numbers have embraced it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, upon being fairly convinced that it was not neceſſary to underſtand it in that light. And a very ſenſible Deiſt once ſaid to an acquaintance of mine, who believed and preached the univerſal doctrine; 'Had I been acquainted with your ſyſtem, thirty years ago, I ſhould have been a zealous Chriſtian; and as great a friend to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as I have been an enemy.' 'And, pray, why not now Doctor?'—'Becauſe I am aſhamed, having ſo long been fighting againſt, to receive it now.'</item>
                        <item>3. Though damnation has been commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be <hi>endleſs,</hi> for many ages; yet it has not (as far as we can judge) prevented evil at all, or very little: but I have mentioned before, how very ſtrict thoſe people live, who receive and hold the ſyſtem of limited puniſhments: whether it is, that <hi>endleſs damnation</hi> is too unnatural to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and that <hi>limited puniſhments,</hi> being more reaſonable, ſeem more certain; or whether it be, that by conſidering they ſhall be puniſhed, either without end, or not at all; and every one think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that endleſs puniſhment is more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but is only reſerved for ſome greater ſinners, and therefore they have nothing to fear from it, I ſhall not pretend to determine; but certain it is, that where the idea of endleſs miſery prevails, it has not prevented iniquity, in the meaſure that might have been expected, on the ſuppoſition of its being the truth of GOD.</item>
                        <item>4. The great number of Heathens, that die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever being favoured with the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025050_0188_102D76B1E5EEFFA0"/>
and certainly without ever hearing of endleſs miſery; the many that die in a ſtate of infancy and childhood; together with the inſtances of ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and perſons born deaf; all convince me, more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of inſtructing and reclaiming his creatures, in another ſtate, that we are at preſent unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</item>
                        <item>5. It is not ſo much the intention of God, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſtrain ſin, as to ſhew it in all its dreadful deformity, puniſh it according to its deſerts, and, finally, to ſhew the ſuper-abounding of his grace, in overcoming and totally deſtroying it out of his creation; which ſhall be accompliſhed when He that ſitteth upon the throne ſhall make all things new; 'And there ſhall be no more death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrow, nor crying; neither ſhall there be any more pain; for the former things are paſſed away,' Rev. xxi. 4.</item>
                        <item>6. As the doctrine of the final Reſtoration, has been ſhewn in itſelf not to have the leaſt tendency to licentiouſneſs, but directly the reverſe; and, as far as I can learn, by hiſtory, or my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe who have believed it, in the manner here laid down, as perfectly conſiſtent with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, have been particularly careful to depart from iniquity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind: yet if any ſhould be ſo loſt to all that is good, as to pervert this truth (revealed for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſes) to their own deſtruction, they alone muſt bear the blame, the loſs, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Scriptures, of truth have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; yet, that is no argument againſt Divine Revelation: The Goſpel of the Grace of GOD, has been abuſed; but ſhould it never be preached
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025050_0189_102D76E0F062F298"/>
on that account? Some, in the apoſtles days, turned the Grace of GOD itſelf into wantonneſs or laſciviouſneſs, (See Jude 4); and others pretended that thoſe holy men encouraged ſin, by proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation to ſinners, through grace, or faith in Chriſt; of which St. Paul complains, (Rom. iii. 8.) 'We be ſlanderouſly reported, and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that we ſay, Let us do evil, that good may come: whoſe damnation is juſt'—The holy apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle abhorred, and conſtantly denied this horrid conſequence, which ſome perverſe minds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to draw from his doctrine; he declared that the damnation of ſuch was juſt, who did ſin that grace might abound, or who affirmed that the doctrine led thereto, or that the apoſtles taught or practiſed any ſuch things; nevertheleſs, (not as fools, but as wiſe) they did not think fit to lay the goſpel aſide, and refuſe to preach ſalvation through CHRIST any more on that account: The ſelf-ſame reaſoning applies to the preſent caſe.</item>

                  <p>I muſt confeſs that you have ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed as to ſilence this great objection; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the belief of the Reſtoration feems by your account of it conſiſtent with a ſtate of grace, and the knowledge and practice of religion. But though you have obviated ſeveral objections, there is one you have not yet touched, which is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and I am doubtful that it will be difficult if not impoſſible for you to anſwer fairly, it may be thus expreſſed, <hi>God has abounded towards us in all wiſdom:</hi> one inſtance is his hanging out the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings of the ſevereſt puniſhments to prevent his creatures from ſinning while in this world; but to tell them at the ſame time, that if they ſhould ſin he means to ſave them, is not <hi>prudent;</hi> becauſe
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025050_0190_102D76B3B09D3C78"/>
that leſſens, if not deſtroys the force of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. He told Adam that if he did eat, he ſhould ſurely die; but did not tell him (at the ſame time) that if he ſhould eat, his caſe would not be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; this were to take down with one hand what he had ſet up with the other. After the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing failed of the effect, he told him ſo, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this was prudently done; ſo after his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings fail of effect in this ſtate, is the time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his deſign of ſaving daring ſinners. We may therefore be ſure that he has not done it yet, and that we miſconſtrue thoſe texts which ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a revelation. The next ſtate is the only ſtate to preach the doctrine, and reveal the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. If you preach it here, it will be unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preach it in hell; for obſtinate ſinners will carry it in their heads thither.</p>

                  <p>As ſpecious and plauſible as this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſeems, I doubt not of being able to anſwer it fairly, without evading the natural force of it in the leaſt. The firſt thing that I ſhall notice in this objection, is the very different and contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which you apply thoſe words of the apoſtle from his firſt evident intention. <hi>He hath abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence, having made known unto us the myſtery of his will according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> Epheſ. i. 8, 9, 10. God hath judged it be the height of heavenly wiſdom and prudence to make known to his ſaints, his glorious purpoſe, finally to rehead all things in Chriſt; and we ought not to preſume to be more wiſe and prudent than he.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:025050_0191_102D76E2CCAC1078"/>
There is no doubt but God hath revealed this great truth more immediately to his ſaints and faithful ones for their conſolation, than for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the finally impenitent.</p>
                  <p>It is of amazing, I had almoſt ſaid of infinite uſe to the people of God, to have this divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel declared to them in the preſent time. The knowledge of this truth entirely removes all hard thoughts of God from the minds of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as I can teſtify by experience; for ſince I have believed in the doctrine of the univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, I have never had one hard thought of God abiding for one minute in my mind, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and never expect to have any more while I continue to believe it firmly.</p>
                  <p>The belief of the Reſtoration is of great uſe in ſupporting good people under their ſorrows and trials here; the idea that evil ſhall be deſtroyed, and all things reſtored to their primitive glory is the moſt conſolatory of all other ideas. As this doctrine tends to remove the greateſt difficulties from the plan of Providence, and alſo from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, it is evident that the knowledge of it muſt be of the greateſt uſe to all that love their great Creator. And therefore if the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it anſwered no other purpoſe in this life, but for the happineſs, joy, and ſatisfaction of ſuch as love God, we might be ſure that he hath made it known, and that we rightly underſtand thoſe paſſages that hold it forth; for ſince 'the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his covenant,' Pſal. xxv. 14. and 'The Lord God will do nothing, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the prophets,' Amos iii. 7. there is all the reaſon to conclude,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025050_0192_102D76B5C59CA928"/>
that if God ever intended to reſtore mankind hereafter, he would not fail to reveal it to his choſen and faithful ſervants. And this he hath done, if I can underſtand the meaning of words.</p>
                  <p>It is true that God did not inform our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents before they ſinned that he had provided a remedy; but not long did he delay after the fall to reveal to them, that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head, Gen. iii. 15. and this one text contains in miniature all that I believe reſpecting the Reſtoration of mankind; for if the Serpent's head is finally to be bruiſed, his power and influence over mankind, muſt be entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and then what ſhall prevent their return to God?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is impoſſible to read the Scriptures attentively, and not perceive that God very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mixes promiſes of mercies among his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt threatenings of judgment; and yet he doth not throw down with one hand, what he builds up with the other.</p>
                  <p>Your object ſeems to ſuppoſe that the doctrine of the Reſtoration ſuperſedes and ſets aſide thoſe puniſhments which God has threatened to inflict upon the impenitent; or elſe how does the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this doctrine weaken the force of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings? But this is a very falſe idea; for we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the threatenings ſhall be fulfilled, and not that the diſobedient ſhall eſcape unpunſhed. There is a great deal of difference between theſe two ideas, though you would intimate them to be the ſame, and that we contradict God by aſſuring the wicked that they ſhall eſcape the juſt judgment of God. But we only declare that an end ſhall finally come to their puniſhment, and that when
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025050_0193_102D703517879EE0"/>
they ſhall be ſufficiently humbled a diſpenſation of mercy ſhall ſucceed that of judgment. Let me aſk you, Has not God threatened mankind with death on the account of ſin? 'Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.' Gen. iii. 19. Well, tell me, is this threatening either weakened or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the knowledge of the great doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead? Did not God threaten the children of Iſrael with dreadful judgments to prevent their ſinning, and that they ſhould be diſperſed among all nations? but will you ſay that he either weakened or diſtroyed the force of his threatenings, becauſe he promiſed them at the ſame time that at laſt he would return their captivity, and reſtore them as at the firſt, and do better unto them, than at their beginning.</p>
                  <p>The laws of this country condemn criminals to death: would it be thought that I ſhould weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or deſtroy the force of the penal ſtatutes, by ſaying, that the execution of the law could only be felt for a certain time, beyond which it could not endure? Is not every malefactor under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death ſuppoſed to know this? and yet will any preſume to ſay, that theſe laws are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakened, and their force deſtroyed becauſe they do not condemn tranſgreſſors to endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments? But, if it be allowed that torments, which are but momentary, have a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in reſtraining many vices, there cannot be the ſmalleſt reaſon to fear that the doctrine of juſt retribution according to the deeds done in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will open the door to vice and immorality, but on the contrary. But this objection is ſo near a kin to the laſt which you propoſed, that it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerves a diſtinct conſideration; for if the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025050_0194_102D76B755DA2D60"/>
doctrine of the Reſtoration does not lead men to commit ſin, (as I am ſure it has no ſuch tendency) then no harm can be apprehended from its being known in this ſtate. And whereas you argue, that as it would not be proper for the preſent ſtate, we may be ſure that God hath not revealed it; and therefore is highly proper for men to know in the preſent ſtate. You will pleaſe therefore to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the univerſal doctrine, ſo far from tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render the divine threatenings uſeleſs or vain, weakening their force, or ſetting them aſide, operates in the direct contrary manner. I as much believe as you or any other man can do, that all the threatenings will be fulfilled upon the finally impenitent; but dare not carry the matter ſo far as to ſet aſide the gracious promiſes of God, with which the Scriptures appear to me to abound, in favour of the final recovery of all at laſt.</p>

                  <p>It muſt I think be confeſſed that if the doctrine of the Reſtoration be true, it would be matter of great joy and comfort for good men to know it, for they have often great trouble and anxiety of mind on the account of their families, friends, neighbours, acquaintance, and mankind in general; which ſorrow would be greatly reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could they have an idea of the Reſtoration of all things in the manner you hold it. But however true this may be, it ſeems not to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed in the Scripture, otherwiſe it would not be hidden from the eyes of ſo many great and good men.</p>

                  <p>It is poſſible, that a ſubject may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the plaineſt manner, and yet the beſt of men may remain ignorant of it. For inſtance, were not the ſufferings, death, and reſurrection of our
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025050_0195_102D76E4DA4F9C68"/>
Lord plainly revealed in the Scriptures of the old Teſtament? And yet we know that the apoſtles of our Saviour did not underſtand one of thoſe prophecies. Nay, when Jeſus told them openly and expreſsly that he muſt be delivered into the hands of men, and that they ſhould mock, ſcourge, and crucify him, and that the third day he ſhould riſe again, they did not comprehend his meaning; although he ſpoke to them frequently and very plainly upon the ſubject, and ſaid, 'Let theſe ſayings ſink down into your ears: for the Son of man ſhall be delivered into the hands of men. But they underſtood not this ſaying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared to aſk him of that ſaying.' St. Luke ix. 44, 45. And in another place we read, 'For he taught his diſciples, and ſaid unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they ſhall kill him: and after that he is killed, he ſhall riſe the third day.' It is impoſſible that words ſhould be more expreſs, or leſs liable to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood. 'But (as the evangeliſt immediately informs us) 'they underſtood not that ſaying, and were afraid to aſk him.' St. Mark ix. 31, 32. And in the ſame chapter we find, that after our Lord Jeſus was transfigured upon the mount, in the preſence of Peter, James, and John, 'As they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they ſhould tell no man what things they had ſeen, till the Son of man were riſen from the dead. And they kept that ſaying with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, queſtioning one with another what the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the dead ſhould mean.' Ver. 9, 10. This was what Chriſt taught them not only plainly, but alſo frequently. See St. Matt. xvi. 21. xvii. 9,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025050_0196_102D76B989314968"/>
22, 23. xx. 17, 18, 19. xxvi. 31, 32. St. Mark viii. 31. ix. 9, 10, 31, 32. X. 32, 33, 34. xiv. 27, 28. St. Luke ix. 21, 22, 44, 45. xviii. 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding the plainneſs and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe predictions, and the pains which Chriſt took to inſtil theſe ideas into them, they never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them at all until ſometime after they were fulfilled. For when they ſaw him taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of men, and treated exactly according to his own words often repeated, they were entirely diſappointed, and all their hopes ſeemed to die within them. And when he was riſen from the dead, they would not believe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe who had ſeen him, and would hardly truſt their own ſenſes, ſo ignorant were they of what he had told them.</p>
                  <p>St. John was the firſt of the diſciples who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he was riſen, for thus he writes 'Then went in alſo that other diſciple, who came firſt to the ſepulchre, and he ſaw and believed. For as yet they knew not the Scripture that he muſt riſe again from the dead.' Sr. John xx. 8, 9. This inſtance is ſo much to my purpoſe, and proves ſo evidently that a thing may be plainly revealed, and expreſſed in the cleareſt manner, and yet not be underſtood; that I hardly need mention any more. But I will mention another, and that is, the calling of the Gentiles. This was ſpoken of by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in the cleareſt language; and Jeſus after his reſurrection gave a full commiſſion to his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which one would think it was impoſſible for them to miſunderſtand.</p>
                  <p>'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, Go ye therefore and teach all nations,' &amp;c.

St. Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. 'Go ye unto all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature.' St. Mark xvi. 15.</p>
                  <p>'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead on the third day: and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem. And ye are witneſſes of theſe things.' St. Luke xxiv. 46, 47, 48. 'Ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you: and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me both in Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt part of the earth.' Acts i. 8. But the apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even after the miraculous deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, were without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſpecting the calling of the Gentiles, until St. Peter was taught it by a viſion from heaven. See Acts x.</p>
                  <p>And St. Paul ſpeaks of this ſubject as a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that was hid from ages and generations, and particularly revealed to him, and to the ſaints in that day. See Epheſ. iii. 1—11. Col. i. 25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when I conſider that the apoſtles themſelves could not for a time ſee thoſe things to be revealed, which yet were moſt plainly, fully, and frequently told them, I cannot wonder that many great and good men now ſhould not ſee the general Redemption and final Reſtoration of all things plainly revealed in the Scriptures, though to me ſcarce any ſubject appears more evident. It gives me now but little concern to hear many ſay, that they cannot ſee the matter plainly declared in the Bible, ſince I know that things have been there that wiſe and good men could not ſee; and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:025050_0198_102D76BB17259538"/>
what has happened in times paſt may take place now: and if I can ſee for myſelf, this great truth made known, it is enough for me. I am not to enquire, What does this man believe? Or, What ſhall the other do? I muſt believe what the Scripture appears to me to teach, and do what I am there commanded, let others believe or do as they may.</p>

                  <p>But I have heard ſome ſay of you, 'How comes this man to know more than all the world? Have there not been many great, wiſe, and good men in all ages, that have never thought of theſe things? If this doctrine of the final Reſtoration of all things had been true, ſurely our wiſe, good, and learned miniſters would have diſcovered it, and proclaimed it long ago. But the doctrine of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery is a point in which they ſeem generally to agree, however they differ in other matters, and therefore it muſt be true, and this doctrine of the general Reſtoration, which this man holds up, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone, muſt be falſe.'</p>

                  <p>I am very far from pretending to be wiſer than any that have gone before me; and as for this doctrine of the Reſtoration it was not only believed and preached by the apoſtles, but many of the ancient fathers who liveth in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity, were bold witneſſes for this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth. It is true that when the Church of Rome roſe to ſupreme power, the Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils endeavoured to extirpate the <hi>merciful doctors</hi> (as thoſe who believed the general Reſtoration, were called in deriſion) and their adherents, but it was not until near the cloſe of the ſeventh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, that they were able to ſilence the witneſſes for this truth. This, (as well as many other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:025050_0199_102D76E897E9FA90"/>
truths) then lay hid until the reformation, when it began a little to revive, and hath gradually increaſed ever ſince. Several great authors have written upon it; many hundreds, and even thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have believed it, and found comfort and joy therein. Nay, there are many miniſters who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it now as firmly as I do, but do not chuſe to confeſs or preach it, for various reaſons; and great numbers of private chriſtians enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs of believing it ſecretly. But put the caſe that I ſtood alone in this teſtimony, yet if upon a fair examination, the Scriptures hold forth this idea, and if all objections againſt it may be fully anſwered; why ſhould my teſtimony be refuſed on the account of its ſingularity? God has an abſolute right to uſe what means or inſtruments he pleaſes, to manifeſt his truth, and to fulfil his purpoſes; and though I am nothing, and in his ſight am leſs than nothing, yet he is able by the things that are not, to confound and bring to nought the things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. 1 Cor. i. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that the generality of miniſters in the preſent day profeſs to believe endleſs miſery, though they diſagree in other points; and indeed one reaſon why they fall out ſo much about other doctrines, is, becauſe they receive this as a firſt principle, as is very obvious; for were thoſe who believe that Chriſt died only for a part of mankind, once to give up the idea of endleſs miſery, they would acknowledge the univerſality of the love of God, and confeſs that Jeſus died for all in the fulleſt ſenſe. And on the other hand, if thoſe who believe in general redemption, were not ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tenacious of the doctrine of endleſs miſery,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025050_0200_102D73A2213EDD40"/>
they would not oppoſe the doctrine of election, nor hold that the will of God might be finally fruſtrated, and that the death of Chriſt ſhall be in vain, with reſpect to many, and that many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the divine love ſhall finally periſh to all eternity. Theſe inconſiſtencies in their ſentiments, and the conteſts between them and thoſe who hold partial redemption and ſalvation, are therefore chiefly, if not wholly owing to both parties being agreed in this moſt dreadful doctrine of endleſs miſery.</p>
                  <p>It is beautiful to obſerve the progreſſion of the glorious goſpel, from its opening to our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the garden down to the preſent day. I have ſometimes mentioned, in public, that the more the goſpel is known and revealed, the larger and richer it appears.</p>
                  <p>It firſt ſeemed confined to one family or nation, but later diſcoveries ſhewed that all nations had a part therein, and all ſorts of people were deſigned to ſhare in its bleſſings: now the glorious news begins to be publiſhed abroad, not only that all nations, and all ſorts of people, but all perſons and individuals, without exception, not only <hi>may</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of its benefits, but <hi>ſhall</hi> in due time enjoy great advantages thereby.</p>
                  <p>God always adapts his remedies to the evils that prevail in the world; and therefore he hath opened his counſels to men according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent capacities, needs, and circumſtances. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity might, formerly, have been received and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely practiſed, without being inveſtigated at all; but when infidelity riſes up and attacks it, as it does in this our age, it becomes the duty of its friends to defend it, by enquiring into its meaning; and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025050_0201_102D74D791B0A7F0"/>
laying all prejudices aſide, to receive as truth thoſe things which God hath revealed, and the ſame to vindicate before the world.</p>
                  <p>It might not formerly have been neceſſary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the prophecies; and yet now, as the time of their fulfilment draws nigh, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more important, be more ſtudied, and better underſtood; and for this purpoſe, God may actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally illuminate the minds of ſome, to ſet them forth in a more national, ſcriptural, conſiſtent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than they have appeared in hitherto. And if it ſhould pleaſe God to make any uſe of my tongue or pen for this great purpoſe, the glory ſhall be all aſcribed to his name, to whom alone it is due; I ſhall have nothing to glory or boaſt of, foraſmuch as I can only communicate what I receive; and I hope none will refuſe to receive the truth, however weak or unworthy the inſtrument by which God may pleaſe to ſend it.</p>

my natural nor acquired abilities, are worthy to be compared to thoſe of many excellent charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who hold the contrary ſentiments: yet the goodneſs of the cauſe in which I am engaged, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires me with courage to attempt its vindication, let who will enter the liſts with me. For when the evidence of this moſt glorious truth firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear to my mind, I was determined never to believe or profeſs it, until I could anſwer every objection that could be brought from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt it, fairly, and without any torturing or twiſting the words of truth; and it pleaſed God ſo to open matters to my view, as to take every objection out of my mind, and to clear up every doubt, in ſuch a manner, that I have full ſatisfaction: And I can ſafely ſay, in the fear of God, that I am ſo far from being offended with thoſe who queſtion me upon the matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give me an opportunity of anſwering for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I take it as an act of kindneſs; and as I ſtand ready to be reproved wherein I am out of the way, ſo I ſhall thank the perſon who, in the ſpirit of love, convinces me of error: 'Let the righteous ſmite me; it ſhall be a kindneſs: and let them reprove me; it ſhall be an excellent oil, which ſhall not break my head.' But let not the man who would write, dip his pen in gall; nor he that would converſe, make his tongue as a ſharp ſword: but 'Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Chriſt's ſake, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you. Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025050_0203_102D711BA5816CD8"/>
humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. And, above all things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs, And let the peace of God rule in your hearts.' Theſe are the tempers of mind we ought always to poſſeſs; and eſpecially, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the great things of the kingdom of God.</p>

                  <p>I have the ſame deſires that you expreſs; and I think it is to the ſhame of human nature, and a reproach to the innocent cauſe of Chriſtianity, that religious diſputes have been carried on with ſuch amazing bitterneſs and acrimony. Men ſeem frequently to forget that they are brethren; and that they muſt all ſtand before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt. If they remembered theſe things, as they ought, they would not revile, cenſure, judge, and condemn each other, as they do: From which evil practices may the good Lord preſerve us, while we debate this very important ſubject; for though I am determined to urge every thing that I can with propriety, in the ſtrongeſt manner that I am able, yet I am willing to ſtipulate on my part, that if I ſhould uſe any reproachful or cenſorious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the remainder of the debate, I will give you leave to conſider it as totally giving up the cauſe in which I am engaged.</p>

xxiii. 38, 39. St. Luke xiii. 35. It is more than intimated in theſe words—'And ſo <hi>all Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved. For GOD hath concluded them all in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that he might have mercy upon all,' Rom. xi. 26, 32. 'In JEHOVAH ſhall <hi>all</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> be juſtified, and ſhall glory,' Iſai. xlv. 25.

And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called, The children of the living God,' Rom. ix. 25, 26. 'Now will I bring again the captivity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and have mercy upon the <hi>whole</hi> houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them,' Ezek. xxxix. 25, 28.

                  <p>But Mr. POOLE'S Continuators, as well as many other eminent divines, tell us, that theſe which you take to be promiſes, are only dreadful threatenings; and their meaning is this:—I never will bring again the captivity of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and her daughters; nor the captivity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and her daughters; neither will I ever bring again the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>thy captives,</hi> in the midſt of them: when <hi>Sodom</hi> and her daughters ſhall return to their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſtate, (which is impoſſible) and <hi>Samaria</hi> and her daughters ſhall return to their former eſtate, (which ſhall never be) then <hi>thou</hi> and thy daughters ſhall return to your former eſtate: but that time ſhall never come.</p>

                  <p>I know, ſuch is their interpretation, which proves nothing more than the weakneſs of their cauſe; for in all this, they expreſsly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict GOD, who, from the 60th verſe to the end of the chapter, promiſes bleſſings to Jeruſalem in the moſt abſolute manner; That he will remember the covenant made with her in the days of her youth, and will eſtabliſh unto her an everlaſting covenant; that ſhe ſhall receive her ſiſters, <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> (called her <hi>elder</hi> and her <hi>younger</hi> ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters); and he promiſes to give them to her, for
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025050_0209_102D71213B7367F8"/>

                  <p>How many promiſes has GOD made to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the prophecies, of not only bringing her <hi>captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and returning her to her <hi>former eſtate;</hi> but even cauſing greater bleſſings than ever to come to her, and of doing <hi>better</hi> to her than in her <hi>beginning,</hi> making her an <hi>eternal excellency,</hi> a <hi>joy</hi> of <hi>many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore very ſurpriſing, that men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to believe the Bible, ſhould dare be ſo bold as to deny theſe promiſes, and declare, that GOD will never bring <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to her former eſtate! They might, indeed, ſafely ſay, that the promiſes have not yet been fulfilled; but it is too bold to aſſert, That therefore they will never be accompliſhed. Were there no other text to prove the Reſtoration of the Jews who died in their ſins, and indeed of the whole fallen race of Adam, I ſhould judge this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;—'<hi>All</hi> that the <hi>Father giveth me, ſhall come to me;</hi> and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the <hi>Father's</hi> will, which hath ſent me, that of <hi>all</hi> which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe <hi>nothing;</hi> but ſhould raiſe it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the laſt day,' St. John vi. 37, 38, 30. Here we find that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> declares, not only
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:025050_0210_102D73AEB3463498"/>
that <hi>all</hi> that the <hi>Father giveth</hi> him <hi>ſhall come</hi> to him; but alſo, that they ſhall come in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as in no wiſe to be <hi>coſt out;</hi> and that ſuch is the <hi>Father's</hi> will, that nothing of all which he hath given to the <hi>Son,</hi> ſhould be loſt, or miſſing, at that great day when he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to the <hi>Father,</hi> who did put all things under him; and as this is the will of that <hi>God who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will;</hi> and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> has undertaken the accompliſhment of this will of the <hi>Father,</hi> it concludes abſolutely and forcibly againſt the doctrine of <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> and <hi>annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>That is all that I contend for: I ground the univerſal Reſtoration of all things, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two premiſes, which I call the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor,</hi> 1. That <hi>all things</hi> are given to the <hi>Son,</hi> without exception: 2. That <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>given him, ſhall come to him,</hi> in ſuch a manner as <hi>not to be caſt out;</hi> and that none ſhall be miſſing, loſt, or wholly deſtroyed, but ſhall be forth-coming, in that great day when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall give up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the <hi>Father.</hi>

                  <p>But can you prove your <hi>major?</hi> I am ſenſible that the <hi>minor</hi> has been the great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which <hi>particular redemption,</hi> &amp;c. has been ſupported; but if the <hi>major</hi> can be proved, it will ſet the ſtrongeſt weapons of thoſe who hold <hi>partial decrees,</hi> &amp;c. directly againſt them, and will give another turn, to the argument.</p>

                  <p>I can prove the <hi>major</hi> by the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive expreſſions as the <hi>minor,</hi> and by more paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

of Scripture; and you ſhall judge for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether I quote them fairly, and whether they can be invalidated by any arguments which will not, at the ſame time, invalidate the <hi>minor.</hi> I will ſet down the ſeveral texts at large, as they are of great importance.</p>
                  <p>St. Matth. x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'<hi>All things</hi> are delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me of my <hi>Father:</hi> and no man knoweth the <hi>Son</hi> but the <hi>Father:</hi> neither knoweth any man the <hi>Father,</hi> ſave the <hi>Son,</hi> and he to whomſoever the <hi>Son</hi> will reveal him.' The very ſame words are mentioned by St. Luke: See chap. x. 22.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt ſtriking paſſages of this kind, are found in the goſpel of St. John, chap. iii. 35. and xiii. 3. 'The <hi>Father</hi> loveth the <hi>Son,</hi> and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>all things</hi> into his hands. <hi>Jeſus</hi> knowing that the <hi>Father</hi> had given <hi>all things</hi> into his hands, and that he was come from <hi>God,</hi> and went to <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c.'</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Thus, <hi>all things</hi> are given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> being both proved from Scripture, we may venture to draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion:</p>
                  <p>If <hi>all things</hi> are given into the hands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the <hi>Father;</hi> and all that the <hi>Father</hi> giveth, or hath given, ſhall come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as not to be caſt out; then ſhall all men be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                  <p>Here the whole Chriſtian world may unite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either party being obliged to give up their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite tenets: and while ſome ſtrongly contend,

                  <p>But as <hi>all things</hi> or <hi>all men,</hi> without exception, are given to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he might reſtore, or bring them back to God, in his own way and time; ſo is he inveſted with <hi>all power,</hi> that he might be able to accompliſh ſo great a work. <hi>Jeſus ſpake,</hi> ſaying, '<hi>All power</hi> is given unto me, in Heaven and in earth,' St. Matth. xxviii. 18, 'For as the <hi>Father</hi> hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the <hi>Son</hi> to have life in himſelf; and hath given him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man,' St. John v. 26, 27. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> has power to quicken ſouls who are dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins; See Epheſ. ii. 1. He himſelf ſaith; 'Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and they that hear, ſhall live, St. John v. 25. He hath power to raiſe all the dead that are in their graves; for he ſaith, 'Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth: they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the reſurrection of damnation,' verſe 29.

And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom thou haſt ſent,' St. John xvii. 2, 3. Here we ſee that his power over all fleſh was given him for this grand purpoſe, that ultimately he might give eternal life; not only endleſs exiſtence, but the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>all</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; which are all without exception.—This is the will of <hi>God,</hi> that of <hi>all</hi> which he hath given the <hi>Son,</hi> he ſhould loſe nothing; but ſhould give eternal life, even the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> which he alone can give, to all, without reſerve, whom the <hi>Father</hi> hath given him; this is the will which <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to do, and this he hath power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.—Now, if he came purpoſely to do the will of <hi>God;</hi> and if it is the will of <hi>God,</hi> that of all that the <hi>Father</hi> hath given to the <hi>Son,</hi> he ſhould loſe nothing; but ſhould bring all to himſelf, in ſuch a manner as that they ſhould not be caſt out, and give them all eternal life; and if all, without

                  <p>If we did not underſtand theſe words with ſome limitation, it would be as difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them with other paſſages of Scripture, as with the doctrine of the Reſtoration; but if we only limit the time, all is eaſy; 'He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy;' nevertheleſs it is added, 'but mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth againſt judgment,' James ii. 13. The way I anſwer all theſe threatenings, and ſhew them to be conſiſtent with that boundleſs mercy of GOD, that is over all his works, is, to ſhew, that both wrath and mercy have their ſeaſon; that <hi>anger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="unknown:025050_0218_102D73FCA34F1FA0"/>
but a <hi>moment,</hi> but that <hi>mercy endureth for ever;</hi> which glorious declaration is expreſſed more than forty times in the Scripture; and that God frequently threatens the greateſt judgments, and promiſeth the greateſt mercies, to the ſame people and perſons. 'Thus ſaith JEHOVAH, Thy bruiſe is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cauſe, that thou mayeſt be bound up: thou haſt no healing medicines. All thy lovers have forgotten thee: they ſeek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chaſtiſement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; becauſe thy ſins were increaſed. Why crieſt thou for thine affliction? Thy ſorrow is incurable, for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thine iniquity: becauſe thy ſins were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, I have done theſe things unto thee.' Now, who would not think, from reading theſe words, that theſe people were in a moſt hopeleſs ſtate, beyond the reach of mercy; and that it was in vain for them even to ſeek it?—And yet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next words ſpeak a language directly contrary. 'Therefore all they that devour thee, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, &amp;c. For I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, ſaith JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH; becauſe they called thee an Outcaſt, ſaying, This is <hi>Zion,</hi> whom no man ſeeketh after.' See Jer. xxx. 12—17. I could juſtify this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by hundreds of paſſages wherein GOD threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens his people with judgments the moſt ſevere, and declares—that his eye ſhall not pity, nor his arm ſave; that he will viſit their tranſgreſſions upon them, will utterly caſt them off, and will not have compaſſion on them at all; and then ſuch promiſes of mercy break out as are ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:025050_0219_102D712DD883C1C0"/>
every one with their greatneſs. But time would fail to quote them at large. GOD, by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, ſays, 'I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael; but I will utterly take them away. For ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.' And then immediately ſays, ſpeaking of a time to come, 'And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, 'Ye are the ſons of the living GOD.' See Hoſea, i. 6, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>The whole prophecy, indeed, ſeems of a piece with this ſpecimen. In the ſecond chapter it is ſaid, 'Plead with your mother, plead: for ſhe is not my wife, neither am I her huſband; and I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.' Then he goes on to pronounce many dreadful threatenings; but the chapter cloſes with the moſt amazing promiſes of mercies to the ſame people, under the ſimilitude of a wife that had been rejected, and after a long time received again. 'And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the <hi>Lord.</hi> And I will ſow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will ſay to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my GOD;' See Hoſ. ii. 2, 4, 19, 20, 23. Thus the objection admits of a fair and rational anſwer; and I have been the larger upon it, becauſe I judged it of great importance to clear it up thoroughly: but more paſſages upon

                  <p>The next objection I ſhall bring is from Job xxxvi. 18. 'Becauſe there is wrath, beware left he take thee away with his ſtroke; then a great ranſom cannot deliver thee.'

                  <p>This would be one of the ſtrongeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that you have yet advanced, if the words a <hi>great ranſom,</hi> had any alluſion to the blood of the dear <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and if it could be fairly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it can have no power over the dead; but I apprehend, when you read and conſider the text, context, and ſimilar paſſages, you will ſee that no ſuch thing is intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had frequently wiſhed for death in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and anguiſh, (as many perſons fooliſhly and wickedly do, that have never felt the tenth part of his afflictions) for which <hi>Elihu</hi> juſtly reproves him, in theſe words; 'Becauſe there is wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

leſt he take thee away with his ſtroke; then a great ranſom cannot deliver thee,' from death and the grave; from being cut off by the hand of Heaven, juſtly provoked by thy raſhneſs: 'Will he eſteem thy riches?' Will he account thy great riches a ranſom for thy life? 'No not gold, nor all the forces of ſtrength:' Wouldeſt thou give ever ſo much of the precious ore to ranſom thy life, it would be unavailable; or, ſhouldeſt thou truſt in thy ſtrength of body or mind; ſhouldeſt thou plead the readineſs of thy wit, the ſtrength and greatneſs of thy judgment, memory, and other faculties; thy benevolence of diſpoſition; thy uſefulneſs in life, thy numerous connections, the great honours that await thee; wert thou a monarch, and couldeſt thou command armies and valiant hoſts, ſtrong and mighty; all theſe things would be totally diſregarded by God, if he, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by thy raſhneſs, ſhould give thee thy wiſh, and iſſue the <hi>death warrant</hi> againſt thy life: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſidering theſe things, 'Deſire not the night (of death and eſpecially ſudden death) when people are cut off in their place,' and there is no remedy, no ranſom, no diſcharge in that war; from which neither power, wiſdom, might, riches, honours, wickedneſs, nor even virtue, can deliver. 'Take heed, regard not iniquity;' do not ſin in any wiſe, and eſpecially do not raſhly wiſh for death; which is very preſumptuous and heaven daring; 'for this thou haſt choſen, rather than affliction:' See Job xxxvi. 18, 19, 20, 21. This is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the plain meaning of the text, and is confirmed by Pſal. xlix. 6, 7, 8, 9. 'They that truſt in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom

for him: (For the redemption of their ſoul is precious, and it ceaſeth for ever.) That he ſhould ſtill live for ever, and not ſee corruption.' But, though the power of wealth, wiſdom, and ſtrength, are not ſufficient to buy a ſhort reprieve from death; yet the power of GOD is able to ranſom therefrom, and to redeem from the grave, or hell, as I have noticed before; and which is expreſſed in the laſt-mentioned Pſalm, in the following terms; 'But GOD will redeem my ſoul from the power of the grave; for he ſhall receive me,' ver. 15. And by the ſame parity of reaſoning, that the power of the HIGHEST is able alſo to redeem or ranſom, the bodies of men from the grave, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have periſhed there: he is able alſo to redeem ſouls from ſin and miſery, if it be his pleaſure; and, by the blood of the MESSIAH'S, covenant, to ſend ſorth his priſoners out of the pit wherein is no water, not even a drop to cool the tongues of thoſe who are tormented there. I have therefore no doubt, but, the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is able to redeem to the uttermoſt, and is ſufficient to deſtroy the power of ſin, death, and hell. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the text on which your objection is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can depreciate the merit of that cleanſing, all-powerful blood, by proving that it cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to loſt ſouls.</p>

                  <p>No; I have not forgot that ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are found in the Bible; and I believe they were written with a deſign to make us diligent, and wiſely to improve our time and talents; and that we ſhould be liberal in giving alms, which ſeems eſpecially to be the meaning of the laſt, if we may judge by the connection in which it is found, and without which I am not able to ſay what it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends: But, in this caſe, they do not appear to me to be any thing to the purpoſe, one way or the other; and yet no Scriptures are more frequently brought than theſe againſt the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of all things; but commonly accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome additions; ſuch as—'There is no repentance in the grave; Nor pardon offered to the dead.'—'And as death leaves us, ſo judgment finds us.'—Words that I have never found in the Bible; but were they repeated ever ſo often, could not affect this argument; ſince the general Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot happen till long after the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will not be wholly comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the grave until the reſurrection, they can never bring this text with any conſiſtency againſt the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſtoration of all men; becauſe, let what will be the ſtate of things in the grave, nothing can prevent our Saviour from raiſing all at laſt, and changing them finally for the better, if ſuch be his pleaſure. I might, therefore, juſt as well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, from the vii. and xiv. chapters of Job, to prove, that there ſhall be <hi>no reſurrection of the dead from their graves,</hi> notwithſtanding the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous promiſes of that grand event; as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove, from theſe and ſimilar paſſages, that <hi>all men ſhall not be finally reſtored;</hi> ſince what is ſaid in thoſe chapters ſeems ten times more againſt the <hi>former,</hi> than any thing that can be urged from theſe is againſt the <hi>latter.</hi> The doctrine of the general <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the juſt and unjuſt; and a ſtate of <hi>rewards</hi> for the former, and <hi>puniſhments</hi> for the latter, according to their works; and alſo the <hi>ſubjection, final reconciliation,</hi> and <hi>re-union of</hi> ALL <hi>things in</hi> CHRIST, are all expreſsly revealed, and are made the ſubject of prophecies, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and promiſes; and are all truths, that cannot be overthrown by any reaſonings, as they are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by GOD himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture, in abundance of places, highly recommends liberality; and, in the moſt poſitive manner, aſſures the bounteous, that they ſhall be bleſſed: I need not recite paſſages to prove, what is ſo univerſally known and confeſſed. <hi>Solomon,</hi> therefore, having given many excellent precepts to direct us in other matters, comes to exhort us to be bountiful and liberal, in diſtributing to the neceſſities of others what GOD hath bleſſed us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; ſaying, 'Caſt thy bread upon the waters; for

thou ſhalt find it after many days. Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight; for thou knoweſt not what evil ſhall be upon the earth. If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themſelves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the ſouth, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the north; in the place where the tree fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there it ſhall be.' Thereby intimating to us, that as certainly as theſe plain common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are true, (than which nothing can be more ſo) ſhall they who beſtow liberally upon the poor and needy, be rewarded; ſince GOD has promiſed, and he will perform: See, upon this ſubject, Deut. xv. 10, 11.—Pſal. xli. 1, 2, 3, cxii.—Prov. xi. 24, 25, 26. xiv. 31. xix. 17. xxii. 9.—St. Matth. vi. 3, 4, x. 42.—St. Luke vi. 38. xii. 33. xiv. 12, 13, 14.—2 Cor. viii. 9.—1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19—and many other places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> then goes on upon the ſame ſubject, and intimates to us, by two ſtriking metaphors, that if we wait till no difficulties appear in our way to hinder us from performing our duty, we ſhall never reap the bleſſing; and after giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that GOD has many ſecret ways of working, far above our comprehenſion, and can therefore bleſs and reward us in many ways out of our own ſight, or the view of others, and yet no leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly than children are conceived, nouriſhed, and receive life in the womb, though we know not how; he comes to give us a warm and preſſing exhortation, to be conſtant in doing good to all, according to our power; and to be ſo far from concluding that to be loſt that we thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, that we ought to conſider alms as ſeed ſown in a fruitful ſoil, and ſhould, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wait for the glorious harveſt, when, through

the divine bleſſing, we may expect to reap an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold.</p>
                  <p>All this is plain and eaſy: But how any text in this beautiful chain, ſhould ever have been thought to have any alluſion to the ſtate of ſouls departed, or brought as a proof that no alteration can take place after death, I cannot conceive. But, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to have any relation at all to a future ſtate, it cannot then in the leaſt diſprove, that very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial changes may happen to ſouls in the ſpiritual world; ſince a tree cut down by its owner, lies not long in the ſame poſition in which it falls, but is applied to various uſes, according to its fitneſs and his pleaſure. But as this is nothing to the purpoſe, I think I have taken too much pains here already; and I ſhould have ſaid little or nothing upon this part of the objection, were it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually urged, as though the whole controverſy turned and terminated upon this alluſion, than which, nothing ſeems farther from the meaning of the text; which, in its true ſenſe, appears to be this—That as certainly as full clouds muſt empty themſelves upon the terraqueous globe, and that every thing is <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>where it is,</hi> and no where elſe; and as a tree falling to the ſouth, does not fall and lie to the north; and, <hi>vice verſa,</hi> ſo, with the ſame certainty, ſhall liberality be bleſt and rewarded.</p>

In this view, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations are conſiſtent with truth; but in no other.

                  <p>Thus, it is plain, that a living dog is better (more uſeful in this world) than a dead lion; which is no longer capable of doing good or evil; that a man, when he dies, loſes all hopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment in this life, and is rendered incapable of exerciſing the functions of it any longer; has no more a portion in any thing belonging thereto. Thus, in fine, all the obſervations that can be fairly made, upon this and ſimilar paſſages, belong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the preſent ſtate of things; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not at all affect the argument, either one way or the other.</p>

                  <p>This is ſo plain, that nothing can be more ſo; but our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words (St. John ix, 4.) deſerve a particular conſideration:—'I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work:'—which is explained commonly of the night of death, when no more works can he wrought.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord was diligent in his labour; he conſtantly went about doing good; he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver idle; he was in haſte, till he had finiſhed the work which his father had given him to do.

ſtate of our exiſtence; which if we here neglect, we never can perform at all, and of conſequence, never obtain the rewards which are promiſed to the obedient: but as it is not the ſtate of rewards and puniſhments that we are now diſcourſing about, but a ſtate beyond— even the Reſtoration of all things; neither is the diſpute about what <hi>men</hi> can do after this life, but what GOD can do, or what he has purpoſed to do with and for them, in the ages to come, after the dreadful ſentence is paſt; whether they ſhall be left under the ſame, <hi>while God exiſts;</hi> or whether they ſhall ever be reſtored; or whether they ſhall be annihilated: this, you know, is the ſtate of the queſtion: ſome hold the <hi>firſt,</hi> and others the <hi>laſt:</hi> but I am apt to think both theſe opinions are extremes, and therefore judge it ſafeſt to maintain the <hi>ſecond,</hi> which I take to be the medium here.</p>

                  <p>Indeed I am convinced, that no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance preceding the general judgment, can affect the argument; becauſe we are informed, that the condemnation of the wicked ſhall be at that day; then GOD will render to them according to their deeds, and will ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> &amp;c.—But the following texts of Scripture form a ſtrong objection to the univerſal Reſtoration, which I would wiſh you well to conſider.</p>
                  <p>'The expectation of the wicked ſhall periſh; and the hypocrite's hope ſhall periſh: Whoſe hope ſhall be cut off, and whoſe truſt ſhall be a ſpider's web. He ſhall lean upon his houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand; he ſhall hold it faſt, but it ſhall not endure. The heaven ſhall reveal his iniquity, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him. The eyes of the wicked ſhall fail, and they ſhall not eſcape;

                     </gap>ors. For what is the hope of the wicked, though he hath gained, when GOD taketh away his ſoul? Will GOD hear his cry, when trouble cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy. When a wicked man dieth, his expectation ſhall periſh; and the hope of unjuſt men periſheth. Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded: But ye have ſet at nought all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh come upon you: Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of JEHOVAH. They would none of my counſel: they deſpiſed all my reproof. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.' Prov. x. 28. Job viii. 13, 14, 15 xx. 27. xi. 20. xviii. 14. xxvii. 8, 9. Prov. xxix. 1. xi. 7. i. 24—31.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and abundance of other ſimilar paſſages, declare the future ſtate of the wicked to be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, without hope; they and their hopes periſh together, as the ſpider's web; they have no hopes or proſpect of being redeemed; they can look for nothing but judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour them as ſtubble fully dry, and as thorns cut up ſhall they be burned in the fire. Solomon

ſays, 'The expectation of the wicked is wrath,' Prov, xi. 23. 'As he loved curſing, ſo ſhall it come unto him: as he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo ſhall it be far from him. As he cloathed himſelf with curſing, like as with his garment; ſo ſhall it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones,' Pſal. cix. 17, 18. Indeed he can have no hopes, when he conſiders that he hath neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great a ſalvation all his life; that he hath ſet at nought GOD'S counſels, deſpiſed his reproofs: that when his CREATOR called to him to turn, he had no ears to hear his voice; and therefore, when ſorrow ſhall overtake, though he may cry, he ſhall not be regarded of God; and though he may ſeek, he ſhall not find: the Maſter of the houſe having riſen up, and ſhut to the door, all knocking for entrance is in vain, even though ſuch were to plead for admittance in the moſt earneſt manner, ſaying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us;' he ſhall anſwer, 'I know you not whence you are;' and though they may reiterate, and expoſtulate, ſaying, 'We have eaten and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets;' he ſhall not be moved, but ſhall ſay to them, 'I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth, when they ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and they themſelves thruſt out.' St. Luke xiii. 25, 26, 27, 28. See alſo, St. Matth. vii. 21, 22, 23, xxv. 11, 12.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are awful warnings, indeed; and were they attended to as they ought to be, would be ſufficient, one would think, to deter men from their evil ways: I am glad that you have
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:025050_0233_102D713A97A7FC08"/>
ſtated them in this moſt ſtriking point of light; for though they form no real objection to my views of GOD'S dealing with men, as I underſtand the Scriptures, they are an inſuperable bar to the opinions of thoſe who deny a future ſtate of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, which I think impoſſible for them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer fairly. I ſhall, however, notice briefly, ſome things in this collection of Scriptures, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that my ſentiments may appear in their true light.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the hopes of the wicked, ungodly, and hypocrites, ſhall periſh at their death.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps they hoped to have lived long, to have enjoyed health, wealth, pleaſure, and all worldly good, for many years; to have ſeen their children for many generations, flouriſhing for a long time on earth; but death deſtroys theſe hopes.</p>
                  <p>The hypocrites might have hoped that they ſhould have been accepted with GOD, on the account of their birth, parentage, profeſſion, rank among the people of GOD, obſervation of the externals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which vain hopes do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh at death.</p>
                  <p>The profane and wicked infidel, and practical atheiſt, might have hoped, either to have ceaſed to exiſt, or to have found ſome way of eſcaping the threatened puniſhment; but death deſtroys theſe hopes alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever may be the final intention of GOD towards theſe miſerable creatures, it is evident they are ſhut up in a ſtate of keen tormenting deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, or dreadful ſuſpenſe, and may be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they ſhall never be releaſed, of which it is likely they may not have even the moſt diſtant
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025050_0234_102D74A128879470"/>
hope, or the leaſt degree of knowledge—but, on the contrary, be in fearful expectation of more terrible puniſhment hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As they have lived and died in ſin, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or miſery, is certain—and there is no remedy, that can prevent their experiencing the conſequences of their crimes, and ſuffering the juſt puniſhment which ſhall be inflicted on them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different deſerts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They who live and die in rebellion againſt GOD, will be eternally deprived of the glories and honours of the kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might have poſſeſſed; will be excluded from a ſhare in the firſt reſurrection, and will be expoſed to ſuffer the torments of the ſecond death; which all muſt inevitably ſuffer, who remain incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible till the great day of judgment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As God hath called, and they have refuſed, it is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they, in their turn, ſhall cry in vain: yet nevertheleſs, though he may long delay, he may hear their cries, and deliver them at laſt. See Pſal. cvii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>David, in Pſalm xxxivth ſays, 'The face of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH is againſt them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.' Our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators not underſtanding, or not entertaining an idea of the future Reſtoration, add, '<hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> cry, and JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.' Whereas the Holy Ghoſt has put no ſuch words as <hi>the righteous</hi> into the text there; but after ſaying, that the face of JEHOVAH is againſt them that do evil, to deſtroy them out of the world, and to make them forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and their names to ceaſe upon the earth, it adds
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025050_0235_102D717AE0130388"/>
a word that ſignifies <hi>crying,</hi> and then ſays, 'And JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles:' See ver. 16, 17. This ſeems, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, like the doctrine of the Bible, which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſays, ſpeaking of the notoriouſly wicked; 'O my God, make them like a wheel: as the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the wind. As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame ſetteth the mountains on fire; ſo perſecute them with thy tempeſt, and make them afraid with thy ſtorm. Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded, and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to ſhame, and periſh. And they ſhall know (as the Hebrew word ſignifies, and as it is rendered in the old tranſlation) 'that thou, whoſe name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Moſt High over all the earth,' Pſal. lxxxiii. 13—18.—Here we ſee, in a beautiful and clear manner, that one grand deſign of God in bringing judgments, and even what is called utter deſtruction, upon men, is that they may know that he is JEHOVAH, the true God: and there are but few intelligent Chriſtians, but muſt, in ſome meaſure, be able to conceive hopes concerning all thoſe to whom the knowledge of God is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Though the threatenings in the prophecy of Ezekiel, both againſt the Jews and other nations, are uncommonly ſevere; yet they frequently cloſe with this gracious promiſe—'And they ſhall know that I am JEHOVAH'—or ſomething ſimilar; as will evidently appear to thoſe who will be at the pains of examining the following paſſages in that book.</p>
                  <p>EZEKIEL, vi. 7, 10, 13, 14. vii. 4, 9, 27. xi. 10, 12. xii. 15, 16, 20. xiii. 9, 14, 21, 23. xiv. 8.

                  <p>But does not puniſhment harden and inflame offenders, inſtead of ſoftening and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them? As we read, Iſa. viii. 21. 'They ſhall curſe their King and their GOD, and look upward:' and, in Rev. xvi. 9, 10, 11. 'And men were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſphemed the name of GOD, which hath power over theſe plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the GOD of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and their ſores; and repented not of their deeds.'</p>

                  <p>Puniſhment, to a certain degree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames and enrages, in a moſt amaſing manner; but continued longer, and heavier, produces a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect—ſoftens, humbles, and ſubdues. When Ephraim, of old, bemoaned himſelf, he ſaid thus:—'Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art JEHOVAH, my GOD,' Jer. xxxi. 18. The metaphor here uſed, expreſſes, in a moſt lively manner, the different effects of the ſame diſcipline, in its beginning, progreſs, and end. When a bullock firſt has the yoke laid on his neck, he frets, toſſes, and rages exceedingly; but, by a continuance of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, he is ſubdued, brought down, humbled, and tamed, ſo as to become the moſt uſeful and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:025050_0237_102D7324BB0CBEB8"/>
gentle of animals. The ſons of Zion are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as lying 'at the head of all the ſtreets, as a wild bull in a net; full of the fury of JEHOVAH, the rebuke of GOD,' Iſai. li. 20. A wild bull, in a net, muſt be a furious creature; ſo are men, when firſt they are brought under the Divine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But GOD knows how to correct men, in ſuch a manner as to bring them to ſubmit to him, in due time; and though ſome are ſo ſunk in ſin as not to be reformed, by any means, in this life; yet that is no argument, that GOD is not able to ſubdue and bring down the proud and moſt rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, in another ſtate, by means that may be uſed effectually there, though they could not be uſed here. GOD ſays, by the prophet to Iſrael. 'Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs any more till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee. So will I make my fury towards thee to reſt, and my jealouſy ſhall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry,' Ezek. xxiv. 13. xvi. 42. Some ſins are ſo daring and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to provoke GOD to threaten, that they ſhall not be purged away in this life; and, perhaps, their malignancy may be ſo great, that nothing that can be uſed here, is able to ſubdue them: Thus, when GOD threatened his people, of old, with deſtruction, they turned his threatenings into ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule: inſtead of weeping, mourning, baldneſs, and girding with ſackcloth, to which God called them; there was nothing but 'joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen, and killing ſheep, eating fleſh, and drinking wine: Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine ears, by JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH of Hoſts, Surely, this iniquity ſhall not be
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:025050_0238_102D74A4C7BBA8F8"/>
purged from you till ye die, ſaith JEHOVAH, God of Iſrael,' Iſai. xxii. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Thus, puniſhments are deſigned for the humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the proud: but if they fail of anſwering that purpoſe, as adminiſtered in the preſent ſtate, they will be continued and increaſed in future pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, to ſuch a degree, as ſhall bring all down in due time. Thoſe pains which produced that rage and blaſphemy which you mentioned, were all poured out on hardened ſinners in the preſent life; and were ſo terrible and ſevere as to produce thoſe fearful effects, but not ſufficiently ſo as to produce the contrary.</p>
                  <p>That puniſhment, to a certain degree, produces rage, but to a certain degree beyond, produces ſubmiſſion; may be illuſtrated by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fact, as well as many others, of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>In the former war between England and France, there was one Mr. —, of Virginia, who was waggon-maſter-general in the army of the Provincials. He was guilty of abuſing his power, by frequently ſtriking the ſoldiers with his waggon-whip. Complaint being made, a court-martial was held, and he was ſentenced to receive five hundred laſhes; which ſentence was executed upon him. When firſt he began to feel the laſh, he was exceedingly enraged, and curſed thoſe who had thus ſentenced him; ſwearing, that if he lived to be releaſed, he would kill them all, if poſſible; for that he valued not his life, in the leaſt, but would revenge this diſgrace, by killing them, wherever he found them; and much more, to the ſame purpoſe. But, before he had received half his puniſhment, he declared, that he had not the
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025050_0239_102D73277A063F80"/>
leaſt diſpoſition to lift his hand againſt them; he ſaw clearly that they had acted right; that he had been entirely to blame; and that his puniſhment was juſt. After his correction was over, he was led quietly away, entirely cured of all his rage; from which he was as much freed by his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ever an effect was produced by a cauſe. He was healed of his wounds, and, I think, reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his poſt.—Some time after the war was over, he was paſſing one day over thoſe mountains in Virginia, commonly called <hi>The Blue Ridge;</hi> and there he met alone one of the men who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, in the court-martial, to ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. He put him in mind of it; and told him, that it was now in his power to retaliate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The other acknowledged that he was in his power; but added, 'M—, you know you did wrong, and deſerved the puniſhment you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and if you kill me, I declare, that we did right in ſentencing you to be whipped; I ſhould do the ſame, were it to do again; and ſo would you have done, had you been in my place.' Mr. M—acknowledged the truth of it; and was ſo far from fulfilling his threatenings, that he ſuffered him to go in peace, highly commending him for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Mr. M— may be ſtill living: he was a general in the American army during the late war, and acquired great honour, for his valour and good conduct.</p>
                  <p>This I think is an argument <hi>ad hominem.</hi> I have often obſerved inſtances of the ſame nature, in a leſs degree; and I think it muſt be admitted, that although a certain degree of puniſhment will en flame, harden, and enrage; yet, farther degrees produce quite contrary effects. Nor is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:025050_0240_102D74A6C0BB0AD0"/>
the only thing in nature that produces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects, according to the quantity uſed; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things do the ſame. Thus, water, with a little ſalt in it, will cauſe pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

my only refuge, and truſting in his promiſes: And the caſe is the ſame with reſpect to the Reſtoration of all men. My weak reaſon tells me, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; that it is absolutely impoſſible, that ſuch hardened rebels can be ſo changed to eternity, as to become willing and obedient ſubjects: but when faith prevails, it informs me, that the things which are impoſſible with men, are poſſible with GOD; that nothing is too hard for JEHOVAH; and that he hath ſaid—'Behold, I am JEHOVAH, the the GOD of all fleſh: is there any thing too hard for me?' Jer. xxxii. 27. And the example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham has often proved a great ſupport to me in this caſe; 'who, againſt hope, believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was ſpoken, So ſhall thy ſeed be: and being not weak in faith, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not" the impediments, which, to the eye of reaſon, rendered the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes improbable, if not impoſſible. 'He ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promiſe of GOD, through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to GOD: And being fully perſuaded that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform,' Rom. iv. 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>This is the only way I anſwer this objection to my own ſatisfaction—GOD hath ſworn, that to him every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear, Iſai. xlv. 23.—That in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, things on earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhall confeſs, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is Lord, to the glory of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> Phil. ii. 10, 11. That it is the myſtery of his will, according to his good
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025050_0242_102D74A8B22AC600"/>
pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of the times, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, or rehead, in one, all things in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him, Epheſ. i. 9, 10,—And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, he is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reconcile all things unto himſelf; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in heaven, or things on earth, Col. i. 20.—That he worketh all things after the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own will, Epheſ. i. 11.—That he will have all men to be ſaved, or reſtored, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth, 1 Tim. ii. 6.—That the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands, St. John iii. 35.—And that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſaid, 'All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me; and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,' St. John vi. 37.—When I conſider theſe, and many ſuch like promiſes, which I find in the Scriptures; and that he that hath promiſed, is able to perform; hath wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all his words, how difficult or impoſſible ſoever the matter may ſeem, to our carnal, vain, and weak reaſoning; I caſt the whole of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon him; judging, that he is faithful who hath promiſed, and that, in his own time, he will fulfil all his purpoſes, and all his promiſes. But I confeſs to you, that it requires a faith, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more ſtrong than that of Abraham, to believe the doctrine of the Reſtoration ſtedfaſtly, in the midſt of ſo much evil as prevails in the world, and which ſeems to render it impoſſible: But my only hope is in GOD.</p>
                  <p>But, to encourage us the more, there are not only promiſes of what GOD will do, but examples
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025050_0243_102D739A41D0AD08"/>
of what he hath done, recorded in Scripture, as the caſes of <hi>Manaſſeh, Nebuchadnezzar, Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen, Saul,</hi> and many of the murderers of our Lord, prieſts, and even Phariſees, are left on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, as patterns of GOD'S long-ſuffering, power, mercy, and love.—And I would adviſe thoſe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that doubt of the univerſal Reconciliation of all things, to remember St. Paul's words to the Coloſſians, on this ſubject, chap. i. 21. 'And you that were ſome time alienated, and enemies in your mind, by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled;' as a proof and example of his power to reconcile all things. Let all remember their own ſtubbornneſs; and then, inſtead of reviling and deriding a truth which GOD has revealed, they will adore him, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are all things; who 'doeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?' Rom. xi. 36. Dan. iv. 35.</p>

                  <p>But allowing that God has power to change the hearts of the vileſt of men, is not the exerciſe of that power evidently limited? for I find it written in Rev. xxii. 11.—'He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill.' By theſe words it ſeems to be intimated, that the characters of both the wicked and the righteous, ſhall at ſome period be ſo confirmed and fixed, as to admit of no change or alteration.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:025050_0244_102D74AA817974E8"/>
of the Reſtoration, which ſeems eſtabliſhed upon many gracious promiſes. The words ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to a particular period, even when the Lord ſhall come, and ſhew that his coming will not, (as ſome ſuppoſe) change the characters of men; but that all ſhall continue, for a certain time, in the ſame character as before. But, though 'he that is unjuſt, ſhall be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſhall be filthy ſtill'—during the age of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſhall have the dreadful curſe pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon him; for, 'If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be anathema, Maran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atha: that is, Accurſed, the Lord cometh: 1 Cor. xvi. 22. Yet I truſt that I have proved, that the vileſt ſhall be finally changed; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe words muſt be underſtood with ſome limitation. And thus though this text is plainly contrary to the opinion of thoſe who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all the human race ſhall be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven at the day of judgment, yet it may be well reconciled to the ſyſtem laid down in theſe Dialogues; eſpecially if it can be proved that ſimilar expreſſions are uſed, where a limitation is ſuppoſed, or neceſſarily implied.</p>

                  <p>St. Paul ſays, 1 Cor. xiv. 38. 'But if any man be ignorant, let him him be ignorant:' But we can hardly ſuppoſe that he meant without limitation. So we read of the Jews, that 'GOD hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber; eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear, unto this day.' And David ſaith;—'Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.

Let their eyes be darkened that they ſhould not ſee, and bow down their back ALWAY,' Rom. xi, 8, 9, 10. Theſe expreſſions of their remaining in a blinded, hardened, and reprobate ſtate, are ſtronger than thoſe—'He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, &amp;c. for, inſtead of <hi>ſtill,</hi> the word <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> is uſed; and yet we are informed, that this 'blindneſs in part has (only) happened to Iſrael, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in: And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.' And that 'GOD hath concluded them all (<hi>or,</hi> ſhut them up together) in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,' even all whom he had ſhut up, or concluded in unbelief. And, as I obſerved before, David ſays; 'Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever: yea, let them be put ſhame, and periſh; That <hi>they</hi> may know that thou whoſe name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Moſt High over all the earth,' Pſal. lxxxiii. 16, 17, 18. Many other ſimilar paſſages might be mentioned; but theſe may ſuffice, to ſhew, that often where the words <hi>Let it,</hi> or <hi>Let them be,</hi> in ſuch-and-ſuch a ſtate, they only intend a certain period, until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpenſation takes place. As for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, holineſs, and happineſs, they have quite a different foundation from ſin and impurity, as I have ſhewn before; and therefore, no arguments uſed in favour of the total deſtruction of evil, can, in the leaſt, prove, that goodneſs, which is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence, ſhall ceaſe; but the contrary: and thoſe who are firmly joined to the LORD, and have continued with him through the ſtate of temptation, ſhall never ceaſe to be righteous, nor be ſeparated from their Head, from whom they ſhall derive

eternal life: for CHRIST hath ſaid, 'Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.' St. John xiv. 19.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST, at his coming, will bring every hidden thing to light, and ſhall take off all diſguiſes; ſo that he that is unjuſt, ſhall appear unjuſt; and he that is filthy, ſhall be diſcovered: hypocriſy ſhall be no more. 'The vile perſon ſhall be no more called liberal, nor the churl ſaid to be bountiful,' Iſai xxxii. 5. 'Then ſhall ye return, and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not,' Mal. iii. 18. The judgment of God is according to truth, and is deſigned to make an entire diſcovery of all perſons, and all ſecret things, 'that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,' Rom. iii. 19. But though judgment has its great uſe in diſcovering, laying open, convincing, and condemning; and puniſhment, in deſtroying, ſubduing, and humbling; yet the powerful, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of GOD, and the operation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, muſt have the glory of reſtoring, or creating men anew; and the blood of JESUS muſt cleanſe their ſouls from the guilt and pollution of ſin. Evil muſt be deſtroyed out of them: this is done by afflictions; and goodneſs muſt be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this is done by God's renewing power and grace.</p>
                  <p>But the objection may be anſwered another way, without any of this reaſoning, by conſidering the ſubject comparatively. Thus: As God only is holy; as none are good but he, in an abſolute ſenſe; as he putteth no truſt in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his ſight, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels he charged with folly; (See Job xv. 15. iv.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:025050_0247_102D739DF088F8F8"/>
18.) and as all intelligences, compared with him, are unjuſt and unclean; ſo, thoſe who have lived and died in rebellion againſt God, and in the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſin, may remain unjuſt and filthy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſaints, thoſe veſſels of honour and glory, who have purged themſelves. 'But in a great houſe there are not only veſſels of gold and ſilver, but alſo of wood, and of earth; and ſome to honour and ſome to diſhonour. If a man, therefore, purge himſelf from theſe (ſins), he ſhall be a veſſel of honour, ſanctified and meet for the maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work,' 2 Tim. ii. 20, 21. Here we may obſerve, that in our Lord's great houſe there ſhall be divers veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of various kinds, yet all uſeful, but ſome more highly ſo than others; that honour and diſhonour are comparative terms; and that the way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come veſſels of the higheſt honour at laſt, is to purge ourſelves from iniquity while on earth, by obeying the truth. For it muſt appear evident, from the nature of things, that there will always be an immenſe difference between thoſe who ſhall be kings and prieſts to God, and thoſe who ſhall be ſubdued in the ages to come, ſo as to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but who ſhall not attain to that honour and glory, which they ſhall have who ſuffer with Chriſt here, and ſhall be glorified with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

There is a terrible threatening, which is indeed the laſt in the Bible, that I ſhould be glad to hear your thoughts upon, which is thus expreſſed, (Rev. xxii. 18. 19.) 'For teſtify unto every man, that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book; If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, GOD ſhall add unto him the plagues that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book: And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, GOD ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book:' But I can almoſt foreſee how you will anſwer this; that though the plagues that are written in this book, ſhall be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet mercy ſhall finally rejoice againſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and though a man's part may be taken out of the book of life, and he, in conſequence, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the torments of the ſecond death: yet, as the time will come, when there ſhall be no more death of any kind, neither ſorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain; his Reſtoration may be certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; and though his part in the heavenly city may be forfeited, ſo that he may never become one of thoſe who ſhall reign therein, nor yet have a conſtant dwelling there; he may, nevertheleſs, enter as a worſhipper, and a ſubject of the great King; and may drink of the water of life; feed on the fruits of the tree of life, and be healed by its leaves; and be one of the happy inhabitants of the new earth, which God will create.</p>

hath here revealed, by adding vain interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own, contrary to the ſenſe of the text; nor in any wiſe to explain away, or weaken, the force of either the threatenings or promiſes, ſet forth in this wondrous book. The amazing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they ſhall feel that have theſe plagues added to them, and the dreadful loſs which they ſhall ſuſtain that have their part taken out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, cannot be even conceived: And it being poſſible to forfeit this glorious portion entirely, and for ever, made St. Paul warn the Hebrews in ſuch a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he doth throughout the whole epiſtle—Oh, what affecting advice is the following!—'Looking diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God; leſt any root of bitterneſs, ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Leſt there be any fornicator, or profane perſon, as Eſau; who, for one morſel of meat, ſold his birthwright. For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though he ſought it carefully, with tears,' Heb. xii. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>'Poor Eſau repented too late,</l>
                     <l>'That once he his birthright deſpis'd;</l>

Thus, though Eſau, as well as Jacob, was bleſſed concerning things to come; (See Heb. xi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o) yet the birthright, and the particular bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings connected therewith, he loſt for ever: And ſo it is poſſible that we may loſe our parts in the holy city, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſuch threatenings would ever have been made. For it is a maxim with me—That God never warns, where there is no danger to fear; and never encourages us to hope, where there is no poſſibility of obtaining.</p>
                  <p>As the glorious and univerſal deliverance of all men from the bondage of ſin, and their obtaining an inheritance in the new earth, was clearly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the great year of Jubilee, under the law; in which every ſervant went out free, and every man returned to his poſſeſſion, and to his family; (See Lev. xxv. 10.) So, the poſſibility of being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut off from the holy city, for ever, was pointed out by that notable exception, ver. 29, 30.—'And if a man ſell a dwelling-houſe in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is ſold; within a full year, may he redeem it.

                  <p>Something ſimilar to this may be found in Rev. iii. 11.—'Behold, I come quickly; hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown:' And the 5th verſe is alſo worthy of conſideration—'He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life; but I will confeſs his name before my Father, and before his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.'—

And then adds—'For I reckon that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us,' Rom. viii. 17, 18.

                  <p>A Preacher whom I once knew, encouraged this wickedly preſumptuous diſpoſition ſo far, as, openly, to ſay: 'God cannot damn me: He can as ſoon ceaſe to be God, as he can caſt me off: even though I ſhould ſin ever ſo much.

covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; and though he is anointed king over my people; I will not ſpare him: yea, though he 'were the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net upon my right hand; yet would I pluck thee thence.' Signets, upon the hands of ancient Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an monarchs, were thoſe ſeals with which their decrees were ſealed and confirmed: ſo that no man could reverſe them. Now, God declares, that if this man was ever ſo dear, and as neceſſary, to him, as the ſignet on the right hand of a king is to its owner; that though he was not able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his kingdom without his aſſiſtance; though he had been the deareſt and moſt uſeful thing: he would entirely caſt him off, for his tranſgreſſions. And how much more ſo, if it be conſidered, that no man is neceſſary to God; that man cannot be profitable to him; that neither our wickedneſs can hurt him, nor our righteouſneſs benefit him: (See Job xxii. 2, 3. xxxv. 6, 7, 8. Pſal. xvi. 2, 3.) And that he threatens to puniſh the only family that he had known on earth, for all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Amos iii. 2. What have not thoſe to fear, who have been placed in high ſtations, entruſted with precious treaſures, great abilities, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c. and have abuſed them!—Let ſuch read, and ſeriouſly conſider, St. Luke xii. 42—48.

                  <p>Theſe kind of reflections are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown out by the enemies of the Reſtoration, to caſt an odium upon the doctrine: But if they were to hear a man ſay; 'If I am juſt ſuffered to enter into this kingdom, and am not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a rebel, it is all I wiſh; I deſire neither the riches, honours, pleaſures, conveniencies, nor even the neceſſaries, that many of the inhabitants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: all I aſk is to be exempted from the pain and ſhame of public puniſhment:' And another was to add—'I can ſee little or no difference between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made heir apparent to the crown, poſſeſſing all the privileges, honours, dignities, &amp;c. of a prince of the blood; and being hanged, drawn, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for high treaſon; ſince even that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, painful and ſhameful as it is, muſt come to an end:' I aſk, Would they not eſteem both theſe men in a ſtate of inſanity, or worſe; entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoid of all ſenſe and reaſon? Yet, this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable language, is not worthy to be named in the ſame day with that which you mentioned. The difference is ſo great, I cannot find language to expreſs it.

                  <p>So they appear to me. But the ſyſtem you have laid down, appears equally calculated to check preſumption and deſpair, and to cure all ſuch ſpiritual madneſs; provided that they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

to it.—But, what will you ſay to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>annihilation? that</hi> may not be liable to the ſame objections as <hi>endleſs damnation;</hi> and ſo the wicked may be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> and deſtroyed, ſoul and body, in hell; and yet, at laſt, all beings that are in exiſtence may be made happy. The Scripture ſeems, in many places, to favour this idea; and the works of nature ſeem to confirm it. For inſtance; many fruits and animals periſh, before they arrive at perfection; and why may it not be ſo with the ſouls and bodies of men? they are no where ſaid to be raiſed to incorruption, or immortality; but to be deſtroyed, to be caſt into the lake of fire, to be burnt up, root and branch: to be conſumed, devoured, burnt up as chaff, thorns, &amp;c. I need not mention particular texts; becauſe the general part of the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Scriptures run in that ſtile. And I have ſometimes of late reaſoned with myſelf, that the ſecond death muſt end either in the reſtoration or annihilation of thoſe who were caſt therein; for there ſeemed ſomething in <hi>endleſs miſery,</hi> that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed my belief, at times. But I could not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy myſelf, whether the wicked would be finally reſtored to ſome degree of happineſs, or totally deſtroyed; and was apt to think the latter, as it ſeemed a ſtrange figure of ſpeech to call <hi>deſtruction,</hi> Reſtoration.—Pray, have you ever thought upon this matter?</p>

                  <p>There are but three poſſible things that can befal thoſe who are caſt into the ſecond death; either <hi>endleſs miſery, total annihilation,</hi> or <hi>Reſtoration:</hi> a fourth cannot be thought upon; and but one of theſe can be true.

one <hi>can</hi> be true, and one <hi>muſt</hi> be true; there are theſe two ways of diſcovering the truth: Firſt, if two of the propoſitions are proved to be abſurd, the third muſt ſtand: 2dly, if one be proved true, the others muſt fall to the ground of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. I have taken the ſecond method; and having ſhewed that the doctrine of the Reſtoration is not abſurd, and therefore that it is true; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the others are falſe.—But, beſides this way of arguing, there are three circumſtances which prove to my ſatisfaction,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>1.

                  <p>I truſt I can, in many inſtances: But I will fix upon one that is full to the purpoſe, and unexceptionable; and that is, the caſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and her daughters, <hi>Gomorrah, Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:025050_0257_102D74D005E0F970"/>
who, 'giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,' Jude 7.</p>
                  <p>As they are ſet forth for an example in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo alſo in their reſtoration: For we may certainly argue, that if any of the human race ſhall be annihilated, the inhabitants of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c. will be; as they were condemned with an overthrow, and made an example to thoſe who ſhould after live ungodly, 2 Pet. ii. 6. But theſe wicked nations ſhall have their captivity returned; ſhall return to their former eſtate; and ſhall be received by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as daughters, in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her daughters, more wicked themſelves, than <hi>Sodom</hi> and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhall be reſtored at the ſame time; ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ways, and be aſhamed; ſhall never open mouth any more to glory over the meaneſt of mankind; when the great JEHOVAH ſhall be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for all that ſhe has done, and towards <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> for all that they have done alſo, inaſmuch as they ſhall return from their long captivity, and be given to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> for daughters; See Ezek. xvi. 53, 55, 61, 63.</p>
                  <p>Now, by Sodom and her daughters being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from their long and dreadful captivity, we muſt underſtand one of three things: either, firſt, the return of their deſcendants; or, ſecondly, the reſtoration of the land whereon the cities ſtood; or, laſtly, the reſtoration of thoſe very perſons who were deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be the firſt; for there are none of their deſcendants remaining on earth: all were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:025050_0258_102D74B6F6CB8AC8"/>
by fire and brimſtone: none of the inhabitants eſcaped, Lot and his daughters excepted: who were only ſojourners, and were deſcendants of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, and relations to Abraham.</p>
                  <p>As it cannot be the firſt, let us try the ſecond. A very ingenious gentleman ſuppoſes, that in the time of the Millenium, the Dead Sea ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into land, and ſhall again become a beautiful, well-watered plain, and be given to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> For he argues, and ſeemingly very juſtly, that as God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> all the land which he could ſee from the place where he then ſtood; (See Gen. xiii. 14, 15, 16, 17.) and as the plain of <hi>Sodom</hi> was in ſight, it was included in the grant: and, though the Dead Sea now occupies the place where thoſe cities ſtood; yet God's promiſe cannot fail: and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Millenium, the Dead Sea ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and the place ſhall become a fruitful plain. But whoever will read Ezek. xlvii. 8, 9, 10, 11. may plainly ſee, that the waters that ſhall iſſue out from under the threſhold of the holy houſe, ſhall be brought into the Dead Sea; and ſhall ſo heal thoſe deadly waters, that they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fruitful, and bring forth fiſh in great abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; exceeding many, like the great ſea, which is now called the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> which fiſh ſhall be more uſeful for food, to the innumerable inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that ſhall then be in that happy country, than all the vegetables that would grow there, even though the whole place was turned into a fruitful garden.</p>

                  <p>But are you certain, that by <hi>the ſea,</hi> is meant <hi>the Dead Sea,</hi> or <hi>Lake of Sodom?</hi>

                  <p>Yes. 1. Becauſe all the other waters in thoſe parts, produce great plenty of excellent fiſh; and, therefore, need not healing. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fiſhers ſhall ſtand upon the banks of the ſea, from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim, places that are well known to be contiguous to the Dead Sea; one of which is nearly at the north-eaſt corner, the other at the weſt end of the ſame. 3. The marſhes, and the miry places thereof, ſhall not be healed; but ſhall be given to ſalt, as ſpecimens of what the whole is at this time; which barren and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpots ſhall remain, as ſtanding evidences of the truth of Scripture, and the exact fulfilment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as <hi>Sodom</hi> cannot be reſtored in her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; there being none remaining on earth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Dead Sea be turned into land, in the Millenium; it follows, as the only remaining ſenſe of the return of <hi>Sodom's</hi> captivity, that thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inhabitants, who were deſtroyed by fire and brimſtone from heaven, ſhall be reſtored to a ſtate of felicity: And thus, both the doctrine of <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation</hi> and <hi>endleſs damnation</hi> fall to the ground at once.</p>

                  <p>But as it is the ſecond death, after the day of judgment, that is to deſtroy the bodies and ſouls of the wicked in hell; perhaps, the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Sodom, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored before that period, and may not be caſt into the lake of fire.</p>

                  <p>It is evident by our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words, (for we muſt not contradict any part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) that this will not be the caſe: for he ſaith, That it ſhall be more tolerable for the land (<hi>that is,</hi> the inhabitants) of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in the day of judgment,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:025050_0260_102D74B91B71E8D0"/>
than for the cities where his goſpel was preached, and his miracles wrought, and yet the inhabitants remained impenitent: See St. Matth. xi. 24. x. 15. St. Mark, vi. 11. St. Luke, x. 12. From all which paſſages it is evident, that the inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> will be condemned in the day of judgment, and puniſhed in the lake of fire; and though their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery will not be ſo great as that of the inhabitants of the cities where our Saviour preached, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his mighty works; yet they will be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that day: and, conſequently, the return of their captivity is not to be expected, till after the creation of the new earth. Therefore, it is plain, that the lake of fire is not deſigned to annihilate thoſe who are caſt therein; ſince all that are not found written in the book of life, at the day of judgment, will be caſt into the lake of fire. They whoſe names are in the book of life, will be happy. The inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> will be miſerable, in ſome degree; therefore, will not be found written in the book of life; conſequently, will be caſt into the lake of fire. They will be reſtored; their captivity ſhall be returned: therefore the lake of fire ſhall not annihilate them. They are ſet forth for an example in their puniſhment; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in their Reſtoration.—I need not purſue this argument farther: It appears evident to me; and, till it be fairly anſwered, I ſhall add nothing more.</p>

                  <p>Yes, I have frequently heard it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but as it appears totally void of all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Scripture, it hardly deſerves any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The objections that I feel myſelf concerned to treat with ſeriouſneſs and reſpect, and candidly to anſwer, are thoſe which appear to be drawn from the book of divine Revelation; but if I muſt attend to all thoſe which the ingenuity of men might raiſe againſt the doctrine of the Reſtoration, I ſhould not only have a very hard taſk, but ſhould never know when I had done, and beſides the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would dwindle into trifling and conjectures, very unſuitable to the nature and importance of ſuch an awful ſerious ſubject. I muſt obſerve, that this objection is nothing but a raſh unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſertion, or bold conjecture, without the leaſt foundation either in Scripture or reaſon, and if I was to aſſert juſt the contrary, I cannot ſee why my aſſertion would not be a ſufficient anſwer. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, leſt it ſhould be thought that any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection can be raiſed, that cannot be fairly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that I knowing the ſtrength of this, would willingly evade it, I will ſay a few words upon it. The Scriptures univerſally hold forth the idea, that men will be judged, condemned, and puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deeds done in the body. God will render to every man according to his deeds,' Rom. ii. 6. 'For we muſt all appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:025050_0262_102D74BAF9CA0588"/>
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,' 2 Cor. v. 10.</p>
                  <p>'And that ſervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes: but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes,' St. Luke, xii. 47, 48. Theſe, and all the paſſages that ſpeak of future puniſhment, conſtantly hold it forth as a juſt retribution for the evil deeds done in this life; but never intimate any thing of what this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection holds forth, of puniſhment being continued <hi>ad infinitum</hi> for crimes committed hereafter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is plain that puniſhments or corrections are intended to ſtop men from ſinning, and under the divine agency to take away their ſins. 'By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin,' Iſai. xxvii. 9. This is univerſally allowed to be the deſign of troubles and ſorrows in the preſent life, and why not in the next ſtate alſo? the Scripture ſays nothing to forbid this idea, but much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it; particularly that awful paſſage where the prophet ſays, 'And it was revealed in mine ears by JEHOVAH of Hoſts, Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, TILL YE DIE, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts,' Iſai. xxii. 14. If then iniquity ſhall be purged away after death, it is certain that men ſhall not always continue to ſin in a future ſtate, for they muſt ceaſe to commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, before it can be purged away. And though their puniſhments may at firſt cauſe them to rage, (as we ſee is frequently the caſe in this world) yet ſhall they continue un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e is another argument of this ſame kind, viz. that is not founded upon any particular text of Scripture, which is directly contrary to the one you have been anſwering, which I have formerly thought unanſwerable in favour of the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment, which is the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of ſin, being againſt an infinite object, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining infinite hatefulneſs, and juſtly therefore deſerving infinite puniſhment. Sin is a crime of infinite magnitude, becauſe God is a Being of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite majeſty and perfection. Every crime juſtly demerits puniſhment proportioned to its malignity! and conſequently every offence againſt God deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits infinite puniſhment. No mere creature can ever ſuffer an infinity of puniſhment in any limited duration. It follows therefore, that a ſinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be <hi>eternally</hi> puniſhed. Farther, every man is under infinite obligations to devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſervice of God, his infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor. To violate an infinite obligation, is to commit a crime of infinite malignity. A crime of infinite malignity, deſerves infinite puniſhment. Can it ever be proved then that everlaſting, or <hi>endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> is not the proper deſert of a life of ſin? I have often ſaid, That this argument trite and common as it is, never was, nor ever would be fairly anſwered; nevertheleſs, I am willing to hear what you have to ſay upon it.</p>

                  <p>If ſin is <hi>infinite,</hi> then we muſt aſcribe to it one of the perfections of the Deity, which ſtrikes me as ſomething abſurd, if not ſomething worſe: <hi>ſin,</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="unknown:025050_0264_102D74BC9A2E1E30"/>
a <hi>privation,</hi> an <hi>act of a worm, infinite?</hi> Actions must, in my opinion take their denomination from the actors, and not from the objects. Infinite actions, or actions of infinite magnitude require infinite power to perform them. If ſin is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite magnitude, goodneſs it more ſo, as deriving a power from God to the performance of it. But if you grant that David ſpoke in the name of the Mediator in Pſalm xvi. you may be at once furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a proof, that even goodneſs, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtate in which it ever was exhibited in the world, was not conſidered as of infinite magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the great performer. 'Thou haſt ſaid unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Thou art my Lord: my goodneſs extendeth not to thee. But to the ſaints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight,' Ver. 2, 3. If acts of goodneſs were of infinite magnitude they muſt extend to God, but the ſpeaker, in theſe words, be he who he may, David or Chriſt, was careful to let us know that he did not conceive his acts of goodneſs infinite. And if acts of goodneſs are not infinite, it would be highly abſurd to call evil actions infinite, which proceed wholly from the creature.</p>
                  <p>I grant indeed that there is a paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which mentions the word <hi>infinite</hi> as belonging to ſin and iniquity, but then it is mentioned in ſuch a connection as ſhews it to be uſed as Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus frequently mentions it, for a very great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us it is uſed by many good authors, who certainly do not mean to uſe it in the firſt and proper ſenſe of the word. The Sacred Writer, in the paſſage alluded to, takes particular care to guard us againſt any ſuch idea, as though ſin was
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:025050_0265_102D7119BA99A9C8"/>
of infinite magnitude, or even virtuous and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, which approach far nearer to infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as having their ſource from the fountain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs. For Eliphaz ſays, 'Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable unto himſelf? Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makeſt thy ways perfect? Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment? Is not thy wickedneſs great? and thine iniquities infinite?' Job xxii. 2—5. And language very ſimilar to the above is uſed by Elihu, 'If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt him? or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doſt thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man,' Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Theſe expreſſions, if they teach any thing, I ſhould think expreſsly declare, that no actions of men can by any means be of <hi>infinite</hi> magnitude, in the ſenſe in which we commonly underſtand that word; though their numbers and magnitudes may be ſo great as to be ſtiled <hi>infinite,</hi> as the word is ſometimes uſed.</p>
                  <p>You aſſert, in conſequence of your ideas of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> ſin, that <hi>every</hi> offence againſt God demerits infinite puniſhment. If the caſe be ſo, does it not tend entirely to take away the diſtinction which God hath made between ſins of infirmity and ſins of malice, ſins of ignorance and ſins of wilfulneſs, leſſer and greater ſins? All ſins are offences againſt God, and if <hi>every</hi> offence againſt God is of <hi>infinite magnitude,</hi> how can any be greater? and thus the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:025050_0266_102D74C060A17848"/>
diſtinctions are entirely deſtroyed, and, all ſins will be eſteemed equal, contrary to the whole tenor of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>If every offence againſt God demerits infinite puniſhment, then it will follow, that God cannot render to any according to their ways, nor puniſh them as their iniquities deſerve, unleſs they are doomed to <hi>endleſs miſery;</hi> what then will become of all thoſe threatenings where God threatens to puniſh people for all their iniquities, and yet to ſhew favour to them afterwards? This is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon your plan, for none can ever receive all the puniſhment due to their ſins during numberleſs ages. Yet if the word of God be true, he can deal with tranſgreſſors as they have done, and yet be gracious to them afterwards, 'For thus ſaith Adonai JEHOVAH, I will even deal with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt deſpiſed the oath in breaking the covenant. Nevertheleſs, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting covenant.—That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith Adonai JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH,' Ezek. xvi. 59, 60, 63.</p>
                  <p>Here is an inſtance to the purpoſe, of thoſe whoſe ſins were of the deepeſt die, and to whom God threatens to deal as they had done, and to puniſh them for all their numerous and aggravated tranſgreſſions, and yet to remember mercy for them afterwards, and to be pacified towards them for all that they had done. All which things would be abſolutely impoſſible, according to your ideas. In many other parts of Scripture God promiſes to
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025050_0267_102D74BED0AC5F20"/>
render to tranſgreſſors according to their works and ways, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be afterwards gracious unto them. And in one place, at leaſt, where God is declaring the great mercies which he will manifeſt unto the children of Iſrael, in returning them to their own land, and cauſing them to dwell ſafely therein, he ſays, 'And firſt, I will recompenſe their iniquity, and their ſin <hi>double:</hi> becauſe they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the carcaſes of their deteſtable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable things,' Jer. xvi. 18. What do you think of this? If every offence is of infinite magnitude, and deſerves infinite puniſhment, which can never be fully executed, then how can God puniſh a people for <hi>all</hi> their iniquiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and <hi>do</hi> to the greateſt ſinners <hi>as</hi> they have <hi>done,</hi> yea, and recompence their iniquity, and their ſin <hi>double</hi> firſt, and then be gracious to them, and love them, and be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards them afterwards? And the prophet Iſaiah ſays, 'Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, ſaith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned; for ſhe hath received of the LORD'S hand DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS,' Iſai. xl. 1, 2. Here a fact is ſaid to be accompliſhed, which upon your ſcheme can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done to all <hi>eternity;</hi> for if every offence againſt God is of infinite magnitude, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves infinite puniſhment, none can ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>ſingle</hi> for <hi>one</hi> of their <hi>ſins,</hi> far leſs DOUBLE for ALL.</p>
                  <p>And therefore nothing can poſſibly be more evidently contrary to Scripture than your trite and common argument, that as, every ſin is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite magnitude, ſo it juſtly demerits infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:025050_0268_102D74C23AA0D9A0"/>
which as no mere creature can bear, muſt neceſſarily ſubject all who are recompenſed according to their own doings to <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, If I was to grant you, contrary to Scripture, reaſon, and common ſenſe, that every offence is of infinite magnitude, and naturally deſerves infinite puniſhment: How would you prove from <hi>that</hi> the certainty of <hi>endleſs miſery?</hi> Do you make nothing of the reconciliation which our Lord Jeſus has made for <hi>all ſinners,</hi> and for <hi>all ſins?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me aſk you ſeriouſly, Did not Chriſt make a full and complete offering and propitiation for the ſins of the whole world? Is it not certain that his merits were far greater than the demerits of all mankind? Is he not the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world? If Chriſt died for all men, without exception, as you grant, and removed all their iniquities, and bore them away, and reconciled all to God by his death while they were enemies: much more as he has paid ſo great a price for their ranſom, he will recover them out of their loſt eſtate, and ſave them by his life. 'Where ſin abounded, grace did (or ſhall) much more abound. That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,' Rom. v. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>I conclude, that let ſin be ever ſo great, the grace of God is greater: and if you will have it that ſin is of <hi>infinite magnitude,</hi> I hope you will not deny the propitiation of Jeſus Chriſt, which he made for all ſins, the ſame character. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you magnify ſin, and inſiſt upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its demerit, I will endeavour to magnify
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:025050_0269_102D74D92895ADD0"/>
the all powerful Redeemer above it, and ſpeak of his power to redeem all the human race, for whom he ſhed his blood. And then you will gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in favour of the doctrine of endleſs damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by all your arguments founded upon the <hi>infinity</hi> of ſin: Chriſt being far more infinite to ſave, than ſin can be to deſtroy: and as he has undertaken to redeem and bring back thoſe who were loſt, there is no danger of his failing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>

                  <p>I muſt confeſs that what you have ſaid on this head entirely convinces me, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not found the <hi>eternity</hi> of puniſhment, upon the <hi>infinity</hi> of ſin; and you have given me more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction upon many points in theſe converſations than I ever expected to receive. I am indeed at length almoſt perſuaded to receive your ſentiments, though I once thought that it was impoſſible to anſwer all my objections, yet you have gone far towards it. Nay, I cannot at preſent recollect any thing material, but what you have anſwered. I would not however be too haſty in adopting this ſyſtem, but after your example conſider it well. But there is certainly ſomething more grand, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and harmonious in this view than can be found in any other ſcheme; for both the other ſyſtems end in darkneſs and black night, one in <hi>endleſs damnation,</hi> and the other in <hi>gloomy annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But on your plan light riſes out or obſcurity, and a glorious day ſucceeds the darkeſt ſcenes. This view of things ſets the Book of divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the moſt pleaſing light, and appears, for aught any thing that I can ſee, conſiſtent with the Divine perfections. But why, ſince you believe the univerſal Reſtoration, do you not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>On the other hand, ſome aſk me, Why do you ever mention it at all in your ſermons; ſince it is not eſſential to ſalvation to believe it? To them I give theſe anſwers.
<list>
                        <item>1. St. Paul declared to Timothy, that this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Goſpel of God's being the Saviour, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer, of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; and that they laboured and ſuffered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, becauſe they truſted in God, as the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Saviour. But he was so far from being aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this belief, that he ſaid to Timothy, 'Theſe things command and teach,' 1 Tim. iv. 9, 10, 11. And ſo am I determined to do, at proper opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; notwithſtanding the reproach and contempt awaiting me for ſo doing.</item>
                        <item>2. Though it is frequently ſaid to be a matter of little or no conſequence, if true; yet, if it be any part of the record God hath given of his Son, (as I think I have proved) we are in danger of making him a liar, if we believe it not: See 1 John v. 9, 10, 11.</item>
                        <item>3. Though you may be Chriſtians, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; yet I cannot; though once I could alſo: But now the evidences of its truth appear ſo plain to my mind, that it would be criminal in me not to believe it; and ſince I do believe it, would it not be highly diſhoneſt in me to deny it? I have never done ſo yet, when aſked; and God forbid, that I ſhould be aſhamed to publiſh, what he has commanded to be made known.</item>
                        <item>4. I have commonly acted merely on the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and I never ſhould, that I know of, have

preached it in public, or but rarely, far leſs have written upon the ſubject, had it not been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a dangerous and deſtructive hereſy; and people been cautioned againſt hearing me, on that account.</item>
                        <item>5. I have been frequently deſired to preach upon the ſubject, expreſsly; and could not well refuſe, without betraying a cowardly diſpoſition.</item>
                        <item>6. I aſk, Who is the beſt man; he who preaches the truth contrary to his judgment, for intereſt, or to gain applauſe; or he that fairly ſpeaks as he thinks, without diſguiſe; although he knows that it will diſpleaſe his beſt friends on earth; even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuppoſition that he errs, in many points? If there be an heretic in the world, it is the man, who, for the love of money or applauſe, or through the fear of man, preaches that to others which he himſelf doth not believe. 'He that is ſuch, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſinneth; being condemned of himſelf,' Tit. iii. 11.</item>
                        <item>7. If we are to hold forth nothing to mankind, but what all are agreed in, we muſt diſcourse upon very few ſubjects: for I do not recollect ſo much as one, but what people either diſagree about the thing itſelf, or the manner of explaining and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: No! not even the being and perfections of God: nor any point of doctrinal, experimental, or even practical religion.</item>
                        <item>8. We are to endeavour to teach mankind what they know not, as well as to confirm them in what they are already taught; ſhould keep back nothing that may be profitable to them; ſhould give meat to ſtrong men, as well as milk to babes, and ſhould not ſhun to declare the <hi>whole</hi> counſel of God. We ought to juſtify the ways of God to men, to ſhew
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:025050_0272_102D74C6084B8CE8"/>
the neceſſity and harmony of Divine Revelation, and take pains to convert infidels; all which things are more promoted by this view than any other.</item>

<list>
                        <item>1. There are a thouſand other ſubjects in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beſides this; and all deſerve conſideration, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their weight and importance.</item>
                        <item>2. I have an utter averſion to going always in the ſame round of matter or manner; and, therefore I frequently vary in both.</item>
                        <item>3. There are many other ſubjects of more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent importance than the belief of this; ſuch as, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith, hope, love, obedience, &amp;c. and therefore ought to be more frequently inſiſted on, in proportion to their preſent uſe.</item>
                        <item>4. There are many ſcenes of providence and grace to take place in the univerſe, before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſtoration; ſuch as the Millenium, the call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Jews, the univerſal ſpread of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel through the earth, &amp;c. Theſe things are much nearer, and therefore the Scripture ſpeaks more of them; and what God moſt ſpeaks of, in his word, we ſhould diſcourſe of moſt to the people.</item>
                        <item>5. This doctrine, though it may have its uſe in converting men; and certainly enables thoſe who believe it, to ſet forth the terrors of the Lord, and his mercies, in a more ſtriking manner than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could; yet it is chiefly uſeful in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the people of God, and, in part, relieving them from that bitter anguiſh which their tender minds feel, from the conſideration of the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that periſh; and, therefore, may not be ſo
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025050_0273_102D74DD4A52B340"/>
proper for a popular audience as many other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</item>
                        <item>6. The plan of this grand Reſtoration is ſo vaſt, includes ſo many different and ſeemingly contradictory diſpenſations, that it cannot be fairly ſtated, and fully defended, in one ſermon, and eſpecially the objections anſwered; and many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not capable of taking in and digeſting at once, ſo many ſubjects as are neceſſary to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this matter, and have not patience to attend to a long ſeries of demonſtrations, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proofs; and, therefore, this doctrine ſhould not be introduced by any man, in any place, unleſs he has opportunity to give it a fair inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and, therefore, I never mention it at all, at my firſt preaching in any place; nor unleſs I have ſufficient opportunities to diſcuſs it.</item>
                        <item>7. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays to his diſciples—'I have yet many things to ſay unto you; but ye cannot bear them now,' St. John xvi. 12. And St. Paul ſays—'And I, brethren, could not ſpeak unto you as unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but as unto carnal; even as unto babes in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it; neither yet now are ye able,' 1 Cor. iii. 1, 2. 'Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age; even thoſe who, by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed, to diſcern both good and evil,' Heb. v. 14. Therefore, as the Saviour and his apoſtles adapted their ſubjects and diſcourſes to the circumſtances of their hearers, and treated them in a gentle manner; ſo ſhould we. Prudence, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and care, ſhould always be uſed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing on a doctrine ſo deep and awful as this;

and, eſpecially, as it hath been ſo little known of late ages.</item>
                        <item>8. I would wiſh to eſtabliſh well the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, before I meddle with any thing elſe: and as to the doctrine of the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would rather that it ſhould ſeem to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inferred from truths already known, than delivered as an independent ſyſtem: I, therefore, ſeldom or ever make it a leading point in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; but ſometimes lead to it, as a natural conſequence of what has been ſaid. After all, I would chuſe that men ſhould diſcover it themſelves, by carefully reading the Scriptures, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, believing them to be ſtrictly true: by liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love towards God and man; by walking in humility, often reflecting on their former eſtate; and conſtantly viewing the ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the boundleſs love of their great Creator: rather than to learn it of any man, far leſs ſtill, of ſuch an unworthy worm as I am.</item>
                        <item>9. As far as I know my own heart, truth, in love, is my conſtant aim. I am unconnected with any party; and am not ſo prejudiced in favour of any thing that I hold, but that I would willingly be convinced in any thing, by proper evidence; and when ſo convinced, I am ready to retract pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly: As, therefore, I do not feel myſelf perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intereſted to ſupport the ſyſtem, right or wrong; I have, therefore, dwelt much leſs upon it, than moſt preachers do upon their particular ſentiments.</item>
                        <item>10. When I firſt embraced theſe views, I was obliged to give ſome account of my reaſons; and I choſe rather to do it by writing than preaching: Accordingly, I publiſhed my ſentiments, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025050_0275_102D74DED87A4BE0"/>
to many objections; which publications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the hands of thoſe to whom I preached, made it leſs neceſſary for me to diſcourſe upon thoſe matters in public, or even in private, as I could refer to what I had written: and with the ſame view, I am inclined to publiſh theſe familiar diſcourſes, which we have had together; after which it will be leſs neceſſary than ever for me to preach the Reſtoration publicly; yet, I will not wholly avoid it, at convenient times, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per circumſtances.</item>
                        <item>11. Laſtly, as I know ſo much of the nature of man, as to be ſenſible that he turns, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and loathing, from what is perpetually cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med down his throat; but reliſhes that which he falls upon, as it were accidentally, and comes into by little and little: I have always made it a rule never to introduce it, in public or private, unleſs where it was earneſtly deſired, nor ever to continue it long together; and, above all, never to queſtion people upon the ſubject, after diſcourſing upon it: aſking them, ſaying, Do you believe it? &amp;c. Nor would I ever wiſh to preſs them with the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at once, and oblige them immediately to yield; as this kind of conduct, ſo far from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good purpoſes, commonly ſets them againſt what is thus intruded upon them.
