            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Preface, To the candid and unprejudiced Reader.</head>
            <p>AS Mr. WHITEFIELD's groſs Miſrepreſentations of the following Sermons have obliged me to publiſh them, I muſt give ſome Account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct whilſt: in this Place. I know let me be never ſo careful to avoid perſonal Reflections, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his darling Doctrines and raſh Cenſures in the trueſt Light and tendereſt Manner; yet ſhall I hardly eſcape the Reproaches of ſome—. But the rudeſt Clamours will give me no uneaſineſs; for my Conſcience bears me Witneſs, that I am doing my Duty; that my Deſigns are fair and honeſt: I am not ſo much Concerned for my own Vindication, as for the Credit of our <hi>holy and reaſonable Religion,</hi> and for the Reputation of our <hi>Mother Church</hi> under God, the Bulwark of the Reformation, and of her ableſt Champions induſtriouſly abuſed and deſamed of late.</p>
            <p>When Mr, WHITEFIELD arrived here laſt Year, I gave him at firſt the uſe of our Church; and looked upon him at firſt as a well-meaning tho' <hi>raſh</hi> Young Man, who had imbibed ſome miſtaken Notions of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004499_0003_100D5ADD777F6D90"/>
Religion; for which reaſon I adviſed him, in the moſt ſerious and tender Manner I could, to examine the Principles he went upon with greater Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; adding; that I was ſorry he had loſt the eſteem of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> whom even their Enemies allowed to be generally eminent for Learning and Lenity. However, could he happily get over his Prejudices, he might, through God's Bleſſing, do much good in <hi>America,</hi> by means of his agreeable Voice and ſerious Manner, &amp;c. I farther promiſed, according to his Behaviour, to uſe my Intereſt with my Brethren on the Continent, to recommend him to the favour of the Clergy, upon his return to his Native Country.</p>
            <p>But I ſoon perceived him Proof againſt any ſuch Advice; for ſome few Days after, both from our Pulpit and in his <hi>Street-Preaching</hi> he raſhly accuſed the Clergy in general of <q>
                  <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>falſe Doctrine</hi>; of ſubſcribing without believirg their <hi>Articles,</hi> in order to get into Preferment; and that when once poſſeſſed of their Churches, they locked the Doors and put the Keys into their Pockets,</q> &amp;c. When I expoſtulated the Matter with him, juſtly obſerving how unjuſt, raſh and uncharitable ſuch a Charge was againſt a Body of Men, of whom perhaps he knew not one in a Thouſand; all the Anſwer he made was, that he did not mean them all, only the Generality of them.</p>
            <p>Soon after I ſaw, with <hi>his Name</hi> to it, an abuſive Anſwer to the <hi>Biſhop of London's</hi> late Paſtoral Letter,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004499_0004_100D5ADF47CD5C38"/>
wherein his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably cautions the People of his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> againſt the two dangerous Extremes of <hi>Lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> The Letter is wrote with that ſtrength of Reaſon and good Senſe, with that Perſpicuity and Gravity, which ſeems natural to our pious and prudent Dioceſan; with that Chriſtian Calmneſs and true Z aſ, which diſcovers his real Concern for ſacred Truth, and his tender regard for the good of Souls, in danger of being deluded and miſlead.</p>
            <p>His three Letters in Oppoſition to <hi>Infidelity</hi> were wrote, ſome Years agone, with the ſame Candid and Chriſtian Spirit; containing Arguments in a manner Demonſtrative, and yet ſo admirably fitted to all Capacities, that, by the bleſſing of God, they proved an excellent <hi>Antidote</hi> againg the <hi>Poiſon</hi> ſo induſtriouſly ſpread at that Time. Had Mr.
WH—D ſeriouſly peruſed them, eſpecially the 2d Letter; the ſhort View there diſplay'd of the Chriſtian Inſtitution, would have inſtructed him in the true ſcriptural Senſe of our <hi>Articles,</hi> concerning Juſtification through Chriſt Jeſus. For tho' we are juſtified freely through his <q>Grace; yet the Goſpel Account is as full and expreſs, as Words can make it, on the one Hand, that Faith in Chriſt is the Foundation of a Chriſtians Title to Heaven; and on the other Hand, that Repentance and good Works are neceſſary Conditions of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſtinction between good Works being the <hi>Fruits,</hi> but not the <hi>Condition</hi> of Juſtification is meerly
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004499_0005_100D5AE151A59400"/>
evaſive and trifling; ſeeing Juſtifying Faith and good Works cannot be ſeperated, cannot be oppoſed One to another, without rendering both uſeleſs and ineffectual: For in the plain Senſe of Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord, or without good Works be finally juſtified in his ſight. And according to the 12<hi>th Article</hi> of our Church <hi>they are pleaſing &amp; acceptable to God in Chriſt.</hi> Nay this is the meaning of the 11<hi>th. Article,</hi> on which Mr. WH—D magiſterially impoſes his own Senſe, and ſpitefully cenſurs the Clergy for not implicitely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his indigeſted Notions; For when 'tis aſſerted, <q>that we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith, and not for our own Works (<hi>viz.</hi> without Faith.)</q> 
               <hi>By Faith only</hi> an Evangelical Faith is moſt certainly to be underſtood ; which always includes ſincere, tho' not perfect, unſinning Obedience; as appears plain from the whole Tenour of the Goſpel. And farther our Church diſtinctly points out, in what Senſe we are to underſtand all her Doctrines, in the 6<hi>th Article,</hi> 
               <q>Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation, So that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or necceſſary to Salvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The pious &amp; learned Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> late <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>St. Davids,</hi> in his <hi>Harmonia Apoſtolica,</hi> has fully proved that by the Word of the 11<hi>th Article,</hi> there is not attributed any Efficacy or Dignity to <hi>Faith,</hi> more
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:004499_0006_100D5AE4DD85D4B0"/>
than to other great Goſpel Virtues, in the Buſineſs of Juſtification; and has confirmed the ſame by the Suffrages of all the eminent Fathers of the primitive Church. And yet becauſe the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends this true, genuine, ſcriptural &amp; intelligible Notion of Faith; Mr. WH—D, with equal Truth &amp; Decency, calls him a <hi>Doctrinal-Papiſt,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>To make preaching up the neceſſity of good Works the Character of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> muſt proceed from very pernicious Deſigns, or elſe be owing to groſs Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance both of the <hi>Proteſtant &amp; Popiſh</hi> Doctrines. Our <hi>Church</hi> both in her <hi>Articles &amp; Homilies</hi> aſſerts the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of good Works, but renounces the <hi>Merit</hi> of them. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> claims <hi>Merit</hi> by them, as appears from their Doctrine concerning Works of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> And yet by other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremonies, by Pardons &amp; Indulgences, and by one Device or another has enervated the Chriſtian Religion to that Degree, that it has loſt its Virtue &amp; Efficacy upon the Minds &amp; Lives of men.<note n="§" place="bottom">

I could mention o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tenets and Practices of the like nature. But</p>
            <p>I proceed to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>W—d's</hi> Charge againſt; the Clergy, as aſſerting we are juſtified by
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:004499_0008_100D5AE81B0509B8"/>
               <hi>Works only,</hi> is abſolutely and ſcandalouſly falſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that great and good Man <hi>Arch Biſhop Tillotſon</hi> (whom he has moſt groſly abuſed in this, as well as in other reſpects) inſiſts upon it, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and no other, has merited the Bleſſings of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation for us; that we ourſelves can do nothing, whereby we can merit theſe Bleſſings at Gods Hands; nay farther that all our Obedience is imperfect, and ſo far from meriting, that it ſtands in need of Pardon. See his 174th Sermon Vol. 3d.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> (tho' as pious and uſeful a Book as ever was wrote, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and deſtroyed by Mr. <hi>W—d's</hi> Orders) ſpeaks fully to Chriſts meriting in our behalf, by ſatisfying the Divine Juſtice for <hi>actual</hi> as well as <hi>original</hi> Sin, and purchaſing an eternal and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inheritance for all that repent, believe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey him, through the Aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>W—d</hi>'s Scheme of Chriſtianity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nothing to be required of us. I have heard him in <hi>expreſs Words</hi> declare, that good Works will not recommend us to God's Favour, nor will evil Works;, even all the Sins that ever were committed in the World, though center'd in one Soul, for one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hinder its Juſtification and Salvation. That we have free Will only to do evil, nay are meer Machines, and therefore cannot do any thing; or ſhould we attempt to do any thing for ourſelves, we thereby make ourſelves half Saviours, and in

that Caſe ſhould never be ſaved through Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. That Chriſt by his Obedience hath every Way fulfilled the Law for us, and God will not deſire to be paid twice.

            <p>What wild, diſtracted Notions are theſe? Into what dangerous Mazes may they lead well-meaning credulous Souls? I know ſome are willing to put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meaning, on theſe, and the like irrational and unſcriptural Poſitions, than what is plain and obvious. But' tis impoſſible, by any Shifts and Evaſions, to elude the evil tendency of them.

            <p>To caution my Hearers againſt the Danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Notions in this important Doctrine, was the End I chiefly propoſed in the following Diſcourſes; which were haſtily put togother, and are printed as they were preached; except ſome few Sentences in the afternoon Sermon purpoſely paſſed over in the Delivery, which yet are neceſſary to preſerve the Connexion. Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> heard them both; and from Church repaired to <hi>Society Hill,</hi> attended with great Numbers of every Perſuaſion; where, after naming the ſame Text, your Preacher to day, ſaid he, from theſe Words, &amp;c. And ſo went on contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and preverting the Doctrines I had deliver'd, without any regard to Decency, or our bleſſed Lords Precept <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. And in direct Contempt of the 53d <hi>Cannon</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> whereby publick Oppoſition between Preachers is ſtrictly forbidden; becauſe thereby may grow much Offence and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs to the People. As actually happen'd in
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:004499_0011_100D5AEFC207B6E0"/>
this particular Inſtance; For ſome have raſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Communion of the Church implicitly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his Schiſmatical Advice <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould follow ſome rigid Itinerant Diſtenters, whom he named, as the only Preachers of the <hi>true Goſpel</hi> in theſe Parts. He peremtorily aſſerted (and, it I am not miſinformed, backed the Aſſertion with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, tho' dreadful Imprecations againſt himſelf, if what he ſaid was not ſtrictly true) that I had preached up the ſufficiency of an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith</hi>; and had taught <hi>Juſtification by Works only,</hi> And then very pathetically exhorted the People not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or liſten to ſuch Preachers. They teach, ſaid he, the Doctrine of Devils; vile Doctrine that leads to the Gates of Hell and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And ſoon after in his Declamations, on the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Hill,</hi> to a numerous Audience, he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirmed; That the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> and his <hi>Commiſſaries,</hi> and the preſent ſet of <hi>Clergy</hi> neither underſtand nor believe their <hi>Articles</hi>; Do not ye therefore believe them; for they are <hi>Simon Maguſes.</hi> They are <hi>Sorcerers, Emiſſaries</hi> of the Devil; They are <hi>rotten Pillars,</hi> and have for theſe hundred Years paſt, been pulling down the <hi>Church of England</hi> with their unhallowed Hands.</p>
            <p>Now was this rude Language, this low Scurrility, this falſe Accuſation the Dictates of the <hi>holy and infallible Sprit,</hi> or of the <hi>Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience</hi>?

            </p>
            <p>It has always been the Method of Deceivers, to inveigh againſt received and orthodox Principles, and the Paſtors that are regularly appointed to teach and maintain them: And 'tis a vaſt advantage they gain over any People, when they can by art and Elocution reſtrain them from a rational Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Doctrines, they pretend to deliver by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and from liſtning to the Inſtructions of their <hi>lawful Guides</hi>; whom they will labour hard to make them undervalue by ſecret Surmiſes, injurious Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and undeſerved Reflexions.</p>
            <p>As to the abuſive Miſrepreſentation of me, or my Doctrine by Mr. <hi>W—d</hi>; Let his and my Superiors, and every impartial Man judge of it. I freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, and pray <hi>God</hi> forgive him, and reſtore him to a ſound Mind and regular Conduct.

this publick Notice of one capable of acting ſo much out of Character; had it not been abſolutely neceſſary, in the conſcientious Diſcharge of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my preſent Station, to caution the ſerious and well-meaning, againſt being impoſed upon and lead aſtray by thoſe, who are confident and raſh, becauſe they are not rational: and ſupply with Grimace, Noiſe and Paſſion, what they are known to want in Senſe and Underſtanding; not to mention <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is at preſent, it ſeems, an attainment deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable, if not dangerous to the owners.</p>
            <p>However, Religious Truths are always beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by calmneſs of Reaſoning, and clearneſs of Argument. And it muſt be owing to the want of due and ſerious Attention, if Men do rot receive the moſt uſeful and laſting Edification, from Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes calculated chiefly to inform their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and convince their Judgments. But ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to ſome even well meaning Hearers appear flat and unſavoury, and to have nothing in them of <hi>Life and Power.</hi> They can reliſh nothing, but what is delivered with eagerneſs and vehemence; what raiſes Tempeſts and Earthquakes in their Breaſts, like the <hi>Thunder and Lightning from Mount Sinai.</hi> They think themſelves better edified, when their Paſſions are only affected, and their Imagination heated by the moving Voice or Geſture of the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But the Devotion raiſed in this manner is only momentary and vaniſhing; when the Judgment is not better inſtructed, Men are under the ſtrongeſt Deluſions imaginable, and miſtake the <hi>wild Freaks</hi>

of an over-heated Fancy, for the <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> of Gods holy Spirit. By which Means their Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties may be utterly ſpoiled; and being deceived may aſſent to the moſt unaccountable abſurdities; or <hi>waxing worſe and worſe,</hi> may run into Religious Diſtraction, or furious rage.</p>
            <p>Some, God be praiſed, are fully convinced of the Danger they were at firſt runing into; and, 'tis to be hoped, by degrees all conſiderate Perſons will reject with Indignation Errors ſo deſtructive, and ſo fruitful of Miſchiefs; <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> which of late <hi>here,</hi> as well as in <hi>England</hi> have been done by ſuch Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and ſuch Teachers.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Trapps</hi> late Sermons.</note>

               <q>Yea a Man may ſay, Thou haſt Faith, and I have Works; ſhew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle ſeems here to introduce, as it were, two Chriſtians; the one he ſuppoſes to be <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Erroneous,</hi> the other <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,</hi> and to repreſent them as warmly engaged in ſerious Diſcourſe concerning ſome fundamental points of Religion, particularly the Nature of <hi>Juſtification</hi> &amp; the Means of obtaining it: The weak Chriſtian looks upon <hi>Faith</hi> alone as the only Means, and argues for the Sufficiency of it, tho' he ſhould neglect to do <hi>Works</hi> anſwerable and ſuitable to his <hi>Faith</hi>: But the better inſtructed Chriſtian doth not think <hi>Faith</hi> alone Sufficient, if it be not accompanied with a ſuitable Life and Converſation.</p>
            <p>Both of them no doubt diſclaim'd all pretence of <hi>Merit</hi> either in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Works,</hi> and attributed (as we muſt always do) the whole of our Salvation to the precious Death and meritorious Satisfaction of the holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Author and Finiſher of our <hi>Faith.</hi> Both of them were likewiſe agreed, that <hi>Faith</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; but then, as I hinted juſt now, they differed very much in their
Sentiments concerning the Nature and Sufficiency of it; for one thought <hi>Faith</hi> alone abſolutely full, compleat and ſufficient; and on that account ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004499_0017_100D5AFC237316A8"/>
he might ſafely ſuperſede his concern about maintaining <hi>Good Works,</hi> and proceeding daily in all holy Converſation and virtuous Actions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other reaſoning more juſtly, was firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that <hi>Faith</hi> could not be of a true and ſaving Nature, could not be manifeſted in a right Manner, but by <hi>Good Works</hi> the genuine Fruits and Effects thereof.</p>
            <p>This may ſerve to repreſent to us the very Caſe of ſome zealous Profeſſors of Chriſtianity among ourſelves; who, though they readily acknowledge and inculcate the neceſſity of <hi>Faith</hi> and that they are under ſtrict Obligations to live and die therein, ſeem notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with the erroneous Chriſtian, to lay too great Streſs upon their <hi>Faith</hi>; thinking, nay boaſting, that they will be thereby ſaved; tho' their Tempers be <hi>Uncharitable,</hi> and their Behaviour, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>Irregular</hi>; as if Speculative and bare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion could ſave Chriſtians, without obeying the Evangelical Precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> are firmly joined together, and inſeperably connected by a moral efficiency, and have the Sanction from a divine Command; and 'tis therefore preſumptuouſly vain, extremely dangerous for any Man to flatter himſelf or ſeduce others into a fond Perſuaſion, that juſt, or even <hi>inſpired</hi> Notions of Religion, will avail them in the Sight of God, will juſtify them according to the Terms of the Goſpel; whilſt they indulge themſelves in vice, are

ungodly, and walk diſorderly. Would Men but once ſtrive with a true and holy Zeal, who ſhould be the beſt Chriſtian, who ſhould keep at the greateſt diſtance from Sin and every appearance of evil, and who ſhould ſquare his Life moſt exactly according to our bleſſed Saviour's pure Precepts and holy Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: There would then be little room left, and leſs if any Inclination in the Minds of ſerious Chriſtians, for theſe needleſs Controverſies and unreaſonable Diviſions with relation to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſtification, Free-Will</hi> and <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> which prevail too much at preſent, as they did in the <hi>laſt Century,</hi> to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of <hi>true Religion</hi> and diſturbance of Society: Such Diſputes are too dry and intricate for uſeful Inſtruction; their natural tendency is to render Men confident and troubleſome, proud and uncharitable; but never to make them either wiſer or better.</p>
            <p>As Matters therefore ſtand, we ſhould look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the End of <hi>Faith,</hi> that by it we may be partakers of the Benefits of Chriſts Death and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours of the Virtues of his Life. The beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Credit we can do our holy Religion is to give the World living Proofs of its Truth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and to defend and adorn it with a good, peaceable and exemplary Practice; for an inoffenſive Demeanour, a Life of true Virtue and unaffected Piety will always have its effects; will in Time ſtop the Mouths of Gain-ſayers and conciliate the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Affections of Men even diſaffected: For as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves, <hi>we may by well-doing</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Having premiſed this in order to explain my <hi>Text,</hi> I propoſe in my following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew that <hi>Faith</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, in all that have heard the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That <hi>Faith</hi> alone is not ſufficient to Salvation, unleſs it be accompanied with <hi>Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To offer ſome Inſtance of thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> by which chiefly Men ought to ſhew forth and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their Faith.</p>
            <p>I, Then I am to ſhew, that <hi>Faith</hi> is abſolutely; neceſſary to Salvation, in all that have heard the glad Tidings of the Goſpel of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may appear very plain, if we only conſider, That <hi>Faith</hi> is the very Foundation of a religious and devout frame of Soul, the firſt Principle of the Chriſtian Life, and the Maſter-Spring that excites and guides our ſpiritual Motions; without which no Man can be truly and ſincerely Religious; <hi>For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 11 Ch. 6 ver. '<hi>tis impoſſible to pleaſe God; he that cometh to God muſt Believe that he is; and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004499_0020_100D5B0308924E30"/>
of them <hi>that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Now theſe two Expreſſions, <hi>pleaſing God</hi> &amp; <hi>ſeeking him,</hi> are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame Importance, and both of them ſignify Religion or the Worſhip and Service of God; which doth antecedently ſuppoſe our firm Belief and Perſuaſion of thoſe two fundamental Principles of all Religion, whether natural or revealed, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a <hi>God,</hi> and that he will Protect and Reward thoſe that faithfully Serve and Obey him, becauſe without Mens firſt Believing theſe, there would be neither Ground nor Encouragement for any ſuch thing as Religion. Hence the Apoſtle to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. requires us <hi>to examine ourſelves if we be in the Faith</hi>; we muſt not be careleſs and indifferent in a Matter of ſo great Weight and Moment, and that ſo nearly concerns our eternal Intereſt and Welfare: For according to our <hi>Saviour's</hi> expreſs Declaration, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am He</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the promiſed Meſiah and Saviour of the World) <hi>ye ſhall die in your Sins.</hi> It being the principle Act of this <hi>Faith,</hi> to believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind; conſequently we muſt eſteem his Doctrine to be pure, true and ſacred; we muſt receive it as ſuch, and endeavour by the Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace (which he has promiſed to all them that ask it in Sincerity and Truth) to fulfil his holy Will and obey his Commandments; and he that thus <hi>Believeth on the Son of God, hath everlaſting Life, and he that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004499_0021_100D5B0533FF89E8"/>
Believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, John</hi> 3. 18 and 36. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us (2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>That God will take Vengeance on them that know him not, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From hence appears both the Neceſſity and Nature of <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which inſtructs us not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo obliges us to embrace and obey that pure and undefiled Religion taught and inſtituted by him in the holy Goſpel. Any other Senſe of <hi>believing in Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be lame and imperfect, for what can it ſignify or avail to believe in him, if we flight the Religion of which he is the Author, and diſregard thoſe inſpir'd and faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of his Life and Rules of this Doctrine? The holy Scriptures were given for our Learning and written for our Inſtruction; and in the due uſe of Means, the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> will guide us into the ſaving knowledge of what God has thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, what he commands us to do, what he promiſes to the Obedient and threatens againſt the Negligent; that thereby we may be induced ſeriouſly to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live <hi>righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a true Deſcription of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which is required by the perfect Revelation of Gods Will, and approves itſelf to the Reaſon of Mankind; tho' there are ſome who labour to render it obſcure and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. This is the true meaning of <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>receiving Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>putting on Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004499_0022_100D5B076730E1F8"/>
which the Scripture requires, and in this Senſe we muſt underſtand theſe Phraſes, when we apply them to this Matter. This is the <hi>Faith</hi> which is neceſſary to Salvation, in all that live under the Sunſhine of the Goſpel. As to thoſe who have not had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd unto them, it would be raſh and ill become us to pronounce any thing peremptorily concerning them; we muſt not affect to be <hi>wiſe above what is written</hi>: However we may on the charitable, and therefore the ſafeſt ſide, ſuppoſe that God, whoſe Goodneſs is over all his Works, may apply his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanted Mercy</hi> unto them; and that tho' they do not believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom they have not heard, he may reckon them excuſable; the want of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and external Revelation being a good Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in their behalf. But as to thoſe who have heard the glad Tidings of Salvation, who live where the Goſpel is taught in Purity and Truth, where the Evidences of Chriſtianity, and Motives to believe, ly ſo open to the general Apprehenſion of Mankind. If any in ſuch Circumſtances be ſo obſtinate as not to believe <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> not to make uſe of the Means of Grace, not to pray earneſtly with the Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief</hi>: Such Perſons muſt be without Excuſe, and reputed unworthy to be ſaved through our bleſſed <hi>Saviour's</hi> Mediation, and are juſtly liable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned over to Condemnation: For thus according to our Lords own Words (<hi>John</hi> 14. 6.) <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by me,</hi> and that coming to the Father is only by Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>Whoever rejects, perverts or corrupts this <hi>Faith,</hi> may be conſtrued to ſap the ſure Foundation of

moral Duties; and to do the greateſt Miſchief to human Societies, by rooting out of the Minds of Men thoſe powerful Reſtraints from Injuſtice, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, Sedition, and all kinds of Vice which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity has laid them under: The influence of which is a great Security to mutual Benevolence, Peace and Order; and produce Effects publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately beneficial, in many Caſes that are without the reach of human Laws. 'Tis Faith that makes us ſtrictly diligent in the coniſcientious Practice of ſocial Virtues, and careful to direct them to their true Ends: Nothing can inſpire a Man with the <hi>true Spirit</hi> of Charity, but the Contemplation of the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God apprehended by <hi>Faith,</hi> nothing can make us truly humble, but the knowledge of Gods tranſcendent Power and Perfection manifeſted by the ſame efficacious <hi>Principle.</hi> Nor can any Thing but the Hope or the Divine Favour excite Men to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignedly zealous for religious Virtue in general. Without this Grace, the higheſt Perfection Men either will or can raiſe themſelves to, is to mortify and avoid one Vice that they may purſue another; for inſtance to deny their <hi>Avarice,</hi> in order to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their <hi>Ambition,</hi> to ſhun the folly of <hi>Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that they may indulge themſelves in the mad Freaks of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi>; and in one Word to do good for their own ſelfiſh Ends and private Intereſt; and to be vicious and corrupt, is not by Principle, at leaſt with leſs Diſgrace and greater Security. Tho' thus now it appears that <hi>Faith</hi> is absolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yet it will appear, as I propoſed to ſhew in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004499_0025_100D5B0D67B7F418"/>
Ild Place, That <hi>Faith alone is not ſuffcient, unleſs it be accompanied with good Works.</hi> This might be eaſily inferred ſon what has been ſaid on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Head, and is abundantly plain and evident from the whole Tenour of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in every Branch of our Duty, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us with the ſtrongeſt. Motives and Arguments to a good and exemplary Life, to let our Light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, that men may ſee our good Works—St. <hi>Paul</hi> 'tis true, faith <hi>that a Man is juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3 28. Some inſiſt on it, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here means no other than the Deeds enjoned by the ancient Law, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the ritual Part thereof, ſuch as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and the Like; but granting that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms a Man is justified by <hi>Faith</hi> without the Deeds of the <hi>Moral Law</hi>; yet he means only <hi>perfect Works,</hi> or exact, unſinning Obedience required by the tenour of the <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> as appears from the preceeding Verſes, where he declares, that all <hi>Men are concluded under Sin,</hi> and therefore unable to do Works that can challange a Reward, that need no Mercy, no repentance; by ſuch Works ſince the Fall <hi>no Man living can be juſtified</hi>: But the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in tender pity to the weakneſs of our depraved Nature, abates the rigour and ſeverity of the Law by requiring only <hi>ſincere,</hi> inſtead of perfect unſinning Obedience, and that too render'd eaſy and practicable by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of Heaven, by the Grace and Strength of our Lord &amp; Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Advocate with the Father, and apropitiation for our Sins</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004499_0026_100D5B105140BB98"/>
by requiring &amp; accepting Repentance affords Men all the Encouragement in the World to repeat and live well, and <hi>Faith</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles generally compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Repentance and ſincere Obedience: The <hi>Faith</hi> by which a Man is <hi>juſtified</hi> is not, cannot be a son; but muſt bring forth Fruit, muſt be attended with <hi>good Works</hi>: For as the ſame Apoſtle tells us, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.) <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing nor Uncircumciſion, but Faith that worketh by Love</hi> i.e. ſuch a Faith as moves Men to ſhew forth their Love to God and their Saviour be doing ſuch good Works, as the Precepts of the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join and ſtrictly require.</p>
            <p>And here 'tis proper to obſerve, that there is not ſo great difficulty in reconciling the two Apoſtles St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this Head, us ſome Perſons have fondly imagined. For Iſt, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that we <hi>are juſtified by Faith,</hi> I have already proved he means an active and <hi>lively Faith,</hi> which approves itſelf by a ready <hi>ſincere</hi> tho' imperfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and conſequently he thereby affirms the ſame Thing with St <hi>James</hi> viz that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> both, a virtuous and upright Life, as well as a ſound and right Belief are neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Or again when St <hi>Paul</hi> a firms that <hi>Minds juftified by Faith without the Works of the Law</hi>; if we conſider that he is arguing againſt ſome Judaiſers, who were ſtill for impoſing on Chriſtians the Yoke of the moſaick Ordinances, in particular that of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; as thinking them neceſſary to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004499_0027_100D5B11D5B19AA8"/>
with God and their Juſtification. In Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this, the Apoſtle shews that ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as is accompanied with Evangelical Obedience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with ſuch Virtues and Graces as are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and genuine Effects of it, is ſufficient to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in and through the Merits and Mediation of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; without any farther Obligation of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the many legal Rites and burdenſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies inſtituted by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But St <hi>James</hi> being engaged in a controverſy of a different Nature, tho' he ſpake by the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Thing yet he argues after another Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Among the Chriſtians he wrote to, were many <hi>Libertines</hi> who denied the neceſſity of a Godly Life; and maintained that a bare Speculative <hi>Faith</hi> was enough to ſave them; and very probably had perverted ſome difficult Paſſages in St <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, to countenance &amp; ſupport that their erroneous Doctrine; a Doctrine which St <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf decries in many Places, particularly telling the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (I Ep. 7. 19.) <hi>That nothing would avail then, but keeping the Commandments of God</hi>; and ſaving of himſelf (1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. 2.) <hi>Tho' I have all Faith—and have not Clarity I am nothing</hi>; and a Doctrine that flatly contradicts what our bleſſed Saviour affirms concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſign of his appearance in the World, (Mat. 5. 17.) viz. <hi>That he came not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> (the Moral Law) <hi>but to fulfil it</hi>; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly when One asked him, <hi>What he ſhould do to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal Life</hi>? his Anſwer was, <hi>if thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</hi> So that if we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004499_0028_100D5B13D39F21E0"/>
will take the true Scheme and principle Deſign of Chriſtianity from <hi>him</hi> who firſt inſtituted and beſt underſtood it; 'tis a <hi>practical</hi> not a bare <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Science,</hi> 'tis a ſtrict <hi>Inſtitution</hi> which, tho' it offers Pardon for what is paſt, yet requires us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after all purity of Heart and holineſs of Life for the future. <hi>It does not make void but eſtabliſhes the Law</hi>; and is ſo far from diſpenſing with Morality, that it has advanced it to the higheſt improvement, So groundleſs and abſurd was the Opinion of thoſe <hi>Licentious Men</hi> who eſteemed themſelves exempted and diſcharged through <hi>Faith,</hi> from the Practice of <hi>moral Duties.</hi> In Oppoſition to this dangerous and wild Conceit, St <hi>James</hi> goes on to prove, that <hi>Faith</hi> when it doth not produce <hi>good Works</hi> is dead, lifeleſs and unactive; and by neceſſary Conſequence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> For this purpoſe he offers <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> plain and undeniable Arguments, in the Chapter of which my Text is a Part; <hi>viz.</hi> He ſhews that <hi>Faith without Works is a dead Faith</hi>; because Iſt, ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> is uſeleſs and and unprofitable: from the 14, to v. 18. Where he compares this kind of <hi>Faith</hi> to a Man, that fees his Neighbour neceſſitous and deſtitute of daily Food; but tho' he is able, yet doth not afford him Things needful for his preſent relief, putting him off with a few formal good Wiſhes: In this Caſe the poor Suppliant would receive no real Relief from his rich Neighbour. Even ſo the Man that has <hi>Faith,</hi> and is not careful to <hi>maintain good Works,</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi> in the iſſue can be no more profitable to him, than a few
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004499_0029_100D5B1805184E58"/>
good Words from a rich uncharitable Man can be helpful to his poor, famiſhing Neighbour. For what can it benefit a Man to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs he lives and behaves himſelf as every ſincere Chriſtian ought to do. The Act of <hi>Faith</hi> is, no doubt, good in itſelf; but if the Man poſſeſſed of it, does no more good through its Influence than if he had it not; he may be ſaid to have a good Gift, but is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for it: 'Tis like a Treaſure which a Man hides in the Earth and there lets it remain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever uſeing it; and ſo the Man reaps no more real good from it, than if he actually had it not. Such a <hi>Faith</hi> therefore as is not accompanied with <hi>good Works</hi> is no better than a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> becauſe it is uſeleſs and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of our <hi>final Juſtification by Faith only,</hi> and by <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo groſsly explain'd, as to ſuperſede all our own Endeavours to obey Gods Laws, through Chriſt who ſtrengthens us; however comfortable it may be to ſuch as are reſolved to live wickedly, and yet intend to get to Heaven at laſt, in a ſhorter and eaſier Way than the true Goſpel-Scheme of Salvation has laid down; yet ſure I am, the Hopes of ſuch <hi>Hypocrites will periſh</hi>; for our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, who taught all neceſſary Truth, ſpeaks no ſuch comfort in his Sermons to <hi>impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; no, on the contrary he ſeverely threatens thoſe who continue in any known Sin, and break the leaſt of his Commandments; that they ſhall <hi>not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Should the <hi>Solifidian</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004499_0030_100D5B1A2F9A18A0"/>
               <hi>Scheme</hi> be embraced with all the abſurd Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as 'tis inculcated by <hi>Some</hi>; it could not fail (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its natural tendency) to have a bad Effect upon Men's Manners: It would make them diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>virtuous Actions,</hi> and diſregard Morality, even <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> as a mean and low attainment. This muſt in ſome Degree obſtruct the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel</hi>: and be an Obſtacle to the Converſion of ſenſible and underſtanding Men either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi> How could we demonſtrate to them the excellency of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or ſhew them the advantage of it, or prevail with them to embrace it, if they muſt renounce their <hi>Reaſon</hi> and part with their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> in the Exchange? This would deſervedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nder it to <hi>the Jews a Stumbling Block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs.</hi> This is moreover a rejecting the Commands of God (for which our Lord ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Phariſees, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9.) that Men may <hi>keep their own Traditions,</hi> i.e. may ſtrictly adhere to the Prejudices and diſtinguiſhing however unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or unreaſonable Tenets of a Party. This is certainly in the moſt obvious Senſe <hi>to make void the Law of Faith,</hi> which is the Rule and Meaſure whereby our Lives are to be reform'd and governed; becauſe if good Works are not neceſſary to our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and juſtification, for what are they neceſſary? And if they are not for our acceptance with God, or at all neceſſary; what reaſon has any Man to concern or trouble himſelf about them? St <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rejects this wild Hypotheſis with great and juſt abhorrence; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Do we then make void</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004499_0031_100D5B1BB549C4F8"/>
               <hi>the Law thro' Faith? God forbid.</hi> God forbid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the Statutes of the Lord, which are right, pure and rejoice the Heart, ſhould be abrogated and made void, and that too by <hi>Faith</hi>; by the Faith of the glorious Goſpel, that noble and excellent Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for the Promotion of holineſs and happineſs among Men; that laſt and moſt perfect Application of the <hi>Divine Phyſician</hi> for the recovery and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a ſinful and degenerate World.</p>
            <p>Again Ildly St <hi>James</hi> argues that <hi>Faith</hi> without Works is but a dead Faith, becauſe it cannot be ſhowen. It has no Proofs, no Evidences, is like a Cauſe without Effects; and for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, is as it were not exiſtent. This much the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intimates in the Words of my Text, Saving <hi>ſhew me thy</hi> Faith <hi>without thy Works; and I will ſhow thee my</hi> Faith <hi>by my Works.</hi> By which manner or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion 'tis manifeſtly implied, that true <hi>Faith</hi> may be known by <hi>good Works,</hi> as a <hi>good Tree is known by good Fruits,</hi> but cannot without them. For in the Name of Goodneſs, how can he, that doth not practice according to his Profeſſion, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he believes what he pretends to be perſwaded of? Is it not commonly obſerved that Men act, even in their worldly Affairs, according to their real Perſuaſions? Thus if any prudent Perſon firmly believes, that ſome particular acquaintance of his own will prove a good Friend, an uſeful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to him; he will by all proper Means ſeek to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf more &amp; more, &amp; to court and ſecure
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004499_0032_100D5B1DF077AF30"/>
his Countenance and Favour. Or if one ſhould be really perſwaded, that at ſuch a Time and ſuch a Place, he ſhall reap ſome conſiderable Benefit and Advantage, he will be ſure to give his punctual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, for fear of loſing ſo fair an Opportunity; and ſo it is in many other Caſes.</p>
            <p>If therefore Men pretend to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet do not live as becomes the Diſciples of the meek and holy <hi>Jeſus.</hi> It they profeſs to believe the holy Scriptures, and yet do not obſerve what they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach and enjoin; if they are aſhamed of found religious Principles, becauſe they are run down by Numbers &amp; will not turn to preſent Account. Why, theſe are ſhrew'd, nay certain Signs that they do not truely and really believe what they pretend, ſo that <hi>Faith</hi> in this reſpect alſo is but a <hi>dead Faith</hi>; it brings forth no Fruit, has no proper Evidences to prove it; nay the want of good Works rather proves it to be only a falſe, pretended and hypocritical <hi>Faith</hi>: For that Faith is only Fancy which thinks to be crown'd without Obedience. If our Principles and Practices be not of a Piece, if they do not mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſupport and adorn each other, we are not <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to newneſs of Life, but are ſtill dead in our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add at preſent, that without all doubt, our <hi>Juſtification</hi> in this Life muſt, proceed by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Meaſures, that it will do at the <hi>laſt Day,</hi> when we ſhall publickly receive it from the Mouth of our Supreme Judge; who hath before hand told

            <p>AFter I had this Morning explain'd theſe Words, I ſhew'd in the <hi>Iſt Place,</hi> that <hi>Faith was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Salvation</hi>; becauſe it is the very Foundation of a religious and devout frame of Soul; the firſt Principle of the Chriſtian Life, and the Maſter Spring that excites and guides our ſpiritual Motions, towards the attainment of everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For according to our <hi>bleſſed Saviours</hi> expreſs Declaration, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; and if ye believe not that I am he,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the promiſed Meſſiah) <hi>ye ſhall die in your Sins.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief affronts <hi>God,</hi> and is a manifeſt Contempt of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Goodneſs, and does what it can to defeat his gracious Deſigns to ſave Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>IId Place</hi> I propoſed to ſhew, that <hi>Faith alone</hi> is not ſufficient unto Salvation unleſs it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>good Works</hi>; ſuch Works as the precepts of the Goſpel enjoin and require, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <hi>we are juſtified by Faith,</hi> he means an
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004499_0035_100D5AA29048CED8"/>
active and lively Faith, which approves itſelf by a ſincere Obedience, and that too rendered eaſy and practicable by the Succours of Heaven, by the Grace and Strength of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>James</hi> proves in this Chapter, that <hi>Faith</hi> when it does not produce <hi>good Works,</hi> is dead, life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unactive, and by a neceſſary Conſequence is inſufficient to <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Argument which he makes uſe of to this purpoſe is ver. 14. The <hi>Faith</hi> that Juſtifies muſt not only be a bare Aſſent of the Underſtanding to the Goſpel, but muſt include Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thereof; and if it does not, it no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> than good Words to a Man in want deſerves the Name of <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>IId Argument</hi> is contain'd in my <hi>Text,</hi> which proves that <hi>Faith may he ſhew'd by good Works, but cannot without them.</hi> A Man may pretend that he believes; but if his Practice be diſgreble to his Profeſſion, 'tis the ſhrewdeſt Sign in the World, that he does not believe what he pretends. If our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices do not mutually ſupport and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn each other, we are not raiſed to newneſs of Life, but are ſtill dead in our Sins. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p>A <hi>IIId Argument</hi> is advanced in the Context, to prove that <hi>Faith without Works is but a dead Faith</hi>; becauſe it is no more, nor nothing better, than what even <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves have. This St. <hi>James</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004499_0036_100D310354E34A40"/>
plainly intimates in the 19, and 20 ver.—<hi>Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that there is one God, thou do'ſt well; the Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> Are theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unclean Spirits not deſtitute of Faith; what a woeful and deſperate Condition then muſt ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monq Chriſtians be in, who continue in a State of groſs or affected Infidelity; not only void of Faith, but Oppoſers of it too? Seeing in this Caſe, they not only fall ſhort of the Attainments of <hi>Devils</hi>; but alſo go as great, if not greater, lengths in their Enmity to <hi>Faith</hi> the Faith of the Goſpel; for the <hi>Devils both believe and tremble.</hi> We read in the Oracles of ſacred Truth, that theſe evil Spirits have ſeveral Times made open Confeſſion of ſome of the prime Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; Thus <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 24. <hi>the unclean Spirits its fell down before</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and confeſſed him to be</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>the holy One of God.</hi> And Ch. 5. 7. The Legion of Devils which entred into the Herd of Swine, acknowledged that <hi>Jeſus was the Son of the moſt high God.</hi> Thus likewiſe the Damſel, poſſeſſed with a Spirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, told the People of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; that <hi>theſe Men were the Servants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Acts 16. 17.</p>
            <p>From all which it undeniably appears, that the Devils are not deſtitute of Faith, ſince they have confeſſed that Chriſt is the Son of God; and that his Goſpel and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles inſtruct us how to walk in the Paths of Righteouſneſs, that lead directly to the Gates of Heaven.

               <hi>prime Articles</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith: But can any Man be ſo abſurd, as to think he can be <hi>juſtified and ſaved,</hi> whilſt he has nothing more to qualify him for, or to intitle him to Salvation, than thoſe impure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have? Can any Man be ſo unreaſonable, as to imagine, <hi>that Faith</hi> wil be ſufficient to juſtify him before God, which carries him no greater length than what theſe accurſed Spirits have attain'd to? They have Faith, but want obedience; they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it ſeems, but cannot do well; whereas Men, by Gods preventing and aſſiſting Grace, can both believe and do well, if they be not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the uſe of the neceſſary and appointed Means. And therefore if, when God enables them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Spirit, and will not endeavour to do more than Devils; what are they better, I had almoſt ſaid how much worſe are they than theſe?</p>
            <p>The <hi>IVth Argument</hi> urged by St. <hi>James,</hi> to prove; that <hi>Faith alone is not ſufficient to Salvation</hi>; is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis different from, and unlike to that <hi>Faith,</hi> which God approved in his Saints and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of old. Thus he inſtances in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab,</hi> (ver. 21 and 25.) who were approved of, and rewarded by God, for ſhewing their Faith by their Works. As to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not he, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>juſtified by works</hi> (proceeding from his Faith) he believed God, ſhew'd his Faith, very great Faith in Gods Power and Promiſes, by leaving his Country and Friends, by offering his Son, his <hi>only Son Iſaac,</hi> and paying an entire Obedience to God's Commands, however ſeemingly ſevere they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004499_0038_100D5A7A90CB6870"/>
were. The <hi>Faith which produced theſe good Works was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs</hi>; and upon that account he was called the Friend of God.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Rahab,</hi> was not ſhe, ſays St. <hi>James, juſtified by Works</hi> (proceeding from her Faith) <hi>when ſhe had received the Meſſengers and ſent them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way.</hi> That ſhe had a ſtrong Faith in God, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 31. teſtifies, and ſhe herſelf declared it ſaying, Joſh. 2. 11. <hi>The Lord your God, he is God in Heaven above and in Earth beneath</hi>; and becauſe ſhe believed that God would give the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to his peculiar People the Iſralites, ſhe therefore acted according to her belief, and receiv'd into her Houſe the Men that were ſent to ſpy out the Land; where ſhe concealed them from their Enemies, and ſaved them from falling into their Hands; and by ſo doing preſerved herſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from the Deſtruction that fell upon the City of <hi>Jericho,</hi> where ſhe dwelt.</p>
            <p>Now if our Faith were like theirs as lively, ſtrong and vigorous; the Effects of it too would be as great, viſible and conſpicuous, had we the like Occaſion to ſhew it. Were we thoroughly and habitually peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that all the precepts of our Religion are the expreſs Laws of the ever-living Sin-revenging God; and that all the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſpel will one Day be verified and made good; what manner of Perſons would we ſtrive to be in <hi>all holy Conſervation and Godlineſs</hi>? How would the lively Hopes of another World raiſe us above the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004499_0039_100D5A7C518C6E80"/>
Vanities of this preſent Life; and ſet us out of the reach of the moſt powerful Temptations, that this World can aſſault us withal: Such a Faith would certainly induce us to do all things with a view to Eternity, with a due Regard to that ſolemn and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account we muſt all one Day make to the Sovereign Judge of the whole Univerſe. Such a Faith would never ſuffer us to be biaſed by worldly Intereſt or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Views, in Oppoſition to ſacred Truth, to Chriſtian Unity, and to the Dictates of a well-inform'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that faithful Monitor and Gods Vicegerent within us. <hi>Abrahams</hi>'s outward Actions declared his inward Principles; his Obedience was proportioned to his Faith; becauſe the one was ſtrong and lively, the other was conſtant and uniform; becauſe his Faith was not ſtaggered, he was called the <hi>Father of the Faithful</hi>; and became an illuſtrious Example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſincere perſevering Obedience in the moſt difficult Inſtance. <hi>Now,</hi> faith the Lord, <hi>I know that thou loveſt me: becauſe thou haſt not witheld thy Son, thine only Son from me.</hi>

Vicious and corrupts Minds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004499_0041_100D5A80999C1F30"/>
who hate to be reformed, and are Enemies to <hi>moral Virtues,</hi> which are the eternal and unalterable Laws of God, muſt of Courſe be averſe to the true Doctrine of the Goſpel; or if they profeſs Chriſtianity, they always place Religion in the frequent uſe of bare outward Means, Forms and Cerimonies; or in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Syſtems</hi> of Opinions conſiſtent with unrighteous, uncharitable, diſorderly Practice and Behaviour. But ſuch Perſons are miſerably deceived: For in this (faith St. <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 3. 10.) <hi>the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil; whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, I think, it may appear plain and evident to every candid, unprejudiced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that their Notion of Faith is not juſt and true, who aſſert that a firm Belief, a ſtrong Perſuaſion, or as they are wont to expreſs it in unſcriptural Phraſes, a Recumbence, Reſting or Relying on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Juſtifies Sinners, without any manner of regard to the other Terms of the <hi>New and better Covenant.</hi> This Notion of Faith as it is without any good Foundation from Divine Revelation, ſo it very much tends to overthrow all the Arguments and Motives to a holy Life, contained in the Bible; and can never be fairly reconciled with thoſe Texts which make Repentance, good Works and new Obedience abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation: For is it not as plain in many Paſſages of holy Scripture, as words can expreſs it, that to <hi>repent, to turn to God,</hi> and to <hi>do works meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> are required of us, in order to obtain the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004499_0042_100D5A822131F490"/>
pardon of our Sins, and the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Faith alone does not juſtify;</hi> and indeed, ſtrictly ſpeaking, neither <hi>Faith nor Works juſtify</hi>; i.e. neither of them is, or can be the meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification: 'Tis God that juſtifies through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. Faith, 'tis true, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted means, upon which God has promiſed us an Intereſt in Chriſts merits; but ſo likewise are Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Prayer and Obedience; and that Faith only is to be accounted juſtifying, which is operative and diſcovereth itſelf by <hi>holineſs of Life; without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> The good Works we ſhould perform, the evil Actions we ſhould avoid in this Life, and the Rewards and Puniſhments we are to expect in the next, ought frequently to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Thoughts, and to be the ſubjects of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Let ignorant or ill-deſigning Men call inſiſting on ſuch Topicks <hi>moral Preaching</hi>; yet ſure I am 'tis preaching after the Pattern of our Saviours Divine Sermons: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> often made <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Humility, Contentment,</hi> and a <hi>Judgement to come,</hi> the chief Subjects of his Diſcourſes; and ſo doing preached Jeſus Chriſt, and convinced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted many to the Faith of the Goſpel. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt doth abundantly ſtrengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the moral Law, by repeating and renewing its Precepts, by giving them a freſh Promulgation, and ſtamping them with the Impreſs of greater Authority;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004499_0043_100D5A83AA6BB5F0"/>
by clearing and improving the Senſe and Obligation of them; and by adding thereto new expreſs precepts of its own; ſuch as the <hi>Love of Enemies, poverty of Spirit</hi> and <hi>Self-denial</hi>; and finally by enforcing the old and new Precepts, by more powerful and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sanctions, by more precious Promiſes and ſeverer Threatnings, by better Evidence and a greater Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of both, as <hi>bringing Life and Immortality to light</hi>; which before the Son of Righteouſneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd was clouded with much Darkneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; and which Men either did not heartily and fully believe, or upon very uncertain and unſatisfying Principles.</p>
            <p>In all theſe reſpects the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the greateſt eſtabliſhment of the Law; and the Chriſtian Faith rightly underſtood layes an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Obligation on all its Votaries, to a ſuitable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in all the Virtues and moral Duties, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004499_0045_100D5A8991007E48"/>
the Divine Grace and Spine; and which we promiſe ſolemnly at our Baptiſm, and in the other holy .Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>If <hi>we would ſhew our Faith,</hi> we muſt have our Converſation much in Heaven, and look beyond Things preſent and ſenſible, to things which arc not ſeen, but are eternal; labouring principally to ſecure the great Intereſts of another World; and referring all the Actions of this ſhort and dying Life, to that State which will ſhortly begin, but never have an End. If we are not thus ſerious and ſervent in our Devotions, and hearty and conſtant in our Endeavours to glorify God, to lead holy &amp; Chriſtian Lives; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretences to Salvation will moſt certainly fail us: It will ſignify nothing to rely upon any other Election, than that which is made ſure, and may be ſhewn by a lively Faith and virtuous Corverſation. We are all to be eſteemed the Elect of God, if we live as becomes the Diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus; but ſhall be found Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates if we do not. We ſhould therefore</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Shew our Faith by the habitual Practice of thoſe Virtues, which the Goſpel warmly recommends; ſuch as <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility, Patience</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance, Purity</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honeſty, Forbearance</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givneſs Brotherly Love</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Theſe are the genuine Effects of Faith, the bleſſed Fruits of the Spirit; and muſt be ſtudied and carefully practiſed by all the ſincere Followers, and true Diſciples of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>; who <hi>was made Fleſh and dwelt among us,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:004499_0046_100D5A8B16314A28"/>
that in his own Perſon and Life he might give us an Example of all that Purity and Holineſs, of all that Virtue and Godlineſs of Living, which his Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to perform. Religion, <hi>true and reaſonable</hi> Religion did always chiefly conſiſt in Immitation of God, in as near a reſemblance, as is conſiſtent with with finite frail human Nature, of thoſe Excellencies which ſhine forth in the beſt and moſt perfect Being. But we may now ſtrive to imitate him with much greater eaſe and advantage, ſince God was pleaſed to become Man, on purpoſe to purchaſe Peace and Pardon for us; to turn us from Darkneſs to Light, and to ſhew us how Men may become like to God.</p>
            <p>We cannot <hi>ſhew our Faith in him,</hi> unleſs on the other Hand we <hi>abſtain from every appearance of evil,</hi> and renounce <hi>having fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs,</hi> we muſt put away from us all Pride, eſpecially <hi>ſpiritual Pride,</hi> and Ambition, all uncharitableneſs and evil-ſpeaking, Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſpiteful Reſentment, Cruelty and Injuſtice. Our bleſſed Saviour came into the World to root out and deſtroy theſe Vices, and others of a like Nature; and therefore ſo long as we continue in any of them, we may well be conſtrued to <hi>deny the Lord that bought us,</hi> and <hi>to put him to an open Shame</hi>; ſo far would we be from demeaning ourſelves, as highly becomes his Diſcipies; or ſhewing forth our Faith in him.</p>
            <p>To teach otherwiſe is to transform and disfigure the Goſpel of Chriſt and to undermine the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

Deſign thereof; for if we believe in God, and truſt to be ſaved by the Merits and Interceſſion of our gracious Redeemer, we muſt be careful to ſhun every thing diſpleaſing in his ſight, and to live as becomes rational Creatures, tho' ſold under Sin, yet ranſomed by his precious Blood. This very Faith would naturally engage us to be vigilant and circumſpect, to watch and guard againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be wiſe as Serpents and harmleſs as Doves; For <hi>Chriſt manifeſted in the Fleſh,</hi> and the other Myſteries of our Faith are Myſteries of Godlineſs, and deſigned to enlighten our Underſtandings, to warm and purify our Hearts, to raiſe and ſublimate our Affections, to enliven and extend our Hopes, and to command a ſuitable Life, a correſpondent Practice.</p>

            <p>No Man therefore ſhould take up his Religion, the Profeſſion of his Faith upon truſt; and yeild in that point, wherein his eternal Welfare is concerned, to the plauſible pretences of Infallibility, to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Recommendation of others perhaps more inconſiderate, raſh, and ignorant than himſelf: But it ſhould be a rational Service, the reſult of our own mature, impartial, well-weigh'd Conſideration; and what we find conſonant and agreeable to the Dictates of ſound Reaſon and divine Revelation.

St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 'tis true, ſays, <hi>It is a faithful Saying and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners</hi>; but moſt certainly Chriſt came not to ſave obſtinate, impenitent, perſevering Sinners: No, againſt ſuch the full Vials of Divine wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance are Threatned: But they are only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, penitent and reforming Sinners, that have any juſt Claim to the Merits of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours precious Death and gracious Interceſſion; and to them alone is that <hi>faithful Saying</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>We muſt not think it is poſſible for us to mount above the Clouds, through the Vapours of repeated Debaucheries; or to jump directly out of a <hi>Dalilahs</hi>

Lap into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſom; <hi>what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? what Concord hath Chriſt with Belief?</hi> None ſurelv. They only that have <hi>done good ſhall go into Life everlaſting; but they that have done evil into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> The Time will come (ſays <hi>Biſhop Taylor</hi>) when it: will more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail thee, O Man, to have ſubdued one Luſt, than to have known all Myſteries. And <hi>tho' I have all Faith,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, and have not Charity,</hi> (that quiet and peacable, that kind, benevolent and ſocial Virtue <hi>Charity</hi>) <hi>I am nothing,</hi> i. e. he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly concluded, he had no title to the ſavour of God, if he ſhould diſgrace the Chriſtian Profeſſion by harſhly ceſuring others, by treating his fellow Creatures with inſulting rudeneſs. It is highly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, and altogether inconſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> to virify and defame, to accuſe and condemn our <hi>Brethren both the Living and the Dead</hi>; but I only mention this, and am ſorry there ſhould be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it.</p>
            <p>To. conclude, Let all of us, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> as we tender our preſent or future Happineſs; let all of us, at all Time?, endeavour to frame our Lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Chriſtian Faith. Let our Belief have its due Influence upon our daily Actions and Dealings with others; that we may not only be juſt and charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but candid and inoffenſive; <hi>as far as poſſible living peaceably with all Men.</hi> Our Zeal even for our <hi>Faith,</hi> far leſs for uncertain, controverted Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſhould never out-run the Bounds of <hi>Chriſtian Prudence,</hi> of Obedience to Superiors, and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion

to Inferiors. By doing theſe Things in the fear of God, <hi>we ſhew forth our Faith</hi>; If not, all the Precepts, the Promises and Threatnings of the Goſpel will riſe up in Judgment againſt us; the Articles of our Faith will be ſo many Articles of our Accuſation; and it will be a weighty Aggravation of the Charge laid againſt us; that we Profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith, but lived like <hi>unbelieving Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion is ſo well confirmed by clear and undeniable Evidence, that not to believe it is very abſurd, unreaſonable and impious: But to be fully perſuaded that it is true, and yet to live wickedly as if it were falſe, is the greateſt Contradiction to Truth that can be, and manifeſtly expoſes to the greateſt Danger: For the whole World cannot produce a more wretched and miſerable Perſon, than a deluded and degenerate Chriſtian; who falls into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Perdition, after he has groſly abuſed the greateſt Advantages, and willfully neglected the beſt Opportunities of being forever and infinitely bleſſed and happy.</p>
            <p>That we may avoid falling into ſo deplorable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, let us in earneſt and ſervent Prayer beg of God, who hath promiſed <hi>to give to them that ask him,</hi> the neceſſary Aſſiſtance of his Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to enable us to grow in every Grace and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to abound in all the Fruits of Faith and Righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the Glory of God.</p>
