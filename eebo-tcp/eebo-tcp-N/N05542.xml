            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>NOT knowing but the <hi>Indians</hi> might be waiting at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> we made all the Diſpatch poſſible, as ſoon as we had received our Commiſſion, and arrived there on the Twenty-ſixth, but were agreeably ſurprized to find that they came there only that Day.</p>
            <p>IMMEDIATELY on our Arrival we conferred with <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> and <hi>George Croghan,</hi> in order to know from them what had occaſioned the preſent coming of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that we might, by their Intelligence, regulate our firſt Intercourſe with them; and were informed, that tho' their principal Deſign, when they left <hi>Ohio,</hi> was to hold a Treaty with the Government of <hi>Virginia,</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where they had accordingly been; yet they intended a viſit to this Province, to which they had been frequently encouraged by <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> who told them, he had the Governor's repeated Orders to invite them to come and ſee him, and aſſured them of an hearty Welcome; and that they had moreover ſome important Matters to propoſe and tranſact with this Government.</p>
            <p>THE Commiſſioners finding this to be the Caſe, and that theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were ſome of the moſt conſiderable Perſons of the <hi>Six Nations, Delawares, Shawoneſe,</hi> with Deputies from the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> and <hi>Owendats,</hi> met them in Council, in which the Commiſſioners declared the Contents of their Commiſſion, acknowledged the Governor's Invitation, and bid them heartily welcome among their Brethren of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to whom their Viſit was extremely agreeable. — <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> and <hi>Andrew Montour</hi> interpreting between the Commiſſioners and <hi>Indians</hi> and ſeveral Magiſtrates, and others, of the principal Inhabitants of the County, favouring them with their Preſence.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Twightwees</hi> and <hi>Delawares</hi> having had ſeveral of their great Men cut off by the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> and all the Chiefs of the <hi>Owendats</hi> being lately dead, it became neceſſary to condole their Loſs; and no Buſineſs could be begun, agreeable to the <hi>Indian</hi> Cuſtoms, till the Condolances were paſſed; and as theſe could not be made, with the uſual Ceremonies, for want of the Goods, which were not arrived, and it was uncertain when they would, the Commiſſioners were put to ſome Difficulties, and ordered the Interpreters to apply to <hi>Scarrowyady,</hi> an <hi>Oneido</hi> Chief, who had the Conduct of the Treaty in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and was a Perſon of great Weight in their Councils, and to aſk his Opinion, whether the Condolances would be accepted by Belts and Strings, and Liſts of the particular Goods intended to be given, with Aſſurances of their Delivery as ſoon as they ſhould come. <hi>Scarrowyady</hi> was pleaſed with their Application; but frankly declared, that the <hi>Indians</hi> could not proceed to Buſineſs while the Blood remained on their Garments, and that the Condolances could not be accepted unleſs the Goods, intended to cover the Graves, were actually ſpread on the Ground before them. A Meſſenger was therefore forthwith ſent to meet and haſten the Waggoners, ſince every Thing muſt ſtop till the Goods came.</p>
            <p>It was then agreed to confer with <hi>Scarrowyady,</hi> and ſome others of the Chiefs of the <hi>Shawoneſe</hi> and <hi>Delawares,</hi> on the State of Affairs at <hi>Ohio,</hi> and from them the Commiſſioners learned, in ſundry Conferences, the following Particulars, viz.</p>
            <p>"THAT when the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania's</hi> Expreſs arrived at <hi>Ohio,</hi> with the Account of the March of a large <hi>French</hi> Army to the Heads of <hi>Ohio,</hi> with Intent to take Poſſeſſion of that Country, it alarmed the <hi>Indians</hi> ſo much, that the <hi>Delawares,</hi> at <hi>Weningo,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Town, ſituate high up on <hi>Ohio</hi> River, went, agreeable to a Cuſtom eſtabliſhed among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and forbad, by a formal Notice, the Commander of that Armament, then advanced to the <hi>Straits,</hi> between Lake <hi>Ontario</hi> and Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> to continue his March, at least not to preſume to come farther than <hi>Niagara.</hi> This had <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007026_0003_102AEBEEA4646800"/>not however any Effect, but, notwithſtanding this No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>SCARROOYADY, who was the Speaker in theſe Conferences, when he had finiſhed this Relation, gave his Reaſon for ſetting forth theſe three Meſſages to the <hi>French</hi> in ſo diſtinct a manner; becauſe, ſaid he, the Great Being who lives above, has ordered us to ſend three Meſſages of Peace before we make War: — And as the <hi>Half King</hi> has, before this Time, delivered the third and laſt Meſſage, we have nothing now to do but to ſtrike the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007026_0004_102AEBF0317E5960"/>THE Commiſſioners were likewiſe informed, by Mr. Croghan, that the <hi>Ohio Indians</hi> had received from the <hi>Virginia</hi> Government at large Number of Arms in the Spring, and that at their preſſing Inſtances a ſuitable Quantity of Ammunition was ordered in the Treaty at <hi>Winchester</hi> to be lodged for them, in a Place of Security, on this Side the <hi>Ohio,</hi> which was committed to the Care of three Perſons, viz. <hi>Gueſt, William Trent,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> who were impowered to diſtribute them to the <hi>Indians</hi> as their Occaſions and Behaviour ſhould require. That all the Tribes ſettled at or near <hi>Allegheny</hi> would, take their Measures from the Encouragement which the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould find in the Province of <hi>Virginia</hi>; and that the kind Intentions of this Government in the Appropriation of a large Sum of Money for the Uſe of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> in caſe they ſhould be diſtreſſed by their Enemies, and their Hunting and Planting prevented, were well known to them by the repeated Informations of <hi>Andrew Montour</hi> and the Traders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CONRAD WEISER,</hi> to whom it was earneſtly recommended by the Commiſſioners, to procure all the Information poſſible from the <hi>Indians</hi> of his Acquaintance, touching their Condition and Diſpoſition, and the real Deſigns of the <hi>French,</hi> did likewiſe acquaint us, that all Perſons at <hi>Ohio</hi> would have their Eyes on the Reception of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> now at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and judge of the Affection of this Province by their Treatment of them: and that as the intended Preſent was no Secret to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> it was his Opinion, that the Whole ſhould, at this Time, be diſtributed; for if any Thing can, ſuch a generous Donation muſt needs attach the <hi>Indians</hi> entirely to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE ſeveral Matters being taken into Conſideration by the Commiſſioners, and the Governor having given them expreſs Directions to accommodate themſelves to the Circumſtances of the <hi>Indians,</hi> as they ſhould appear in examining them at the Place of Treaty, we were unanimouſly of Opinion, that an Addition ſhould be made to the Goods bought at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in which a Regard ſhould be had to ſuch Articles as were omitted or ſupplied in leſs Quantities than was ſuitable to the preſent Wants of the <hi>Indians.</hi> On this Reſolution the Liſts of Goods were examined, and an additional Quantity bought of <hi>John Carſon,</hi> at the <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Price, and uſual Rate of Carriage.</p>
            <p>DURING theſe Conſultations, it was rumoured that the <hi>Half King</hi> was returned to <hi>Logs-Town,</hi> and had received an unſatisfactory Answer, which was confirmed, but not in ſuch Manner as could be poſitively relied on, by a Brother of <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> and another Perſon who came directly from <hi>Allegheny.</hi> This alarmed the Commiſſioners, and made them willing poſtpone Buſineſs till they ſhould know the Certainty thereof, judging, that if the <hi>Half King</hi> was returned, he would certainly ſend a Meſſenger Expreſs to <hi>Carliſle</hi> with an Account of what was done by him; and from this the Commiſſioners might take their Meaſures in the Diſtribution of the Preſent.</p>
            <p>A LETTER, wrote by <hi>Taaf,</hi> and <hi>Callender,</hi> two <hi>Indian</hi> Traders, dated the twenty-eight Day of <hi>September,</hi> from a Place ſituate a little on this Side <hi>Allegheny River,</hi> directed to <hi>William Buchannan,</hi> was given him in the Morning of the firſt Day of <hi>October,</hi> and he immediately laid it before the Commiſſioners for their Peruſal. In this Letter an Account is given, that the <hi>Half King</hi> was returned, and had been received in a very contemptuous Manner by the <hi>French</hi> Commander, who was then preparing with his Forces to come down the River; and that the <hi>Half King,</hi> on his Return, ſhed Tears, and had actually warned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders not to paſs the <hi>Ohio,</hi> nor to venture either their Perſons or their Goods, for the <hi>French</hi> would certainly hurt them. On this News the Conferences with <hi>Scarrooyady,</hi> and the Chiefs of the <hi>Six Nations, Delawares,</hi> and <hi>Shawoneſt,</hi> were renewed, and the Letter read to them, at which they appeared greatly alarmed; but, after a ſhort Pauſe, <hi>Scarrooyady,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawoneſe,</hi> ſpoke in theſe Words:</p>

                  <p>IT has pleaſed Him who is above, that we ſhall meet here To-day, and ſee one another; I and my Brother <hi>Onas</hi> join together to ſpeak to you. As we know that your Seats at Home are bloody, we wipe away the Blood, and ſet your Seats in Order at your Council Fire, that you may ſit and conſult again in Peace and Comfort as formerly; that You may hold the antient Union, and ſtrengthen it, and continue your old friendly Correſpondence.</p>

                  <p>WE ſuppoſe that the Blood is now waſhed off. We jointly, with our Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> dig a Grave for your Warriors, killed in your Country; and we bury their Bones decently; wrapping them up in theſe Blankets; and with theſe we cover their Graves.</p>

                  <p>We muſt let you know, that there was a Friendſhip eſtabliſhed by our and your Grandfathers; and a mutual Council Fire was kindled. In this Friendſhip all thoſe then under the Ground, who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>WE, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Six Nations,</hi> do now exhort every one of you to do your utmoſt to preſerve this Union and Friendſhip, which has ſo long and happily continued among us: Let us keep the Chain from ruſting, and prevent every Thing that may hurt or break it, from what Quarter ſoever it may come.</p>

                  <p>YOU have recommended to us the ſeveral Nations, who, you ſay, live in that great Extent of Country, over which our Traders travel to diſpoſe of their Goods, and eſpecially the <hi>Twightwees, Adirondacks,</hi> and <hi>Caghnawagas,</hi> who you ſay live at different Extremities, and have good Inclinations towards the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> — We believe you would not give them this Character unleſs they deſerved it. Your Recommendations always will have a Weight with Us, and will diſpoſe us in Favour of them, agreeable to your Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>THE ſeveral Articles which contain your obſervations on the <hi>Indian</hi> Traders, and the looſe ſtragling Manner in which that Trade is carried on, thro' Countries lying at great Diſtances from your Towns — Your Propoſals to remedy this, by having named three Places for the Traders to reſide in, under your Care and Protection, with a Requeſt, that the Province would appoint the particular Perſon to be concerned in this Trade, for whom they will be anſwerable — What you ſay about the vaſt Quantities of Rum, and its ill Effects, and that no more may be brought a ongſt you; all theſe have made a very ſtrong Impreſſion upon our Minds; and was it now in our Power to rectify theſe Diſorders, and to put Matters on the Footing you propoſe, we would do it with great Pleaſure: But theſe are Affairs which more immediately concern the Government; in theſe therefore, we ſhall imitate your Example, by laying them before the Governor, aſſuring you, that our heartieſt Repreſentations of the Neceſſity of theſe Regulations ſhall not be wanting, being convinced, that unleſs ſomething effectual be <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007026_0010_102AEBFB39268228"/>ſpeedily done in theſe Matters, the good People of this Province can no longer expect Safety or <hi>Profit</hi> in their Commerce, nor the Continuance of your Affection.</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>We will ſend an Account to <hi>Onondago</hi> of all that has been tranſacted between us.</p>
                  <p>We will aſſiſt you with Horſes for the Carriage of the Goods given you.</p>
                  <p>We grant your Women and young Men their Requeſt for Rum, on Condition it be not delivered to them until You ſhall have paſſed the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>SCARROOYADY ſome Days ago deſired us to give Orders for the Mending of your Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we did ſo; being obliged to ſend for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Gunſmith out of the Country, as no One of that Trade lived in the Town; who promiſed to come: But having broke his Word, it has not been in our Power to comply with this Requeſt.</p>
                  <stage>Here the String given with the Requeſt was returned.</stage>
                  <p>HAVING delivered our general Anſwer, we ſhall now proceed to give one to what was ſaid by particular Nations, as well by the <hi>Shawoneſe</hi> in the Forenoon, as by the <hi>Twightwees</hi> in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Delawares, <hi>and</hi> Shawoneſe,</p>
                  <p>We are glad to ſee you in ſuch good Diſpoſitions to each other. We entreat you to do every Thing you can to preſerve the Continuance of this agreeable Harmony. The <hi>Shawoneſe</hi> may be aſſured we retain no Manner of Remembrance of their former Miſcarriages: We are perfectly reconciled, and our Eſteem for their Nation is the ſame as ever.</p>
                  <stage>Gave a large String.</stage>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Twightwees,</p>
                  <p>We ſhall take your ſeveral Preſents, Shells, Strings, Beaver, Blanket, and Calumet Pipe, with us, and deliver them to the Governor; that theſe and the ſeveral Things ſaid at the Delivery of them, may remain in the Council Chamber, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for our mutual Uſe and Remembrance, whenever it ſhall pleaſe the Great Being, who ſits above, to bring us together in Council again.</p>
                  <p>Gave a long String.</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>WE deſire you will ſend theſe two Strouds to the young King, as an Acknowledgment of our affectionate Remembrance of his Father's Love to us, and of our Good-will to him.</p>
                  <p>BE pleaſed to preſent to the Widow of the <hi>Piankaſha</hi> King, our late hearty Friend, theſe Handkerchiefs, to wipe the Tears from her Eyes; and likewiſe give her Son theſe two Strowds to clothe him.</p>
                  <stage>Here two Handkerchiefs and two Strands were given.</stage>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren</hi> Twightwees,</p>
                  <p>WE aſſure you we entertain no hard Thoughts of you; nor in any wiſe impute to you the Misfortune that befel the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in your Town; it was the Chance of War: We were ſtruck together; we fell together; and we lament your Loſs equally with our own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Six Nations, Delawares, Shawoneſe, Twightwees, <hi>and</hi> Owendats,</p>
                  <p>WE have now finiſhed our Anſwers; and We hope they will be agreeable to you: Whatever we have ſaid, has been with a hearty Good-will towards you; our Hearts have accompanied our Profeſſions, and you will always find our Actions agreeable to them. Then the Commiſſioners were ſilent; and after a Space of Time, renewed their Speeches to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> Six Nations, Delawares, Shawoneſe, Twightwees, and Owendats,</p>
                  <p>WE have ſomething to ſay to you, to which we entreat you will give your cloſeſt Attention, ſince it concerns both us and You very much.</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>WE have held a Council on the preſent Situation of your Affairs. We have Reaſon to think, from the Advices of <hi>Taaf</hi> and <hi>Callender,</hi> that it would be too great a Riſque, conſidering the preſent Diſorder Things are in at <hi>Ohio,</hi> to encreaſe the Quantity of Goods already given you: We therefore acquaint you, that, though the Governor has furniſhed us with a larger Preſent of Goods, to put into your publick Store houſe, as a general Stock, for your Support and Service, and we did intend to have ſent them along with you; we have, on this late diſagreeable Piece of News, altered our Minds, and determined, that the Goods ſhall not be delivered till the Governor be made acquainted with your preſent Circumſtances, and ſhall give his own Orders for the Diſpoſal of them. And that they may lie ready for your Uſe, to be applied for, whenever the Delivery may be ſafe, ſeaſonable, and likely to do you the moſt Service; we have committed them to the Care of your good Friend <hi>George Croghan,</hi> who is to tranſmit to the Governor, by Expreſs, a true and faithful Account how your Matters are likely to turn out; and on the Governor's Order, and not otherwiſe, to put you into the Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>THIS we hope you will think a prudent Caution, and a Teſtimony of our Care for your real good and Welfare.</p>

                  <p>WE have a Favour of a particular Nature to requeſt from your <hi>Speaker, Scarrooyady,</hi> in which we expect your Concurrence, and joint Intereſt; and therefore make it to him in your Preſence.</p>

                  <stage>Here the Commiſſioners applying to <hi>Scarrooyady,</hi> ſpoke as follows:</stage>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſpected Chief and Brother</hi> Scarrooyady,</p>
                  <p>We have been informed by <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> and <hi>George Croghan,</hi> that you did at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in publick Council, undertake to go to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may, perhaps, be afraid to diſoblige the <hi>Shawoneſe,</hi> as it was at their Inſtance you undertook this Journey; but we intend to ſpeak to them, and have no Doubt of obtaining their Conſent; convinc'd as we are, that the Releaſe of theſe Priſoners will be ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <stage>Gave a String.</stage>
               </sp>
               <p>THE <hi>Shawoneſe</hi> Chiefs expreſſing Diſſatisfaction at this Endeavour of the Commiſſioners to ſtop <hi>Scarrooyady,</hi> it gave us ſome Trouble to ſatisfy them, and obtain their Conſent; but at laſt it was effected; and when this was ſignified to <hi>Scarrooyady,</hi> he made this Anſwer.</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
                  <p>I WILL, take your Advice, and not go to <hi>Virginia</hi> at this Time, — but go Home, and do every Thing in my Power for the common Good. And ſince we are here now together, with a great deal of Pleaſure I muſt acquaint you, that we have ſet a Horn on <hi>Andrew Montour</hi>'s Head, and that you may believe what he ſays to be true, between the <hi>Six Nations</hi> and you, they have made him one of their Counſellors, and a great Man among them, and love him dearly.</p>
                  <stage>Scarrooyady <hi>gave a large Belt to</hi> Andrew Montour, <hi>and the Commiſſioners agreed to it.</hi>
                  </stage>
               </sp>
               <p>AFTER this Difficulty was got over, nothing elſe remained to be done; and as the Abſence of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> was dangerous, the Commiſſioners put an End to the Treaty, and took their Leave of them, making private Preſents at parting, to ſuch of the Chiefs, and others, as were recommended by the Interpreters to their particular Notice.</p>
               <p>THUS, may it pleaſe the Governor, we have given a full and juſt Account of all our Proceedings, and we hope our Conduct will meet with his Approbation. But, in Juſtice to theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and the Promiſes we made them, we cannot cloſe our Report, without taking Notice, That the Quantities of ſtrong Liquors ſold to theſe <hi>Indians</hi> in the Places of their Reſidence, and during their Hunting Seaſon, from all Parts of the Counties over <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> have encreaſed of late to an inconceivable Degree, ſo as to keep theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> continually under the Force of Liquor, that they are hereby become diſſolute, enfeebled and indolent when ſober, and untractable and miſchevious in their Liquor, always quarreling, and often murdering one another: That the Traders are under no Bonds, nor give any Security for their Obſervance of the Laws, and their good Behaviour; and by their own Intemperance, unfair Dealings, and Irregularities, will, it is to be feared, entirely eſtrange the Affections of the <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> deprive them of their natural Strength and Activity, and oblige them either to abandon their Country, or ſubmit to any Terms, be they ever ſo unreaſonable, from the <hi>French.</hi> Theſe Truths, may it pleaſe the Governor, are of ſo intereſting a Nature, that we ſhall ſtand excuſed in recommending in the moſt earneſt Manner, the deplorable State of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and the heavy Diſcouragements under which our Commerce with them at preſent labours, to the Governor's moſt ſerious Conſideration, that ſome good and ſpeedy Remedies may be provided, before it be too late.</p>
