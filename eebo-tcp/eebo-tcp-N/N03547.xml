            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A LETTER TO THE Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, relating to their approaching ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p>
            <q>To extend the Governour's Right to command, and Subjects Duty to obey, beyond the Laws of One's Country, is Treaſon againſt the Conſtitution, and Treachery to the Society whereof we are Members: And, to diſſolve the Ties by which Princes stand confined; and overthrow the Hedges, by which the reſerved Rights, Privileges, and Properties of the Subjects are fenced about, tempts every Prince to become a Tyrant, and to make all his Subjects Slaves.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>annual Election</hi> of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives drawing nigh, and the Importance of a good Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being greater than is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagin'd, (nothing leſs than the <hi>civil Salvation of the People</hi> depending upon the <hi>ſame</hi>) has induced me, together with the Requeſt of many of your Friends, to lay before you, the Neceſſity of uſing the greateſt Care in your ſeveral <hi>Elections,</hi> not only from the great Danger of a <hi>bad One</hi> at all Times, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the <hi>preſent</hi> Circumſtances of the Province.</p>
            <p>In order to comply with this their Requeſt, and to ſet before you the Danger <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your Posterity</hi> are brought into by a <hi>bad Election</hi>; I have publiſh'd this Letter, in which I have made uſe of ſome Helps from <hi>Cato</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> which were wrote upon the glorious Cauſe of Liberty, and have been juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by all wiſe Men of every Party; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

what is done here in Imitation of thoſe valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Letters, cannot be judged to be factious, or againſt the Intereſt of the Publick.</p>
            <p>But, however ſome may receive <hi>this,</hi> I am ſure, every true Lover of his Country, (who has Honeſty and Wiſdom enough to refuſe any Bribe offered him as an Equivalent for the leaſt Priviledge of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) will approve of it, and govern himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in voting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are born to Liberty, as you are <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> and as you are <hi>Deſcendents</hi> of the <hi>firſt worthy Setlers</hi> of this Country, who purchaſed <hi>their</hi> and <hi>your</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at the moſt invaluable Price of their <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure</hi>; it is therefore your Intereſt, and your Duty to Poſterity, to preſerve them entire, without ſuffering the leaſt Breach to be made on them.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution, which you live under, is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of a mixed Monarchy, where your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors have every Right to protect and defend you; none to injure or oppreſs you. You have a large Share in the Legiſlature; you have the ſole Power over your Purſes: But it depends upon yourſelves alone, to make theſe Rights of your's, theſe noble Priviledges of Uſe to you. And in order to make this plain to you, I ſhall recount ſome of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges you enjoy by your <hi>Charter,</hi> and ſhew what a Part you have in the Government; as the End of it is, and ought to be, wholly for your Advantage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Charter</hi> ordains, that you ſhall have a General Aſſembly, convened, held and kept, every laſt Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday in <hi>May,</hi> which ſhall conſiſt of the Governor and Council for the Time being, and of ſuch Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as ſhall be elected and deputed from time to time, by the major Part of the Freeholders, and other Inhabitants qualified to vote in that Choice, preſent at ſuch Election. This General Aſſembly, at their firſt Meeting, proceed to elect twenty eight Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; after which Election, they proceed to make
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004334_0005_10045B5F4BE4DC60"/>
what Laws may be neceſſary for the publick Good, to raiſe what Moneys may be neceſſary to ſupport the Government, in defending and protecting you this is the ſole <hi>Priviledge</hi> of your Repreſentatives. To levy and aſſeſs reaſonable Taxes and Aſſeſſments upon your Poles and Eſtates, is another Priviledge of your Repreſentatives. The General Aſſembly have the Right of diſpoſing of the waſte Lands. The Conſent of your Repreſentatives is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary in all Acts of Government, and many of them muſt originate in the Houſe, eſpecially thoſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Articles of <hi>ſupplying the Treaſury</hi> and <hi>taxing the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this you may ſee the great Share you have in the Government, having at leaſt two Branches of the Ligiſlature (who have all the Moneys and other Advantages in their Power) which are appointed by your Election. Your Repreſentatives (who are immediately of your Appointment) are the Truſtees of your Liberties, who, if they give up, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to give up any the leaſt of them, you have it in your Power, the next Year, to chooſe more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men in their Room; and ſuch Repreſentatives will chooſe ſuch Councellors, and then all will be well. For not only good Care will be taken, that no Laws but ſuch as are for your Good and Welfare ſhall be enacted; but alſo, that none be truſted with the Execution of them, except thoſe who have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Underſtanding and Integrity. Such a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly (which depends upon your Election of Repreſentatives) will be very tender of the leaſt Priviledge, and will keep a proper Guard upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Prerogative. They will be able properly to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>invaluable Priviledges</hi> granted by <hi>Charter,</hi> and the Inſtructions given to a Governour, and will know they have no Buſineſs with Inſtructions (<hi>except from the People</hi>) and that any Compliance with an Inſtruction which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Charter, is a traiterous giving up the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004334_0006_10045B660C1765E0"/>
of their Country, and an Abuſe upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. For although it be one of the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Maxims of the Engliſh Government, '<hi>That no Blame or Wrong be imputed to the King</hi>'; it is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, '<hi>That no Wrong be done to the People</hi>'. They will know, that the only Rule of their Government ought to be your Good, and that they are inviolably obliged to keep a watchful Eye upon your Charter, as their Directory, and to ſee that no Infraction be made on it. <hi>That being your Conſtitution,</hi> from ſuch a Behaviour in your Legiſlature, you may naturally expect, his Majeſty's Council (who conſtitute the middle Branch) will, in giving their Conſent to the Appointment of civil Officers, be actuated by the ſame good Principles, they were, as a Branch of the Legiſlature; and conſequently, they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Appointment of an unqualified Perſon to an executive Office in the Government, nor to the Removal of any Judge, unleſs he has been guilty of Malefeazance in his Office. It was <hi>(Gentlemen,)</hi> one of the material Bleſſings obtained at the happy Revolution, that the Tenour of the Judges Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be altered, from <hi>during Pleaſure,</hi> to, <hi>ſo long as they behave well.</hi> The Crown having the Power of creating and removing Judges at Pleaſure, was found by fatal Experience, to be one of the greateſt Misfortunes the Nation laboured under; the Law being always expounded in Favour of the Crown, from whence aroſe the Doctrines of <hi>diſpenſing Power,</hi> the <hi>Forfeitures of Charters,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſlaviſh ones, deſtructive of Liberty, which produced the Nation's Delivery from Slavery by King <hi>William</hi> of immortal Memory; who reſtored to our <hi>Forefathers</hi> their Priviledges, that they loſt in the common Calamity of thoſe Times, which ſo much endeared that glorious <hi>Deliverer</hi> to thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, that there was not then, as there ſcare is now, a <hi>Jacobite</hi> to be found in the whole Province; ſo that we can vie with any of his Majeſty's Subjects for Loyalty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004334_0007_1004178F203FFB40"/>You have here ſeen ſome ſmall Sketch of your happy <hi>Conſtitution</hi> by the Charter, which confirms to you all the Priviledges of <hi>Engliſh Men</hi>; and as a Reward for your <hi>Anceſtors</hi> great Merit in ſetling this Country, adds many others, giving you a larger in the Government, than the People in <hi>England</hi> have. The Improvement of which depends upon you whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for to preſerve your Liberties, they muſt be kept up in their whole Strength. And to this End<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it lies upon you to chooſe for your Repreſentatives, Men that will be really <hi>ſuch</hi>; Men that you can't ſuppoſe will be ignorant or careleſs of your Intereſts; or what is much worſe, that will act quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them.</p>
            <p>For Names <hi>(Gentlemen,)</hi> will not defend you, when the Thing ſignified by them is gone. The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were as abſolute with the Shew of a <hi>Senate,</hi> and the Appearance of the People's chooſing their <hi>Praetors, Tribunes,</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> as the <hi>Eaſtern Monarchs</hi> are now, without theſe ſeeming Checks, and this Shew of Liberty; and in ſome Reſpects, they were more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; as the Infamy of their Tyranny was ſhared by thoſe Aſſemblies, the Advantages were all their own, and the Condition of the People was rather worſe for theſe mock <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and pretended Repreſentatives; who, under the Colour and Title of the Protectors of the People, were, at the People's Expence, the real Helpers and Partakers of the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Tyrant. The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have <hi>Parliaments,</hi> but Parliaments which dare not diſpute their Royal Pleaſure; and the poor People would not fare one Jot the better, if theſe Parliaments were bribed not to diſpute it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This wretched Caſe,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>will be yours, and the wretched Caſe of your Poſterity,</hi> if ever an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or deſigning Governour ſhall, hereafter be able to <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>awe</hi> your Repreſentatives. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wicked Bargains are then made, will be made
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004334_0008_10045B6C2E0088F8"/>
at <hi>your Expence,</hi> and you muſt pay the terrible Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning at laſt. It requires therefore your beſt Tho'ts, and moſt vigorous Reſolutions, to preſerve your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution entire in all its Parts, without ſuffering any one Part to prevail ſo far over the other, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in Effect, tho' not in Name, to a ſimple Form of Government, which is always <hi>Tyranny.</hi> It will be immaterial to you, whether this is brought about by <hi>Confederacy,</hi> or by <hi>Force</hi>; by <hi>Knaves,</hi> or <hi>Fools</hi>; whatever be the villainous Means, <hi>Violence, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and every Rank of Evil will be the End. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with an honeſt and generous Deſign of ſaving your Country, you ought to chooſe Repreſentatives, whoſe Intereſts are at preſent the ſame with your own, and likely to continue the ſame. Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who are not already pre-engaged, nor, from their <hi>Circumſtances, Profeſſion, Offices, and Manner of Life,</hi> are likely to be engaged in a contrary Intereſt.

A great <hi>Protestant Peer of France,</hi> having changed his Religion, in Compliance with his Maſter <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th of <hi>France,</hi> who had changed too, was ſoon after asked by that <hi>Monarch</hi> publickly, which of the two Religions he thought the beſt? <hi>The Protestant, Sir, undoubtedly, ſaid the Peer, by your own royal Confeſſion, ſince in Exchange for it, your Majesty has given me Popery and a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's Staff to Boot.</hi> Where Boot is given, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a tacit Confeſſion that the Exchange is unequal without it.

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004334_0009_10045B76D7D7AEF8"/>It is the Right and Duty of the Electors, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the Conduct, and to know the Opinions and Intentions of thoſe, who offer themſelves to their Choice. And (if they have ſerved before) the beſt Way to form a Judgment of their preſent Views and Deſigns, is to ſurvey their <hi>paſt Behaviour,</hi> when in Office. How can any of you be truly repreſented, when you know not the Sentiments of thoſe who repreſent you? It is ſtill your happy Lott, that you have frequent Means and Opportunities to reſent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually the Corruption of thoſe, who have baſely betray'd their <hi>ſacred Truſt,</hi> and ſlighted with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Scorn and Contempt, your prudent Inſtructions,</hi> given for the Preſervation of your Liberties; admit no ſuch Man to be ſo much as a Candidate again, nor indeed any Man to be a Candidate, until he has declared in the moſt explicit and ſolemn Manner, his moſt hearty Regard for your <hi>invaluable Liberties,</hi> and his fixt Reſolution to preſerve the ſame, and withſtand any Attempts to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is your Time, — which if you ſuffer <hi>to be loſt, may be forever loſt.</hi> Chooſe not therefore thoſe, who would bribe you, with getting you made diſtinct Pariſhes and Praecincts, or with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any other ſeparate Advantage for you, becauſe, you may depend upon it, the Purchaſe of this Favour for you, muſt coſt you very dear, for they muſt give a <hi>Quid</hi> for your <hi>Quo.</hi> And if, in order to get this Favour for you, and to eſtabliſh his Intereſt with you, your Repreſentative ſhould, by his Vote, (which is probable) gain a Compliance with an Inſtruction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically oppoſite to the Charter, or do any other Damage to the Publick; upon duly ſtating the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, you'l find yourſelves upon the Ballance great Loſers, having ſuffered more in the publick Loſs, than you have gained by your private Advantage.

Liberties of their Country, in order to gain a private Advantage, that being very inſecure under an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Chooſe not thoſe, who are in Confederacy with the Diſpoſers of civil and military Honours, by which Means, ſome have been able to carry almoſt <hi>all their Points</hi> in the Houſe, a few Years paſt. For you may depend upon it, they can't act as free Agents; and what the Conſequence of that in a few Years will be, you may judge from what has already happen'd to you. By this, you find Laws enacted without this eſſential Clauſe in them, viz. <hi>Any Law, Uſage, or Cuſtom to the contrary notwithſtanding</hi>; which is a repealing Clauſe: But this is left out, becauſe, the Governour has an Inſtruction to conſent to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing Act whatever; which is depriving you of one of your beſt Privileges, being nothing leſs, than taking from the General Aſſembly the whole legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power granted them by the royal Charter; for it ever will be a fundamental Maxim in <hi>Politicks,</hi> —That <hi>the ſame Power</hi> which can <hi>enact,</hi> can either <hi>alter</hi> or <hi>abrogate</hi>: —According to which, If our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly have no Power to <hi>repeal,</hi> they never had a Power to <hi>enact</hi>; from whence it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, That our whole Body of Laws are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null and void. This mean Compliance with Inſtructions, is the Root and Foundation of all your heavy Sufferings, and may yet produce worſe and more heavy; whereas an honeſt Non-compliance with an Inſtruction, which infringes upon your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, will be a conſiderable Security to them, by being never troubled with it again, unleſs now and then by Way of <hi>Scarecrow,</hi> as you have been with the Inſtruction for fixing the Salary.</p>
            <p>You are Freemen, and Men of Reaſon and Spirit; <hi>awaken</hi> your Spirit, <hi>exert</hi> your Reaſon, and <hi>aſſert</hi> your Freedom.

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004334_0011_10045B82F72E4820"/>Chooſe not the Gentlemen of the <hi>Militia</hi>; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it may be objected, That they are not ſo depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as the Gentlemen of the Army in <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they receive no Pay; yet remember their Duty, together with thoſe Darlings, their military Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power, depend upon obeying the Word of Command, as well as the Officers of the regular Troops. And it is well known, That Power and Honour have a greater Influence upon moſt Men than Money. Becauſe, Coveteouſneſs is a Vice, that even the Miſer himſelf would have the World believe he deſpiſes; whereas, Power and Honour are allowed to be admired by all. Your military Officers have conſiderable Power lodged in their Hands, more in ſome Reſpects, than is proper and convenient for your Intereſt, to entruſt many of them with. And this has been conſiderably augmented by the new Law paſſed by the laſt General Court, for raiſing the military Fines, threefold.</p>
            <p>Chooſe not thoſe Officers who depend upon Fees, becauſe, as you now have two Sorts of Money paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the Bills of the old Tenor, extant, are to be called in by the Year 1741, and no other Money is to be paſſing (unleſs the next General Aſſembly take Care of you) except that of the new Tenor: You may depend upon it, the Officers will endeavour that no new Regulation ſhall be made of their Fees to prevent your being oppreſſed, but that they ſhall remain upon the preſent Eſtabliſhment. So that a Place now worth in Fees 500 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> will then be worth more than 1500 <hi>l. per Annum. A very fine Advance upon your growing Poverty.</hi>

            <p>If a Motion ſhould be made and obtained, in the Courts of this Province, That all Bills of Coſt ſhould be taxed, to be paid in Bills of the new Tenor, it muſt conſiderably encreaſe your Law Charges, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you compute the Coſts of the many ſmall Actions brought before <hi>Justices,</hi> for Debts not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Forty Shillings, and for the unpardonable Crime

of not Training, for which terrible Fault, I knew a Man pay Thirteen Shillings new Tenor, the Juſtices Fees, which added to two Fines ſued for, made in the whole Twenty Three Shillings new Tenor, and ſo amounted to Three Pounds Nine Shillings, Bills of the old Tenor. By this you ſee what you are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to, unleſs you prevent this growing Oppreſſion by uſing proper Care in the enſuing Election of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. I am not inſenſible, That almoſt all the Officers, civil and military, will exert themſelves in the enſuing Election, in favour of themſelves and their Brethren; and will tell you, they are ſenſible how prejudicial the new Tenor Bills are, and that they carry a Sting in their Tail, but that, that ſhall be prevented by a new Regulation of Fees; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them not in this Affair, <hi>becauſe your All is at Stake</hi>; (altho' in their reſpective Offices, when they behave well, as many of them, to their Honour, do, treat them with all due Deference and Reſpect) but tell them plainly, you fear your good Nature and Credulity in ſending them and their Friends, your Repreſentatives, has brought all your Misfortunes upon you; and that therefore you think it high Time, for the ſakes of their Families, as well as your own, to alter your Elections, and to chooſe ſome of thoſe <hi>uncourtly People,</hi> who have always kept up that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preſervative of Liberty-<hi>Jealouſy</hi>; and that you have already ſuffered too much by <hi>gilded Pills,</hi> to take any more of them; and that you can have no Manner of Reliance upon this their Promiſe, leaſt a Law for regulating Fees, ſhould meet with the ſame Fate, which the Bill did, that, <hi>Anno</hi> 1734, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Houſe of Repreſentatives, for reſtraining the Clerk of the Naval Office, taking exorbitant Fees. Tell them further, That this Inſtance convinces you, That you are to hope for no Relief from ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for if a Law would not paſs to check the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of ſuch an <hi>obnoxious Officer,</hi> who obtained that very profitable Poſt in a diſagreable Manner,

It can't be reaſonably thought, that they, when they get into Power, will do more againſt themſelves, their Friends, and the Governour's Friends, than they did againſt a Man, whom they would have gladly curtailed in his Fees, but that they feared it would have been made uſe of as a Precedent, to have prevented their, &amp; their Friends intended Oppreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This glaring Inſtance muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtare them in the Face, and give them the Lie, when they pretend to ſay they are for any other new Regulation of Fees, than what ſhall be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Officers. No! <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Tell them <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt will not lie,</hi> and you are not to be deceived; and that upon this Maxim you will act in your enſuing Election. Tell them you are not quite ſo blind, as not to ſee, That as your Trade decays, the Number of Candidates for every Vacancy will daily encreaſe, which muſt give <hi>Prerogative</hi> a conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over <hi>Liberty.</hi> Tell them, all the additional Profit raiſed by this new Money muſt come from you, and ſo add double Weight in the Scale of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative (which is heavy enough already) againſt Liberty; and that this ought to make you conſider, what large Strides Prerogative will be daily making towards abſolute and deſpotick Power, when it is ſo conſiderably augmented, and the Supports of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo much enfeebled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It highly imports you to conſider what you are about, and whether you will bring Life or Death upon us. Oh!

But very quickly the Scene will be ſhifted, both you and we ſhall be in their's.</p>

            <p>Chooſe Men of good moral Characters, who have always in their Dealings in <hi>Meum et Tuum</hi> acted honeſtly; for it is a great Hazard, whether he who would cheat his Neighbour of <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> will not fell his Country for <hi>Judas</hi>'s Price.</p>

            <p>Chooſe ſuch as are moſt likely to relieve you from ſuch Burthens, under which we all ſadly groan, and under which we muſt certainly ſink, never to riſe again, if we are not relieved.</p>
