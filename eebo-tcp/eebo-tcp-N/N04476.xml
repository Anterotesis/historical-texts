            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>IT was neither Thirſt after Gain, nor the Deſire of Applauſe, but the Welfare of Mankind alone, which excited me to publiſh this Eſſay. I have therefore frankly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly laid before the World ſuch Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may, I hope, be of Service to my Fellow Creatures.</hi>

               <hi>I Have, however, always obſerved, that when a Treatiſe or Eſſay upon any of the liberal Aris and Sciences makes its firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it gives Employment to Cavillers.</hi> Horace, <hi>in the following Lines, diſtinguiſhes a Critic from a Caviller, and candidly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he is not offended with thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

               <hi>A Caviller, on the contrary, being on all Occaſions more attentive to what is wrong than what is right, is jealous and cautious in beſtowing Applauſe, but rather wants, by his ſhrewd Obſervations, to acquire a pretty Figure to himſelf. The Truth of it is, there can be no more a perfect Work in the World, than a perfect Man. To ſay therefore of any Performance, that there are Faults in it, is in Effect to ſay no more, than that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it is a Man.</hi>

            <head>AN ESSAY On the WEST-INDIA DRY-GRIPES.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>European</hi> Phyſicians give an Account of a Diſeaſe ſimilar to the <hi>Dry-Gripes,</hi> calling it <hi>Cholic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Pictonum,</hi> becauſe moſt frequent at <hi>Poic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</hi> They are both attended with exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive griping Pains in the Pit of the Stomach and Bowels, which are much diſtended with Wind; violent and frequent Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to vomit, ſometimes bringing up ſmall Quantities of bilious Matter; at other times there is a Senſation, as if the Bowels were drawn together by Ropes; great Coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and frequently a continual Inclination to go to Stool without voiding any Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:005553_0010_1018660E5EC15250"/>
The Ducts which open into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and excern a Mucus to moiſten and lubricate them, are obſtructed and glewed up with a Viſcoſity not eaſily reſolvable; and through the whole Courſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, the Faeces are extremely dry and hard, in ſmall Lumps like Bullets. The Inteſtines are drawn up towards the Back with almoſt continual convulſive Twitches. The Pains are frequently ſo ſharp, that the Patient will fall on the Floor, and cry out violently in the greateſt Agony.</p>
            <p>The Alcaline Acrimony impacted on the Stomach and Inteſtines, is ſo great in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſes, as to communicate its malign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the whole nervous Syſtem, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing violent Convulſions, which are very dangerous Symptoms; tho' I have known many recover after having a Number of them. But if the exceſſive Pain continues any conſiderable Time, the <hi>Periſtaltic</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inteſtines becomes inverted, and the <hi>Iliac Paſſion</hi> enſues.</p>
            <p>This ſore Malady uſually degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Palſy, and a Deprivation of all Sort of Motion in the Hands and Feet.—Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> conjectured, that the Tranſition of a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005553_0011_10186613477E0B88"/>
Cholic to a Palſy, was a Sign that the Morbific Matter was tranſmitted not by the Arteries, but the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and that its Seat was not in the Coats of the Inteſtines, but the nervous Plexus of the <hi>Meſentery;</hi> which is very ſenſible, and obnoxious to an Afflux of Humours of the nervous Kind. But this Remark of Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to the Hyſteric Cholic, which ſometimes counterfeits the Bilious; being accompanied with a Pain about the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biculum Cordis,</hi> the Region of the Stomach, and a little lower, which is followed with a Vomiting of Humours of a green or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Colour, and a great Sinking of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; after a Day or two the Pain goes off, but upon the ſlighteſt Commotion or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the Mind, it ſoon returns again. In this Caſe, neither Cathartics nor Clyſters have any Place, as they exaſperate the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; ſo that this Diſeaſe ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed rather from the Diſorder of the Spirits, than the Fault of the Humours. Phyſicians, therefore, ought above all things to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that they miſtake not the <hi>Diagnoſtic,</hi> by imagining that the Symptoms which attend Hyſteric Women, do ariſe from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005553_0012_101866150E9B5588"/>
ſuch Diſtempers as they frequently counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
            <p>The remote Cauſe is ſuppoſed to be an obſtructed Perſpiration, by being too much expoſed to a moiſt Night Air, and cold raw Winds; hard Drinking, eſpecially Drams or ſtrong Punch; and Want of a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, which renders the Chyle crude and viſcid; but the proximate Cauſe is an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Bile.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, the Opinion of ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and worthy modern Authors, that this Diſtemper is cauſed by taking large Quantities of Lime-juice; but I muſt beg Leave to differ from their Sentiments in this Caſe: For ſeeing the Humours which vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and fret the Coats of the Stomach and Inteſtines are intirely alcaline, Acids muſt be (and Experience confirms it) the moſt effectual Remedies. Thus the Negroes, in ſome Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eaſe their exceſſive Pains in the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Limes, or drinking the Juice. It has likewiſe been obſerved, that ſince the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>America</hi> have drank Punch with more Water (which moiſtens the Faeces, and dilutes the acrid Salts of the Bile) and made

of old Spirit (which has leſs of the hot fiery Particles than when new from the Still) yet with much more Lime-juice than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> is not near ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as before this Cuſtom prevailed.</p>
            <p>In all Kinds of Diſeaſes it is abſolutely neceſſary to know the Cauſe; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to attempt a Cure, is like a blind Man ſhooting at a Mark; the Remedies in one Caſe being directly oppoſite and deſtructive in another. Thus if a Fever, proceeding from a hot, inflammatory, alcaline Cauſe, be treated with a hot Regimen, and not with an acid cooling One, the Patient muſt inevitably periſh; but, on the contrary, if Acidity is the Cauſe (as it commonly is in Children) the alcaline Method is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. As therefore a Phyſician, not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regarding the Symptoms and the Cauſe of a Fever, may prove the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Patient; ſo in all Cholics the Symptoms and the Cauſe are to be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally regarded; and for want of a nice and exact Attendance thereto, a too general Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure very ſeldom meets with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in either Caſe.</p>

But before I enter upon the Cure of the <hi>Dry-Gripes,</hi> Humanity obliges me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Perſons who are moſt liable to it are generally lean, and much emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, by their exceſſive Perſpiration in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and conſequently the aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parts of the Blood being thus evaporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſaline Particles muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding acrid. The Method, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to prevent this Malady in ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> To abſtain, in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in Summer on the Continent, from Drams and ſtrong Punch; ſalted and high ſeaſoned Meats; immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Exerciſe, which raiſes Sweat; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Venery: To riſe early in a Mornings; to take Chocolate for Breakfaſt and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; make frequent uſe of Broths and boiled Meats, emollient and acid Herbs and Fruits; dilute plentifully with tepid, ſmall, and ſubacid Liquors; and when coſtive, to take a ſmall ſaponaceous Purge, ſo as to procure one Stool a Day.</p>
            <p>The following Method I have found, by many Years Experience, ſucceſsful in the <hi>Dry-Gripes,</hi> and were it more generally
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005553_0015_101866207046C7A8"/>
practiſed, I believe the Lives and Limbs of great Numbers might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>To mitigate the Violence of the Pains, and prevent Vomiting, I order,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Opii, Grana una vel duo, ſive Laudan. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid. Sydenham. Guttas triginta, quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta, vel quinquaginta, et repetend. pro re nata, in majori vel minori Doſi, donec Aeger ſe ſenſit in ſtatu tolerabili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Vomiting be ſo bad that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach can hardly retain any Thing, the following Powders ſcarce ever fail of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. Tartari Vitriolati, Grana decem; Olei Cinnamomi Guttam unam. M. F. Pulvis ſumendus in Hauſtu Theae Menthae omni (vel ſecunda quaque) Hora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vomiting being ſtopped, I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the following Preſcription, till three or four Stools are obtained:</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Cremoris Tartari Grana triginta; Olei Caryophyllorum Guttam unam. M. F.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005553_0016_10186622ADB9C7B0"/>
Pulvis ſumendus in Hauſtu T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>heae Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae (vel Decocti avenacei) omni Hora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an obſtinate Coſtiveneſs, and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Pain of the Bowels, are perpetual Symptoms in this Diſeaſe, Opiates are to be adminiſtered through its whole Courſe at proper Intervals. When, therefore, the Pain is very exceſſive, I give Opiates even at the ſame time with the purging Powders, that the Pain may be rendered tolerable, that a Relaxation of the Inteſtines may thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that their Periſtaltic Motion may become conſtant and regular, and be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interrupted nor perverted.</p>
            <p>Every Pain acts as a Stimulus, or rather, a Stimulus excites a Senſe of Pain: But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stimulus provokes the Fibres to Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, if violent, throws them into Spaſms. When, therefore, a Cholic Pain is very vehement, the Inteſtines are in ſome Places affected with Convulſions, and are as if bound hard with a Swathe; inſomuch, that unleſs the Pain is lulled aſleep, neither the Faeces nor Wind can be tranſmitted downwards: It is for this Reaſon, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violent Cholic Pain is almoſt always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005553_0017_10186626E5864ED8"/>
with a great Coſtiveneſs. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, very rational to add Anodynes to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in very vehement Cholics; nor is this any new Practice, ſeeing the moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Riverius, in Capite de Dolore Choli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> preſcribed <hi>Aloes Drachmam unam, Scammonei Grana ſex;</hi> to which he added two Grains of <hi>Opium,</hi> and in one of his Obſervations even five Grains.</p>
            <p>This Courſe, ſteadily purſued, gives ſometimes three or four Stools in Twenty-four Hours; but if no ſuch End is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it often happens (eſpecially if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is of long Standing) I order the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen to be cheriſhed with an emollient Fomentation, and that more particularly when the Belly is very tenſe and hard, or exceſſively contracted by a Spaſm: For the Fomentation penetrating the Integuments of the Abdomen, ſoftens and relaxes the too tenſe and rigid Fibres. I have often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the good Effects of the following Fomentation:</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Florum Chamaemeli Manipulos tres; Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis Althaeae, Seminum Lini et Faenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graeci, ana Uncias tres; Capitum Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005553_0018_1018662869BCC0E0"/>
albi Uncias quatuor. Cum Aquae et Lactis recentis, ana Q. S. Vaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coque clauſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am apt to believe, that far better Effects might be expected, if the Patient made uſe of a Semicupium prepared from the ſame Ingredients. Every One who has obſerved the very happy Effects of an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Bath in Nephritic Pains, will very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agree to what I ſay.—I have, indeed, frequently ſeen the moſt cruel Nephritic Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm ſuddenly vaniſh by the Uſe of a Bath only, when neither plentiful Bleeding, nor Opiates given freely, gave the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: Nay, I have learned, by many Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, that nothing conduces ſo much to eaſe the Pain, and ſend the Stone down the Ureters, as a warm and emollient Bath.</p>
            <p>I am likewiſe of Opinion, that it would very much conduce to a ſpeedy and perfect Cure, if the Patient, through the whole Courſe of the Diſtemper, made frequent uſe of oleaginous Mixtures, which would not only lubricate and relax the Inteſtines, but alſo, by ſheathing the lixivial Salts of the Bile, prevent their Points from acting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005553_0019_1018662B81AF4640"/>
with ſo much Force and Energy upon the Stomach and Inteſtines. For in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the Secretion of the acrid Salts of the Bile, in the Hepatic Glands, ſeems to be in an over Proportion to the oily Parts.</p>
            <p>Where there is no Vomiting, and the Pain not very acute, the Powders of <hi>Crem. Tartar</hi> may, after giving one Opiate, be uſed as directed, without any Delay. The Effects of which, after ſome Time, will be a ſenſible Perception of the Pain falling gradually downwards, from the Pit of the Stomach towards the Rectum. When, therefore, the Pain is ſettled in the lower Parts of the Abdomen, you may, in caſe the Patient is uneaſy for want of a Stool, preſcribe the following Purge.</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Cremoris Tartari Drachmam unam; Radicis Jalapii Grana ſex; Olei Cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophyllorum Guttam unam. M. f. Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis ſumendus in Hauſtu Decocti avenacei ſecunda (vel tertia) quaque Hora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this does not, in ſix or ſeven Hours, procure a Stool, I order an oleaginous and emollient Clyſter; which not only lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005553_0020_1018662ED295C448"/>
the Inteſtines, but alſo ſoftens the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated Faeces.</p>
            <p>When the hardened Excrements are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried downwards, the Patient begins to break Wind backwards, which is ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding offenſive. In the firſt three or four Stools, the Faeces are often very faetid, and abounding with a ropy viſcid Subſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling membranous Filaments.</p>
            <p>It is a neceſſary Caution not to be too haſty in gaining a Paſſage thro' the Body; for if larger Quantities of the ſame Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or others more ſtimulating, ſhould be given, you will be often foil'd in your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and make good a common Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The more Haſte, the worſe Speed:</hi> For ſharp ſtimulating Purges and Clyſters have very bad Effects on the Nerves in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and endanger a Deprivation of Motion in the Patient's Limbs.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Patient generally recovers upon procuring a free Paſſage through the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, by the prudent Uſe of the already mentioned Medicines; yet it is neceſſary to keep the Body ſtill temperately open for a Week, or more, by the laſt preſcribed Purge; to which may be added <hi>Calomel.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005553_0021_1018663083C126B0"/>
Grana ſex:</hi> For otherwiſe the Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very coſtive, and the exceſſive Pains return, by the acrid Humours perpetually flowing into the Inteſtines.—But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this the Pains ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which perhaps may be owing to a greater Degree of Viſcidity in the Fluids, I have known a Dram of the <hi>Tartar. Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil.</hi> taken every three Hours to perfect the Cure; and when that failed, the following has generally ſucceeded:</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Aquilae albae Grana ſex; Conſervae Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rubrarum Q. S. ut fiat Bolus omni Mane et Veſperi ſumendus donec Ptyaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus excitetur leniſſimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Calomel, by its Gravity, and the acid adhering to the metalline Part, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the Fluids, and forcing open the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and excretory Paſſages, anſwers the Intention in ſuch obſtinate Caſes.</p>
            <p>When Convulſions happen, ſtrong Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants are to be avoided; but Anodynes generally relieve, with the Method already deſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005553_0022_101866350B220190"/>
In this Diſtemper the poor Patient being deſirous of a Moment's Eaſe, even at any Rate, has too commonly a Recourſe to Drams, and other ſpirituous Liquors. But tho' a Moment's Eaſe may, by ſuch Means, be obtained, yet the Diſeaſe is more ſtrongly rivetted, the Pains return with double Force, and all the Symptoms are vaſtly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated.</p>
            <p>The proper Drinks in this Diſtemper are, Water-Gruel, Barley-Water, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as are of the demulcent Kind; which dilute, obtund and diſſolve, the acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salts of the Blood.</p>
            <p>Till the Stomach and Inteſtines have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered their proper Tone, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is very liable to a Relapſe, either by taking Cold, drinking too freely of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liquors, or not keeping ſtrictly to Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are light and eaſy of Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To ſtrengthen, therefore, the Stomach and Bowels after the Patient's Recovery, I order the following Medicines:</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Elixir proprietatis Guttas ſexaginta, ter de Die ſumendas in quovis Vehiculo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005553_0023_10186639B625C548"/>
Vel,</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Corticis Peruviani Uncias duas; Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Serpentariae Virginianae, Florum Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maemeli, ana ſeſquidrachmam; Radicis Gentianae, Corticis Aurantiorum, ana Drachmas tres; Radicis Rhei Drachmas duas. Infundantur cum Vini Maderenſis Libris quatuor. Capiat AEger Uncias duas ter de Die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vel,</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Saponis Veneti ſemiunciam, Extracti Gentianae, Chalybis cum Sulphure prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parati, ana Drachmas duas; Pulveris Radicis ſerpentariae Virginianae, Aloes, ana Drachmam unam; Syrupi Zinzibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Q. S. ut fiant Pilulae mediocres. Capiat tres omni Mane et Veſperi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To compleat the Cure, let the Patient, as ſoon as able, uſe conſtant and moderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe on Horſeback, than which there is not a better Thing to ſtrengthen the Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra and Inteſtines; for the Fibres of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery and Inteſtines having been with the long Pains much weakened and relaxed, are by this Means brought to recover their proper Tone, and reaſſume their former Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillations,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005553_0024_1018663BC79C8C20"/>
ſo as to ſhake off and expel the morbific Impurities: For riding on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, by the very frequent Jogging of the Body, gently ſhakes the whole Abdomen; and, therefore, by a continual Preſſure and Agitation, it throws off whatever adheres to the Inteſtines, overcomes any Lentor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the ſmall Veſſels, and very much promotes the Circulation of the Blood thro' the Meſenteric Veſſels, and little Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> where the circulating Fluids move the ſloweſt. Hence this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, by its almoſt continual jolting of the Body, diſſolves the Blood, concreted partly by the Force of the Diſeaſe, and partly by its ſluggiſh Motion in thoſe Parts; opens the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions formed in the <hi>Hepatic, Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, Meſenteric,</hi> and <hi>Inteſtinal Glands;</hi> and greatly contributes to the Action of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which is aſſiſting to that of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Laſtly, as it is evident, from many Experiments, that Perſpiration is very much increaſed by Riding, it is of vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage not only in this, but in almoſt every Chronical Diſeaſe, by driving the noxious Humours from the Center to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and expelling them through the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005553_0025_1018663EC5720EE8"/>
Ducts of the <hi>Milliary Glands.</hi> Riding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, has indeed reſtored many, on whom the moſt operoſe Medicines have not had the leaſt good Effect. Let then the Patient enjoy Health by Riding, and daily acquire Strength by this noble Exerciſe.—The Uſe of the Fleſh-Bruſh, and other Frictions, are likewiſe neceſſary, eſpecially about the Joints and Limbs, which will promote a briſker Circulation of the Fluids in thoſe Parts. In fine, every Thing is to be uſed which will increaſe the Elaſticity of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, attenuate the Fluids, and promote a good Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>If this Diſeaſe is complicated with any other, the Judgment of the Phyſician may then vary the Method, according to the different Circumſtances of the Caſe. Thus when the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> is only the Symptom of a ſpurious, intermitting Fever, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian</hi> Bark, prudently adminiſtered, is then the only proper Remedy: For the ſpurious Intermittents create a great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of direful Symptoms, their true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſticks being diſguiſed under the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome other Diſtemper; as enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vomitings, griping Looſeneſſes, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005553_0026_1018664370536DF0"/>
Morbus, Cholics, pricking Pains in the Side like a Pleuriſy, Ophthalmies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Pains on one Side of the Head, or Hemicranies univerſal or particular, Spaſms or Cramps, Nephritic Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo Pains like thoſe of Women in Labour.</p>
            <p>The Bark is certainly a moſt noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in many Caſes; and notwithſtanding ſome ingenious Gentlemen have pointed out a Way to anſwer all its Uſes by other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, endued (as they ſay) with as good, if not better, Properties; yet I believe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Practitioner, who has had a thorough Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of its Efficacy in many Diſeaſes, will readily acknowledge, that nothing has hitherto been diſcovered equal to it: And that late Diſcovery, in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> of its moſt admirable Effect in Mortifications, may be ſufficient to convince ſuch Sceptics, that their darling Hypotheſes not agreeing with Facts, are but Cobweb Schemes, calculated rather to amuſe, than to eſtabliſh a ſolid and laſting Practice.</p>
            <p>All Hypotheſes, unleſs they agree with Facts, are deluſive and vain; and I believe it will be readily granted, that had the Writers of this and former Ages confined
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005553_0027_10186646AD6DE200"/>
themſelves more to practical Obſervations, ſome Diſeaſes, now the <hi>Opprobria Medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> would have been better underſtood, and perhaps as eaſily cured as an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fever by the Bark judiciouſly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid is not to derogate from the Theory of Phyſick, which is founded on Facts and proper Obſervations; and by which every particular Diſtemper, with all its Symptoms and Accidents, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; becauſe it is impoſſible for any Man to judge from ſuch and ſuch Symptoms, what the Method of Cure ought to be in this or that Diſeaſe, unleſs he has an Idea of the Cauſes and Manner of their Production. A true Phyſician, therefore, goes always warily to Work, and proceeds upon a juſt and ſolid Foundation; for he firſt gets a Knowledge of the Seat and Cauſe of a Diſorder, and at theſe he levels his Preſcription. If the Caſe proves obſtinate, he augments the Force of his Medicines, and varies them as Circumſtances alter, without acknowledging an End to his Art, where the Diſeaſe is curable: For he has always ſome promiſing Remedy in Reſerve,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005553_0028_101866499C92AE98"/>
and can, from Rules of Analogy, directly attempt the Removal of Diſeaſes unſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A Perſon, on the contrary, who is ignorant of the <hi>Animal OEconomy,</hi> and the many other Requiſites in Phyſic, is puzzled and confounded at every Accident which turns up, and a new Caſe throws him quite out of his Biaſs; for having but few Remedies to truſt to, he directs them at all Adventures, without purſuing any form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſign, or without regarding the Seat, the Cauſe, or Stage of the Diſeaſe, and the Circumſtances of the Patient. If happily his Medicines ſucceed, it is well; but if they fail, he is at the Extent of his Cord, he has done his utmoſt, and your Caſe is deſperate: But thrice happy is the Patient, if he eſcapes without having either his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or Life deſtroyed, through the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender's Ignorance and Raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now after this Digreſſion give a few Caſes of Perſons who have been under my Care, to illuſtrate the foregoing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing the <hi>Dry-Gripes.</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for about a Week before I was called to his Aſſiſtance; but inſtead of relieving him, they had ſtrongly aggravated all the Symptoms. At my coming he had a rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain in his Stomach and Bowels, and ſuch frequent Strainings to vomit, as to caſt up every Thing he took. His Pains were ſometimes ſo exceeding ſharp, that two or three Perſons could ſcarcely keep him in Bed; and after every ſuch ſharp Fit, he could not ſee for near a Quarter of an Hour. As, therefore, Opiates could not be kept in his Stomach, I ordered him to take the already mentioned Powder of vitriolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tartar every Hour in Mint-Tea, which always ſuppreſſes the Vomiting, where A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodynes fail.</p>
            <p>After taking three Doſes his Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo well ſettled, as to take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Draught.</p>

This operating three of four times, brought away a large Quantity of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>To keep him tolerably eaſy the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes were repeated three of four times every Twenty-four Hours, tho' in ſmaller Doſes.</p>
            <p>To keep his Body temperately open, the laſt Powders were continued five or ſix Days. At length, by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> and the bitter Infuſion, he was perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p>CASE II.</p>
            <p>An old Man, near Seventy, was ſeized with this Diſtemper about a Month before I was ſent for: He had no Vomiting, and his Pains, tho' very ſharp, were not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute as uſual.</p>
            <p>I gave him, as ſoon as I came, <hi>Opii ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquigranum,</hi> and afterwards the Powders of Cream of Tartar. Next Morning I was ſent for very early, and found him in a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but as it went off, I repeated the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate, and continued the Uſe of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In the Evening of the following Day,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005553_0032_101866558D09A198"/>
the Pains being removed to the lower Parts of the Abdomen, I ordered a Clyſter, and by obſerving the Method mentioned in the laſt Caſe, he got well in a few Days.</p>
            <p>CASE III.</p>
            <p>A Man, about Twenty Years of Age, was attacked by the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> above three Weeks before I ſaw him, and had taken (as I was informed) during that Time, near Twenty Purges and Clyſters. The Pains were exceſſively ſharp in the Pit of the Stomach, as well as in the Inteſtines; and he was frequently ſo convulſed, that two or three Perſons could ſcarcely keep him down. He was once ſo diſtracted with the Violence of the Pain, that he was with Difficulty prevented from throwing himſelf out of the Chamber Window.</p>
            <p>I gave him <hi>Liquid. Laud. Syd. Guttas quinquaginta,</hi> which in a few Hours abated the Violence of his Pains. In ſhort, by purſuing the Method already laid down, he got the better of the Diſeaſe in about three Days Time. But his Stomach and Bowels were ſo very ſore afterwards, that he could
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005553_0033_1018665A54158290"/>
hardly ſuffer any Thing to touch them. This indeed I have commonly obſerved, where the Pains have been very violent.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to recite any more Caſes, theſe being ſufficient to give a perfect Idea of the <hi>Modus Medendi</hi> to Practitioners.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, to ſhew the pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of giving Quickſilver in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, relate the Caſe of a Perſon in one of the Hoſpitals in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man about forty Years old had the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> ſeveral Weeks, before he was taken into the Hoſpital. He had continual Reachings to vomit, and violent Pains in his Belly, which was prodigiouſly ſwelled and hard. The Phyſician attending the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal preſcribed very frequently Clyſters and Purges of <hi>Aq. Purgant. cum mana, et Sal. mirab. Glaub.</hi> and other Remedies. At laſt, when he found the Patient not in the leaſt relieved, but rather worſe, he ordered him to take Six Ounces of Quickſilver at a Time, which was repeated, till the Quantity amounted to 18 Ounces. This Method, however, was ſo far from recovering the Patient, that the Symptoms increaſing, he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005553_0034_1018665D505CEF30"/>
died after enduring the moſt racking Pains, for the ſpace of eight Weeks.</p>
            <p>Having open'd his Body, the next Day after his Death, I found the Inteſtines very much diſtended with Wind, but little or no Excrements. In his Stomach, which was very much contracted and ſhrivel'd up, I found fourteen Ounces of the Quickſilver he had taken eight Days before, mixt with about half a Pint of viſcid Matter.</p>
            <p>Hence we learn, how long Quickſilver may remain in the Stomach, eſpecially when the Fibres have loſt their proper Tone; ſince in this Caſe the contractile Power of of the Stomach muſt have been exerted with a prodigious Force, in order to have thrown ſuch a Weight from the Bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach over ſuch an Aſcent as the <hi>Pylorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſome Perſons have a great Opinion of the Uſe of crude Quickſilver in curing the <hi>Dry-Gripes,</hi> as well as many other Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I ſhall here, to ſhew how unphiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical ſuch Gentlemen are, give you Dr. <hi>Quincey'</hi>s Reaſoning upon the Article of Quickſilver:—<q>It is (ſays he) frequently talked of indeed, as good in ſome Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bowels; but there are very
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005553_0035_1018665F2D2AAEE0"/>
few Inſtances of its Uſe in ſuch Caſes. Nor can that at all appear reaſonable, which is commonly reported of its quick Paſſage through the Body; for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Favourers of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports make uſe of, are quite againſt them; that is, its prodigious Weight: For when it firſt comes into the Stomach, it cannot but fall to the Bottom; which is ſo much below the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> that a vaſt Force muſt be required to throw it over into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; and when it comes there, by their manifold Convolutions, it very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt aſcend, and particularly while it paſſes the Colon: So that it is hardly conceivable, how a Body of ſo great a Weight can be lifted over ſo many Aſcents, as it neceſſarily comes at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>OEſophagus</hi> and the <hi>Rectum.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If Dr. <hi>Quincey'</hi>s Reaſons are convincing, how much ſtronger muſt be the Objection againſt the Uſe of Quickſilver, in Caſes where the Stomach and Bowels are relaxed and weakened; the Fibres being then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly leſs capable of exerting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractile Force to raiſe any Weight; which is certainly the Caſe, when a Perſon has
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005553_0036_1018666269525E80"/>
laboured under ſuch a violent Diſtemper as the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> for a conſiderable Time.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen in <hi>England</hi> two Inſtances of the Succeſs attending the Method here laid down for the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> in the <hi>Cholica Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctonum,</hi> ariſing from the Fumes of White-lead; which gives me Reaſon to hope, that by a farther Trial of it in <hi>Europe,</hi> it would be found as beneficial in the latter Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as it is in the former.</p>
            <p>We frequently obſerve Perſons in the <hi>Dry-Gripes</hi> to loſe the Uſe of their Limbs (the Ancles and Wriſts becoming exceeding weak, and the Balls of their Thumbs ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) either by the Acrimony of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or the Uſe of ſtrong Stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; by which means the fine nervous Syſtem being wounded and debilitated, the Equilibrium between the Solids and Fluids is deſtroyed.—In ſuch a relaxed State of the Solids, the Blood muſt neceſſarily become viſcid; for the Fibres having loſt their ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic Force, the Circulation of the Fluids is diminiſhed, and conſequently they run into preternatural Coheſions. The giving, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a greater Degree of Fluidity to the Blood, and a proper Tenſity or Springineſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005553_0037_10186666635712C8"/>
to the Fibres, is abſolutely neceſſary, to make all the regular Secretions and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for otherwiſe ſome Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will want a ſuitable Supply of nutritious Juices, while others are overloaded with a viſcous Fluid.</p>
            <p>All Perſons of weak, relaxed Nerves, ſhould avoid a moiſt and foggy Air, which would neceſſarily render their Fibres ſtill more lax and flaccid<note n="*" place="bottom">The Effects produced in the human Body by a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or light Atmoſphere, and according as it is affected by Cold, Heat, Moiſture, or Dryneſs, were fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained in the Philoſophical Lectures exhibited by Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> laſt Summer; which, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, will be ſpeedily publiſhed.;</note> but let them reſide in a cold, clear Air, which will give a greater Degree of Tenſity and Elaſticity to the Solids. In ſuch Caſes, the Air of ſome Parts of <hi>North-America</hi> is far preferable to that of <hi>England,</hi> which is much moiſter, and more foggy than the former. On this Account it is, that Chronical Diſtempers are more frequent and obſtinate in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>North-America.</hi>—But when they are in a cold Climate, they ought not to tarry too long in the cold Air, for fear of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005553_0038_10186667E9656980"/>
chilling their Blood; and it would be of Service to ſuch Perſons to wear the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaiſter on their Ancles and Wriſts du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cold Weather:</p>
            <p>R. <hi>Emplaſtri Oxycrocei, Galbani, ana Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam unam; Opii, Camphorae, ana Drachmas duas. M. f. Emplaſtrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Opium and Camphor, by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of their Parts, are very penetrating and attenuating; and conſequently will be the Means of preventing a Lodgment of viſcid Juices on the Joynts; but the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to be renewed every Eighth or Tenth Day. The <hi>Linimentum Paralyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> which is well known in <hi>England,</hi> ought likewiſe to be well rubbed in, down the Back, and on the Limbs, twice a Day. It is a moſt excellent Compoſition, and and were its great Efficacy in theſe Caſes more generally known, it would be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly eſteemed, as a moſt noble Topic in a relaxed State of the Nerves.</p>
            <p>The Foods which they cat ſhould be nouriſhing, and eaſy of Digeſtion; for where the Fibres are weak, the Aliments
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005553_0039_1018666B4B6505D0"/>
ought to be ſuch as are eaſily converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Animal Juices, and will give the leaſt Reſiſtance to the Action of the Solids; <hi>Viz.</hi> New-laid Eggs, Jellies, Chickens, Lamb, Viper-Broth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſubacid Liquors are beſt, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, above all Things, let them take care to chew their Victuals thoroughly, with a ſufficient Quantity of light and well baked Bread; for, according to the <hi>Arabian</hi> Saying, <hi>He that does not take care to chew his Victuals thoroughly, hateth his own Soul.</hi> It is from the Neglect of this Duty, that frequently and Indigeſtion ariſes, which creates Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and a vicious Chyle; which is the Forerunner of the Deſtruction of the whole Animal OEconomy.—The Stomach may be called the Kitchen of the Body, whoſe office is to digeſt and convert the Aliments
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005553_0040_1018666E5D545CA0"/>
into a laudable Chyle; the more, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Food is attenuated and divided by Maſtication, ſo much the eaſier it is for the Stomach to perform its Office. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is, indeed, the greateſt Preſervative of Health; for it prevents all Superfluities, and neither overloading nor ſtraining the Veſſels, enables Nature to exert herſelf with the greateſt Force and Vigour. Cupping, Bleeding, Bliſtering, Purges, Clyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſeldom of Uſe, but to the Slothful and Intemperate; and are, for the moſt part, only Expedients to make Luxury conſiſtent with Health. The Bodies of ſuch Perſons as indulge themſelves in all Sorts of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without regarding either the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or Quality, become frequently full of crude and vicious Humours; which, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly increaſing, at laſt begin to putrify, and grow malignant. Upon violent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, therefore, or the ſlighteſt Exceſs of either Heat or Cold, Moiſture or Dryneſs in the Air, or any little Inconvenience ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the other Non-naturals, a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Inflammation often enſues, and vents itſelf in acute and mortal Diſeaſes: For no Perſuaſion can prevail with ſome Men to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005553_0041_10186672B2E5E070"/>
uſe purgative Evacuations to diſburden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Nature at proper Seaſons, or before the Diſeaſe begins to gather Strength; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering themſelves that all is well and ſafe within, as long as nothing appears outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or is felt by them to the contrary. He, therefore, that is deſirous of preſerving his Senſes and rational Faculties in the greateſt Perfection, and of being able to act with a ſprightly Vigour and lively Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt beware of ſpurring Nature on beyond her Craving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let ſuch Valetudinarians uſe the Fleſh-Bruſh, moderate Exerciſe, without raiſing Sweat, and frequent polite and chearful Company. Muſic may likewiſe be of great Service in ſuch Caſes; for every Stroke of a muſical Inſtrument cauſes an Undulation of the Air, which giving ſome Degree of Concuſſion to the Fibres of the Body, without overſtraining them, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a briſker Circulation of the Blood; and conſequently invigorates the Nerves, and leſſens the Viſcidity of the Fluids. The extraordinary and almoſt incredible Effects of Muſic in curing the Bite of the <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> the World is no Stranger to. If theſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005553_0042_10186674385BB818"/>
Advantages from Muſic were more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſidered, it might perhaps be applied to very noble Purpoſes, and not (as ſome imagine) to enervate the Mind; for as a diſtempered Body is often the Cauſe of a diſordered Mind, it may, by acting on the Solids, be the Means of regulating our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and bringing our Minds to a proper Degree of Calmneſs and Serenity. Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> who was without Doubt of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Diſpoſition, frequently ſoothed his troubled Mind, and raiſed his drooping Spirits, by the Force of <hi>David'</hi>s Muſic.</p>
            <p>I will now ſubjoin a few Forms of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which I generally make uſe of in a relaxed State of the Nerves, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Autumn, when we are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Diſeaſes ariſing from a debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Fibre; for in that Seaſon of the Year, our Bodies being relaxed by the Heat of the Day, are more liable to the Miſchiefs of the ſudden Coldneſs of the Evenings, Nights and Mornings. Beſides, <hi>Sanctorius</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that from the Autumnal Equinox, to the Winter-Solſtice, our Perſpiration is, one Day with another, about one Pound leſs; and this Diminution is ſtill ſo much
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005553_0043_10186677691C46D8"/>
the more, as our Veſſels have been more relaxed by the Summer's Heat; for they then cannot with Force enough propel the contained Fluids, which conſequently muſt every Day contract a greater Degree of Lentor and Viſcidity.—It is, therefore, no Wonder, that many unwary Perſons are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under Diſeaſes in Autumn, ſeeing their Humours are then more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acrid, as well as their Perſpiration very much diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, evident, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylactic</hi> Method in that Seaſon of the Year, is to ſtrengthen the Fibres, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a proper Fluidity in the Blood; that the ordinary Perſpiration may be kept up in a proper, conſtant, and uniform Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—The following Medicines anſwer ſuch an Intention in this Climate, and act as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terants;</hi> for every Thing which does not operate in the firſt, but fartheſt Paſſages, the Phyſicians commonly include under that general Appellation. I think, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that a few gentle and proper Purges ought firſt to be taken, in order to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the redundant acrid Bile, which kind

            <p>The Ingredients joined with the Bark in theſe Tinctures give an agreeable Warmth and Scent, which is very grateful to a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach weakened and palled by a Fever and Medicines. The ſaline and reſinous Parts of the Bark, being intimately united with the Liquor, are thus given with much greater Advantage, than can be by giving it in Subſtance: For when it is given in the fineſt Powders, which can poſſibly be obtained from the Mortar and Sieve, it is yet too coarſe for a weakened Conſtitution, and therefore frequently brings on a <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea</hi> by its Stimulus; but in Tincture or Decoction, it is too fine to give any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the firſt Paſſages, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſes, by the common Courſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, much farther, but gives a more uniform and general Contraction to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated and relaxed Fibres.</p>

               <head>AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE IN PHYSICK.</head>
               <p>THE following Account being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome very uncommon Circumſtances, I thought it would not be improper to make a full Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Particulars, of which I was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſeveral Perſons of Credit.</p>
               <p>The Wife of one <hi>B. S.</hi> who had been a healthy, lively Woman, and the Mother of two Children, was ſeized, in the Year 1738, with a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> and the uſual Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, <hi>viz.</hi> a frequent and copious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge by Urine, a gradual Waſting of the Body, a Hectic Fever, with a quick, low Pulſe, Thirſt, great Pains in her Shoulders, Back and Limbs, and Loſs of Appetite. She continued in this Manner two Years,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005553_0047_101866840BA47FD0"/>
notwithſtanding the Uſe of Medicines uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſcribed in ſuch Caſes, but much emaciated. She was then attacked with an <hi>Intermitting Fever,</hi> which ſoon left her; and after this the <hi>Diabetes</hi> gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; ſo that in a few Months ſhe was intirely free from that Diſorder; but the Pains in her Limbs ſtill continued. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her Appetite very well, breathed freely, and her <hi>Hectic Fever</hi> was very much leſſened, tho' ſhe ſometimes had Exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame. About the Beginning of Winter, 1740, ſhe had ſuch a Weakneſs and Pain in her Limbs, as to confine her to Bed altogether; and in a few Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Bones in her Legs and Arms felt ſomewhat ſoft to the Touch, and were ſo pliable, as to be bent into a Curve; nay, for ſeveral Months before her Death, they were as limber as a Rag, and would bend any way with leſs Difficulty than the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Parts of a healthy Perſon's Leg, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Interpoſition of the Bones.</p>
               <p>The 12th of <hi>April,</hi> 1742, ſhe died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then near the Age of Forty; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſent of her Friends, I had the Curioſity to examine the Body. Upon rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

the <hi>Cutis,</hi> I found the <hi>Membrana Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſa</hi> much thicker than I expected in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much emaciated; the <hi>Sternum</hi> and Ribs, with their Cartilages, very ſoft; and all the cartilaginous Productions of the <hi>Ribs</hi> on the Left-ſide doubled over one another, about an Inch long, in this Form Z, but flatter. Upon raiſing the <hi>Sternum,</hi> I found the <hi>Lungs</hi> adhering very cloſe to the <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> on each Side, but more looſe and flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and much leſs in Size than uſual. Her <hi>Heart</hi> was of the common Bigneſs, and upon viewing her <hi>Liver,</hi> I found it at leaſt a third Part bigger than ordinary. Her <hi>Spleen</hi> was about an Inch and a Half in the longeſt Part, and about a Quarter of an Inch thick, and the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> were very much inflated.</p>
               <p>She had Appearances of ſeveral <hi>Anchylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> formed in the ſmall Joynts, <hi>viz. carpal</hi> and <hi>Metacarpal</hi> Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had been without Motion for ſeveral Months; but upon laying them open, I found they were only like a thin Shell. The cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> of the Bones were intirely diſſolved, and no Part of the Heads remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but an Outſide, not thicker than an

Egg-ſhell. Upon making Inciſions in her Legs and Arms of five or ſix Inches long, I found the outer <hi>Laminae</hi> of the Bones ſoft, and perfectly membranous, about the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> and containing (inſtead of a boney Subſtance) a Fluid of the Conſiſtence of Honey when thick, and of a reddiſh Colour, but not at all diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Smell. There was, however, an Appearance of Bones near the Joynts of her Legs and Arms, tho' in part diſſolved; but what remained was very ſoft, and full of large Holes, like a Honey-comb. The Bones of the Head yielded eaſily to the Preſſure of my Finger. It may ſeem ſurpriſing, that thoſe Parts of the Bones, which are the moſt compact and hard, ſhould be diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while their Heads, which are more ſpongy and ſoft, had not altogether loſt their Subſtance.—She was, when in Health, five Foot high, as I was informed by her Huſband; but having meaſured her after Death, ſhe was no more than three Foot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Inches in Length, tho' all her Limbs were ſtretched out ſtrait.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether a corroſive, <hi>acid</hi> State of the Fluids, might not have been the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005553_0050_1018668D863C8EC0"/>
Cauſe of this uncommon Diſſolution of the Bones? For had it been an <hi>alcaline</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, I am of Opinion, thoſe Fluids, ſo long extravaſated, would have arrived to a great Degree of <hi>Putrefaction,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt have been extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Smell, as is uſual in other Caſes proceeding from ſuch a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing therefore a corroſive, <hi>acid</hi> State of the Fluids, to have been the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Cauſe; <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether an <hi>alcaline</hi> Regimen, timely purſued, would not have been the moſt likely Method to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this poor Woman's Caſe?</p>
