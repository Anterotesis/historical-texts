            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER admits the <hi>moral</hi> Perfections and univerſal Providence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily grant that the Majeſty of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Honor of his Laws, require that ſignal Treſpaſſes ſhould be ſignally corrected When theſe Treſpaſſes are of a private Nature, their full Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is often referred to another World; but when the Guilt is public and <hi>national,</hi> the Puniſhment of it muſt be <hi>national</hi> alſo. For it is only in this World that whole Nations can be puniſhed as ſuch, ſince in the World to come, all leſſer Societies or Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, that are entred into here, will be for ever diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Both Sacred and Profane Hiſtory bears Teſtimony to the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Judgments that have been poured down upon Guilty Nations. Some have kiſſed the Rod of the Almighty, and humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the <hi>Lord their Maker;</hi> and he has <hi>returned and repented, and left a Bleſſing behind him.</hi> But others have hardened their Faces, and refuſed all Correction; and have therefore been given up to entire Ruin and Deſolation. For there is a Time when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Almighty has had its full Work, and when the Meaſure of a People's Iniquity is compleat, ſo that nothing remains but a <hi>fearful looking for Judgment, and fiery Indignation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007606_0003_102BA7F3E0A75448"/>
It has been the Practice of the wiſeſt Nations of all Ages, to ſet apart particular Times to be kept holy for particular Purpoſes. And whoever allows SOCIAL WORSHIP to be a Duty, and the devoting one Day in Seven to adore the <hi>Lord our Maker, publickly and in the great Congregation,</hi> for the common Benefits which we daily receive, and to pray for Forgiveneſs of the common Treſpaſſes which we daily commit;—I ſay, whoever allows this to be a Duty, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe allow it to be an indiſpenſible Duty for a People to ſet apart and keep holy particular Times, either of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> or <hi>Humiliation,</hi> as often as they receive any particular Deliverance, or are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with any particular Puniſhment or Judgment. And as it is the Buſineſs of thoſe who watch over the Welfare of the State to point out and enjoin the Seaſons proper for ſuch Purpoſes; ſo it is the Duty of every Individual of the Community, to obſerve the ſame with all becoming Reverence and Solemnity.</p>
            <p>Of this Nature was the <hi>general</hi> FAST appointed to be kept holy by all his Majeſty's loving Subjects in this Province and three <hi>Lower Counties,</hi> on the 21ſt of <hi>May</hi> laſt, being the ſame Day on which a like Faſt was appointed in one of the Neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Certainly, if ever any People had a more immediate Call to humble themſelves before the LORD JEHOVAH, it was our Duty ſo to do, upon that ſolemn Occaſion; when our joint Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings were to be offered up at the <hi>Footſtool of Omnipotence,</hi> for a moſt remarkable Deliverance from wide-ſpreading Earthquakes, which had laid ſeveral Cities level with the Duſt; and when all that is dear and valuable to us, as <hi>Britons</hi> and as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> was to be the Subject of our united Prayers and Supplications. To be convinced of this we need only to read the GOVERNOR's excellent Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is delivered in a Stile ſo truly pathetic, affecting and ſolemn, that one would imagine it might have rouſed the moſt Hardened, and overcome the moſt Obſtinate. In the Preamble it ſets forth the Reaſons of the ſaid FAST, as follows;</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT it is often the Method of God's Providence, for the Glory of his Name, and the Maintenance of true Holineſs, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to viſit his People for their Sins, and in a more ſolemn
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007606_0004_102BA7F56E7923F8"/>
Manner to call them to Repentance by awakening Judgments from Heaven, which, if neglected or contemned, render ſuch a People ſtill more obnoxious to the divine Diſpleaſure:—That at this preſent Time, the Judgments of the Lord ſeem viſibly to be abroad upon the Earth, whoſe habitable Parts have been almoſt univerſally agitated with frequent and moſt dreadful <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> great Cities in divers Places being overturned to their Foundations, many Thouſands of their Inhabitants whelmed in the Ruins, and Wars, and Rumours of Wars, with Sin and Wickedneſs, nevertheleſs extenſively prevailing:—That our gracious Sovereign on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, touched with a deep Senſe of theſe Things, and a thorough Concern for the Glory of God, and the Proſperity of his Dominions, was pleaſed to appoint and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Day of public <hi>Faſting, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication,</hi> and to hallow that Day by his royal Example, riſing from the Throne like the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and humbling himſelf in the Duſt, together with his good Subjects, in one grand and ſolemn Act of Devotion before the <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi> moſt fervently imploring the adorable Majeſty of Heaven <hi>to avert juſt Judgments from us, to continue his Mercies towards us, to perpetuate the Enjoyment of the Proteſtant Religion, and to protect and bleſs our Fleets and Armies:</hi>—That the Imitation of ſuch an illuſtrious Pattern of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> was not only our indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty, on ſo awful and intereſting an Occaſion; as we are Subjects to the beſt of Kings, and equally concern'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his faithful Subjects in the general Safety and Proſperity of his Dominions, but eſpecially as the Province which we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is at this Time particularly viſited with the murdering Sword of a ſavage Enemy, a conſiderable Part of it being already laid waſte by their bloody Ravages; great Numbers of our unhappy Fellow-Subjects cruelly murdered, or carried into barbarous Captivity, and the enſuing Summer opening a Proſpect that ſeems big with the Fate of theſe Colonies, and more nearly intereſting their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Safety than any Period which they have ever yet beheld.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were the Ends propoſed by this FAST leſs affecting than the awful Occaſion of it. For the Proclamation goes on to declare
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007606_0005_102BA7F7DC89F820"/>
that it was deſigned for a Day <q>Of general <hi>Humiliation</hi> before the Lord our God, that we might with one Heart and Voice, in the moſt ſolemn and devout Manner, ſend up our united Prayers and Supplications to the Throne of Grace and Mercy, through the unſpeakable Merits and Interceſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for the Forgiveneſs both of our private and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Sins; for averting the Puniſhments juſtly due to them; for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Amendment of Manners; for Harmony and public Spirit in all our Tranſactions; for a Bleſſing upon his Majeſty's Arms employed in the Defence of our juſt Rights both by Sea and Land; for Conſolation and Redreſs to our ſuffering Brethren and Neighbours; for a ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from our cruel and blood-thirſty Enemies; and for continuing among us, and ſpreading abroad to the remoteſt Parts of this dark Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the ineſtimable Bleſſings of</hi> Britiſh <hi>Liberty, and the pure Light of the Proteſtant Religion, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus, equally reformed from vain Superſtition and giddy Enthuſiaſm.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the great Ends of this Faſt; and certainly none were ever more becoming a Government to enjoin, or a People to comply with. For there is ſcarce a ſingle Thing worthy of our Care in this Life, <hi>as a Society of dependent Creatures,</hi> which is not comprized under ſome one of the foregoing Heads.—And, On! what a glorious Proſpect it would have been, to have beheld two or three Provinces, without one diſſenting Voice, humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before a <hi>Heart-ſearching God</hi> for ſuch important Purpoſes, and throwing themſelves at the <hi>precious</hi> REDEEMER'S <hi>Feet</hi> for Mercy and Favor. One may ſafely affirm, that there is not, among <hi>all the Works of the Almighty,</hi> a Proſpect that would have been more pleaſing to him than ſuch an Appearance of his repenting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Creatures But alas! the Harmony of the fineſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be interrupted and marred by one peeviſh and jarring String! In order to have given ſuch an Appearance its full Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Luſtre, it ought to have been univerſal, and without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for as every Member of the Community has added to the general Guilt, ſo every Member ought likewiſe to have joined in the general Humiliation. And for any Sett of Men to oppoſe their ſtubborn Wills to the Senſe of a Community, and to do all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007606_0006_102BA7FACC240070"/>
in their Power to prevent that general-Bleſſing which the <hi>Lord</hi> has promiſed to ſuch a general Act of Devotion, thereby involving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the fatal Effects of their Obſtinacy;—I ſay, for any Sett of Men to act thus, is a Degree of Baſeneſs for which I have no Name. Good Men have Reaſon to think it their Misfortune to be connected in the ſame Society with ſuch perverſe Perſons, and heartily to mourn becauſe they are conſtrained to <hi>ſojourn in Meſech, and to dwell in the Tents of Kedar!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the Perverſeneſs of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> on the late <hi>ſolemn Faſt.</hi> And Notwithſtanding all the aforeſaid Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the expreſs Order of the Government,—<q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the ſaid Faſt to be religiouſly kept by all his Majeſty's loving Subjects within this Province and Counties, of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Denomination, as they tendered their own temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare, and would not be deemed wanting in the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Duties</hi> of GRATITUDE to their <hi>adorable Maker,</hi> AFFECTION for their <hi>gracious Sovereign,</hi> COMPASSION for their ſuffering Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and <hi>Regard</hi> for their own IMMEDIATE SAFETY;</q> yet moſt of them in this City, as well as in the Country, refuſed to pay the leaſt Regard to the Day, but were rather more buſy than uſual in purſuing their temporal Callings, and graſping at the vile Droſs of this World!</p>
            <p>Early on the Morning of the ſaid Day, the MAYOR of this City being informed, that many of the ſaid <hi>Quakers,</hi> neither reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Decency to their Neighbours, nor moved by the calamitous Situation of their Country, were obſtinately employed in ſervile Labor, ſent the following Warrant directed to the Conſtables of the City, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>In Conſequence of this Warrant the Conſtables returned the Names of 61 Heads of Families, all <hi>Quakers</hi> in this City who were found employed in Oppoſition to this Order of Government. Their Power and Numbers will no Doubt ſcreen them from the Puniſhment which might juſtly be inflicted upon ſuch Obſtinacy and Contempt. But they ſhall not eſcape that Cenſure which the <hi>PRESS,</hi> and EVERY GOOD MAN ought to pronounce againſt them. It was once intended to add the Names of the Offenders in this Place, that the Innocent might not ſuffer with the Guilty; for it is but Juſtice to confeſs, that ſome of the moſt rational and ſenſible <hi>Quakers</hi> of this City were not among the Number, and who, if they did not go to any Place of Worſhip, yet thought it their Duty not to give any Offence to their Fellow-Citizens, and kept their Houſes ſhut up accordingly. But theſe were only a few in Compariſon to the Number of Offenders. Nevertheleſs, as they are ſufficiently known, I ſhall ſpare filling up my Paper with their Names; and ſhall only obſerve, that among the reſt were three Members of the preſent Aſſembly reſiding in this City, who were the Foremoſt to follow their worldly Callings, and to refuſe joining in public Prayers to <hi>Almighty God</hi> for the Preſervation of that HOLY PROTESTANT RELIGION AND CIVIL LIBERTY, whereof they are the <hi>pretended</hi> CONSERVATORS.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not paſs that Cenſure on theſe People which they deſerve. I conſign them over to the Public, and to the Cenſure contained in

the following <hi>Monitor,</hi> publiſhed againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for not obſerving the late Faſt appointed by his Majeſty in that Place. As it comes from a Writer of the higheſt Reputation, and moſt approved Abilities, it will be far ſuperior to any Thing I could ſay on the Subject; and therefore I ſhall conclude my Part of this Publication with a few <hi>Queries</hi> to <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether they believe in the abſolute Perfections and wiſe Providence of the ſupreme God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether they believe He makes no Diſtinction between Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice, Obedience and Diſobedience to his holy Laws?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether every Member of this Community, <hi>Quakers</hi> as well as others, have not <hi>ſinned,</hi> and in many Caſes come ſhort of the Duty which they owe to ſuch an <hi>adorable Being?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether when the Offence is <hi>publick and national,</hi> our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Humiliation ought not to be <hi>public and national alſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Whether, when a particular Seaſon is appointed for ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and a great Majority come chearfully and readily to humble themſelves at their <hi>Maker's Feet,</hi> a few have any Right to oppoſe themſelves to the Senſe of ſaid Majority, to diſturb them in ſuch a ſolemn and neceſſary Act of Devotion, and thereby to prevent, as far as they can, the obtaining of thoſe public Bleſſings, which the Lord has graciouſly promiſed to public Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether Perſons who act thus are not to be conſidered as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to their Country, and to thoſe invaluable Enjoyments which we are called, to <hi>pray</hi> for the Preſervation of, upon ſuch ſolemn Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> were not more immediately concerned than others to pray for the Relief of our bleeding and ſuffering Country, from that Diſtreſs and Confuſion, wherein their particular Obſtinacy and abſurd Principles of Government have involved us?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whether Men who thus deſpiſe every Ordinance of the <hi>Powers that be,</hi> and ſeem unconcerned at the Sufferings of their Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, as well as the Viſitations of their ALMIGHTY CREATOR, are fit to receive any civil Truſt, either as Magiſtrates, or as our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and Guardians of that <hi>Liberty</hi> and holy Religion which they refuſe to join in imploring the <hi>Supreme Being</hi> for the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of?</p>

9. Whether they have not incurred the higheſt Diſgrace by their late Adminiſtration of this Province?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whether their Conduct has not been ſo obnoxious to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, that they were lately deemed by his Majeſty and his Miniſters to have forfeited all Right to civil Offices, as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles diametrically oppoſite to the Nature of an <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> and to the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> of his Majeſty's <hi>Crown?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in Order to prevent the extending of a Teſt <hi>for the total Excluſion of their Friends here from all Places of public Truſt,</hi> have not engaged as it were <hi>Body for Body, that their ſaid Friends the Quakers of this Province will for the future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline meddling in public Matters, and behave more</hi> dutifully <hi>to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> that his juſt Rights may be recovered, and Peace and Happineſs ſecured for his good Subjects in theſe Colonies?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether the obſtinate Refuſal of the <hi>Quakers here</hi> to keep the <hi>late Faſt,</hi> was conſiſtent with this Duty to their Sovereign, and the Promiſe ſo lately made for them by their Friends in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Whether giving out in Mr. <hi>Bradford's</hi> Journal, No. 703. that only a Majority of <hi>Quakers</hi> have engaged to reſign for a little Time, and that they are to <hi>reſume</hi> their Seats when the preſent Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are over, is not a plain Proof that they intend to evade the Promiſe made for them, and to continue in their Obſtinacy till they incur a ſeverer Cenſure?</p>
            <p n="14">14. Whether it is not the higheſt Inſolence in them to talk of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering other Denominations to come into the Aſſembly to extricate the Province from the Diſtreſs into which <hi>Quakers</hi> have involved it, and that when the Storm is over, the ſaid <hi>Quakers</hi> will reſume the Helm, and ſend thoſe others about their Buſineſs?</p>

               <hi>The</hi> MONITOR, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> February 14. 1756. <hi>To the</hi> MONITOR.</head>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE ſubject of the following paper, tho' I cannot rank it entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the political, is of ſo intereſting a nature, in regard to the welfare of the ſtate, that I doubt not of your acceptance and readineſs to communicate the ſame to whom it may concern.</p>
            <p>THE awful end intereſting occaſion of the late general faſt, which our gracious ſovereign commanded to be obſerved RELIGIOUSLY by ALL his loving ſubjects, was enforced under theſe moſt ſolemn and awakening conditions: <hi>As they tender'd the favour of Almighty</hi> GOD, <hi>and upon pain of ſuffering</hi> temporal <hi>puniſhment,</hi> ſhould they be found ſo irreligious and refractory as to <hi>contemn</hi> or <hi>neglect the performance of ſo religious and neceſſary a duty.</hi> A faſt, as his majeſty expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not only to adore the Almighty for being <hi>our defence in time of danger,</hi> and for having <hi>protected and preſerved us from imminent deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of EARTHQUAKES; but alſo to implore the divine bleſſing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the preſent ſituation of PUBLIC AFFAIRS; whoſe <hi>iſſue</hi> is of <hi>the higheſt importance to the peace and ſafety of theſe kingdoms, to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and liberties,</hi> and, above all, to the moſt valuable bleſſing of the <hi>Proteſtant religion:</hi> I ſay this awful and intereſting occaſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced in ſo pathetic and powerful a manner from the throne, perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me that the <hi>faſt</hi> of <hi>Nineveh</hi> would be renewed in the <hi>Britiſh Capital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was great ſatisfaction to every religious heart, and no leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thoſe, who pay a juſt regard to the powers in being, and ſincerely deſire the bleſſings of peace and of the Proteſtant religion, to ſee this Faſt obſerved with that ſolemn and Chriſtian deprotment in all our churches; as the cauſe thereof required. Where majeſty appeared arrayed with the brighteſt luſtre before the King of Kings: and both houſes of parliament never ſhone more illuſtrious, than, at thus ſolemnity, before the altar. No age, nor condition; no party, nor Religion pretended to be exempt from this univerſal obligation.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007606_0011_102BA80572D12F90"/>
The <hi>Papiſts, Diſſenters</hi> of all Denominations, the <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> and even the <hi>Jews</hi> ſolemnized the day with acts of humiliation and works of <hi>mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The courts of judicature were ſilent: no cauſe was that day plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the national Protection before the Lord. The public offices, the cuſtoms, the exciſe, the exchange, and the very exchequer were not open: the merchants, the manufacturers, the tradeſmen and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers; nay the very common ſoldiers were impreſſed with ſuch a ſenſe of their <hi>Chriſtian calling</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>royal authority,</hi> commanding them <hi>to ceaſe from all worldly employments, and to exerciſe their Chriſtian pofeſſion by faſting and prayer,</hi> that not only <hi>the markets were adjourned, the ſhops, nay the very ſtews and brothels were ſhut up; but in this moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous city, I am told, there was no appearance of any worldly traffic, except amongſt a ſett of people, diſtinguiſhed by the name of</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>If this be true, <hi>Mr. Monitor!</hi> what idea muſt <hi>foreign nations</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a ſtate that <hi>tolerates</hi> a people, who run <hi>counter</hi> to the greateſt examples; and <hi>diſobey</hi> the <hi>authority,</hi> by which they are <hi>protected?</hi> what <hi>jealouſies</hi> does it create in our minds to be <hi>connected</hi> with a people that will neither <hi>obey their God,</hi> nor <hi>their king!</hi> had the <hi>Jews</hi> opened their ſhops, and <hi>frequented</hi> their daily <hi>labor,</hi> would it not have been <hi>interpreted</hi> a <hi>contempt of a Chriſtian ordinance?</hi> had the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Nonjurors</hi> made it <hi>a day of pleaſure and entertainment,</hi> would not they have been deſervedly branded with <hi>diſaffection?</hi> had the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> neglected this neceſſary duty, under a <hi>vain pretence</hi> of a <hi>more perfect way</hi> to appeaſe the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> and to <hi>intercede for his protection and aid;</hi> would they not have <hi>incurred the cenſure of all well wiſhers to our happy eſtabliſhment both in church and ſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT then can be urged in defence of theſe Quakers, who in contempt of his majeſty's proclamation; in oppoſition to the univerſal abſtinance from lucrative and worldly employs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved at the imminent deſtruction from which the Almighty has preſerved us, and which our enemies are contriving to bring upon this nation, were the only ſubjects that appeared inſenſible of the public danger, or not deſirous of the public good?</p>
            <p>IT is unſcriptural to ſuppoſe any one can ſerve both God and Mammon. And can they be ſaid to ſerve the Lord in faſting, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007606_0012_102BA806F6941390"/>
weeping and praying, who at the time of public calamities, and general mourning, are taken up in their daily practices of acquiring the riches of this world only? and it is very near boarding upon rebellion, not to comply with ſuch regulations of a government, as are calculated for God's glory and the public ſafety.</p>
            <p>There can be no great expectation of loyalty and religion from a people, who are deaf to the voice of their ſovereign; and prefer the advantages of this world, and their peculiar humour or inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the intereſt we ought to ſeek in God by faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and to the example of the great, the learned, and the devout.</p>
            <p>What could an earthly prince ſay more to engage all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to accompany him to the footſtool of the Almighty, than to declare that the reaſon of his proclaiming a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>public</hi> faſt, was, that both he and his people, might <hi>humble themſelves before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and in a moſt devout and ſolemn manner, ſend up</hi> their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications to the divine Majeſty, to avert juſt judgments, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his mercies, to perpetuate the enjoyment of the Proteſtant religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and ſafety and proſperity to theſe kingdoms and dominions; and to implore his protection and bleſſing upon our fleets and armies.</hi> Was there any token of humiliation amongſt the <hi>Quakers?</hi> where was their devotion? in what manner did they keep the faſt? inſtead of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications to the Divine Majeſty, they were labouring <hi>for the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Neither decency towards their neighbours, nor regard for their king; nor yet the terrors of the Lord, which are abroad upon the earth, could work upon their ſtubborn, unruly, and hardened hearts. Their ſhop was their Temple! and their gain was their God!</p>
            <p>Is it not a ſhocking circumſtance to be connected with a people that are neither to be moved by judgments, nor engaged by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to perform acts of devotion, and to pray for the welfare of the ſociety, whereunto they belong? can there be any credit given to their future profeſſions in favour of the Proteſtant religion, who refuſed on this ſolemn occaſion to pray for its perpetuity among us? does not ſuch a behaviour countenance the ſuſpicion that <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is continued by the ſame jeſuitical policy, with which it was firſt broached in this iſland? and that it has not cleared itſelf of the blaſphemy for which <hi>George Fox,</hi> their patriarch was puniſhed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007606_0013_102BA80A6B3A92F8"/>
Is not there reaſon to ſuſpect the loyalty, as well as religion, of a people, who would not in a <hi>devout and ſolemn manner,</hi> humble themſelves and ſend up their prayers and ſupplications by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and example of their king, to the Divine Majeſty, for the ſafety and proſperity of his kingdoms and dominions? and does not any evaſion or equivocation to excuſe their contempt, or neglect of ſo <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> a duty, as at this time, to implore the Almighty's <hi>protection and bleſſing upon our fleets and armies,</hi> call aloud upon the government to examine into thoſe principles, upon which they pretend to maintain ſuch abſurd and dangerous doctrines, and what, in other ſubjects, would be juſtly ſuſpected of diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ripeneſs to join in the firſt act of rebellion? not to pray <hi>for our fleets and armies</hi> is the next ſtep to <hi>refuſing</hi> the neceſſary taxes to maintain them; which, according to our information from <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> is already the caſe, where theſe <hi>Quakers think they can act with impunity:</hi> and there is no ſtep between ſuch a <hi>refuſal,</hi> and the <hi>betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of their country to the firſt invader.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe are the people who have been in many inſtances diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the royal favour! and in many particulars permitted by the legiſlature to enjoy privileges denied to their <hi>fellow-ſubjects:</hi> whoſe conſcience will not permit them to take an oath! and whoſe plea is for the <hi>ſpirit of Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>for the light within!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only beg leave to ask whether you think a people who have a Right to ſeek for the protection of their Property and lives, are not obliged to ſubmit to the <hi>ordinances</hi> of <hi>that power</hi> by <hi>whom they are protected,</hi> when thoſe <hi>ordinances</hi> do not claſh with <hi>the commandments of God,</hi> nor with the <hi>liberties of the ſubject?</hi> whether the meaſure <hi>of a ſubject's obedience</hi> is not to be <hi>confined</hi> within the limits of the law? whether it is not more criminal in <hi>foro conſcientiae</hi> to <hi>forfeit</hi> our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance by an <hi>obſtinate refractorineſs</hi> to the command <hi>of a ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi> than to take an Oath in a judicial way <hi>for the confirmation of a truth?</hi> whether the ſpirit of Chriſtianity is more viſible <hi>in wearing a broad-brim'd hat, a plain coat, or a green apron;</hi> than in the outward forms of humiliation, and other poſitive inſtitutions in the Chriſtian church? or whether that <hi>light within,</hi> the <hi>plus ultra</hi> of all enthuſiaſts, who have ſo many innovations to patronize under that preſumption, is not a <hi>perverſe</hi> ambitious <hi>paſſion,</hi> which delights in ſingularity, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007606_0014_102BA80CF353B1B8"/>
ſacrifices every conſideration both human and divine to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning obſtinacy?</p>
            <p>But what can be expected from a people, who, under the plea of being guided by the ſpirit, reject the two ſacraments of Chriſt's own inſtitution; and who are, as far as they do ſo, <hi>unworthy the Name of Chriſtians?</hi> who ſcreening their unjuſtifiable proceedings under the ſacred name of conſcience and toleration, <hi>make uſe of liberty as a cloak to cover their impiety and diſobedience.</hi> For no one can plead the act of toleration for doctrines, tenets and deeds which tend to the overthrow of religion and the authority of that government, under which he lives. And I can harbour but a very contemptible opinion of them, whoſe chief pride lies in <hi>an obſtinate perſeverance in their own inventions, and in oppoſition to all other inſtitutions both eccleſiaſtic and civil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is very diſtant from the real ſpirit of Chriſt and of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; which is <hi>to give Ceſar his due, to obey thoſe that are in authority, to ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, to mourn with them that mourn, to faſt and pray leſt we enter into temptation,</hi> and not to confine the <hi>light</hi> as in a dark lanthorn, but to <hi>let it ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the place of a <hi>Monitor</hi> to puniſh; but to exert all his faculties with a view to deter evil-doers from proceeding in their wickedneſs, and to reclaim thoſe, whoſe hearts are not already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a reprobate ſenſe. Therefore, as in the midſt of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the Chriſtian ſpirit to ſhew mercy, where there appears any token of repentance and amendment; I do not perſuade you to ſound the trumpet of perſecution; a term which theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> have made uſe of with great ſucceſs to extort extraordinary privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from the clemency of the ſtate: but, as a friend to ſociety, and an enemy to no perſon, I believe that it can be no breach of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity, nor any force upon a Chriſtian conſcience, to call them to a remembrance of their duty to <hi>fear God,</hi> and to <hi>honour the King;</hi> and to ask them, how they can reconcile their contempt or neglect of the religious obſervance of the late faſt, with that authority; which in the moſt ſolemn manner, for their preſent and eternal welfare, called upon them, and enjoined it, as they tender the favour of Almighty God; and upon pain of ſuffering the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as they deſerve, who reſiſt or contemn the powers, <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:007606_0015_102BA80F303CA5E8"/>
               <hi>of God for the puniſhment of evil doers?</hi> HAD the occaſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged been confined only to the mournful object of <hi>earthquakes,</hi> which have wrought ſo great deſtruction abroad, and viſited ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Britiſh dominions, humanity, the bowels of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian compaſſion, and a true ſenſe of God's mercy, which has ſo wonderfully protected and preſerved us from imminent deſtruction, ſhould have produced ſome religious acts towards our Maker; but when the precarious ſituation of our public national affairs; when our peace, ſafety, commerce, liberties, and the very light of the goſpel where alſo made a neceſſary part of the duty, <hi>What ſhame muſt they take to themſelves, who contemn'd or neglected ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and important an act of religion!</hi>—Is not this a ſpecimen of that ſpirit, which has ſo lately reduced <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to the <hi>brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> expoſed the country to the common enemy, and deſerted their <hi>Proteſtant neighbours</hi> to be cruelly butcher'd by the knives of ſavage <hi>Indians?</hi> ALL then that I would have propoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this evil ſpirit, is, that they ſhall either confeſs their abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their late diſobedience and contempt of the royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and promiſe their future ſtrict comformity to ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the ſtate, from which they are not excuſed by the law; or that his majeſty will be pleaſed to <hi>maintain the honour and dignity of his crown,</hi> the <hi>force of his laws,</hi> and the <hi>dignity of the Chriſtian name among proteſtants,</hi> by inflicting ſuch puniſhment, as he may juſtly do, upon all ſuch as have contemned or neglected the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the late religious and neceſſary duty of faſting. For it is in vain to ſhelter a <hi>contempt of the laws,</hi> under the <hi>act of tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> An act deſigned to <hi>prevent perſecution for religion,</hi> in ſuch caſes as the ſtate acknowledg'd to be indifferent: but not to countenance every <hi>irreligious, factious, and rebellious doctrine,</hi> which the <hi>enthuſiaſts, uncriſtian</hi> and <hi>republican</hi> teachers, might invent and introduce from time to time.</p>
            <p>So far I can venture to affirm, <hi>that theſe worldly-minded people can find no plea for there obſtinancy, and diſobedience,</hi> in ſcripture; and that there don't want examples to ſhew the confuſion and damage, which have enſued to the ſtate, by yielding to, or conniving at thoſe, who <hi>plead conſcience for rebellion,</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> all authority, that <hi>interferes</hi> with their <hi>unruly</hi> paſſions.</p>
