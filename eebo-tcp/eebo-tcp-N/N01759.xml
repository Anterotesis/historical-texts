            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002083_0004_0FBB8A79F98E2568"/>and it's mention'd as a fruit of <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Lazineſs.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Go to the Ant thou Sluggard; conſider her ways and be wiſe.</hi> The <hi>Ants</hi> uſe <hi>diligence,</hi> and obſerve the <hi>proper time and ſeaſon</hi> to provide their <hi>food;</hi> herein their example is worthy to be imitated by men. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep, O Sluggard?</hi> This is a ſharp reproof to the <hi>Lazy</hi> and <hi>Slothful,</hi> who indulge <hi>Sleeping,</hi> when they ſhould be <hi>Working.</hi> Such <hi>lazy</hi> perſons are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſay, as <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep.</hi> No, thinks the <hi>Lazy Drone,</hi> I won't riſe yet, I'll lie till the Clock ſtrikes once more; I'll lie a while and take t'other Nap. Thus he indulges himſelf in ſloth, in needleſs ſleep and 'drowzineſs; when he ſhould be working for a Livelihood. And what's the fruit and iſſue of ſuch a <hi>lazy Courſe?</hi> Why, <hi>Pinching Poverty,</hi> as our Text declares: <hi>So ſhall thy poverty come, as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</hi> Such a <hi>lazy courſe</hi> tends as directly to bring <hi>pinching poverty,</hi> as a <hi>ſteady pace</hi> tends to bring a <hi>Traveller</hi> to his <hi>Journeys end.</hi> Yea, to the <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>ſlothful,</hi> pinching <hi>diſtreſſing want</hi>

The <hi>ſame words</hi> in our Text, and the preceeding verſe, <hi>viz. a little ſleep, a little ſtumber,</hi> &amp;c. are repeated, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.33, 34.

               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>There are Sinful Courſes, which directly tend to bring perſons to miſerable, pinching poverty.</q>
               <p>There are <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Poverty.</hi> Some are <hi>poor negatively,</hi> that is, they are not rich, have not ſuch <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>abundance,</hi> as ſome of their Neighbours have. Yet poſſibly by God's Bleſſing on their prudent diligent Labours, they want neither <hi>Food</hi> nor <hi>Raiment</hi> convenient for them.</p>
               <p>Again, Others are <hi>very poor,</hi> are not able to provide themſelves a <hi>comfortable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002083_0006_0FBB8A7DC5EEFF48"/>Dwelling,</hi> nor <hi>comfortable Food or Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but as to what they can do themſelves, they're in <hi>pinching flraits, wants, neceſſities.</hi> 'Tis this ſort of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> that ſeems to be ſpecially intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Text. This Poverty is very diſtreſſing, and too often puts perſons on wicked practices. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the Name of my God in vain</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, We may conſider, <hi>This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is not a Sin, but a miſery.</hi> In its ſelf conſider'd, <hi>'tis no Sin to be poor.</hi> Though the <hi>Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the air had neſts,</hi> yet our Holy Redeemer <hi>had not where to lay his head.</hi> Mat. 8.20. <hi>Tho' he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. So the <hi>precious Saints</hi> of God, of whom the world is not worthy; are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>poor in this world,</hi> tho' rich in faith. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. They're ſometimes <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> (Heb. 11.37.) <hi>naked, and deſtitute of daily food.</hi> Jam. 2.15. We read of the <hi>poor Saints at</hi> Jeruſalem; and of the <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Saints.</hi> Rom. 12.13. and 15.26. Yea, it's poſſible, perſons may ſometimes come to <hi>pinching poverty;</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002083_0007_0FBB8A7F6A6EDE88"/>yet not for any particular, remarkable Sin or fault of their own, that men know of. Conſider <hi>Job</hi>'s poverty. It may be in many Inſtances of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be ſaid as of the man <hi>born blind.</hi> Joh. 9.3. <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his Parents.</hi> That is, no particular, remarkable Sin beyond what all generally are guilty of, has brought the affliction. Their <hi>poverty</hi> may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be occaſion'd, by ſome long <hi>ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, weakneſs,</hi> or <hi>lameneſs</hi> of body; by <hi>Fire</hi> conſuming what they had; by <hi>Storms</hi> waſting their Subſtance by <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Land;</hi> or by the <hi>failing</hi> or <hi>falſeneſs</hi> of thoſe who had the main part of their Eſtates in their hands; or their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates may be taken away by <hi>Thieves, Robbers, Pyrates,</hi> open <hi>Enemies,</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,</hi> who <hi>ſpoil them of their Goods. Heb.</hi> 10.34. When Perſons are Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh'd by ſuch ways as theſe, they are not to be <hi>blam'd</hi> for, but rather pity'd and reliev'd in, their affliction.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding theſe things, yet very often vicious wicked practices, do evidently and directly bring <hi>pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poverty</hi> on perſons; and they well

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sloth and Lazineſs.</hi> This is the <hi>Vice,</hi> which our Text more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately refers to. God hath made both our <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> we ſhould glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him with both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. All our powers and abilities, ſhould be imploy'd as God directs. God does not give us <hi>Talents,</hi> to be <hi>wrapt up in a Napkin,</hi> out to be imploy'd in his Service. Our <hi>Hands</hi> were not made, meerly to be folded up in <hi>Sleeping,</hi> but to be imploy'd in <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Adam</hi> while <hi>Innocent,</hi> was put into the <hi>Garden, to dreſs and keep it. Gen.</hi> 2.15. Note by the way, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> can't dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If man would have his <hi>Bread,</hi> he muſt then Work for it in the <hi>sweat of his Brows,</hi> and that as long as he lives, even <hi>till he returns to the Ground.</hi> Gen. 3.19 <hi>The Sun ariſeth,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002083_0009_0FBB8A85E07C2980"/>man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</hi> Pſrl. 104.22, 23. The day then, is to be ſpent in <hi>Labour,</hi> not in <hi>Lazineſs.</hi> How plain are thoſe words? <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work.</hi> Surely then the <hi>ſlothful</hi> Servant, is a <hi>wicked</hi> Servant. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.26. <hi>Study to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs, and to work with your hands as we commanded you, that ye may have lack of nothing.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.11, 12. Here's a plain command of God, that perſons ſhould <hi>do their own buſineſs,</hi> ſhould <hi>work with their own hands,</hi> to ſupply their <hi>own wants.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.10. <hi>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat.</hi> Thoſe <hi>who</hi> are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work, are unworthy to eat. We ſhould <hi>Work</hi> as well as <hi>Pray,</hi> for our <hi>daily bread;</hi> and ſhould be, <hi>not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Rom. 12.11. Thoſe honeſt and diligent in lawful buſineſs, by God's bleſſing, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get a comfortable Support for themſelves &amp; theirs; &amp; are alſo able <hi>to give to him that needeth.</hi> Eph. 4.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002083_0010_0FBB8A89A0878B90"/>28. But Lazineſs, Idleneſs, does as it were directly, naturally, neceſſarily lead to Poverty. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh poor, that dealeth with a ſlack hand: but the diligent hand maketh rich.</hi> Prov. 20.13. <hi>Love not ſleep, leſt thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with Bread.</hi> Prov. 23.21. <hi>Drowſineſs ſhall cloath a man with rags. By much ſlothfulneſs, the building decayeth; and thro' Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the hands, the houſe droppeth throngh.</hi> Eccleſ. 10.18. It's plain from the Word of God, from the light of reaſon, from the natural tendency of ſecond cauſes, from experience and obſervation; that Sloth and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tend to bring plaching poverty. Therefore it's very wicked, to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and idle; whether perſons have <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates or not,</hi> they ſhould be diligently imploy'd in ſome lawful buſineſs, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promote the glory of God, and good of Mankind. None ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> neither <hi>Rich</hi> nor <hi>Poor, Young</hi> nor <hi>Old, Men</hi> nor <hi>Women,</hi> tho' 'tis not neceſſary that all ſhould be imploy'd in the ſame buſineſs. God will call all to to an account, how they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002083_0011_0FBB8A8A886E2848"/>imploy'd their <hi>time</hi> and <hi>abilities,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he commanded them or not.</p>
               <p>A Grave Author (<hi>Durham</hi> on the Commands, <hi>Octavo, p</hi> 341.) ſays,
<q>When God giveth men ability of body on mind, it is ſad that they ſhould be uſeful for nothing, nor active in any thing but to Sin, and be ſnares and reproaches to Chriſtians, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, as all idle perſons, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of Chriſtians, are, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, whether Gentlemen, or others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Idleneſs is call'd, <hi>Master omnium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum et Noverca omnium virtutum;</hi> that is, the Mother of all Vices, and the Step-mother of all Vertues.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is a breach of God's Law, it's contrary to the plain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, it diſhonours the Chriſtian Religion, provokes God, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the Devil, hurts men as to their Bodies and Souls, their Perſons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; and ſo hurts the Publick too on various accounts. Yet many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge Idleneſs, they are ſo <hi>lazy</hi> or <hi>proud,</hi> or both, that they won't work. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> were two of the Sins of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Ezek. 16.49. Are there not many, ſo <hi>poor,</hi> that they <hi>want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> and yet won't ſtoop to do this
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002083_0012_0FBB8A8BFB8532A8"/>or that <hi>inferior laborious ſort of work,</hi> no, they ſcorn it? Poſſibly they'll <hi>Beg</hi> or <hi>Steal,</hi> rather than do it. If their <hi>Particular Trade</hi> fails, poſſibly they'll think, they have a <hi>warrant</hi> to be <hi>Idle;</hi> and won't turn their hand to other buſineſs; or if they can't have their <hi>full price,</hi> they'll rather be Idle than work for <hi>mean Wages</hi> But their Pride and Sloth are abominable to God, and ought to be abhorr'd by men.</p>
               <p>So, ſome are ſo proud, fond and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that they <hi>won't let their Children go out to Service,</hi> to be us'd to buſineſs, earn their Living; no, they'll rather keep 'em at home, or playing in the Streets, training 'em up in <hi>Ignorance, Idleneſs, Hunger</hi> and <hi>Nakedneſs.</hi> Are there not too many Inſtances of this? Some Parents are ſo <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>fond,</hi> that they had rather their Children, <hi>Daughters</hi> eſpecially, ſhould <hi>want ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries' at home;</hi> than <hi>go to Service,</hi> where they might <hi>learn more, be better.</hi> and <hi>live better</hi> on all accounts. Such <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fondneſs</hi> are hateful in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and unſpeakably hurtful to their Children. For this bringing up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Ignorance, Pride, Idleneſs,</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently fits them for the Devil's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; it often leads to <hi>Lying, Stealing,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002083_0013_0FBB8A8DA2F46CE0"/>Fornication, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and various ſorts of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Well, ſince <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is thus <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>pernicious,</hi> ſurely <hi>diligence</hi> in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful buſineſs is a <hi>Vertue,</hi> and thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary for it, are ſo far praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Prov. 22.29. <hi>Seeſt thou a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in his buſineſs? He ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings, he ſhall not ſtand before mean men.</hi> So, thoſe are praiſe-worthy, who bring up their <hi>Children</hi> in the <hi>good knowledge of Religion,</hi> and <hi>diligently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in proper buſineſs.</hi> For <hi>Children ſhould be train'd up in the way, wherein they ſhould go,</hi> Prov. 22.6. If you would not have them live like lazy, uſeleſs Drones when grown up; then don't Educate them ſo, while they are young.</p>
               <p>'Twould alſo be praiſe-worthy, to ſtudy, contrive, and promote ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for <hi>Imploying the poor,</hi> even <hi>Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> that if they want buſineſs, they may be ſet on work, and may <hi>eat their own bread.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.12. It's a better Service to God and men, to <hi>imploy the poor,</hi> that they may <hi>get their own Living</hi> than to ſupply them by <hi>Alms</hi> in their <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Lazineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Intemperance.</hi> This alſo is one ſinful method, which leads directly to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002083_0014_0FBB8A8EF9749E40"/>pinching <hi>Poverty.</hi> Alas, how many ſorrowful Inſtances are there, which are plain proof, of this? Inſpired <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20 21. <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Wine-bibbers, amongſt riotous eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of fleſh. For the Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to poverty.</hi> Prov. 21.17. <hi>He that loveth pleaſure, ſhall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oyl, ſhall not be rich.</hi> When perſons will indulge themſelves in <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Paſtimes,</hi> in <hi>eating and drinking of the beſt,</hi> the moſt pleaſant and delicious tho' <hi>very coſtly,</hi> as tho' nothing leſs would ſerve their turn; this directly tends to bring pinching poverty. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> Son, <hi>waſted his Subſtance with riotous living;</hi> and became <hi>ſo poor,</hi> that he would gladly have filled his belly with <hi>hogs-meat,</hi> if he could, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.13, 16. Perſons ſhould <hi>eat in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſs.</hi> Eccleſ. 10.17. When perſons indulge themſelves in eating and drinking to exceſs, this tends to deſtroy their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Health, to waſte their Eſtates, to bring them into pinching ſtraits and wants, to make them unable to provide for themſelves and Families unable to pay their Debts, unable to do what they ought to ſupport both Church and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002083_0015_0FBB8A9523735528"/>State. When they indulge Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it unfits them to ſerve either God or men; it commonly dulls, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, ſtupifies their natural abilities, both of body and mind. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Whoredom, and Wine, and new wine take away the heart.</hi> What an heap of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, does this Sin procure? <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath wo? Who hath contentions? Who hath bablings? Who hath wounds without cauſe? Who hath redneſs of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine.</hi> Alas, no tongue can fully tell, the Sins and miſchiefs proceeding from <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> When perſons are heated and inflamed with ſtrong drink, how often do they <hi>ſet their mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth?</hi> Pſal. 73.9. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do they abound in profane Oaths and Curſes? How often do they talk about, and condemn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things which don't concern them? How often are they <hi>filthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> in their words and actions. How often do they jangle, quarrel, fight, both give and receive <hi>wounds without cauſe?</hi> Indeed, numberleſs are the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs proceeding from Intemperance. It is an old ſaying, <hi>Plures gula quam
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002083_0016_0FBB8A96CF634908"/>gladio pereunt,</hi> more die by Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than by War. Drunkards have a <hi>Wo</hi> denounc'd againſt them by God. <hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drink; that continue until night, till wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them.</hi> Iſa. 5.11. Iſa. 28.1. <hi>Wo to the Drunkards of</hi> Ephraim! <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> (1 Cor 6.9, 10.) therefore their caſe is <hi>wofub</hi> indeed. Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance tends to ruin perſons in this World, and damn them eternally in the next; therefore it is unſpeakably vile and wicked, for any to indulge themſelves in this Vice. Among the Heathen, ſome have purpoſely made their <hi>Slaves drunk,</hi> that their <hi>Children</hi> ſeeing them in that <hi>worſe than beaſtly poſture and condition,</hi> might be warn'd and caution'd againſt the Vice of Drunkenneſs. As for <hi>Drunkards,</hi> how often is <hi>ſhameful ſpuing on them?</hi> Hab. 2.16. It's abominable for any to eat and drink to exceſs, though poſſibly they don't do it to that degree, as to ſet them a <hi>vomiting like Dogs,</hi> or <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing like Swine in their own filth.</hi> Iſa. 5.22. <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink.</hi> If they have <hi>ſtrung heads,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002083_0017_0FBB8A97F9491D88"/>and can bear much without <hi>reeling</hi> and <hi>ſtaggering;</hi> yet if they drink to exceſs, more than is for bodily health, then there's a <hi>Wo</hi> from God denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; they abuſe God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to gratifie their luſts; <hi>their God is their belly, they glory in their ſhame.</hi> Some look on <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> as a breach of all the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> becauſe it <hi>tends</hi> to make perſons break <hi>every one</hi> of them. Since Intemperance is ſo vile and baſe, and makes men on ſome accounts viler than the <hi>beaſts;</hi> ſince it provokes God, and gratifies the Devil; ſince it hurts the Body, the Credit, the Eſtates, the Families, the Souls of perſons; ſince it is ſo, ſurely it muſt needs be fooliſh and ſinful, for perſons to company together meerly to <hi>tipple,</hi> and trifle away precious time.</p>
               <p>Here I might propoſe a few <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it not vile and wicked, for any (<hi>Town Dwellers</hi> eſpecially) when they have no real buſineſs or occaſion for it, to get together to <hi>Taverns, Tipling Houſes,</hi> and there ſpend <hi>ſeveral hours</hi> together, poſſibly <hi>whole Evenings,</hi> and till <hi>late at night,</hi> if not <hi>great part of the day</hi> too; I ſay, is not this vile, ſhameful, wicked? Surely 'tis. <hi>Taverns</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002083_0018_0FBB8A9A56B9BFC0"/>were not appointed for <hi>Town-Dwellers</hi> to <hi>laze,</hi> and <hi>tipple,</hi> to <hi>ſot</hi> and <hi>doze</hi> in; but for <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Cravellers,</hi> who being diſtant from home, muſt ſeek elſewhere for <hi>Lodging, Food</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> that are needful for them. When <hi>Town-Dwellers,</hi> indulge themſelves in ſuch a needleſs <hi>haunting of Taverns;</hi> to me it ſeems, that their <hi>Conſciences are aſleep,</hi> (if not <hi>ſear'd with an hot iron.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.2.) or miſguided and <hi>erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> elſe they would ſeverely <hi>ſting, laſh</hi> and <hi>wound</hi> them for ſuch practices. Is this practice, a minding of things that are <hi>true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely,</hi> and <hi>of good report?</hi> Phil. 4.8. What, is needleſs <hi>haunting of Taverns</hi> a thing of <hi>good report,</hi> is there any <hi>vertue</hi> or <hi>praiſe</hi> in it? Is this practice, an <hi>abſtaining from all appearance of evil,</hi> as we are commanded to do? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. Do theſe practices fit perſons for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Serving of God or men? Do they bring glory to God, or good to men? Do they bring honour to the Chriſtian Religion; or well-grounded peace to their own Conſciences; or due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs for Death and Judgment? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no, none of theſe things. Again,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not vile, that perſons can ſcarce <hi>make a Bargain, make up Accompts, Pay</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002083_0019_0FBB8A9BCD212CF0"/>or <hi>Receive</hi> a little <hi>Money;</hi> but that they muſt needs go to a <hi>Tavern,</hi> and Solemnize the Matter as it were, by ſwallowing down <hi>Strong Drink;</hi> tho' poſſibly neither the <hi>time of day,</hi> nor <hi>ſtate of their Bodies,</hi> calls for any ſuch thing? Can't <hi>Tradeſmen finiſh</hi> or bring home a <hi>piece of Work,</hi> but muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt think themſelves wrong'd, if they are not treated with <hi>Strong Drink?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not vile and wicked, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to tempt and prompt others to drink <hi>to exceſs;</hi> and think they can ſcarce make them <hi>wellcome,</hi> if they don't make them <hi>drunk?</hi> It's criminal to make others (or our ſelves either) <hi>ſick with bottles of wine,</hi> thoſe who are <hi>ſo,</hi> commonly <hi>Stretch out their hands with Scorners.</hi> Hoſ. 7.5. Yet how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are many made <hi>Sick,</hi> diſorder'd, diſcompos'd, inflam'd with <hi>Wine,</hi> yea and with <hi>Rum</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> alſo, and what they mix with it? How many <hi>bottles,</hi> how many <hi>quarts</hi> are often ſpent in exceſs? God is the giver of <hi>Corn, Wine, Oyl,</hi> of all the Creature-comforts we enjoy; now to prepare theſe for <hi>Baal,</hi> (Hoſ. 2.8.) or abuſe 'em to exceſs, to the gratifying of our luſts; Oh how vile is it! And if we do make our ſelves <hi>Sick,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002083_0020_0FBB8A9E5C322B90"/>and <hi>Inflame</hi> our ſelves with <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;</hi> no wonder if we ſtretch out our hands with <hi>ſcorners;</hi> no wonder if we become guilty of various follies. How common is it, for perſons to <hi>tranſgreſs by Wine?</hi> Hab. 2.5. <hi>They alſo have erred thro' wine, and thro' ſtrong drink are out of the way.</hi> Iſa. 28.7. <hi>Wine is a mocker, ſtrong drink is raging; and whoſoever is deceived thereby, is not wiſe.</hi> When perſons are inrag'd with ſtrong drink, what wickedneſs is there almoſt, which they are not ready to commit? Therefore it muſt needs be vile, for perſons to prompt or tempt one another to drink to exceſs. When perſons will get into <hi>Gangs,</hi> or <hi>Clubs,</hi> and have their <hi>appointed Meetings</hi> (whether in <hi>Taverns</hi> or <hi>Private Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>) chiefly if not meerly, to <hi>Swill</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> more than is <hi>needful</hi> for their <hi>Health;</hi> Oh how vile is this? How provoking to God, how pleaſing to the Devil, how ruining to their Souls, and ſtupifying to their Conſciences? What account will they give of this, when <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, and render to every one according to his deeds?</hi> Rom. 2.6, 16. <hi>Wo</hi> is to thoſe, who indulge <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in themſelves, or <hi>prompt</hi> others
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002083_0021_0FBB8AA031EB8E68"/>to it. Hab. 2.15. <hi>Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that putteſt thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kea alſo.</hi> Poſſibly ſome will count this <hi>good fellowſhip;</hi> but really and truly 'tis <hi>damning wickedneſs,</hi> I ſay, 'tis <hi>damning wickedneſs;</hi> it is in a ſort, a <hi>murdering</hi> both the <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for it tends to deſtroy both. Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not vile &amp; wicked, for <hi>Tavern-Keepers, Inn-holders,</hi> meerly for their <hi>own gain,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer their neighbours unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and needleſty to ſpend their time and money with them?</hi> And is it not ſtill a more <hi>aggravated crime</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this, when they <hi>know</hi> that the <hi>Families</hi> of ſuch Neighbours do <hi>pinch</hi> and <hi>ſuffer,</hi> for want of what is thus wickedly <hi>guzled away?</hi> Is it not vile and wicked for any (whether <hi>Inn. holders</hi> or <hi>Retailers</hi>) to Sell Strong Drink to the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Vicious,</hi> when they <hi>know</hi> that they <hi>don't really need it;</hi> and that their <hi>Families want Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi> at the ſame time? When <hi>Drink-ſellers</hi> do thus, are they not <hi>partakers of other mens Sins,</hi> and ſhall they not be <hi>partakers of their plagues?</hi> 1 Tim 5.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Is this pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice agreeable to thoſe Scriptures. <hi>Eph.</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002083_0022_0FBB8AA35B3A1BA8"/>5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkneſs; but rather reprove them.</hi> Lev. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not have thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbours; and ſhalt not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> Or as ſome read it, <hi>that thou bear not Sin for him.</hi> When perſons thus <hi>gain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> by ſelling Drink, to the <hi>known wrong</hi> and prejudice of others; don't they <hi>gain the wrath and ourſe of God</hi> with it? Are they not inſtrumental of hurting and ruining their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and their <hi>Families;</hi> while they gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thirſt after ſuch <hi>unjuſt, unrighteous gain?</hi> Alas, What <hi>ſtupify'd Conſciences</hi> have thoſe, who can thus <hi>Indulge</hi> their Neighbours in Sin; to the great and evident hurt of themſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?</p>
               <p>Let any one who <hi>believes</hi> the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> the <hi>truth of the Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrict and awful account to be given in the Day of Judgment;</hi> I ſay, let any ſuch a one judge, whether theſe practices now mention'd, are not <hi>vile, wicked,</hi> and <hi>abominable.</hi> Will the <hi>plea's</hi> and <hi>reaſonings</hi> us'd <hi>for</hi> theſe practices; avail any thing before the <hi>awful Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002083_0023_0FBB8AA4E1062D88"/>of the Holy and Glorious God, who can't be deceiv'd, and won't be mock'd?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since <hi>Intemperance</hi> is ſo Impoveriſhing, ſo many ways hurtful and pernicious: ſhould not all poſſible conſciencious care be taken, <hi>that Licenſes for Tavern-keeping and Retailing, be not needleſly multiplied?</hi> Thoſe impower'd to act in theſe matters, muſt give an account to God for what they do in it. If they'll evidently endanger the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> for the gratifying a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friend,</hi> or <hi>Importunate Petitioner;</hi> they'll be guilty before God for doing it. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>fail in their Trade</hi> or Buſineſs, muſt the next thing be, <hi>a Licenſe to Sell Drink?</hi> Does not this method of <hi>Supporting one Family,</hi> too often <hi>ruin ſeveral?</hi> Let an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſerious Conſcience, well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Word of God; make its Judgment of theſe things. I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Pride and Extravagancy, tend directly to prinching Poverty.</hi> When perſons in <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Buying of Houſes,</hi> in <hi>finifying</hi> or <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing</hi> them, in the <hi>Coſtlineſs</hi> of their <hi>Food, Drink, Cloaths;</hi> I ſay, when in theſe things they act <hi>above their abilities,</hi> and ſpend <hi>more than then Eſtates will bear;</hi> this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to <hi>pinching Poverty.</hi> Yet how frequent are theſe things? How common is it, for perſons to <hi>look big, go fine,</hi> make a <hi>topping ſhow,</hi> live at an <hi>high</hi> and <hi>coſtly rate;</hi> and yet not be able to do this <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging of others,</hi> by lying <hi>unreaſonably
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002083_0024_0FBB8AA6303EF7A8"/>long in Debt;</hi> and it may be ſometimes they never pay at all? For perſons to lie long in Debt to <hi>Merchants, Shop-keepers, Tradeſmen,</hi> and <hi>poor Labourers;</hi> to lie long in debt for what they <hi>eat, drink, wear,</hi> and for the very <hi>Wood</hi> they burn; and yet make a <hi>great and topping ſhow,</hi> and will ſcarce <hi>bear</hi> to be <hi>ask'd to pay their debts;</hi> this, I ſay, is vile and abominable. No wonder if their <hi>Pride, Injuſtice, Extragancy</hi> bring them <hi>low,</hi> ſuch practices are <hi>Unchriſtian,</hi> countrary to that expreſs Law of Chriſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.31. <hi>As ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to Them likewiſe. Solomon</hi> ſays, Prov. 13.7. <hi>There is that maketh himſelf rich, yet hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: there is that maketh himſelf poor, but hath great riches.</hi> Some are of ſuch a baſe, niggardly ſpirit, that they'll <hi>pretend Peverty,</hi> tho' they have conſiderable <hi>Wealth.</hi> On the contrary, ſome are ſo <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> that they'll make <hi>fine ſhows,</hi> live at an <hi>high</hi> and <hi>coſtly rate,</hi> as tho' they were <hi>very rich;</hi> when poſſibly if Accompts were made up, &amp; all had their due, there would nothing remain to them. If every Bird had its own fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, poſſibly they would be left naked.
