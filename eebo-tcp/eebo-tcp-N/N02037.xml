            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have here the Great and dreadful GOD, beſpeaking his ſinful and wretched people, in the moſt gracious and merciful manner that can be imagined. He is earneſtly calling them to Repentance and Reformation; <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings,</hi> &amp;c. He is aſſuring them of the ready and full pardon of all their Sins upon their Repentance, how heinous and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated ſoever they were: <hi>Tho' your ſins be as Scarlet,</hi> &amp;c. He propoſes therefore to <hi>reaſon</hi> the Caſe with them, that he might effectually convince, affect and perſwade them; <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET them hear GOD what he has to ſay to 'em, and GOD is ready to hear them in their
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002421_0004_0FDC04D95FE60FB8"/>turn, if they can have any thing to anſwer, any reaſon to give, why they ſhould not repent.</p>
            <p>WAS ever any any thing ſo <hi>Good,</hi> condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compaſſionate? So righteous, equitable and reaſonable? as a <hi>Father</hi> to his erring <hi>Son,</hi> rather than as a <hi>Judge</hi> unto his provoking, arraigned, judged people! <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JUST before he had been decking himſelf with Majeſty, and arraying himſelf with glory, and ſpeaking with the utmoſt ſeverity and terror: <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Hear O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath ſpoken</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye people of Sodom and Gomorrah!</hi> But how ſweetly does the ſtyle here change into the mild and ſofter words of Grace, mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion! <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IT may be the people of <hi>Judah</hi> might be ready to <hi>object</hi> againſt the vehemence and ſeverity of GOD by his <hi>Prophet,</hi> as too much and hard and unreaſonable. That they were a ſinful People they might be ready to own, but not to that degree nor ſo univerſally as they are here charged and arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they might be ready to hope. And tho' there might be much amiſs in the Worſhip they render'd to GOD, yet they might look upon the ſlight pour'd thereupon, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, to be in a very unreaſonable Exceſs. Wherefore to <hi>obviate</hi> and anſwer ſuch a riſing and reaſoning in their hearts, GOD ſpeaks in the <hi>Text;</hi> "Come now, and let us reaſon together, let us debate the matter fairly, let me convince you of my own Juſtice and Equity, righteouſneſs and goodneſs, if words will convince
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002421_0005_0FDC04DC1AD95250"/>you. "Thus religion has reaſon on its ſide, and the GOD of heaven condeſcends to reaſon the Caſe with them that contradict him, and find fault with his proceedings.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe and after this manner we often find the gracious GOD ſtooping to <hi>reaſon the Caſe</hi> with his poor people, againſt themſelves. Iſa. 5.3. <hi>And now O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard.</hi> And in the 43. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. <hi>ver. Put me in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> ſays GOD; <hi>Let us plead together, declare thou, that thou mayſt be juſtified.</hi> What fair play is here for their lives! did ever a Judge beſpeak thus a Priſoner at the Bar! or could a fellow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a fellow worm, ſay more to a Criminal that ſtood for his life? The 18th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is all in this ſtrain; particularly, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Hear now, O houſe of Iſrael, is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</hi> And to name no more, the <hi>Holy One</hi> leaves it to the Conſcience of his people to accuſe him if they cou'd &amp; acquit themſelves: Micah 6.2, 3. <hi>For the Lord hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with his people, and he will plead with Iſrael; O my people, what have I done unto thee? teſtify againſt me.</hi> Theſe paſſages, ſome of 'em, do even exceed the Words of my <hi>text</hi> in graciouſneſs. They are a high and glorious <hi>Comment</hi> on them. They ſhine like the <hi>Sun</hi> in their own brightneſs, and no words of man can add to them.</p>
            <p>To come now to my <hi>Text,</hi> and raiſe ſome <hi>Doctrinal Obſervations</hi> from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. GOD deals with us as rational Creatures and treats us in the moſt reaſonable manner. <hi>Come now and let us reaſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>come now, and let us reaſon together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. GOD reaſons therefore and argues with men for this very end to bring 'em to repentance. <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, tho' your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as wool,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>GOD deals with us as rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and treats with us in a reaſonable manner.</hi> Such he <hi>made</hi> us, and accordingly he <hi>treats</hi> us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>HE made us rational Creatures.</hi> GOD made Man a <hi>living Soul;</hi> he made him in his own <hi>Image;</hi> he made him <hi>but a little lower than the Angels,</hi> an Intelligent &amp; immortal <hi>Spirit</hi> as they are. Gen. 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, let us make man in our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, after our likeneſs, and let him have dominion.</hi> It is the <hi>Soul</hi> of man that does eſpecially bear the Image of GOD. In <hi>this</hi> it is that he reſembles the Great <hi>Father of Spirits;</hi> even as the Offspring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Parent. Act. 17.28. <hi>For we are his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</hi> "The faculties of our Souls are to us as the cleareſt looking-glaſs wherein to ſee GOD. By theſe it is that we become capable of conceiving of GOD's Spiritual Nature &amp; Perfections, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Government &amp; Judgment. We are <hi>Minds.</hi> As the Angels of Heaven are <hi>Intelligences;</hi> ſo Man is a <hi>Spiritual Intelligence,</hi> Job 32.8. <hi>There is a ſpirit in man, aud the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth him underſtanding.</hi> There is a Soul in man endued with a principle and power of reaſoning; and this Mind needs to be enlightned by the Spirit of GOD. In our <hi>natural ſtate</hi> we are taught more than the beaſt of the earth, and are made Wiſer than the fowl of heaven; but in <hi>Regeneration</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002421_0007_0FDC04E4F23BDD00"/>of man is divinely Illuminated from above to diſcern the things of GOD. The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the LORD; <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. Of his lighting within him and ſetting up there, to give light to the houſe. Such a light within is <hi>Conſcience;</hi> a moſt noble faculty, GOD's Deputy. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits is the Father of this Light. <hi>He lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh. 1.9. We feel this power of thinking, reaſoning and arguing in our ſelves. <hi>My thoughts cauſe me to anſwer,</hi> ſaid <hi>Zophar: I am full of matter,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elibu,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit within me, conſtraineth me.</hi> We are made rational Creatures, Intelligent Beings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Accordingly GOD deals with us; treats us and carries toward us.</hi> This is right and juſt; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the <hi>moſt perfect Being.</hi> He governs and orders all his Creatures according to the nature he gives them. The Creatures that have not reaſon for their own Conduct, he rules them by <hi>Inſtinct.</hi> Thoſe that have reaſon are capable of moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and accordingly he governs them by <hi>daws</hi> given to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>OUR holy and glorious Maker has written his Law in us; and it was written very fairly in man at firſt.</hi> Yea there yet remains very legible upon the heart of man much of the will and law of GOD to him, and he that will but look within himſelf, and attend to the voice of his own Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can't but read it there. Hence we read of the very <hi>heathen</hi> that they <hi>retained the Truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. They did not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves by the dictates of their own reaſon and Conſcience, but rebelled againſt the ſame.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002421_0008_0FDC04E806D17BC0"/>
               <hi>That which might be known of God was manifeſt in them; for God had ſhewed it unto them.</hi> That is, his own Eſſential Attributes and Perfections, from whence they might and ſhould have argu'd their relation to him, his Expectation from them and Will concerning them; their Duty and Obligations towards him. They were <hi>left without excuſe</hi> in their acting contrary to this light of nature and trampling under foot their own Reaſon; <hi>becoming vain in their Imaginations and darkning their own fooliſh hearts.</hi> Indeed this is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a rational Creature to have the <hi>Law of GOD</hi> written on his Mind and Conſcience; for Reaſon in us is this Law; and it is given man for his Government and Conduct.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>SINCE our fall GOD has written his Law, mind and will to us in his Word.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary for the <hi>recovery</hi> of man from the Ruin his Apoſtacy had bro't upon him. The light of reaſon was wofully <hi>obſcured,</hi> and the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon his heart dreadfully <hi>obliterated,</hi> by the corruption of the Soul, and the Aſcendency that luſt had gain'd; ſo that a <hi>Revelation</hi> from GOD became neceſſary, and that he ſhould <hi>write the great things of his law in tables of ſtone,</hi> which he had before written in the <hi>table of the heart.</hi> And accordingly GOD has done ſo; and we have <hi>his Book</hi> in our hands, to read it with our eyes, and know his Mind and Will for our Salvation; that we may do it and be bleſſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD has given his Word <hi>to inform our Underſtandings in what is right and good.</hi> He hath ſhewed thee; O man, what is good and what doth the LORD thy GOD require of thee. The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002421_0009_0FDC04EBC442E588"/>Commandment is a lamp, and the law is a light; and all that is written by the Inſpiration of GOD, is written for our learning, that we thro' patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope. The way of man is not now in himſelf, nor is he a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law unto himſelf; therefore is the glorious Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Everliving GOD, made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith. This only can make us wiſe unto Salvation: this Wiſdom from above; the word which is near unto us, in our hands, lips and hearts. Nor are we to be wiſe above what is written.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS written word of GOD is given <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our wills, and Conſcience</hi> to embrace and obey the truth and duty, therein propoſed to us. It addreſſes with a full and abſolute authority to this <hi>Imperial faculty</hi> within us, being the law of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majeſty of heaven</hi> to us. Deut. 4.1. <hi>Now therefore hearken, O Iſrael unto the ſtatutes &amp; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I teach you to do them.</hi> And the more effectually to command our ſouls it addreſſes powerfully,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>TO our hopes &amp; fears, and unto every paſſion of our Souls</hi> by them to work on us. To our hopes by the moſt conſtraining <hi>promiſes;</hi> and to our fears by the moſt dreadful <hi>threatnings.</hi> It ſets before us <hi>a bleſſing</hi> &amp; a <hi>curſe,</hi> Deut. 11.26. <hi>A bleſſing if we obey the Commandments of the Lord our God, and a curſe if we do not.</hi> Our ſouls move upon theſe Motives if either reaſon or ſenſe be hearkned to. And becauſe we are drawn by <hi>love</hi> and urg'd on to a thing by <hi>deſire;</hi> therefore the ſure Word of GOD addreſſes to theſe Affections in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002421_0010_0FDC04EEC6FE0DE8"/>us, that we love the LORD our GOD with all our hearts and with all our Souls, and ſeek him with our whole deſires. In like manner, whatever other paſſion and affection is common to man, and which are the <hi>Avenues</hi> to his Soul, thoſe ways has the HOLY GHOST taken in his inſpired word by one or other of them to ſurpriſe or force our Souls. It ſometimes therefore moves our <hi>anger</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ſometimes our <hi>hatred,</hi> ſometimes our <hi>grief</hi> or <hi>ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS GOD deals with us <hi>as with rational Creatures,</hi> and according to the nature and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he has given us: Wherein as he <hi>puts honour</hi> on Man's reaſon, ſo he ſhews how <hi>great a Sin</hi> it is in man to violate his own Reaſon and offend againſt it. We ought to <hi>uſe</hi> the Reaſon GOD has given, yea and to <hi>reverence</hi> it: It is the rule and law of the Eternal and perfect <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> inſcribed <hi>on</hi> us and <hi>for</hi> us: we ſhou'd reverence it as the <hi>Wiſdom of GOD,</hi> as indeed it is.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>IF Sinners would but hearken to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they would repent.</hi> If men would but govern themſelves by reaſon and act rationally, they would not continue in Sin. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>RIGHT reaſon is a Divine Law to Man:</hi> the law of GOD in us, the voice of GOD to us. It is the Eternal and immutable rule of truth, goodneſs and righteouſneſs. There can be no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it, nor Deviation from it without Sin. It is the law and light of Nature; the Law that Angels act by, the Rule of all GOD's perfect Acts and Works. "There are certain Rules of moral "goodneſs, wherein all Underſtandings are agreed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002421_0011_0FDC04F1C7217850"/>and in acting according to which ever Intelligent Being attains its true perfection. It is the Glory of <hi>GOD</hi> that he always acts according to the moſt perfect Reaſon, and this is the Crown of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the unchangable Rule of <hi>Man's</hi> arriving at the honour and happineſs for which he was created.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>IF reaſon had been hearkned to, Man had never fallen from GOD, or ſinn'd againſt him.</hi> Had he attended to the voice of his own upright Conſcience he had preſerv'd his Integrity. Had <hi>Eve</hi> ſtood by her own wiſe and juſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> at firſt to the Tempter, and accordingly deteſted his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her, ſhe had trod him under fool and broken his head with her heel. But ſhe liſtned to the Tempter's Anſwer, and ſuffered her mind to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the words ſhe firſt ſpake in the Wiſdom of GOD. Gen. 3.2, 3. <hi>And the Woman ſaid unto the ſerpent,—God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of this tree, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</hi> Indeed it may ſeem that <hi>Eve</hi> did not act according to the Dictate of right reaſon in anſwering the Serpent at all; yet her <hi>Anſwer</hi> was according to the Dictate of right reaſon, full of Gratitude, Righteouſneſs and Reſolution; and had ſhe ſtood by it ſhe had baffled the tempter, and preſerv'd her ſelf and us. But preſently ſhe abandon'd her Reaſon, and proſtituted her Conſcience, liſtning to the <hi>Devil</hi> and to the lye which he gave to GOD, and looking on the fruit with a luſting Eye. Had ſhe not <hi>left</hi> her reaſon, ſhe had not <hi>loſt</hi> her ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>MAN's recovery to GOD depends now upon his attention to the voice of reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon the Diſcoveries, propoſals and Call of the Goſpel to him.</hi> Let the Sinner conſider <hi>theſe,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002421_0012_0FDC04F55C585CE8"/>uſe his reaſon and hearken to his own Conſcience, and he will turn unto GOD. Let him <hi>think of his ways,</hi> his folly and ſin, his Intereſt and duty; which the Convictions of the HOLY SPIRIT bring every one to do that repents; and he will <hi>turn his feet to God's teſtimonies.</hi> So the <hi>Prodigal</hi> came to himſelf, and reaſoned rightly with himſelf, and <hi>aroſe and came to his Father,</hi> Luke 15.17. He had in all his riot acted madly and irrationally, an abſurd and irrational part; but now he came to himſelf, to the uſe of his Underſtanding, to a ſober reaſoning with himſelf, he ſtraitway left his vicious Courſes. This Exerciſe of reaſon and acting upon it is a thing very pleaſing to GOD; as it is to a wiſe and good Parent to ſee a fooliſh, paſſionate and obſtinate Child bethink himſelf and humble himſelf. Job 33.27. <hi>He looketh upon men, and if any ſay I have ſinned, and perverted that which is right and it proſiteth me not; he will deliver his ſoul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> In a word, The End of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and preached Word is to reclaim men from ſin, and to recover them from guilt and hell by bringing them to repentance; and this by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and enlightning their minds and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Conſciences. It may be ſaid of the <hi>whole word,</hi> its uſe, deſign and end, as it is of the <hi>Book of Proverbs</hi> in particular, Prov. 1. <hi>Init. That we may know wiſdom and inſtruction, to perceive the words of underſtanding, to give knowledge and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and that we may attain unto wiſe Counſels.</hi> Grace reſtores the Exerciſe of reaſon and brings Sinners to repent. The <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes them; Iſa. 46.8. <hi>Remember this, and ſhew
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002421_0013_0FDC04F958022610"/>your ſelves Men; bring it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors.</hi> i. e. Uſe your reaſon, review your actions, look 'em over and over, do it deliverately, calmly, ſeriouſly; conſider the nature of your evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, the iſſue and Conſequent of them; and you will be no longer tranſgreſſors; you will repent of your paſt tranſgreſſions, you will trangreſs no more.</p>
            <p>But here it is neceſſary to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>FALLEN-MAN could not by any natural light have diſcovered whether GOD would admit or decept of his repentance;</hi> or what <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of repentance he would require; or how any ſort and degree of it <hi>could procure favour with GOD,</hi> or prevail to obtain his moſt gracious pardon. The reaſon of Man could carry him no further than a <hi>peradventure</hi> as to theſe things; and as his <hi>Intereſt</hi> would lead him to <hi>wiſh</hi> it poſſible for GOD to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sin; ſo a <hi>general notion</hi> of the goodneſs of GOD might poſſibly lead him to <hi>think</hi> it probable, or to preſume on it as certain that there is forgiveneſs with GOD, upon a Sinner's repentance. But at laſt the bare Reaſon of Mankind could never afford us any certain Information about GOD's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Sin; and our guilt would forbid us to build any hope upon a rotten Conjecture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE meer force of natural reaſon can never prevail upon any truly to repent.</hi> Let a Man's own Reaſon and Conſcience do it's beſt by its ſelf alone to convince and perſwade him, a corrupt nature bears it down with violence; or let a meer Man or Angel reaſon with us in the wiſdom of GOD, and with all the art and power of moral ſvaſion it will not ſuffice. For Reaſon in Man is depraved, corrupted, enfeebled, inſlaved by the Fall: It is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002421_0014_0FDC04FACBC6C540"/>wofully darkned, obſcured, clouded and eclipſed by the Apoſtacy; and there is, 1. A wicked <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> in the Soul of man againſt that light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that remains therein. Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in us, by rea- of the blindneſs of the heart.</hi> Thus the light that is in us becomes in a manner darkneſs, and the poor light that is, is reſiſted, ſinn'd againſt, and quench'd by the violent luſts and paſſions of Men. Beſides, 2. There is a wretched <hi>Impotency</hi> in man to act up to the light of Reaſon within him. It can't and won't attend to its voice in every caſe; nor can it eaſily know the true judgment and determination of reaſon in every caſe; but thro' the Corruption that is in the world thro' luſt, many things occur to biaſs and miſlead men from judging according to right reaſon; Often Education does ſo; and being miſs-taught in our early days, we eaſily imbibe errors, falſe reaſonings and prejudices againſt the truth; and often where we are well Inſtructed at firſt, yet our luſts corrupt, bribe and pervert our Judgment; and <hi>the law in the members wars againſt the law in the mind and leads into Captivity to the law of ſin in the members.</hi> It is not therefore in the power of meer Reaſon to prevail upon a ſinner to repent. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>GOD by his powerful Spirit and Grace, when he renews a Soul unto repentance, brings it to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and hearken unto the voice of reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> He renews the <hi>Mind</hi> of man and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens it; gives it a new and true ſight of things; a diſcovery of truth by a divine Illumination, brings it to reaſon juſtly, and he that was <hi>once darkneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002421_0015_0FDC050059051EF0"/>is now light in the Lord.</hi> It is to the reſtored Soul as it was with <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> who had loſt his reaſon and been like a Brute Creature; but at once <hi>his reaſon return'd to him, his honour and his brightneſs, and excellent Majeſty was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him,</hi> Dan. 4.26. Again, In renewing a Soul to repentance, the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> renews life <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and reſtores its fidelity and authority; to challenge and rebuke for ſin, to require and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us in the Name of GOD. He renews the <hi>Will</hi> alſo, obediently to follow the dictates of the enlightned Mind; and he renews the <hi>Affections,</hi> ſo that theſe govern themſelves in their actings and exerciſe by the rules of right reaſon; and ſo the Souls love and hatred, deſire and averſation, hopes and fears, joys and griefs, are directed unto right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and proportion'd to them in juſt degrees and meaſures, regulated by the will of GOD revealed to us, and for his glory. By all which,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>GOD makes that diſcovery of himſelf, of ſin, of his will and grace for our Salvation, that the Soul cannot reſiſt but moſt freely falls into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a gracious repentance.</hi> 1. GOD ſhews the ſinner ſomething of his own <hi>Majeſty and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> his right to command him and give law to him, the perfect righteouſneſs and ſanctity of all his laws, and his power and reſolution to judge him according to his Law. 2. GOD ſhows him hence the <hi>moral Evil</hi> of Sin, the rebellion that is in it againſt his Authority, the Enmity in it to his holineſs, the preſumption and inſolence, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and baſeneſs there is in it, and its aurſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, guilt deſert and obligation to puniſhment. 3. GOD ſhews the Sinner the <hi>natural Evil,</hi> (i. e.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002421_0016_0FDC050189ACD650"/>the <hi>Curſe</hi>) which is the fruit of ſin; the Evil that purſues it, the wrath and vengeance that is due to it, and hangs over the ſinners head. The ſinners eyes are opened to behold the troops of preſent <hi>outward evils</hi> and miſeries, Judgments and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which Sin brings upon men in this life, and which are concluded in <hi>bodily death.</hi> And the ſinners eyes are yet more intently fixed up on the Threatning and Infliction of Spiritual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and <hi>Soul miſeries.</hi> He has felt <hi>Spiritual Death,</hi> and he fears and apprehends <hi>Eternal Death.</hi> He is bowed down under a curſed Nature, and feels the plague of his own heart; his woful Impotence to what is Good and Holy, yea the averſation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and loathing in his curſed Nature to it. He realiſes the ſecond Death, an Eternal damnation and perdition, in the fire of Hell, and under the burning wrath of a holy GOD for ever. And now at laſt, 4. GOD ſhews the ſinner <hi>a way of deliverance</hi> from the guilt and curſe of ſin, and from its rule and power. He ſhews him the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> which is <hi>CHRIST the LORD;</hi> what he <hi>has done</hi> to ſave him; how glorious the Salvation by him is, both in the manger of the <hi>Impetration</hi> of it, and in its <hi>affects;</hi> and how the Attributes of GOD (his Wiſdom, truth, holineſs, juſtice, grace and mercy) are together glorified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the Juſtification of the repenting Sinner. GOD ſhews the Sinner that there is but this one way of Salvation for him, and <hi>that there is Salvation in no other;</hi> nor on any other terms, but thoſe of the Goſpel, namely, faith in our Lord JESUS CHRIST, repentance toward GOD, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel. Upon all, 5. The <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002421_0017_0FDC0503138F6688"/>effectually impreſſes on the Conſcience of the awakned Sinner the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of repenting, and the <hi>Importance</hi> of it; and cauſes the ſinner to ſee his own periſhing ſtate, and the infinite felicity and glory of a pardoned ſtate and hereby He conquers, conſtrains &amp; brings over the Soul to <hi>an infinite deſire of Grace to repent,</hi> and turn from all Sin to GOD; which deſires when created by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD in the Soul are by his power and of his mercy bro't into act, and fulfilled in the Soul. Sometimes this is effected more deliberately and in form; ſtep by ſtep; ſometimes more ſuddenly, as the light that ſtruck <hi>Saul</hi> down on the way, and the Voice that call'd to him, ſet him inſtantly a trembling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, praying and determin'd him for CHRIST. Sometimes the ſinner is wro't upon effectually by the <hi>Word</hi> alone, ſometimes by the <hi>rod</hi> together with it; and uſually the Judgments both of GOD's mouth and of his hand concur in his <hi>effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS GOD in renewing a Sinner to repentance brings him to attend and hearken to the voice of Reaſon and Conſcience enlightned by the revealed word. Hence the <hi>Work</hi> is GOD's, if men do repent; and the <hi>fault</hi> is mans if he do not repent, and GOD is every way juſtified whether men repent or not. The Sinner is of himſelf wilfull and obſtinate; ſhuts his eyes and ſtops his ears, blows out the candle of the LORD within him, won't uſe his reaſon, won't hearken to, nor conſider of the things that are ſpoken by the <hi>Lord</hi> unto him. If he would but hearken to his own Reaſon and Conſcience, judging by the Word he would repent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002421_0018_0FDC050A9B3E03A8"/>
I come now to the third, and laſt <hi>Propoſition,</hi> which is.</p>
            <p>PROP III. <hi>THAT GOD condeſcends to reaſon and argue with men for this very end, to bring them unto repentance.</hi> Come now and let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>HE reaſons in the Word and by it.</hi> The ſum and ſubſtance, ſcope and argument of the written Word is <hi>this.</hi> This is the thing propoſed in the whole Revelation of GOD's will, his Law and Goſpel. The Doctrines, precepts, promiſes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, hiſtory and examples of both Teſtaments, agree and concur in this; the reducing Sinners unto GOD by JESUS CHRIST, to a ſtate of Grace and pardon here and of glory hereafter. The ſcope of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is to command, perſwade, invite us to be ſaved; and to deter, affright and earneſtly dehort us from the ways of ſin and death. The whole of Divine Revelation to us conſpires at laſt in thoſe words of the prophet, Ezek. 18.23, 31. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God? and not that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his ways, and live? Caſt away therefore all your tranſgreſſions; whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrae?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD reaſons with ſinners unto this purpoſe <hi>by his providential dealings with them and towards them.</hi> Theſe have a voice, and <hi>cry</hi> to us, <hi>and the men of wiſdom will hear the ſame.</hi> Theſe back and confirm the Word, call it to mind and fix it in the memory; ſtrike the low ſenſe of feeling: <hi>Put
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002421_0019_0FDC050C144577E8"/>forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his fleſh.</hi> Firſt by his Goodneſs, GOD would lead the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to repentance; and then by his Judgments he would excite and drive them thereunto. And while he <hi>chaſtens</hi> by his rod, he <hi>teaches</hi> the Soul by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> out of his <hi>Law.</hi> As <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſet <hi>Joah</hi>'s field on fire to bring him to him, after he had once and again ſent to him, but he would not come; ſo GOD ſends Judgments and Corrections when he can't prevail by the more gentle methods of lenity and mildneſs Indeed this is a <hi>harſh</hi> way of reaſoning, but a <hi>neceſſary</hi> one, and too often <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual;</hi> I <hi>have ſtricken them but they have not grieved.</hi> But it is a proper and <hi>effectual</hi> way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; <hi>He openeth their ear to diſcipline and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> Proud and obſtinate ſinners will not be brought to the foot of GOD without this ſeverity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD reaſons with ſinners <hi>by his Miniſters in the Word preached.</hi> Miniſters argue and reaſon the caſe with ſinners in GOD's name and ſtead, from his Word. So <hi>Paul reaſoned before Felix of temperance, righteouſneſs and the Judgment to come,</hi> till his guilty Soul was fill'd with <hi>trembling;</hi> and again in a more mild and ſvaſive manner of ſpeech he <hi>almoſt perſwaded Agrippa to be a Chriſtian.</hi> By the preaching of the Word it is that GOD addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, applies, appeals to and reaches the hearts and Conſciences of men; while the <hi>Preacher</hi> opens and applies the Doctrines, precepts, promiſes and threatnings of the Word. 2 Cor. 5. <hi>ult. Now then we are Ambaſſadors from Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us: we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 12.1. <hi>I beſeech
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002421_0020_0FDC050DF2CA3280"/>you therefore Brethren by the Mercies of God, that you preſent your Bodies a living ſacrifice.</hi> We ſhould chuſe out our Words to reaſon with men; to plead with them on GOD's behalf; and as <hi>Elibu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, ſo ſhould thoſe that hear the word be able to ſay to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> Job 32.11, 12. <hi>Behold I waited for their words, I gave ear to their reaſons, whilſt you ſearched out what to ſay. Paul</hi> was a rational preacher, and a powerful one: Acts 17.2. <hi>As his manner was he reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures on the ſabbath days, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered and riſen from the dead,</hi> Acts 18.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. GOD reaſons with ſinners <hi>by every Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Monitor and Admonition to them.</hi> Be it by more private perſons, or in a more private way: Be it in a brotherly Conference, or by diſputation of friends; in whatever is ſaid that is good unto the uſe of Edifying and fitly ſpoken, a word drop'd in ſeaſon to us; as we are bid to <hi>exhort one another daily,</hi> and to teach and admoniſh one another. But eſpecially the Authoritative Inſtructions, reproofs and counſels of Parents, Tutors, Maſters and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, or any Superiors under whoſe care &amp; watch we are placed, theſe ſhould be eſteemed GOD's Reaſoning with us. Job 13.6. <hi>Hear now my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD reaſons with ſinners <hi>by the voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within them.</hi> This is a <hi>power</hi> that has light and authority, is endow'd and commiſſion'd to plead for GOD. We muſt <hi>judge within our ſelves</hi> what is right and good; in many Caſes. And <hi>if our heart condemn us God is greater than our hearts.</hi> Thus in reading and hearing the word, and under
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002421_0021_0FDC050F14132130"/>Providences both gracious and judicial, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men are touch'd and awakened; and they riſe up and ſpeak to the ſinner for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to repentance.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, GOD reaſons with ſinners <hi>by his Holy Spirit, ſtriving with them.</hi> From of old we know that he <hi>ſtrives with man.</hi> And he only can reaſon effectually, convincingly, with man. He is the Divine Teacher come from CHRIST, to work ſayingly on the Souls of Sinners by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Providences. He can reach the Conſcience, command the Soul, and ſpeak with Authority. <hi>None teacheth like him;</hi> none <hi>can</hi> enlighten, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, convert and ſave a Soul beſide him. He, the <hi>former</hi> of the Spirit is the <hi>Searcher</hi> of it; and the mind, the will, the affections and Conſciences of men are under his immediate notice &amp; cogniſance. He is the <hi>Divine Author</hi> of Grace in us, the Father of ſpiritual-light and giver of it. He is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincer</hi> of ſin, and the <hi>Comforter</hi> of penitents. <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling</hi> is his bleſſed Work, <hi>whereby convincing us of our ſin and miſery and enlightneng our minds in the Knowledge of Chriſt, and renewing our wills, he doth perſwade and enable us to embrace Jeſus Chriſt, as he is offered to us in the Goſpel.</hi> Pſal. 143, 10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, thy ſpirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightneſs.</hi> The weapons of our warfare are mighty <hi>thro' him,</hi> to pull down ſtrong holds caſt down Imaginations and every high thing, and to bring into Captivity every tho't to the Obedience of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> To this end he waits and reaſons and ſtrives <hi>long</hi> with Souls, and does it <hi>ſtrangly;</hi> he overcomes the wills and hearts of men, but offers no Violence to them; <hi>making them willing in the day of his power.</hi>

THUS GOD deals with us as with rational Creatures in his Endeavours to bring us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and would ſinners hearken to the reaſonings of his Word and Spirit in their hearts they would repent; and for this End it is that he reaſons with them.</p>
            <p>USE,</p>
            <p>AND now to apply what has been ſaid, briefly, See</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Condeſcention and grace</hi> of GOD to us, as well as his <hi>Equity and righteouſneſs,</hi> and let it <hi>affect</hi> us with Admiration, thankfulneſs and love; that he ſhould <hi>reaſon</hi> with worms, with rebels and traitors, to reduce them to himſelf, to their duty and happineſs. And O the <hi>patience</hi> and forbearance of GOD to us! how <hi>long ſuffering</hi> is he in his waiting on us, and purſuing with his gracious <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. O ſee and be <hi>aſtoniſh'd at the Obſtinacy and hardneſs of man,</hi> and what an unreaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, incorrigible Creature he is become: That he ſhould <hi>need</hi> to be ſo reaſoned with, &amp; be <hi>no more</hi> prevailed on by the Reaſonings of GOD with him. Surely we are more bruitiſh than the very <hi>beaſts,</hi> have not the underſtanding of a man, and have loſt their <hi>Inſtinct</hi> of ſelf-preſervation. As our Context has it, <hi>Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed &amp; brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the aſs his maſters crib: but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>YE fools and blind,</hi>—as our LORD ſaid once to ſome; beſotted and deſperately mad; blinded by Satan, and led by him at his will, leſt the light
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002421_0023_0FDC051987ACDBE8"/>of the knowledge of the glory of GOD ſhould ſhine unto them. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid it is hid unto them that are loſt.</hi> And what a <hi>Hell</hi> will the reaſon and Conſciences of Sinners create unto them in the moſt direful reflections on their own obſtinacy and frenzy thrô the days of Eternity! Mark 9.44. <hi>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> Prov. 1.24. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Uſe</hi> may be <hi>to congratulate the penitent on the wiſdom he ſhows,</hi> the <hi>good underſtanding</hi> he manifeſts. The fear of the LORD that's wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding. The penitent Sinner acts a wiſe part. He hearkens to GOD in his Word; he attends to the voice of his own Conſcience; he fears and turns from Sin; <hi>He inclines his ear to Wiſdom, and applies his heart to underſtanding; he underſtands the fear of the Lord, and finds the knowledge of God; now he regards diſcretion and his lips keep knowledge: He forſakes the fooliſh and lives, and walks in the way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>HOW willingly, fervently &amp; unweariedly ſhould Miniſters reaſon with Sinners, labouring their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Converſion to GOD:</hi> from Sabbath to Sabbath, from houſe to houſe, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, reproving rebuking, exhorting with all long-ſuffering and doctrine; beſeeching, entreating in the meekneſs and gentleneſs of CHRIST. They ſhould be apt to teach, and fervent in ſpirit; and mighty in the Scriptures, skilfull in the Word and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002421_0024_0FDC051B065713D0"/>Doctrine; to lay before men the guiltineſs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of their natural ſtate, to open aright the curſed nature of Sin, to diſplay before them the riches of free Grace from the doctrines and promiſes of the Goſpel, to draw the Beauties of <hi>a Crucified JESUS</hi> before the eyes of Sinners; to reaſon with them, upon the Neceſſity and Benefit of a timely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to ſet the Threatnings of GOD in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray againſt the Impenitent. But O what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſdom and divine Learning, both in the letter and ſpirit of Scripture, both in the Word and ſaving Work of GOD, is neceſſary hereunto! What application alſo and diligence in ſtudy, in prayer, in Watching over and labours with our own hearts! Prov. 11.30. <hi>He that winneth ſouls is wiſe, and the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>LET every one reaſon with himſelf.</hi> Stand in awe and commune with thy own heart; hear GOD's reaſonings, and uſe thy own reaſoning faculty. Uſe it while he continues to ſpeak to thee; to ſtrive with thee; for this will not be always. <hi>Should not our hearts burn within us, while he is ſpeaking to us on the way?</hi> Conſider what he ſays, and the LORD give you an Underſtanding; an eye to ſee, an ear to hear, and a heart to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and retain his words.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to conclude all,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>O hearken to the Reaſonings of GOD! Hear and your ſoul ſhall live.</hi> Hear him for <hi>his</hi> own ſake, that he may have glory from thee. Hear him for <hi>thy</hi> own ſake, for it is in tender pity to thy poor Soul that he argues with thee. Hearken to him for <hi>CHRIST's</hi> ſake, for it is Wiſdom's Voice, He
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002421_0025_0FDC052403C23820"/>whoſe Delights from Everlaſting were with the ſons of men: Prov. 8.4, 5. <hi>Unto you O men I call, and my voice is to the ſons of men; O ye ſimple under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand wiſdom; and ye fools, be ye of an underſtanding heart. Hear, for I will ſpeak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips ſhall be right things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>O beg of GOD this understanding heart;</hi> beg of him an Obedient ear and will; pray for a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience, and for holy Affections: beg of GOD to give thee his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and to renew a right Spirit within thee; entreat him not to leave thee, nor to ceaſe ſtriving with thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>GIVE up thy ſelf to Him,</hi> to be taught and ruled by him, enlightned and ſanctified and led by him. Yield an unfei'ned Aſſent and Conſent to all he ſays; and ſay, —<hi>All that the Lord our God has ſaid unto us, we will do and be Obedient.</hi> Yield up thy whole Soul to his bleſſed Word as to a <hi>Mould</hi> to receive the bleſſed <hi>Form</hi> it would ſtamp upon thee. With <hi>Mary</hi> ſit at <hi>JESUS</hi> feet to hear his words; and ſay with <hi>Saul</hi> when the <hi>Light</hi> from Heaven ſtruck him, and the <hi>Voice</hi> from Heaven called to him; <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>
