            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in our Text, with great Engagedneſs of Affection, excites and ſummoneth all around him to give to God the Glory of his Goodneſs, to praiſe and thank God for his wondrous endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mercy to his Church and People in Particular: That <hi>God's Mercy endureth forever</hi> is the Burden of this devout and affectionate Song of Praiſe, which being frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, adds Beauty and Energy to it, as well as ſerves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the thankful Notice we ſhould take of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of divine Goodneſs, and to ſhew how much we ſhould be fill'd with <hi>Wonder,</hi> and fir'd with <hi>Gratitude</hi> when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the long Continuance thereof, to us guilty worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Creatures. But in the mean Time, ſingular Inſtances of divine Mercy, loudly call for our moſt intenſe and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgments, and this ſeems to be the Senſe and Scope of the Words that I have now choſen to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>But to make them eaſier to be underſtood, and prepare them for Improvement, let us enquire.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>What are the Wonders of Mercy which Almighty God does ſometimes work for his Church and People.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>What that Thankſgiving is which we ſhould offer to God upon ſuch Occaſions.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:005499_0003_1018408854A9B7F8"/>V. <hi>Wherein appears the Reaſonableneſs thereof.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But before I proceed to anſwer the Queſtions propos'd, I ſhall beg leave to premiſe theſe few Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Mercy,</hi> as to its general Nature, is Kindneſs vouchſafed to the miſerable, and that a <hi>Wonder of Mercy</hi> is ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Inſtance of Kindneſs; to Effect which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goes out of the ordinary Road of his providential Proceedings with Mankind: They are therefore call'd Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, becauſe being of an extraordinary Nature, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and are wont to excite Wonder or Admiration in thoſe that behold or hear of them. But I proceed to anſwer the</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Enquiry, which is this, <hi>What are the Wonders of Mercy which Almighty God works for his Church and People?</hi> And here more generally let it be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, That the Almighty hath diſappointed great and deep Plots, artfully formed againſt his Church. Thus when <hi>Haman</hi> as cunningly as cruelly contriv'd the utter ruin of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation, and that under the falſe Pretext of their not keeping the King's Laws, it pleaſed <hi>Jehovah</hi> to baffle his Deviſe effectually, and that by a ſmall but ſurpriſing Incident, one Night the King could not reſt till he had read in the Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Loyalty in diſcovering a treaſonable Conſpiracy againſt his Life (<hi>Eſt.</hi> vi.) This effectually overſet the whole Scheme, which iſſued in the Deſtruction of proud and invidious <hi>Haman,</hi> ſo that he was hang'd on the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows he had prepar'd for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> the mark of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Rage. (<hi>Eſt.</hi> vii. 10)</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance much like this we have in the Caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Nobles that wanted to ruin him, knowing that they could not find any Occaſion againſt him, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it were concerning the law of his God, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contriv'd to get a Law enacted which they knew he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005499_0004_1018409B4F8F71B8"/>
could not conſcientiouſly comply with, in order to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as a Rebel for Neglect: But how wonderfully did the bleſſed God overturn this Deviſe, and make it a mean of promoting the Ruin of its Contrivers: The Lord ſent his Angel and ſhut the Lyons Mouths that they hurt not the Innocent, but they break the Bones of the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. (<hi>Dan.</hi> vi.)</p>
            <p>The Deliverance of <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> Plot deſerves everlaſting Remembrance. As cruel <hi>Nero</hi> wiſh'd that the whole City of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one Neck that he might cut it off at a Stroke. So the bloody <hi>Papiſt's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to burn up at one dreadful Blaſt the Flowers and Strength of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that ſo the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Zion being deſtroy'd, the whole might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an eaſy Prey to their Teeth: But how wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was this Hell hatched ſanguinary Scheme detected by a Letter ſent to one of the Nobles, who was a Member of Parliament, diſwading him from going to Parliament by this Argument, <hi>viz. That they ſhould meet with a Blew and not ſee the Hand that gave it;</hi> which the King reading, apprehended that there was a Deſign to blow them up by <hi>Gun-Powder,</hi> and therefore wiſely ordered the Cellars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and near the Parliament Houſe to be ſearched, upon which the monſtrous Traitor <hi>Faux,</hi> was found with the dark Lanthorn in his Hand, ready to kindle the dreadful burning Train. O amazing Mercy of God! O in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>andous Cruelty of <hi>Papiſts!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. God hath wrought wonderful Deliverances for his Church and People in the following Manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By ſmall Means, thus the Stars in their Courſes fought againſt <hi>Siſera;</hi> the Enemies of <hi>Joſhua</hi> were ſlain by Hail, and the <hi>Meabites</hi> with the Sun ſhining on Water: And did not the Almighty break to Pieces the <hi>Spaniſh Armado,</hi> which they vainly call'd <hi>Invincible,</hi> after all their proud
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005499_0005_10184089DE7B63F8"/>
Boaſts of bringing us into a State of Slavery. Was not <hi>Deborah,</hi> tho' of the weaker Sex, raiſed up by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Deliverance of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation from a State of Bondage? As King <hi>Aſa</hi> juſtly obſerv'd, <hi>It is nothing to the Almighty to ſave by many or by few.</hi> As the Mariner Turns a great Ship by a ſmall Helm, ſo does the Almighty ſometimes perform great Works by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Inſtruments. How ſurpriſing, was the Victory which <hi>Gideon</hi> gain'd over the vaſt Hoſt of <hi>Midian,</hi> by a few Hundreds of Men lighting of Lamps and breaking of Pitchers? Surely <hi>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong.</hi> He that girds on his Harneſs ſhould not boaſt as he that puts it off! All Events are under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Controle.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Sometimes God delivers his Church and People without Means, and this is ſtill more amazing: Behold when there is no Interceſſor, then doth his right Arm bring Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The very Night after <hi>Rabſhakeh's</hi> Blaſphemous Boaſts, an Angel ſlew one hundred and fourſcore and five Thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 35.) After <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> had made a Vow to ſacrifice all the Chriſtians in the Empire upon his return from the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, it pleaſed God to give him a mortal Wound, which made him acknowledge that the <hi>Galilean</hi> had overcome him.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Sometimes God compaſſes the Deliverance and Benefit of his Church by contrary Means, <hi>out of the Eater comes forth Meat, and out of the Strong Sweetneſs,</hi> which is an amazing Inſtance of his Almightineſs. Thus the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Oppreſſion in <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Mean of their Increaſe in it, and Deliverance from it, the more they were afflicted the more they grew. (<hi>Exo.</hi> i. 12) It is an old and a true Proverb, That <hi>the Blood of the Martyrs, is the Seed of the Church. Julian</hi> was well aware of this, and therefore he left off Perſecuting the Church, not out of Mercy, but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005499_0006_1018409EE4C54CB0"/>
Envy, leaſt ſhe ſhould be thereby increaſed! But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Almighty doth ſometimes reſtrain the Malice of Men againſt his Church, that it ſhall not go that Length they would have it. <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxvi. 10. <hi>Surely the Wrath of Man ſhall praiſe thee, and the Remainder of Wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</hi> The Almighty bounds the Envy of Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as he does the proud Surges of the angry Ocean, <hi>thus far they may come and no farther.</hi> The Almighty put a Hook in the Jaws of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and a Bridle in his Lips, ſo that he was obliged to return by the Way he came aſhamed, after all the blaſphemous Boaſts of his inſulting Miniſter <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> xix.)</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another Wonder of divine Mercy to the People of God is this, that the Almighty ſometimes ſtills the Rage of Wicked Men againſt them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxv. 7. <hi>Which ſtilleth the Noiſe of the Seas, the Noiſe of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</hi> And hence it is ſaid elſewhere, that <hi>When a Man's Ways pleaſe the Lord, he will make even his Enemies to be at Peace with him.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi> came forth with an angry Intention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the Almighty ſoon ſmooth'd his ſurly Brow, that inſtead of killing him, he kiſſed him; and therefore we are told that Jacob <hi>ſaw the Face of Eſau as the Face of God. i. e.</hi> He ſaw the gracious Hand of God in that ſuddain Alteration in his Brothers Aſpect.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. The Almighty ſometimes repays into the Boſoom of his Church's Enemies, the Evils they deſign'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do to her: Some Inſtances of this Kind have been already given, to which let theſe be added, <hi>Pharoah</hi> thought to have deſtroy'd <hi>Iſrael</hi> by purſuing them into the Red Sea, but inſtead of this, he and his Hoſt were drowned in the mighty Waters! <hi>Abithophel's</hi> Plot againſt <hi>David,</hi> prov'd his own ruin. The cruel Emperor <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who endeavour'd to deſtroy the Chriſtians entirely, was conſum'd

with Lice. Time would fail to enumerate the particular Wonders of Mercy that have been ſhew'd to the People of God, and that both as to Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>What elſe is the Converſion of every Sinner to God, but a wonder of Mercy; and eſpecially of ſuch as are of the groſſeſt Kind? Hereby Brands are pluck'd out of the Burning and made Monuments of pure and glorious Grace.</p>
            <p>And is not the Preſervation of every one, or their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in a State of Grace, a Wonder of divine Mercy! <q>Grace in the Heart, ſays Biſhop <hi>Hopkins,</hi> is like a Spark of Fire in the Ocean expos'd to the Violence of the Winds and Waves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea Wonders of divine Mercy have appear'd in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lives of Gods People. Famous <hi>Du Moulin</hi> in the Time of the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> was preſerv'd by a Spiders weaving her Web acroſs the Mouth of the Oven where he lay hid. And the Proteſtants who were beſieg'd in <hi>Beziers</hi> in France, were deliver'd by a drunken Drummer, who going to his Quarters at Midnight rang the Alarm Bell. But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Propos'd, which was to ſhew <hi>when God generally works Wonders of Mercy.</hi> And that is</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. When a Spirit of Prayer is given to the People of God <hi>Pſal.</hi> cii. 13, 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have Mercy upon Zion, the ſet Time to favour her is come</hi> (why) <hi>thy Servants favour the Duſt thereof, thou ſhalt regard the Prayer of the deſtitute and not deſpiſe their Prayer.</hi> Before God confers Mercies, he gives a Spirit of Prayer to ask them, but when this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd it is an awful Sign of approaching Judgments.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. When Gods People are brought low, and all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Helps fail, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 36. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his People, and repent himſelf concerning his Servants, when he ſeeth that their Power is gone, and that there is none ſhut up
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005499_0008_101840A1D36FEFD8"/>
or left, in the Mount of Extremity the Lord is ſeen;</hi> witneſs <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the Red-Sea; after the Bricks were doubled <hi>Moſes</hi> came for their Relief, and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> were every way encompaſſed at the Red-Sea, they ſaw the Salvation of God!</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. When God's Truth and Glory are much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then he will exert his Almightineſs, leaſt his Name ſhould be prophan'd, and his Honour inſulted. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 22. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I do this, but for my Holy Names Sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly, When a compleat Deliverance can be effected, an Inſtance of this we have in the Story of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they were ſuffered to go into the great Deeps, that there they might be buried in a watry Grave!</p>
            <p>Again another Time is when the Enemies of God's People breath forth the greateſt Rage againſt the Church of God. When <hi>Saul</hi> was going on in this Plight to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he was <hi>ſtruck down at once to the Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add that another Seaſon is, when God can get moſt Honour upon his Enemies, and moſt Honour from his Friends. Had <hi>Hamans</hi> Plot been cruſh'd in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, the Church would have been protected, but God's Glory would not have been ſo much made manifeſt. And therefore the Lord ſuffers his Enemies to go on ſometimes a great Way, and bring their cruel Councils to ripeneſs for Execution, before he blaſts and breaks them!</p>
            <p>And when the People of God are much diſtreſs'd before they get Deliverance, their Senſe of the Mercy is heightned, and their Praiſes for it enlarg'd! The</p>
            <p n="3">3d. General Head comes now to be diſcours'd upon, which was to ſhew, <hi>Why God does ſometimes work Wonders of Mercy for his Church and People.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. One Reaſon is, that not only thoſe to whom the Mercies are vouchſaf'd may praiſe him; but alſo that the Generations
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005499_0009_1018408F88BA40C0"/>
to come may truſt in him and obey him. This was the happy Iſſue of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance at the Red-Sea, <hi>They fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and believed the Lord, Ex.</hi> xiv. 31. <hi>David</hi> improv'd his memorable Deliverance <hi>from the Jaws of the Lyon, and from the Paw of the Bear,</hi> to ſtrengthen his Expectation of future Mercies, and Deliverance from future Dangers; and the Apoſtle us'd the ſame Method, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 10. <hi>He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from ſo great a Death, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> And did not the Jewiſh Church tread in the ſame Path? <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxii 4, 5. <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers truſted in thee, and thou didſt deliver them.</hi> And from this bleſſed Topick ſhe elſewhere pleads for Deliverance. <hi>Iſa.</hi> li. 9, 10. <hi>Awake, awake, put on Strength, awake as in the Antient Days, art thou not he that wounded the Dragon, who dried up the Sea, and made the Deeps a Way for the ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs over?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. To make his Glory illuſtrious, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 27. <hi>I ſaid I would ſcatter them into Corners and make the Remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them ceaſe among Men, were it not that I feared the Wrath of the Enemy, leſt they ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely, and ſay our high Hand and not the Lord hath done all this.</hi> Thus vainly vaunted railing <hi>Rabſhakeh!</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. <hi>Where are the Gods of</hi> Sepharvaim, Hena, <hi>and</hi> Ivah, <hi>of</hi> Hamath <hi>and</hi> Arpad? <hi>Have they deliver'd</hi> Samaria <hi>out of my Hand, that the Lord ſhould deliver</hi> Jeruſalem! This Argument <hi>Moſes</hi> urg'd to prevent the threatn'd Deſtruction of <hi>Iſrael. Num.</hi> xiv. <hi>If thou kill this People, the Nations will charge thee with Weakneſs.</hi> Jehovah doth great Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a great God, his Name and Nature are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore his Works are ſo! Every one does, or ſhould do, Works ſuited to their Quality and Character. <hi>Magnos magna decent.</hi> When <hi>Alexander</hi> met with a great Difficulty he thus encounter'd it, <hi>jam periculum par animo</hi> Alexandri. Here is Danger equal to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Bravery.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005499_0010_101840A4C1B12AA0"/>
And wondrous Works do not only ſuit a God, but make his Name glorious among the Nations, thus it was in reſpect of the Judgments inflicted upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> —</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another Reaſon is the Relation that God bears to his People, together with the Promiſes he has made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Benefit and their Dependance on him. He is their Father and will he not have Compaſſion on his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſurely Property excites Care, he has promiſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, <hi>And that no Weapon form'd againſt them ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Munition of Rocks ſhall be their Defence, he that dwells in the Secret of the moſt High, ſhall be under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Almighty.</hi> He has promis'd to ſupport them, and to make their Bread and Waters ſure. He has promiſed to deliver them out of Trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> l. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi>—Iſa. xliii. 3, 4. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy Ranſom,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for thee, I have ſav'd thee, therefore will I give Men for thee, and People for thy Life.</hi> Jehovah will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſink many Nations in Ruins, than ſuffer his poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to periſh! Moreover they truſt in God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not be confounded, for Truſt engages Jehovah's Care. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Propos'd, which was to ſhow <hi>what Thankfullneſs for God's Mercies includes,</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It includes high and honourable Thoughts of them in our Minds,—frequent reflecting upon them, and grateful Senſations for them. —</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It includes our extolling God with our Lips, and giving him the whole Glory of his Works of Mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſacrificing to our own Net, but on the contrary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our utter Unworthineſs of them in the leaſt Degree.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It includes our living the Praiſes of God, &amp; hoping in his Word, for future Mercies. The</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005499_0011_10184091489B6A38"/>5th. Propos'd comes next to be conſider'd, which was to ſhew, wherein appears the Reaſonableneſs of Thankſgiving for every Mercy, and more eſpecially for ſignal Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof? And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. There is ſome Diſpoſition deeply engraven in the Human Nature to expreſs Gratitude for Benefits receiv'd. <hi>Do not the</hi> Publicans <hi>ſo,</hi> ſaid our Lord? <hi>Lycurgus</hi> obſerv'd, <hi>that it is a prodigious Thing not to repay a Benefit!</hi> Yea even ſome of the Brute Creation expreſs a kind of Gratitude, <hi>the Ox knoweth its Owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib;</hi> and therefore we ſhall be worſe than Publicans, Pagans and Beaſts if we neglect it!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is moſt juſt and equal. He unjuſtly asks a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, who is not inclin'd to requite it. The leaſt Mercy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Acknowledgment, and how much more Wonders of Mercy. Seeing that our Being and all our Benefits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from God, it is but reaſonable that we ſhould return a Tribute of Praiſe for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly It is a delightful Duty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxxxv. 3. <hi>Praiſe the Lord for it is good, ſing Praiſes to his Name for it is Pleaſant.</hi> Indeed it is the ſweeteſt Duty on this ſide Heaven, and the neareſt Reſemblance of the continued Employment of the glorious Inhabitants of that bleſſed Place.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It is profitable, and hence the Lord Jehovah ſays, <hi>that he that offereth Praiſe glorifieth him, and that to him who ordereth his Converſation aright, will be ſhewn the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God.</hi> I proceed to the Improvement of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which ſhall be only in a uſe of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O give Thanks to the Lord of Lords,</hi> to him that is above all Princes and Potentates, and earthly Nobles, <hi>for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth ever. To him alone who doeth great Wonders, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Let God alone be the ſupream Object and Center of our Praiſe, for he it is that over rules all Events.

of God to the Proteſtant Churches in general, and to the Britiſh Zion in Particular: Bleſſed be the Lord that he has brought us out of the myſtical <hi>Egypt</hi> of Popery, and that he has delivered us from the Armies of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heshbon,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan!</hi> All Glory be to God the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, for delivering <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh Armado,</hi> and the <hi>Gun-Powder Plot,</hi> that <hi>infernal Device!</hi> And for ever Bleſſed be the Lord for delivering the Nations from Popery and Slavery, by the coming of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> afterwards King WILLIAM, of glorious Memory! O what a Bleſſed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of marvelous Mercy was that! And let us my dear Brethren, thank God with all our Hearts for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne! What unſpeakeable and precious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, dear Sirs! do we enjoy under the mild and auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reign of our preſent gracious Sovereign King GEORGE? And therefore what Malignity and Madneſs muſt poſſeſs thoſe Spirits who want to revolt from ſuch a Government, which is temper'd with Lenity and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, and equally Protects the civil and religious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all! Neither ſhould the late memorable Victory at <hi>Dettingen,</hi> which it pleaſed a gracious God to give to the Britiſh Arms over the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> be paſſed over with Silence and Negligence. O the unſpeakable Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heaven in covering the Head of our indulgent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in the Field of Battle, when with intrepid Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he expos'd his naked Boſom to the deſign'd malignant <hi>Gallick</hi> Shot! What paſſionate Gratitude do we owe to the King of Kings for preſerving ſo important a Life, in ſo perilous a Juncture! But that which has eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to ſpeak upon this Subject at this Time, is the News we have of a Victory obtain'd in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>

It is God! it is God alone! my Brethren, that has wrought this wondrous Mercy for us, and to him be all the Glory! <hi>O give Thanks to the Lord, for his Mercy endureth forever!</hi> Conſidering our great abuſe of Mercies both Spiritual and Temporal, it is a Wonder that God has not given us up as a Prey to the Teeth of our Enemies! O let us exalt <hi>Jehovah</hi> with all our Hearts, and not forget his precious Benefits! Let us Thank him after the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>'s Example, and pray to God that he would be pleaſed to perfect this begun Deliverance! Let us avoid Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the one Hand, and ſinful Diffidence on the other; and hoping pray, that he who has and does deliver, will yet deliver us from Popery and Slavery: And let us live agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theſe wondrous and important Mercies of God, which may God grant for CHRIST'S ſake!</p>
            <p>Our God hath diſappointed the deep Plot of the Courts and Conclaves of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo artfully form'd, and ſo cloſely conceal'd in order to deſtroy at one fatal Stroke our civil and religious Liberties!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath brought the Wind out of his Treaſures, and ſcattered the Squadrons of our Enemies; ſome he hath buried in the mighty Waters, like their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who were purſuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>That mighty God who bounds the turbulent Ocean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its proper Limits by a girdle of Sand, has graciouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Check to the Romiſh Rage by the Winds, and put a Hook in the Jaws of thoſe haughty and ſanguinary <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheribs,</hi> that they ſhould return by the Way they came, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, without Succeſs!</p>
            <p>Our God hath repaid, in ſome Meaſure, into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of his Churchs Enemies, the Evils they deviſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, as in the Caſes of <hi>Pharaoh, Haman, Ahithophel, Senacherib, Julian,</hi> and <hi>Domitian!</hi>
