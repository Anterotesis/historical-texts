            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, turn from their Evil, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter, 1. We have a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> to deal with a People as He pleaſeth, under the <hi>Parable</hi> or Similitude of a <hi>Potter</hi> and his <hi>Clay,</hi> ver. 1,—6. If the Potter hath power over his yellow Clay to faſhion it as he will; ſurely that God, who hath given being to us and all Creatures, may diſpoſe of us as ſeemeth good in His ſight, Rom. 9.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002958_0004_0FE6A61D2C4CE588"/>20, 1. <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay—?</hi> 2. God ſhews that in his Dealings with Nations, He acts as a <hi>righteous Judge;</hi> yea as a God gracious and merciful, <hi>ver.</hi> 7,—10. At what inſtant—God ſpeaks againſt a People when He threatens to bring deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Judgments upon them, and 'tis implied that this is for their Sins, whereby they tranſgreſs His holy Laws: This is the ground of the Controverſy. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are here aſſur'd that tho' a ſinful People give God cauſe to come out againſt them, ſo that if He ſhould mark iniquity they could not ſtand; yet He is not wont to deal with them in a way of rigorous Juſtice; but firſt threatens and warns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He comes out againſt them to deſtroy them: Yea, that if they take the Warning, and turn from the Evil of their Sins unto unto Him; God will alſo repent of the Evil of Puniſhment He threatned to bring upon them, and ſtay His Hind. Not as if God chang'd His Mind, or alter'd His Decree. No! He is the Almighty, All-wiſe, and Unchangeable God. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not</hi>—Mal. 3.6. God is of one mind, and who can turn Him? God can do nothing but what is worthy of His infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002958_0005_0FE6A5E8B699C0B0"/>and therefore He can't Repent in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>The Strength of Iſrael will not Repent</hi>— He is not a Man that He ſhould Repent. However, God is ſaid to Repent, ſpeaking after the manner of Men, when He changeth His way, and the Courſe of His Providence towards a Perſon or People, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Jon</hi> 3.10. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, the Expreſſion here us'd intends that God would not execute the Judgments denounced, nor bring the threatned Evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; but <hi>e c.</hi> would return unto them in a way of Grace and Favour. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, God ſhews that His Promiſes of proſpering and eſtabliſhing a People are Conditional, ver. 9, 10. <hi>If it do Evil, I will repent of the good</hi> — God will ſtop the Courſe of His Mercies, and walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them. Now the due Obſervance of theſe Rules would help us to underſtand the Juſtice, Truth and Equity of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Diſpenſations towards His ancient People, and others. 3. We have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the foregoing Diſcourſe with an <hi>eſpecial Application</hi> to God's Covenant People the Jews, ver. 11,—17. In which the <hi>Prop et</hi> is commanded to declare to the Men of <hi>Judah,</hi> that God was framing Evil againſt them; and then to call them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment of life, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. But their obſtinacy in ſiuning is foretold,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002958_0006_0FE6A61D479D3800"/>and they are upbraided with their folly in forſaking their Covenant God, <hi>ver.</hi> 13,—15.4. We have an account of the People's deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate reſolution to plot miſchievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices againſt <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> becauſe he faithfully delivered God's Meſſage to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>ad ſin.</hi> And then an Imprecation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which the Prophet was not acted by an evil ſpirit of perſonal Revenge: He deſir'd not the <hi>woful Day;</hi> but by the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>BUT to return to the Text, from which, and as related to the Context, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD is wont to Threaton a People, and give them Warning before He brings Deſtroying Judgments upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>IF they Repent of the Evil of their Sins, and turn from them to the Lord; God will alſo Repent, and not bring the threatned Evil of Puniſhment upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>BUT if a People when thus Threatned go on obſtinately in their Sins, they may expect that God will bring His Deſtroying Judgments upon them till they are made Deſolate.</hi>

AT what inſtant I ſpeak, to pluck up — God utters His Voice in dreadful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings before He gives the fatal blow. He cauſeth the Woe-Trumpets to ſound before He pours out the Vials of His Wrath. Thus God threatned the Sinners of the Old World, and yet ſpared them One Hundred and Twenty Years before He brought the Flood upon them to deſtroy them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3,—7 In which time <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and the building the Ark a ſign. Yea the great Prophet and Teacher, our LORD JESUS CHRIST, is ſaid to Preach to thoſe Sinners, whoſe Spirits are now in Priſon, 1 Pet. 3 19, 20 <hi>By which alſo he went &amp; preached unto the ſpirits in priſon: Which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

God early denounc'd dreadful Threatnings againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Revolt and Apoſtacy, Lev 26.14. — 34. — <hi>If ye ſhall deſpiſe my ſtatutes —I will ſet my face againſt you, and ye ſhall be ſlain before your enemies.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>And if ye work contrary to me — I will bring ſeven times more plagues upon you — your Land ſhall be deſolate &amp;c.</hi> And thus God ſent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

                  <hi>Jonah</hi> to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> tho' they were not his peculiar Covenant People, with that Meſſage, Chap 3.4. — <hi>Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be overthrown</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, God had ſpating Mercy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for them. Now, God doth thus threaten, and ſpeak againſt a People,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>IN and by His Word.</hi> Herein God's Wrath is reveal'd from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men. God threatens His degenerate People by His Word in the mouths of His Miniſters, Hoſ. 6.5. <hi>I have hewed them by the prophets, I have ſlain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> Tho' Men were the Inſtruments in Writing, or Pronouncing theſe Threatnings; yet they wrote and ſpake as mov'd and inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And therefore this Word is to be received not as the Word of Men; but as indeed it is the Word of God. <hi>Thus faith the Lord.</hi> And this Word of God abideth in full force and virtue throughout all Generations, 1 Pet. 1.24, 5. <hi>All fleſh is as graſs</hi> — <hi>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> It not only concerns thoſe to whom it was nextly directed; but all to whom it comes, and they may <hi>aſſure</hi> themſelves that if their Caſe be the ſame it will take place on them. Rom. 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning.</hi> And thus
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002958_0009_0FE6A5F385F861A0"/>the Puniſhments recorded in Scripture, are ſaid to be <hi>our Examples,</hi> — 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. In them we do as in a <hi>figure</hi> behold the truth and faithfulneſs of God in fulfilling His Word. Sinners muſt therefore realize it that the Threatnings of God's Word are denounced againſt them as truly as if their Names were mentioned. <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi> And if they continue impenitent they ſhall find it ſo in the Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God, when as many as have ſinned <hi>in the law,</hi> ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by the law,</hi> i. e. the written Word. Rom. 2.12. All muſt <hi>hear what the Spirit faith to the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2.7.</p>

Anſw. 1. IT ſuppoſeth, <hi>That they are truly and generally Convinc'd of the Evil and Danger of their Sins.</hi> Sin is the worſt of Evils: the <hi>wages</hi> of it is <hi>Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. But alas! Such is the Power of deceitful Luſts, to blind Mens minds, that they flatter themſelves in their own Eyes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.2. Agreably there is a woe denounced againſt thoſe that <hi>call Evil Good, and Good Evil;</hi> that put Darkneſs for Light — <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. Wicked Men whoſe underſtanding is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have wrong notions of God, of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in their Practical Judgments, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the gratification of their Luſts before the enjoyment of God. The old Man is Corrupt according to Deceitful Luſts; ſo that while a Perſon or People are under the governing influence of Sin, they do not make a right Judgment concerning the Nature and pernicious Conſequences of this Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evil. But when God gives them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he ſends his Spirit to Convince them of Sin, making them to ſee and know that it is, <hi>an evil and bitter thing that they have forſaken the Lord their God.</hi> Such a people, are brought to conſider and realize it, that they have Diſhonoured God, and Wounded themſelves, by their Iniquities. God ſays to them. Thou haſt <hi>fallen by thine Iniquities,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1. Thou haſt deſtroy'd thyſelf; and his Word is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002958_0014_0FE6A62862D651D8"/>carrying Light and Conviction with it, when ſet home by his Spirit. So that they are brought to ſay, as Job 33.27. <hi>I have ſin'd, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not.</hi> Yea, they are convinced that this is the procuring Cauſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities they ſuffer, and are brought to determine it muſt be forſaken, or it will be their ruin. Before they might be ready to attribute their Miſeries to other Cauſes; but now God makes them know that their Iniquities have ſeperated between them and their God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2. His Voice to them is that, Jer. 4.18. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee, this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart.</hi> And they are made ſenſible that Sin is the accurſed thing which troubleth them. Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as this is given by the Spirit of God, commanding the Bleſſing on the Calls of His Word and Providence, when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple attend to this great Duty of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The ſaving Convictions made on God's Children are reviv'd; ſo that they awake out of their ſleepy frames, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come active and vigorous in promoting the neceſſary Work of Reformation. Others have good Impreſſions made upon them, which the Spirit of God faſtens and makes preparatory to ſaving Converſion. And
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002958_0015_0FE6484469768468"/>tho' there may be many at ſuch a time that fall ſhort of this; yet even of theſe there are not a few who are ſo convinced in their Conſciences of the evil and danger of Sin, that they outwardly Reform, and do many things
<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark 6.20.</note>. Deſtruction from God is ſuch a terror to them that they dare not commit thoſe groſs Sins which they before allowed themſelves in
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2.20.</note>, nor omit thoſe Religious Duties they before liv'd in the neglect of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT ſuppoſeth that <hi>they inwardly grieve and mourn for their Sins whereby they have diſhonoured and provoked God.</hi> In true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Sin which was before lov'd and delighted in, is loathed and hated; and inaſmuch as it is an evil preſent, this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is expreſſed in hearty Sorrow upon the account of it, 2 Cor. 7.10. <hi>Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row worketh Repentance.</hi> The true Penitent mourns heartily becauſe he hath offended ſo great and glorious, ſo good and gracious a God, by his Iniquities. He looks unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Compaſſionate Saviour, conſiders how his Iniquities have pierced Him, and kindly relents, yea mourns bitterly. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably it is Prophecied, that when God would pour out the Spirit of Grace upon the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jeruſalem; They ſhould look upon him whom they had pierced, and mourn, as one
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002958_0016_0FE6A5DBA1B31340"/>mourneth for an only ſon</hi>—, Zech. 12.10, 12. The Land ſhall mourn—. And this is what God calls his backſliding People to, Joel 2.12, 13. <hi>Therefore now ſaith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rent your heart and not your garment, and turn unto the Lord your God.</hi> Agreably, when a People are bro't to Repentance, there's a general Mourning and Sorrow upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Sins; they are affected with grief, and their Souls are wounded within them under the terrible Apprehenſion of the evil and danger of Sin. And tho' all do no not mourn after a <hi>godly ſort,</hi> becauſe they have offended God, and vexed. His Holy Spirit; yet there are many who do thus <hi>ſigh and cry for all the abominations done in the midſt of them,</hi> Ezek. 9.4. And others have Sin ſo imbittered to them, that they can't take pleaſure in it, as they us'd to do; but abſtain at leaſt from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Commiſſion; ſo grievous are the pains, and ſo ſore the wounds of their Conſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WHEN a People are Penitent, <hi>they Confeſs their Sins before the Lord, &amp; ſolemnly engage to forſake them.</hi> Such a People do not ſeek to cover and extenuate their Sins; do not go on to juſtify themſelves, and complain of God, as if he dealt hardly with them. As they, Ezek. 18.25. Ye ſay,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002958_0017_0FE6A5D89527C968"/>
                  <hi>the way of the Lord is not equal.</hi> But they juſtify God in all the Evils He brings upon them, and acknowledge that they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed leſs than their Iniquities deſerve. Thus they give Glory to God, when they Repent, taking ſhame and blame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Accordingly, this is named as one ingredient of Repentance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40. If they ſhall <hi>Confeſs their Iniquity,</hi> and the Iniquity of their Fathers—. And we find that God's ancient People attended this duty when brought to Repentance, Judg. 10.10. <hi>And the children of Iſrael cried unto the Lord, ſaying, we have ſinned againſt thee, both becauſe we have forſaken our God, and alſo ſerved Baalim.</hi> And thus the Seed of Iſrael ſtood and <hi>confeſſed their Sins,</hi> — Neh. 9.2. When this good Spirit prevails among a People, they will be ready to confeſs with <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to them, my God: for our iniquities are increaſed over our head.</hi> And with <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.5. <hi>We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled by departing from thy judgments.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>O Lord, righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of faces, as at this day.</hi> ver. 8. <hi>O Lord, to us belongeth confuſion of face: to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> Their Petitions for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002958_0018_0FE6A62CC2FFF990"/>and Favour will be accompanied with ſuch penitent Confeſſions: yea, they will ſolemnly <hi>engage to forſake their Sins</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have diſhonoured and provoked God. When God is pleading the Quarrel of His Covenant with them, they will not only confeſs their Violations of it; but alſo, as they may be call'd, be ready afreſh to enter into God's Covenant and Oath, that they will forſake thoſe Sins which appear to be the Sins of the times wherein they live. Thus God's People did on a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Fast,</hi> Neh. 9.38. <hi>We make a ſure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and write it, and our princes, levites, and prieſts, ſeal unto it.</hi> Chap. 10.29. <hi>They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entred into a curſe, and into an oath to walk in God's law, which was given by Moſes the ſervant of God, and to obſerve and do all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord our God, and his judgments, and his statutes.</hi> And in particular, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to watch againſt ſome Iniquities that had prevail'd among them. Agreable to this, A <hi>Venerable Synod</hi> of our own have obſerv'd, <q>We ſeldom read of any Solemn Reformation, but it was accompliſhed this way, as the Scripture doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and teſtify
<note n="†" place="bottom">Reſult of Synods, p. 112.</note>.</q> I would here ask leave with all humility to expreſs my deſires that this Duty might be again ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002958_0019_0FE6A5F4D96ED958"/>attended by theſe Churches. But to return, All I ſhall further ſay under this Head is, that where Repentance is ſincere, our Confeſſion of Sin will be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,</hi> flowing from an afflicting ſenſe of the diſhonour done to God, and an hearty deſire to give Glory to Him. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſuch is not extorted, as <hi>Judas,</hi> when under the rack of a tormenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> Mat. 27.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A Penitent People humble themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God's Threatnings, and Submit to Him.</hi> The pride and ſtubbornneſs of their Spirits are ſubdued, that they dare no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God, being convinced of the truth of that Word, <hi>Wo to him that ſtriveth with his Maker,</hi> Iſai. 45.9 They now fall down at God's foot, and reſign themſelves to His Sovereign Will, being ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the puniſhment of their Sins, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be reconciled to God upon His own terms, Lev. 26.41. —<hi>If then their uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed hearts be humbled, and they then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the puniſhment of their iniquity.</hi> Such a People are of a broken and contrite Spirit under the Tokens of God's diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſubmit to Him, and are more concerned to have their Sins and God's Anger removed, than to be delivered from outward Calamities. Before they might refuſe to receive Correction; but now they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002958_0020_0FE6A64CDECD44E8"/>can ſay with <hi>Ephraim, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed</hi>—, Jer. 31.18. They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Yoke God lays upon them, and humble themſelves under His mighty Hand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Penitent People <hi>Turn from their Evil Ways, and Return to the Lord their God.</hi> Thus a People's Repenting is expreſs'd in the Text by <hi>turning from their Evil,</hi> i. e. the Evil of Sin, which is the worſt and the only Evil that ſtirs up God's holy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>against</hi> a Perſon, or Nation. The true Penitent not only confeſſeth, but alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his Sin. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. There's a turning from Sin in inward <hi>Averſion</hi> to it, and an hearty endeavour to put it far away as the abominable thing he hateth. Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, Repentance is called Repentance <hi>from dead works, Heb.</hi> 6.1. i e. Sins, which are dead Works; for they proceed from the body of Death in us, and if perſiſted in, end in Death. Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death. Accordingly, it is not enough that a degenerate People ſanctify Faſts, confeſs their Sins, and promiſe Amendment. No! they muſt forſake them and reform, or they do not Repent, Ezek. 14.6. <hi>Say unto the houſe of Iſrael, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Repent and turn your ſelves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</hi> There muſt be a fixed Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by the help of God, to abandon our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002958_0021_0FE6A5E777AFE3D0"/>Sins, and this muſt be put in execution: The Wicked muſt forſake their Thoughts, and evil Ways. As the Children of Iſrael, <hi>put away the ſtrange gods</hi> from among them, and ſerved the Lord: and His Soul was grieved for the miſery of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 10.16. We muſt not hold faſt our Iniquities, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to let them go; but muſt break off our Sins by Repentance. We muſt in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places ſeriouſly engage in the Work of Reformation. <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> in their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt lead in this neceſſary Work, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Authority to ſuppreſs thoſe Evils which threaten the Deſtruction of their People, as they provoke God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them; they muſt endeavour to turn away Wrath, by being a Terror, not to Good Works, but to the Evil. Thus King <hi>Joſiah, put down the Idolatrous Priests, &amp;c.</hi> 2 King. 23.4, 5. The <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> muſt in their Places bear due Teſtimony againſt the Sins of a backſliding People, Iſai. 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſin. lieads of Families</hi> muſt endeavour to put all Iniquity far from their Tabernacles; and put <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution in practice; As for me, and my Houſe, <hi>we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Particular Perſons muſt be ſenſible of the Plague of their own Hearts, and ſeek to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002958_0022_0FE6A62CE2908E78"/>God their Saviour to convert and heal their Souls. In a word, the <hi>Body of a People</hi> muſt hear and obey God's Voice, in Iſai. 1.16, 17. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your ways and doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, Learn to do well</hi> —. It was ſaid even of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> Jon. 3.10. <hi>God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way</hi>—. I would hope ſome of them were ſo taught the knowledge of the true God, and of the only way of Salvation by the promiſed Meſſiah, that they ſincerely repented, and were eternally ſaved. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there muſt be, as there was among them, an outward prevailing Reformation of thoſe hainous Evils for which God threatens Deſtruction. And upon this, we find God hath ſpar'd a finful People; as the <hi>Nenevites;</hi> and His Covenant People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> delivering them from thoſe publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which threatned their ruin; tho' it appear'd afterwards by their ſpeedy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, when the Judgments were removed, that the generality of the People were not thoroughly reformed, not ſted faſt in God's Covenant. Upon the account of which, God again and again turn'd againſt them, and puniſhed them ſeven times for their Iniquities. So that in order to a People's obtaining laſting Peace in the enjoyment of God's eſpecial Favour and Bleſſing, it is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002958_0023_0FE6A5F8B3C75F00"/>needful that they be generally ſincere in their Repentance, &amp; thorow in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. In which there is an hearty Turning from all known Sin, as it is contrary to the revealed will &amp; declarative Glory of God, and a returning to that One God, who is the Father the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, as to our higheſt End and chief Good; as to our Lord and Portion; to walk in His Ways, and keep all His Commandments, 1 Kin. 8.48. <hi>And ſo return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their ſoul.</hi> There muſt be ſuch a Repentance <hi>towards God,</hi> Act. 20.21. Such a turning to the Lord, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.21. if we wou'd hope, as a People, to enjoy the continued ſhines of God's face, and the peculiar Tokens of His favour. The Power of Godlineſs muſt take place among us in the general Eſtabliſhment of pure and undefiled Religion, in Doctrine, Worſhip and Manners. Now, ſuch a Repentance and Reformation as this, muſt be the eſpecial <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> poured out upon a People, in His Divine Gifts and Graces, Ezek. 36.26, 7. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them. And ye ſhall dwell
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002958_0024_0FE6A630BAD2EDF0"/>in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God. I will alſo ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes, and I will call for the corn, and will increaſe it, and lay no famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increaſe of the field, that ye ſhall receive no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of famine among the heathen. Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for your abominations. Not for your ſakes do I this, faith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be aſhamed and confounded for your own ways, O houſe of Iſrael. Thus ſaith the Lord God, in the day that I ſhall have cleanſed you from all your iniquities, I will alſo cauſe you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes ſhall be builded. And the deſolate land ſhall be tilled, whereas it lay deſolate in the ſight of all that poſſed by.</hi> Chap. 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my ſpirit upon the houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> The Spirit of God is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of the ſaving Bleſſings purchaſed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. O that this comprehenſive Bleſſing might be beſtow'd on us, and the whole Iſrael of God!

LEARN that <hi>GOD's ways are equal, and his dealings with Nations, as well as particular Perſons, are Righteous.</hi> Though God is Sovereign, God over All; yet He doth not uſe an Arbitrary Power, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereignty in Puniſhing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men. No! <hi>The Judge of all the Earth doth right:</hi> He proceeds in Judgment according to known and eſtabliſh'd Rules of Righteouſneſs, and makes it appear that Juſtice and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.14. God could Appeal to his People. Ezek. 18.25, — 29. <hi>Hear now, O houſe of Iſrael, Is not my way equal? Are not your ways unequal? When a righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done, ſhall he die. Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002958_0026_0FE6A5F8D66C8E08"/>that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive. Becauſe he conſidereth, and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. Yet ſaith the houſe of Iſrael, The way of the Lord is not equal. O houſe of Iſrael, are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal?</hi> Yea, when God was about to Deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> He ſays, ſpeaking after the manner of Men, Gen. 18.21. <hi>I will go down now, and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</hi> And righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was remarkably deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Overthrow. There's none of God's Diſpenſations towards the Children of Men, but what may be fairly accounted for from a due Conſideration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works which God at firſt entred into with <hi>Adam,</hi> "not only for himſelf, but for his Poſterity"; of the Covenant of Grace, and of the State of Mankind, as the World is under the Government of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man-Mediator. If there be any perplexing Difficulties to us, theſe muſt proceed from the darkneſs and weakneſs of our own minds. God's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is like the great Mountains, even when his Judgments are a great Deep. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. Let us then give God the Glory of his Juſtice and Rectoral Holineſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002958_0027_0FE6A5FB54FE7F18"/>that he is clear when he judgeth. And let not Sinners take up Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt God, as if he dealt hardly with them; But rather Condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in a believing Penitent manner, ſeek to be Reconcil'd to him, for <hi>he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciſul, and repenteth of the Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which leads me to</p>
               <p>USE II. <hi>LET us all be Exhorted to Repent, and turn to the Lord, that He may Repent of the Evil, and Spare us.</hi> God is this Day Calling us to Humble ourſelves under his Amazing Judgment, whereby He threatn'd to ſend us down quick into the Pit, when he terribly ſhock the Earth. And what reaſon have we to fear before Him, when we conſider our many provoking Sins, and the Tokens of God's Anger in the Courſe of His Providence? God hath known us above moſt of the Families of the Earth, and therefore may Viſit us for our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which have been committed againſt ſhining Light, and Covenant Bonds. There hath been great Contempt caſt on Jeſus Chriſt, and His great Salvation, while many have appeared to prefer the World, and their Luſts before Him: Great Oppoſition to the Spirit of Grace, while formality in Religion hath ſadly prevailed; yea
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002958_0028_0FE6A630D64C6F60"/>many have been profane and vicious, God's Ordinances, His Houſe, His Day, have not been valued as they ſhould have been. There have alſo been Scandalous Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties found among us, as Injuſtice, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Intemperance, Uncleanneſs, &amp;c.— And alas? we have ſeem'd, till this late ſurpriſing Providence, to be in a dreadful meaſure unconcern'd under our Sins, and the awful withdrawments of God from us. Few comparatively have appear'd to lament after the Lord, and to ſtir up themſelves to take hold of a departing God. Nor have we been duly Affected with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſpenſations of Divine Providence, in which there hath been a wonderful mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Judgment and Mercy. I might here remind you of ſome of them. God hath drawn the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Wilderneſs to plead the quarrel of his Covenant; but now grants us a good meaſure of <hi>Peace</hi> and Quietneſs. He hath threatned &amp; afflicted us with Scorching <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Drought;</hi> and yet in a good meaſure <hi>ſpar'd</hi> and recover'd the <hi>Fruits of the Earth.</hi> He hath ſent mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in ſome places, and loudly call'd to us to be <hi>Ready,</hi> by Repeating <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Deaths</hi> in an extraordinary manner; and yet we now enjoy <hi>general Health.</hi> The God of Glory hath utter'd his Voice in <hi>Terrible Thunders,</hi> and threatn'd to Conſume
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002958_0029_0FE6A5FB6B85BD28"/>us by the <hi>Flame</hi> of his devouring Fire; And yet the <hi>Lives</hi> of his People have been <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> in his ſight. He viſited us with a <hi>violent Storm</hi> by which we ſuſtain'd conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Damage; And yet much <hi>ſparing Mercy</hi> was extended towards us, as to our Lives and Eſtates, by Sea and Land. And the day following, which was the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> God ſet his <hi>Bow</hi> in the Cloud, a <hi>Token</hi> of his Covenant, <hi>that he will not again deſtroy the Earth with a floud.</hi> Gen. 9.13, — 16. And if we conſider the Day, and the fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity we had of attending the Means of Grace after the Storm, we may in ſome ſort behold our Glorious Saviour with a <hi>Rainbow</hi> about his head, as he appear'd to <hi>John</hi> in a Viſion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. And thus, there appear'd a Rainbow round about the Throne, 4.3. "Whereby is fitly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented God's Covenant of Grace with his Church, that namely, notwithſtanding all the ſtorms and rempeſts of perſecution and other troubles they muſt encounter with in this unſteady World, yet he will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to Periſh, as God ſpake once of the Waters of the Deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dutch Annotations.</note>. God might in this bright Appearance give us a Token for Good, that in Judgment he will remember Mercy; and may we not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002958_0030_0FE6A63903A15240"/>humbly hope his Voice to us is that, Iſa. 54.9. <hi>For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the earth; ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi> Wroth, "To wit, ſo as I have been, or ſo as to forſake thee utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly"
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pook.</note>. However, as we were not reform'd by theſe Things, God hath more lately Viſited us with an <hi>Amazing ſhock of an Earthquake,</hi> which Providence appears ſtill more wonderful, now that we hear there was a terrible ſhake of the Earth at <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> near Two Thouſand Miles diſtant from us, about Thirty Six Hours before. God then threatned to deſtroy us ſuddenly, and yet ſpared us in His great Mercy, tho' the Earth trembled, yet was it kept by the ſame Almighty Hand which ſhook it, from Opening and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us up. We were <hi>perplexed, but not in deſpair; caſt down, but not deſtroyed.</hi> Or, whatever diſmal Apprehenſions many might have of ſudden Deſtruction, <hi>God's thoughts were not our thoughts</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. 55.8, 9.</note>; but as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo did he magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his Mercy in the Article of our extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; Indeed in this Judgment God hath ſpoken againſt us, and yet he earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002958_0031_0FE6A606E07BFE88"/>us ſtill, and gives a ſpace for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, while ſome places are alarum'd by repeated Shakes and Noiſe. And is not this the Voice of God's Providence to us; <hi>If ye turn from the Evil, I will repent of the Evil</hi> — and that of our Lord and Judge, Luk. 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Let us then be Exhorted earneſtly and ſpeedily to engage in this neceſſary Work, Seeking to God in the Name of Chriſt, to pour upon us his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And certainly, we ſhould take Encouragement, when we hear, that God hath Sanctified theſe extraordinary means together with the diſpenſation of his Word, to make good impreſſions on many. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, few, if any can remember the time when People were ſo generally Awakened, and brought to ſay with trembling, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Act. 16.29, 30.</note>. O let us then lift up the hands that hang down, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue inſtant in Prayer to the God of all Grace that He would by His Spirit carry on this Work 'till a ſincere Repentance and thorough Reformation be wrought among this People. Nor ſhould the ſenſe of our great Sinfulneſs and Unworthineſs diſhear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten us; but excite us to have the more
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002958_0032_0FE6A6391A63F758"/>entire dependance on the Merits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 5.12.</note>. His Blood cleanſeth from all Sin; it is of Vertue ſufficient to cleanſe a Nation, Thouſands and Millions, as well as one ſingle Perſon. For, <hi>It is the Blood of God,</hi> Act. 20.28. In Chriſt Jeſus there's a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain open'd to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin, and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13.1.

Let ſuch then as are ſenſible of the Guilt of their numerous &amp; hainous Tranſgreſſions, come and receive the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God. Let ſuch as are ſenſible of the power and pollution of their Sins, come, and receive the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt, to renew and ſanctify them. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will let him take the water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 22.17.</note>. And is not the Day near when the Fountain now mention'd ſhall be in a ſignal manner opened in the extenſive Preaching of the Goſpel, and the abundant Effuſions of the Spirit of Grace, ſo that many Nations ſhall be ſprinkled, yea waſhed from their Sins; when <hi>all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and the receiving of them ſhall be Life from the Dead to the Gentiles! See Rom. 11.15, — 26. Let us then pray and wait; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

            <p>DOCT. I. <hi>GOD is won't to Threaten a People, and give them warning, before. He brings Destroying Judgments upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. II. <hi>IF ſuch a People Repent of the Evil of their Sins, and turn from them to the Lord; God will alſo Repent, and not bring the Threatned Evil of Puniſhment upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER this Second Doctrine we inquir'd, <hi>What is implied in a People's Repenting of the Evil of their Sins?</hi> An Anſwer hath already been given to this Inquiry. We therefore proceed to ſhew.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>IF a People, when Threatned, thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, God will alſo Repent, and not bring the threatned Evil of Puniſhment upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN God threatens a ſinful People with Deſtruction, there's yet a Reſerve of Mercy. The Threatning is not ſo abſolute as to leave no place for Repentance, Jer. 36.2, 3. <hi>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have ſpoken unto thee againſt Iſrael, and againſt Judah, and against all the nations from the day I ſpake unto thee, from the days of Joſiah, even unto this day. It may be that the houſe of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their ſin.</hi>
                  <q>The Omniſcient God could not be at a loſs about the Event; but this is ſpoken of the All knowing God after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men, to ſhew how acceptable to Him true Repentance is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Truth will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and duly weigh the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT will appear, if we conſider <hi>the gracious Promiſes and Declarations of God's Word.</hi> There are great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to the Penitent by the true God. Indeed God hath not abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd particular Perſons temporal Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002958_0037_0FE6A60890E103B0"/>from this or the other publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, tho' they truly Repent. Job 9.22. <hi>He destroyeth the perfect, and the wicked.</hi> Eccl. 9.2. <hi>There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</hi> However, God often ſets a <hi>viſible mark</hi> of His Favour upon ſuch, when He is coming out againſt a Degenerate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in deſtroying Judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. And if at any time He bring the temporal Evil upon them, He ſanctifieth it, &amp; makes it work together for their good
<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 8.28.</note>. God doth not puniſh ſuch as an Enemy, in a way of vindictive Juſtice; but Chaſtiſeth them as a merciful Father, for their profit. And no tribulation or <hi>diſtreſs ſhall be able to ſeperate them from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">ver. 35—39.</note>. Nor may a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent People expect to be delivered from all kinds of Calamity: While Sin remains, there will be Sorrow. But then, they ſhall not be plucked up and deſtroyed, the Evil here threatned. No! They ſhall continue a People before the Lord. He will dwell among them, be their God, and own them for his People. And the Affliction they ſuffer ſhall be ſanctified to ſeperate them from their Sins; and not be ſent in Wrath for their Deſtruction. Iſai. 27.8, 9. <hi>He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002958_0038_0FE6A64452CF3368"/>eaſt wind. By this therefore the iniquity of Jacob ſhall be purged, and this is the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi> And thus God ſpeaks very graciouſly concerning them that were carried Captive with <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> Jer. 24.5,—7. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord the God of Iſrael, like theſe good figs, ſo will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have ſent out of this place into the land of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans for their good. For I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land, and I will build them, and not pull them down, and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: for they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> And as for the Church and People of God in the firſt and pureſt times of the Goſpel, they were <hi>perſecuted</hi> indeed, but not <hi>forſaken; caſt down,</hi> but <hi>not deſtroy'd.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.9. The Spirit of God, and of Glory reſted on them, and the trial of their Faith was more precious than Gold. The Church flouriſhed like the <hi>Palm tree,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her preſſures, of which it is obſerv'd, "the more it is preſs'd down, the more it grows." What was ſaid of God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> may be applied to them. Exod. 1.12. <hi>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</hi> Thus it was in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002958_0039_0FE6A60FC8399358"/>a Spiritual ſenſe. Vaſt numbers were born to God; the Blood of <hi>Martyrs</hi> being made by God the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Church

Lev. 26.41, 2 — <hi>If then their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity: Then will I remember my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Jacob, and alſo my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the land.</hi> Iſai. 58.6,—8. <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yoke.

Acts 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002958_0040_0FE6A64468EFDBC0"/>of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord your God ſhall call. Chap.</hi> 3.19. By ſuch good words as theſe doth God encourage His People to Repent and turn to Him. Now we are aſſured that 'till Heaven and Earth paſs, <hi>one jot or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law till all be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS appears from <hi>the Proviſion made for true Penitents in Jeſus Chriſt, and from the Constitution of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> God hath made abundant Proviſion for the Salvation of His People in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath offer'd a Sacrifice of Atonement for the Congregation of His People, who look to Him by Faith, mourn for their Sins, and turn from them unto the Lord. Agreably, <hi>Aaron</hi> was commanded to offer a <hi>Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for the People, with the blood of which he was to <hi>make Atonement</hi> for all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Lev. 16.15—17. Thus on the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Atonement</hi> they were to afflict their Souls, and offer an Offering made by Fire unto the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.27. Thus, tho Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>Paſſover, and ſprinkle the Blood upon the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts—that the deſtroyer might not come into their houſes.</hi> Exod. 12. Which things did prefigure <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Lamb of God which
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002958_0041_0FE6A5DB8A740298"/>taketh away the ſin of the World</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 1.19.</note>. And we are hereby taught that ſuch as do in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving penitent manner look unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhall find mercy with God. God will ſay of them, ſpare them from going down to the Pit, I have found a ranſom. And tho' it be true, that none ſhall receive the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting benefit of Chriſt's Sacrifice, but ſuch us heartily receive the Lord Jeſus, mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their ſins with a godly Sorrow, yet the Body of a People fare the better on temporal accounts, and God will not deſtroy them, where ſuch a frame of ſpirit is found prevailing among them. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.6. — 10. And this is plain from the nature and tenor of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, in which God gives encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, not only to ſingle Perſons, but alſo to His People to Repent, that their Sins may be blotted out, and their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not be their ruin. Jer. 31.31, — 36. <hi>Behold, the days come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah: Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which my covenant they brake, although I was an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto them, ſaith the Lord,) But this ſhall
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002958_0042_0FE6A645A4DEEB48"/>be the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greatest of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſin no more. Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the ſun for a light by day, and the ordinances if the moon and of the ſtars for a light by night, which divideth the ſea when the waves thereof roar; the Lord of hoſts is his name. If thoſe ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the ſeed of Iſrael alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a nation before me for ever.</hi> Compar'd with <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.8, — 12. In which there ſeems to be a gracious promiſe of a <hi>national Converſion</hi> of the Jews, and then that they ſhould not as a People, be rejected any more. And may not the People of God in <hi>New-England</hi> hope for a Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace relating to them, that ſhall reſemble this? May we not hope that God will revive His Work among us, and not utterly caſt us off?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>WHEN a People Repent, then God's Threatnings and Judgments have the deſired
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002958_0043_0FE6A60FDEC4DC90"/>Effect.</hi> Theſe are means God uſeth to purge away the Sins of His People. When God threatens and brings lighter Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is for their Warning, that they may be reclaimed and reformed. And therefore when theſe means are bleſs'd for this end, and the Work is in ſome good meaſure effected, God will return in a way of mercy and favour. He will repent, and change the courſe of His Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a People. Now His Word <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth that which he pleaſeth, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth in the thing whereto he ſent it</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 55.21.</note>. Now the <hi>Rod &amp; Reproof gives Wiſdom;</hi> His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple open their Ear to Diſcipline, and turn to Him that ſmiteth them. And therefore God will caſt away the Rod, and ſhew Himſelf as a reconciled Father. Thus God ſaid of His ancient People, Iſai. 10.12. — <hi>When the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jeruſalem, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria.</hi> God calls the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> the <hi>Rod</hi> of His <hi>Anger,</hi> ver. 5. And threatned to ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. But then, when the Work was done for which God ſent him, then he would puniſh him, and deliver His People.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002958_0044_0FE6A645CD568D00"/>
4. THIS appears <hi>from God's Providential Diſpenſations towards His ancient Covenant People, and Others.</hi> Whatever their Sins had been, yet when they Repented, God alſo Repented of the Evil, and returned to them in a way of Favour. Thus, the <hi>Houſe of Iſrael lamented after the Lord, put away Baalim, &amp;c.</hi> And God delivered them out of the Hand of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. When <hi>Ephraim,</hi> i. e. "the Ten Tribes, or thoſe of all the Tribes that fear'd the Lord", bemoan'd himſelf, and Repented, God ſaid, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is be a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earnestly remember him ſtill: — I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31.18, — 20. Yea, when the <hi>Ninevites turned from their Evil way, God repented of the Evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not,</hi> Jon. 3.10.</p>

               <p>CONTRARIES have contrary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. Context. <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s forſaking the Lord, was to make their Land deſolate, and a perpetual hiſſing, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Deut. 28.13. <hi>If thou will not hearken unto the voice

And the Sacred Hiſtory informs us that theſe dreadful Threatnings were fulfilled upon them till they were caſt out of the good Land God had given them; deprived of their eſpecial Priviledges, and deliver'd up to an amazing Deſtruction. The Sinners of the <hi>Old World</hi> deſpis'd the Warnings God gave them by <hi>Noah,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted His Spirit.

And this might be argued from God's Juſtice, Holineſs, and His Truth in fulfilling the Threatning of His Word &amp;c.

                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002958_0046_0FE648407611A4F0"/>
FURTHER to Confirm this awful Truth, I ſhall briefly obſerve God's manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in Judgment againſt an Impeninent People that enjoy the means of Grace, and are in Covenant with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHEN ſuch a People go on Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently and refuſe to be Reformed by God's Word and Providence; <hi>He takes His griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit from them.</hi> While God threatens His People, and ſends lighter Judgments as Calls to Repentance, He alſo uſually ſends <hi>His Spirit</hi> to ſtrive with them; but aſſureth us that His <hi>Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</hi> Gen. 6.3. Accordingly when they reſiſt and vex Him, quenching His good Motions, and ſinning preſumptuouſly againſt the Convictions He gives them; as His ancient People did
<note n="†" place="bottom">Act. 7.51.</note>. God is provok'd to withdraw His Spirit from the Means they enjoy; and to ſend His Plagues upon their Hearts; and then ſuch as were blind are judicially blinded, ſuch whoſe Hearts were hard, are hardned, being given up to their own Luſts, and the Temptations of Satan. Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice: and Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts lust: and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> And now God may threaten in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002958_0047_0FE6A6123A4BDBD0"/>His Word and by His Providence; but they will not turn at His Reproof. Iſai. 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt more and more.</hi> Now that meſſage may be bro't to them, Iſai. 6, 9, 10. <hi>And he ſaid, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not: and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes: leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and he healed.</hi> It follows, ver. 11. —<hi>Till the cities be waſted without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and the houſes without man, and the land be utterly deſolate.</hi> And when God withdraws even the common Influences and Reſtraints of His Spirit, a People grow worſe and worſe under the outward means, and ripen apace for Ruin. They are as <hi>Reprobate ſilver, becauſe God bath rejected them,</hi> Jer. 6.30, All the means us'd to purge away their droſs become ineffectual. And now there is oftentimes an evil Spirit of of ſlumber and carnal ſecurity prevailing, over ſuch a People; ſo that they will <hi>not conſider their latter end, till they come down wonderfully,</hi> Lam. 1.9. And wo will be unto them, when God takes His Holy Spirit from them. As far as this Judgment is inflicted, ſo far is their Day of Grace at an end. The things of their Peace are now.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002958_0048_0FE6A64CF4BF6330"/>hidden from their eyes, and they will walk on in the paths which lead to deſtruction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3,—14.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>GOD then proceeds to take away the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances and Means of Grace from them.</hi> Theſe are the Viſible Tokens of God's Preſence with His People. Thus God ſet up His Tabernacle, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong His ancient People. But when they deſpiſed the Means of Grace, and abuſed them to harden themſelves in Sin, as if they were deliver'd to do theſe and the other Abominations, and might Sin with impunity: I ſay, when it was thus. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd theſe viſible Tokens of His Preſence and Favour, Jer. 7.9, 10. <hi>Will ye steal, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and commit adultery, and ſwear falſely, and burn incenſe unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not. And come and ſtand before me in this houſe which is called by my Name, and ſay, we are delivered to do all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> abominations?</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Therefore will I do unto this houſe which is called by my Name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shilob.</hi> The <hi>Ark</hi> was an eſpecial Token of God's Preſence; but when the Iſraelites refuſed to repent and turn to the Lord, God gave it up into the hands of their Enemies, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. The <hi>Temple</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the holy things in it, was
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002958_0049_0FE6A65851582F80"/>the great <hi>Medium</hi> of their inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; But when they boaſted of God's holy Mountain, crying, The Temple of the Lord, as if this would ſecure God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, notwithſtanding their Impenitency, God in His over-ruling Providence burnt and deſtroy'd it, firſt by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> then by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and caſt them out of His ſight. And thus God threatned the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.5. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen; and repent and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi> And what a fearful Example for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth before us, have we in this, and the other <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> once highly favour'd with the light and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>WHEN God is thus departed, and His Covenant broken, Destroying Judgments enter in, and make a People deſolate.</hi> Now the Glory and Defence of a People are gone; And there's a wide breach made at which deſolating Judgments come pouring in as an overflowing Scourge. They who have been thus highly ſavour'd, but refuſe to be the Lord's People, provoke Him to pluck them up, and deſtroy them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a People in the Earth. Thus God threatned that <hi>Ephraim ſhould be broken, that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002958_0050_0FE6A64E1BF2B578"/>it be not a people,</hi> Iſai. 7.8. And apoſtate <hi>Iſrael</hi> is forbidden to rejoyce as other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; becauſe they had gone a whoring from their God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.1. Others may for a time proſper in outward reſpects, tho' God be not their Covenant God; but when His People break His Covenant, and refuſe to return unto Him, their Civil and Religious Priviledges, their Outward and Spiritual Enjoyments have been taken away together. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the Lord, and he had rejected them, their Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution was broken, and they were ſcattered abroad to the four Winds of Heaven. How pathetically did our Saviour lament over them when He ſaw their Ruin approaching! Mat. 23 37, 8. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002958_0051_0FE6A6586AACE958"/>favour'd with the Light and Priviledges of the Glorious Goſpel? Or experienced more remarkable Deliverances in times of imminent Danger? Who have had louder Calls to Repentance in God's threatned Judgments; or more faithful Warnings by His Miniſters? And yet Iniquity abounds after all, yea Crying Sins. And do not many refuſe to return and reform? How little is there to be ſeen of that Good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which animated the <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland!</hi> Alas! By what we can learn, the power of Religion is very much weaken'd and decay'd among them, as well as among ourſelves. And may we not fear God will Viſit them with terrible Judgments? Surely we may well ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thy judgments.</hi> I ſpeak not theſe things to diſcourage any that tremble at God's Word; but that we may all be quickned to Watch and Pray, and keep our Garments. Things may ſeem to look fair; and we ought to bleſs God for the Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity enjoyed: but what ſettled Peace can be expected while ſo many Diſhonour God, Deſpiſe Chriſt, and reject the Offers of the Goſpel? While <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuch Power, and they that call themſelves Reform'd ſhew ſo little regard to Religion in the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002958_0052_0FE6A64E3383F918"/>Power and Purity of it? The Lord grant that we may not ſay, Peace and Safety, when ſudden Deſtruction cometh

God hath ſpoken in the Threatnings of His Word, and by the Rebukes of His Providence. Let us then to Day hear His Voice, and not harden our Hearts. The Lord hath rored out of Zion with a Voice which may well make us to tremble; and yet ſpare us from the threatned Deſtruction: And now ſays to us, <hi>if ye return, I will Repent of the Evil</hi>—. But threatens to bring Ruin upon us, if we go on impenitently, and refuſe to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

Our Days of Faſting and Prayer will riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us, unleſs we bring forth fruits meet for Repentance: Let us therefore take heed and beware of giving God reaſon to Complain of us as of Ephraim and Judah, Hoſ. 6.4. — <hi>Your goodneſs is as a morning-cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away:</hi> Leſt that threatning be fulfill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, Chap. 13.3. <hi>Therefore they ſhall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that paſſeth away, as the chaff that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor, and as the ſmoke out of the chimney.</hi>

Our Lord Himſelf, the great Prophet of His Church, began His publick Miniſtry with Preaching this Doctrine, Mat. 4.17. <hi>From that time Jeſus began to preach and to ſay, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd this Doctrine to the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us that he reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to the Jews and Greeks <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> Act. 20.21. He declar'd that this was their duty, and urg'd it not only upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo upon the <hi>Greeks;</hi> i. e. the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This Command is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to all that live within the Sound of the Goſpel, Act. 17.30. <hi>God now command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men every where to Repent.</hi> And the Goſpel gives us encouragement to attend this Duty, how many and great ſoever our Sins have been, aſſuring us that Jeſus Chriſt is come to call, not the Righteous but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repentance; that He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Pardon for all penitent Believers, and is exalted to be a Prince, and a Saviour, <hi>to give Repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of Sins</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Act. 5.31.</note>. The Word of God alſo aſſureth us, that <hi>whoſo confeſſeth &amp; for ſaketh his ſins,

Let us offer to God that humble Requeſt, Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner. Let us be ſenſible of the Plague of our own Hearts, and bitterly bewail the diſhonour we have done to God, and the wrong we have done our own Souls by our Sins: Let us abhor our ſelves upon the account of our Sins, and turn from them in inward hatred and averſion.

THE laſt USE may be <hi>of Conſolation to the Penitent.</hi> Be you Comforted: God will repent of the Evil, and not bring it upon you: His anger is turned away, and He will Comfort you. <hi>For thus ſaith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
