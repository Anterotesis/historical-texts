            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CONJECTURES UPON THE NATURE AND MOTION OF METEORS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>UPON ſeveral obſervations made upon ſundry Meteors, which have appeared in Europe and New-England, I have collected the following general phaenomena:</p>
            <p n="1">I. THEY appear like round balls of fire, or globes of red hot iron, or white hot iron, ready to melt, as large as the ſun or moon, in the meridian, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſurrounded with a flame which appears like a tail, with ſtreams and ſparkles net ſo bright as the body. They frequently exceed the light of the moon, and in ſome inſtances that of the ſun, ſo as to make a ſhadow in the cleareſt ſunſhine.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THESE Meteors have been ſeen paſſing through the air, at all points of the compaſs, over a ſpace of ground above 100, and ſometimes above 500 miles long, and above 100 miles wide, with an exceeding great veloſity. I could never get ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations accurate enough, to determine the velocity with any degree of exactneſs. Doctor Halley ſuppoſes it to be above 300 miles, and Doctor Pringle about 1000, in a minute. I rather ſuppoſe it does not exceed 500, for the reaſons hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To each particular perſon obſerving, who ſtands in or near the line of their courſe, they ſeem to riſe while they are coming towards him, and to fall when they are going from him, as the ſun riſes and ſets, ſeemingly at a ſmall diſtance. But by comparing the obſervations made by ſeveral perſons ſtanding a little out of the line of their courſe, at the diſtance of 50, 100, or 500 miles from each other, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that at their firſt approach or appearance they are 50 or 100 miles diſtant from the earth; then they come within 20 or 30 miles of it; and afterwards are at the diſtance of 50 or 100 miles again; which different diſtances ſeem to ariſe principally from the curvatur of the earth. Or if theſe ſeveral diſtances of any one Meteor have not been accurately determined on both ſides of its neareſt approach, yet it is evident, that ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Meteors, during the time in which they have been obſerved, have been coming nearer to the earth, and others going farther from it.</p>

               </gap>ke diſtant cannon or rumbling thunder, have been heard paſſing through the air, without any diſtinct light.</p>
            <p n="5">V. ALTHOUGH theſe Meteors, by reaſon of their extreme velocity and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, generally become inviſible in about a minute after they paſs by; and as they recede from any perſon, preſently make but a ſmall angle with the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>zon, and ſeem to be ſuddenly intercepted by horizontal clouds, houſes, &amp;c. yet there is no ſufficient evidence that any of theſe high Meteors, which have moved 100 miles or more, ever did really fall to the ground, or become wholly extinct; though after the emiſſion of ſo much of their fire in the exploſion, they are not ſo bright, and have no flame or tails.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. THESE Meteors generally appear as often or oftener than once in 20 or 30 years. Near ten of them have been ſeen in England within theſe 100 years; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur ſuch Meteors have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in New England within theſe 50 years; but as they have been generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be of the ſame nature with thunder, lightning, ſhooting ſtars, and ſuch like lower Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eors, which ſeem to have no exiſtence above two or three minutes, there have not been ſuch critical obſervations made upon them as I could wiſh may be made hereafter. Yet theſe general phaenomena, I take to be as certain as can ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be collected from ſuch ſudden, tranſient, and unexpected obſervations, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made by the lower ſort of people: And have therefore been led to conjecture a new Theory of the nature and motion of theſe high Meteors.</p>
            <p>Now to aſſign a natural cauſe or reaſon for any thing, is to reſolve it into the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral laws of nature, by which the wiſe Creator governs the world; and to ſhew its connection with other things, according to thoſe general laws by which we find the univerſe is governed, ſo far as we are acquainted with it. And the fewer laws we have recourſe to, which will ſolve all the apparent phaenomena, the greater is the probability that we have hit upon the true theory. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. IF the apparent diameter of theſe fiery globes is equal to thoſe of the ſun or moon, in the meridian, and ſubtends an angle of above half a degree, at the diſtance of 50 miles from the obſerver, then it is evident that their real diameter is half a mile at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. IT ſeems evident that theſe globes are ſolid and firm, at leaſt as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE, they preſerve their globular ſhape and motion throughout their whole courſe, and after the exploſion. For if they conſiſted only of inflammable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017113_0005_0FA02F4DA10DC2F0"/>matter, of the nature of pulvis fulminans, or a train of gun-powder, fired at one and, (as ſome of the lower Meteors ſeem to do) there would be no probability that they would inva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iably preſerve their exact globular ſhape; but would melt down, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of flame and ſound.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BECAUSE, they are ſtrong and firm enough to withſtand the force of ſo great a ſhock as is given at the exploſion. The noiſe is generally repreſented as being equal to loud thunder, a large cannon near by, or a thouſand cannon at the diſtance of 20 or 30 miles. And I ſuppoſe that a thouſand cannon fired at the diſtance of 25 miles, give juſt as loud a report as one cannon at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile. The greatneſs of the exploſion being in a ſeſquiplicate ratio of the diſtance heard

                  <p>The undulations of ſound are propagated from a ſonorific body in concave ſhells, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing very much like the blowing up of a bladder The whole preſſure of the air upon the inſide of the ſhell, is equal at all magnitudes, taking the whole ſhell together; but leſſer upon each particular part or ſpot, as it grows bigger. The magnitude of the ſound is in proportion to the ſolid content of the ſpherical ſhell; and the audibility of it (at any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſtance) is in proportion to the preſſure upon any particular part, at that diſtance. Therefore, as the ſolid content of the ſphere is to the ſuperficies, or as the cube of any number is to the ſquare of the ſame number, ſo is the magnitude of a ſound to the diſtance heard. Or multiply the diſtance by the ſquare root of itſelf, and it gives the magnitude of the ſound.</p>

And if the Meteor is about 30 miles high, where the atmoſphere is 500 times more rare than it is upon the earth, in order to produce the ſame ſound to our ears, it muſt be equal to 500,000 cannon fired upon the earth. And if this exploſion is made by an elaſtick fluid, as violent as gun powder, then the matter of this globe muſt be as ſtrong and firm as the iron of cannon, and the ſides of the ſame proportional thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is about 50 rods, in order to ſtand ſuch a violent ſhock.

For when a body is charged with it, at or near the inſtant when it is diſcharged, the ſire is retained in it with as great a force, as that with which it is diſcharged, or would ſtrike againſt another body. So that the force with which the fire goes out, by any elaſtick ſpring, or repulfive power, is impreſſed on the body it leaves. Or if it be drawn out by the attraction of ſome other body, the force of that attraction is taken off from the body it leaves, which will have the ſame effects upon it. And hence a large phial or jarr, when it is overcharged with electrical fire, will ſometimes burſt, like a bomb, and that although it was ſtrong enough to withſtand the weight or expanſion of the air, which is 15lb. on every ſuperficial inch; and ſuch a preſſure upon a ſphere half a mile in diameter, will lie above 5,000,000lb</p>

And if the exploſion of a Meteor is ſo great, when the noiſe heard is only equal to the report of a ſingle cannon near by; how great muſt it be in thoſe inſtances, where it cauſes an earthquake 40 or 50 miles round?

The round ball always runs away, and leaves the flame, tail and ſparkles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it; juſt as a cannon ball leaves the fire and ſmoke, or the nucleus of a comet runs before its tail.

Now, if we multiply the ſquare of the difference of the velocities, into the ſquare of the difference of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters, we ſhall find that the reſiſtance of the air upon the Meteor is, to that upon a cannon ball, as 17,000,000,000 to 1.

And becauſe the humming of

And the exproſion of the Meteor being repreſented to be equal to 100 cannon at that diſtance, the humming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">IV. THE great exploſion and flame attending theſe Meteors, is cauſed by the diſcharge of electrical fire, collected by the friction of the atmoſphere, and emitted about the time, or a little after, it approaches neareſt to the earth, and becomes overcharged. I ſuppoſe electrical fire is not eſſentially different from common fire, and is a kind of univerſal element diffuſed, in ſome degree, into almoſt all bodies in the univerſe, and, by friction, may be collected into a much greater quantity in ſome particular bodies: And, when the whole ſuddenly ruſhes out in one place or ſtream, it is there ſo greatly collected or condenſed, like the rays of the ſun in a focus, that it becomes common fire, capable of inflaming any combuſtible matter; and, by the extreme celerity of its motion, ſo violently agitates the air, as that its elaſtick ſpring becomes ſenſible to the ear. Common experience teaches, that when a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of viſible fire is once begun, the friction of the air upon it, at the velocity of half a mile a minute (as in the blowing of a pair of bellows) will inflame and increaſe it to a very great degree: And, therefore, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the air, at the velocity of 1000 half miles in a minute, (the force of which is 1,000,000 to 1) will collect fire where it was not begun before, or but in a low degree; as all bodies grow warm by friction: And, we find by experience, that fire is often collected by ſoft bodies, which do not make ſo great a reſiſtance as conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed air, though moved with a velocity much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, (page 231) that balls exploded in the night, out of great guns, grow h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE preceding calculation is founded upon the known laws of motion, in which we cannot be miſtaken; but we have room for different conjectures about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and periodical revolutions of theſe Terreſtrial Comets; yet we are circumſcribed within certain limits. On the one hand we muſt not ſuppoſe that their number is ſo great, or that their periodical revolutions are ſo frequent, as to exceed obſervation: On the other hand we muſt not ſuppoſe that their periodical revolutions, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diameters, are ſo great, as that, in their a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

OUR obſervations have heretofore been ſo imperfect, as that we cannot eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine minute circumſtances; but the general theory ſeems highly probable, if not certain, that theſe ſuperior Meteors are ſolid bodies, half a mile in diameter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving round the earth in long elipſes, their leaſt diſtance being about 20 or 30 miles; that, by their friction upon the atmoſphere, they make a conſtant rumbling noiſe, and collect electrial fire; and, when they come neareſt to the earth, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, being then overcharged, they make an exploſion as loud as a large cannon.</p>
            <p>I SHALL add one conjecture reſpecting the uſe and benefit of theſe Meteors.—It is poſſible that, by their violent exploſion and agitation, they may cleanſe and purify the air, and render it more ſalubrious to mankind; much more than thunder and lightning. There is an obſervation in the Phil. Tranſ. Abr. Vol. VIII, page 519, which ſeems much to favour this conjecture; it is in theſe words: <q>A Meteor was ſeen over England and Ireland, and at Venice, at the ſame time: It appeared like a great ball of fire, which burſt with an exploſion which ſhook great part of the iſland, and ſeemed to ſet the whole atmoſphere on fire.
