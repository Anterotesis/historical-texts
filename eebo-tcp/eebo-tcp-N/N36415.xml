            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> 24th day of March 1794, the brig Falmouth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from Port Royal, Jamaica, bound to Belfaſt, in Ireland, to which place ſhe belonged. At the time ſhe ſailed, the following perſons were on board:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Corran,</hi> Maſter. <hi>Francis Turner,</hi> Mate. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gilmore, John Douthard, — Boyd, — Carrol, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph York,</hi> (Mariners.) <hi>William Williams,</hi> a Cabin Boy. <hi>Joſeph Porter,</hi> a Paſſenger. And a Black Boy, Servent to Mr. Porter.</p>
            <p>Nothing material happened on the voyage, until two of the hands, <hi>Boyd</hi> and <hi>Carrol,</hi> were taken ſick, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apparently of violent fevers, the one immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other.—During their illneſs, the Captain uſed to inquire after their ſituation, and ſent frequently from the cabin both Soup and Coffee.</p>
            <p>After the death of theſe men, which happened previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of May, there appeared an apparent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the conduct of the Captain, which ſhewed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in particular inſtances of harſh treatment towards one another of the Crew, whom he charged with an intention to poiſon him and run away with the veſſel.</p>
            <p>Very ſoon after the death of the Men, they ſpoke an American Schooner, the Maſter of which Captain <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> had before been acquainted with—and who, on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had loſt two of his men, offered to ſupply him with two more. Captain <hi>Corran</hi> thanked the American for his friendſhip, but told him he would endeavour to do with the hands he had. This circumſtance appeared ſtrange to the crew, as the loſs of the men had rendered them but weak handed.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of May, he took from the Mate a Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which he had given him ſoon after their ſailing;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047599_0004_1023EF3AEC348B28"/>
and likewiſe took from him his books of navigation; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his own hands the entire navigatinn of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> the paſſenger, was in an extreme ill ſtate of health, and was ſo feeble as to be confined to his bed, which was in the ſtar board ſtateroom. In this ſituation he lay until the 24th of May, when the Mate being in the larboard ſtateroom, and the Captain and Mr. <hi>Porter's</hi> ſervant in the cabin, the Mate heard Captain <hi>Corran</hi> in warm language, abuſing Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> ſwearing that he ſhould not any longer ſtay in the ſtateroom, and ordering his black boy to go immediately and bring his maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cabin. This the boy attempted; but finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to effect it; and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> at the ſame time, begging for God's ſake that he might be ſuffered to lay where he was—the Captain entered the ſtateroom, and, with the aſſiſtance of the black boy, took Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> by force, out of his bed, and ſupporting him himſelf under one arm, and the black boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin, (he being unable to walk himſelf) and ſat him down in a chair. The Captain then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the black boy to bring out his maſter's bed, and to make it up in the cabin, upon two cheſts belonging to Mr. <hi>Porter.</hi> This being done, he compelled the black boy to lay his maſter on the bed, and then ſent for one of the top gallant ſtudding ſails, which he made a ſort of curtain to ſurround his bed. After this tranſaction, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and, going upon deck, gave a general order, that neither the black boy, nor any other perſon ſhould come into the cabin without his leave and that no perſon ſhould concern himſelf with Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> as he would take care of him himſelf.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 26th of May, about Midnight, the Captain ſent for the cabin boy; the boy came to him, and the Captain ordered him to fetch a candle; after he had brought it, he damanded of the boy where he had been—the boy replied, it was his watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: He then ordered him to ſtrip off his jacket, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he bid him go to the locker and bring him the cat o' nine tails. The boy went to the locker, and told the Captain he could not find it: He threatened to ſtrike him with a cutlaſs, if he did not find it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, the boy not being able to find it, he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

               </gap>ropped the body and ran upon deck, acquainting his companions that the Captain had murdered their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. At 4 o'clock the Captain came upon deck, and ordered <hi>Douthard</hi> to go down in the cabin, and few Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> up in a blanket, and told him that Mr. <hi>Porter's</hi> ſervant ſhould aſſiſt him, <hi>Douthard</hi> refuſing to, he ſeized him, and compelled him by force to go into the cabin. By the Captain's order, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the black boy, he laid Mr. <hi>Porter's</hi> body on one of his own blankets, ſewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a moſt ſhocking manner, there were large gaſhes about the hips, above a foot long, he was alſo much cut about the arms: The ſheet was very bloody and much clotted blood was upon the floor, near the bed. After the body was ſewn up, Captain <hi>Corran</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Douthard</hi> and the black boy to throw it out of the cabin window. <hi>Douthard</hi> told him they were not able, and requeſted his permiſſion to call another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He replied, that he would not let any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon come into the cabin to help them. On finding, however, that they were not able to effect the purpoſe themſelves, he conſented that <hi>Henry Gilmore</hi> ſhould be called. By the aſſiſtance of <hi>Gilmore</hi> the corps was brought upon deck, and laid upon a board in the gang way. From the companion door to the gang way,
<pb facs="unknown:047599_0007_1023EF06D328D4B8"/>
there was a conſiderable quantity of blood which had run through the blanket as they were carrying the body along. While the corps was lying in the gang way, the Captain came upon deck, leaned over the quarter rail, covered his eyes with his hands, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for ſome minutes much confuſed. He was rouſed from his reverie by <hi>John Douthard,</hi> who aſked him if they ſhould heave the deceaſed overboard. He ſeemed ſtartled by the queſtion, but bid them "<hi>away with him.</hi>" The body was accordingly committed to the ſea. Immediately after this, he ordered the veſſel to be kept away N. W. and ſet the ſtudding ſails.</p>
            <p>The Mate was obliged to keep out of the Captain's way, and was once forced to go into the fore top— and at other times to conceal himſelf in the hold, as he had threatened to take away his life, and had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him apparently for that purpoſe—being whenever he came upon deck, conſtantly armed with a cutlaſs and a pair of piſtols.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of May, the Captain ſent ſeveral meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the Mate, deſiring him to come upon deck, and declaring that he would not hurt him. The Mate accordingly came up the fore ſcuttle, and being afraid to go aft, remained behind the windlaſs: Captain <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> obſerving his ſhyneſs, and that his eye appeared perpetually on him, told him <hi>he kept a damned, ſharp look out:</hi> After this he went down into the cabin, and kept for a conſiderable time, hammering with a maul, whch led the crew to fear that he wanted to force out the lumber port in order to founder the veſſel. But it afterwards appeared that he was driving a great number of ſpikes into the after ſcuttle to faſten it down.—About noon, <hi>Henry Gilmore</hi> who had been ſteering, was relieved from the helm, and came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward where the Mate was, who inquired of him what courſe they were ſteering. He informed him N. W. —On which the Mate replied, that that courſe would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that the Captain had ill deſigns, both on them and the veſſel. The Mate then conſulted as many of the crew as he conveniently could, who agreed to take the firſt opportunity to ſecure the Captain. About an hour afterwards the Captain came on deck, and having
<pb facs="unknown:047599_0008_1023EF3EDED0C758"/>
walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed down the deck, <hi>Joſeph York,</hi> who was then at the helm, ſeized his arms behind, and ſtruggling with him, the reſt of the crew came to his aſſiſtance, bound him, and brought him into the cabin, where they ſecured his hands with a pair of hand cuffs which they found in his cheſt.</p>
            <p>Previous to his impriſonment, when he ordered the veſſel, to be ſteered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engliſh Channel: But on the 30th of May when the mate had got poſſeſſion of his Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and was enabled to take an obſervation, he found they were very near the latitude of Halifax, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour after they ſaw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour until four days afterwards, when they came to anchor in Roſe Bay between La Have and Lunenburgh, On ſearching for the books of Navigation, after confining the Captain, they found that he had cut out of every book the Table of the Sun's Declination.—Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their arrival there the Mate went on ſhore, and made report to the magiſtrates of the tranſaction o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> board the Brig Falmouth.—The Captain was carried on ſhore, and the Depoſitions of the people being tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, he was committed to priſon, and afterwards brought to Halifax, where the Court of Admiralty was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on Friday the 11th of July at the Court Houſe, for the Trial of this unfortunate Man, for the murder of Joſeph Porter, a gentleman who took a paſſage on board the Brig Falmouth, at Port Royal, Jamaica.— The Court being opened with the cuſtomary ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the priſoner was arraigned, and pleaded not guilty, was remanded for trial on Monday. On that day the trial commenced, and continued, by adjourment, until Tueſday, when the examination on the part of the Crown being ended—the Priſoner was called upon by the Court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence—he was again recommitted, and the Court adjourned to nine o'clock on Tueſday. On Tueſday the Court again aſſembled, and the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er having nothing to ſay in his defence, the Court was ordered to be cleared. After a ſhort period the Court was again opened and the Priſoner brought to the Bar,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047599_0009_1023EF090A49CA00"/>
when his Excellency Governor Wentworth, the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident of the Court, addreſſed the priſoner; and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Court have deliberately conſidered all the evidence which had been ſubmitted to them, were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly of opinion that he was guilty of the murder of JOSEPH PORTER. His Excellency then demanded of the Priſoner if he had any thing to urge, why ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death ſhould not be pronounced upon him. After heſitating a few moments, the Priſoner began an imperfect narration of the proceedings on board the Brig Falmouth, from her ſailing from Jamaica, paſſing over the period when the murder was committed, of which, however, he declared he was not guilty. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing further to offer, the Preſident pronounced the awful Sentence of Death upon him, and he was adjudged to be hanged on Monday the 21ſt of July, between the hours of one and two o'clock at Point Pleaſant, between the ebbing and flowing of the tide.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 21ſt of July this unhappy man, was carried from the Priſon to the Beach at Point Pleaſant, where he ſatisfied, by the forfeiture of his life, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Laws of the Country.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Narrative contains every material fact related on the Trial of <hi>William Corran</hi>; and perhaps there never was a Trial in which every witneſs called, ſo perfectly corroborated the teſtimony of his fellow. —But in the midſt of this coincidence of evidence, the mind is left at a loſs for a clew, by which to unrav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l the motive that could induce Captain <hi>Corran</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Murder, attended by ſo many aggravated circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.—The witneſſes all declared, they were unable to aſſign any reaſon—that they knew of no quarrel that ſubſiſted between him and the deceaſed, previous to the 24th of May, when he was ordered out of the ſtate room;—that previous to that period he had treated Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> very kindly—and that his uniform conduct, both in the paſſage from Belfaſt to Jamaica and on the paſſage home, until the 2d of May, had been ſuch as to give no juſt cauſe of complaint to any of them.</p>
            <p>Many have conjectured that a temporary inſanity, at leaſt muſt have been the occaſion of this horrid deed. To this conjecture every feeling mind muſt wiſh to ſubſcribe, eſpecially when the teſtimony of reſpectable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047599_0010_1023EF415C6AD760"/>
perſons who have known Captain <hi>Corran</hi> previous to this tranſaction, unite in deſcribing him as a man, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the general quietneſs and inoffenſiveneſs of his manners.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Corran</hi> was born in Ireland, in the town of Port a Ferre, in the County of Down. He was a man of middle ſtature—of a robuſt, athletick habit, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing great bodily ſtrength and activity. He was in the 32d year of his age, and has left a father, two broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and a ſiſter, to lament his untimely end.</p>
            <p>He was in this place a few years ago, being then a foremaſt hand on board a ſhip laden with Proviſions from Ireland. His activity and behaviour, were ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Captain, that before he left this port, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him mate of the ſhip.</p>
            <p>What a contraſt do the pleaſing ideas that floated in his imagination at this period of his firſt advancement in life form with the painful reflections that muſt have crowded into his mind in his laſt painful viſit to <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax.</hi> He feelingly noticed the contraſt himſelf— "Here" he exclaimed, "I was firſt made mate of a veſſel"—and heſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ating, he ſeemed by this manner as if he would have added. "Here all my worldly proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects end—here I muſt make my exit."</p>
            <p>At the mention of his father's name by a gentleman who attended him in his laſt moments, he burſt into a flood of tears, and appeared more affected by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the diſtreſs his death muſt occaſion to his parent, than he had ever ſhewn on his own account.</p>
