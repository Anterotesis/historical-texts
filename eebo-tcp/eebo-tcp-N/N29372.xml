            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

and inſulting Egyptian, he, under an impulſive preſentiment, ſlays the petty deſpot. But his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, not knowing that by him is their future deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance to be wrought, refuſe his mediation in their quarrels; and ungenerouſly threatening his life he is conſtrained to fly for refuge to the land of Midian, where generouſly ſuccouring the daughters of Jethro', he tarries in the land, and becomes the ſon-in-law of Midian's prieſt. Poſſeſs'd of true greatneſs, he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exchanges the ſplendours of a court for the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the paſtoral life; and during an exile of forty years, in undecaying vigour, partakes all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of domeſtic bliſs.</p>
            <p>BUT Iſrael's oppreſſions wax heavier, their groanings penetrate the ſkies, their God comes down to deliver them, their champion is forced from his beloved ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, he muſt now endure the gaze of the multitude, the buſtle of a court, and amidſt the toils and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a camp ſpend the reſidue of his devoted days. But he goes not a warfare at his own expence, he is commiſſioned to Pharoah, and arrayed in divine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, his rod becomes a ſerpent; it is ſtretched forth, the waters of Egypt become blood; he predicts, and murrain and blain arreſt both man and beaſt; the liſting up of his hand is more terrible than armies with banners. It is the ſignal, and reptiles and locuſts in hoſts innumerable devour the blaſted crops. The ſun alſo refuſes his chearing beams, and fire, hail, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt fill with conſternation the ſmitten and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Egyptians. At this period it was that the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of character mentioned in our text was aſcribed to the Hebrew champion, viz. that <hi>"The man Moſes was very great in the Land of Egypt, in the ſight of Pharoah's ſervants, and in the ſight of the people."</hi>—But how much greater will he preſently appear, when according to his word we behold the ſudden fall of Egypt's firſt born, the emancipation and triumphant march of Iſrael's hoſts, when at the ſtretching forth of his rod the red ſea cleaves in ſunder, and for Iſrael rears on either hand its adamantine walls; and when
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039116_0004_1013A90950F59168"/>
on the ſame ſignal it entombs Pharaoh and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing legions. But we cannot trace through forty years the progreſs of his riſing greatneſs, ſuffice it to obſerve, that as the Jews beheld in Moſes (as the inſtrument of divine providence) the founder of their religion and inſtitutor of their civil polity: So to him as an hiſtorian and prophet are all nations indebted for the only genuine elements of the hiſtory of man; and accurate developement of the true principles of morality; whilſt in his mighty works, the friend of religion, adoringly, beholds diſplayed the finger of his God.</p>
            <p>BUT the doctrinal inference which we would here deduce for the theme of this occaſion is, The providence of God over human affairs; and more eſpecially as diſplayed in his raiſing up at eventful periods, preeminently diſtinguiſhed characters, for the accompliſhment of purpoſes in the higheſt degree benevolent. Tracing then, briefly theſe providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſpenſations, we will advert to them as relating to the Jewiſh nation—as diſplayed towards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles—and laſtly, as affecting the moſt important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of theſe highly favoured States.</p>
            <p>As to the Jewiſh nation, we behold their fathers ſeeking in Egypt an aſylum from famine. To their deſcendants it proves an houſe of bondage. But are the purpoſes of Abraham's God now baffled, or ſhall his promiſes fail of accompliſhment—nay in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted deliverence of his covenant people and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their taſk-maſters, we behold pourtrayed, in the moſt ſtriking characters, his compaſſion for the diſtreſſed, and indignation againſt oppreſſors. Yes, ye oppreſſed Poles—ye long enſlaved ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Africa! ye hapleſs children of bondage, in every age and nation, in Iſrael's deliverance behold the certain pledge of your own—Whilſt in Pharoah's overthrow, ye tyrants of the earth, learn to anticipate your own ſwiftly approaching doom.—But e'er Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael has reached the promiſed land, is their venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

deliverer called to ſleep with his fathers! Still they are not forſaken—their God he ſlumbereth not—the faithful and valiant Joſhua leads them over Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan. The iniquity of the Amorites is now full, and their land becomes the inheritance of more faithful Iſrael. But is Joſhua alſo called to go the way of all fleſh, and is back-ſliding, but now penitent Iſrael, groaning under the yoke of ſurrounding nations—behold in their turns what champions are raiſed up, a Sampſon, a Jephtha, a Gideon, a David, an Elijah and Eliſha, a Jehoſephat and Joſiah, and a Judas Maccabeus.</p>
            <p>BUT when the Lord called Abraham and his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity did he caſt away the Gentiles? Regarded then no more the God of the univerſe the nations whom himſelf had formed. Nay even amongſt the Gentiles is found the patient and perfect Job, the approved Cyrus, and pious Cornelius, and over the intereſts and concerns of all nations and individuals does the common parent of all, unceaſingly extend his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence. In the fall of Belſhazzar, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the Medes and Perſians, we behold redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the wrongs of proſtrate nations. The Perſians degenerate, and in their turn are the ſpoilers of the earth; how are their innumerable hoſts diſcomfited at Marathon! and how their perverted power ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly broken by Macedonia's impetuous youth. Is it deſigned that Greece ſhould in her politics exhibit the models of well ordered communities; that in her liberty ſhould long diſplay her all-invigorating influence; and that as the lamp of ſcience and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined arts, ſhe ſhould ſhine on ſurrounding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt nations. But to conſtitute this very Greece, or to preſerve it from enemies potent and malignant; how at ſucceſſive and eventful periods, as the inſtruments of God, do ariſe an Homer and Solon, a Lycurgus and Thales, a Socrates, and Ariſtotle, a Demoſthenes, a Themiſtocles and Ariſtides, with others not leſs il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:039116_0006_1013A9100FD72D00"/>
Is Rome to become next the theatre of events au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious unto man? Is a greater than Moſes, under her jurisdiction, ſeat to diſpel the miſts of ſuperſtition, which long had degraded the character and debaſed the hearts of men? Is he in miracles more numerous and benevolent than the prodigies of Moſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim himſelf at once the Prince and the Meſſenger of Peace? Is he, and are his Apoſtles, to diſſeminate through the nations that religion which, uniting man to man, in the ſacred bonds of brotherhood; and which by faith elevating them to union with the Father of Spirits brings into viſion the regions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal felicity?</p>
            <p>To effect then purpoſes, ſo ſuperlatively bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, it becomes expedient that Rome ſhould ariſe, ſhould extend her influence, civilize barbarians, unite diſtant and remote provinces, and eſtabliſh through her wide domain, laws equal and uniform. But to rear and ſuſtain a fabric ſo ſtupendous, belonged not to feeble hands, it required the proweſs and talents of a Romulus and Numa—a Brutus and Poplicola—a Cincinnatus and Fabius. The amiable Scipios, and others, with genius and virtues no leſs tranſcendant. Nor have modern nations and times been deſtitute of characters great, amiable, and illuſtrious. Britain juſtly boaſts her great Alfred—France (even repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican France) her Henry the Fourth. With Doria's greatneſs towers that of his country. Helvetia produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the illuſtrious Tell. And even barbarous Ruſſia receives with the arts a poliſh from her firſt Peter.</p>
            <p>BUT whilſt the Eaſtern Continents thus ſoar each in its turn to diſtinguiſhed greatneſs, the Weſtern, though more vaſt in extent, various in its climes, and luxuriant in its productions, is but too much a blank in the ſyſtem of the univerſe; for with ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is but the haunt of the monſters of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; or of men ſcarce leſs ferocious than their brethren of the deſert.

Auſpicious choice! he that at three and twenty ſagely counſelled Braddock; who with his gallant Virginians ſaved from the tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahawk and ſcalping knife, legions of flying veterans; will not in the ſanguine field diſappoint his country's expectations.—Nor will that citizen who in rural ſcenes, or legiſlative councils for twenty years, hath evinced the combination of public and private vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and abilities when victorious ſubvert the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated

rights of his native land. Illuſtrious man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy fame beſtrides the Univerſe. Poets ſing thy mighty deeds, and orators pourtray thy many virtues; and yet thy character needs only the hiſtorian's faithful pen, ſimple narration is alone ſufficient; for ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified and numerous are thy great actions, that they contain in themſelves embelliſhments beyond the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of feeble art. But as cuſtom hath authorized, and as the circumſtances of the day may require ſome tribute to his memory, permit me to attempt a faint portraiture of the Mount-Vernon Hero. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of WASHINGTON to be juſtly appreciated, and properly underſtood, muſt be contemplated in a variety of lights. It is military, it is political, it is moral, and it may alſo be eſtimated from compariſon. Nor will this variety exhauſt it, it is like the pure gold which diminiſhes not in the crucible. His mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary talents altho' the moſt ſplendid, yet perhaps were the leaſt eſtimable trait in his high character; not that his abilities in the field were ſlender, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcience of ſlaughter ſeems to partake in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the nature of calamity; and is only valuable from its averting evils of greater magnitude. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive warfare is alone rational and juſt; and it was in this that our Fabius peculiarly excelled. Yes, he was the man of whom truly it hath been ſaid, "his prudence ſaved what valor would have loſt." But in what a cauſe is he engaged, the liberties of his country. The independence of numerous ſtates, the glory of a riſing and vaſt republic hanging dubious in the pendant ſcale; on the one hand are hords of veterans with every implement of deſtruction, led on by chiefs long drilled in military ſcience; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the ſons of freedom, but often few in number, half armed, conflicting with hunger, nakedneſs and want; but WASHINGTON is there; the die is caſt, the ſcale preponderates, and Columbia's chief, crowned with victory, and rewarded with the applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of his grateful country, like another Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus, retires to his beloved ſcenes of huſbandry.</p>
            <p>But as in his military atchievements, with prudence the moſt conſummate, he diſplayed dauntleſs courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a fortitude that was invincible; ſo in his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039116_0009_10136E73744462E8"/>
capacity he was no leſs tranſcendant. When he aſſumed the higheſt ſtation in the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that government was itſelf, but in imperfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no precedents to guide his dubious way, he muſt himſelf originate them. In Europe already had the fermentation of Liberty, of Tyranny, and of Crimes, mingled their chaotic maſs. With that country theſe ſtates were connected by exiſting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. There the political horizon darkened, tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous concuſſions were felt, revolution ſucceeded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; whilſt civil liberty, religion, morality, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and property, became alternately the ſport of conflicting factions, of regal tyrants, or of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſing lunatics. And whilſt the moſt diſaſtrous of wars laid waſte the faireſt provinces of the world, this country though diſtant three thouſand miles, yet it was menaced by the approaching and dire calamity. But if with the preſervation of our faith with all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we yet enjoy ſo great a meaſure of peace, and if in thoſe days of adverſity which ſeldom have had a parallel, ſuch a tide of unexampled proſperity has flowed in on us, I would aſk, to whom, under provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are we indebted? Or who hath parried from us the blow, which robbing us of peace, would have wreſted from us, this accumulating good? Is it not to WASHINGTON we are thus indebted? and was it not his quick, diſcerning mind, which foreſeeing, repelled the efforts of our foes, by his well-timed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of neutrality. But whilſt the firſt intereſts of his high charge, were thus ſecured under his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian eye, need you be informed that thoſe of ſmaller magnitude were alſo duly cheriſhed under his foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand; you have ſeen it in his repeated Addreſſes to both Houſes of the Federal Legiſlature; in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Farewell Addreſs, and uniformly through his illuſtrious adminiſtration of eight years. The virtues of WASHINGTON demand now attention; but though thus mentioned ſubſequent to his military and political talents, it is not from a ſuppoſition that they were either leſs evident, or leſs valuable. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his virtues were ſo brilliant and irreſiſtable as to convince enemies and annihilate ſuſpicion. And ſo important is virtue itſelf, as ever to tranſcend all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039116_0010_1013A91D03866F70"/>
other gifts or acquirements however ſplendid. An able General, or profound Politician, if deſtitute of juſtice, of integrity, or compaſſion, or what is the ſame thing, if void of the fear of God, from whence thoſe virtues originate, may become like Arnold, a traitor, or like Attilla, "the ſcourge of God;" but if power or intereſt invites, never like WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the benefactor of his Country. The victory which this illuſtrious man obtained over his paſſions, how did it elevate him above the Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ian, who was lately the chief dependence of the leagued monarchs. Suwarrow grown grey in victory, and conqueror in thirty pitched battles, meets with a ſingle repulſe in Switzerland, his haughty ſoul chagrined, and brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his diſaſter, feels all the mortification of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. He who had predicted that like a tyger he ſhould howl in Italy, now in rage retiring to Lindau, and yielding to all the impotence of paſſion, in his chamber growls like a monſter in his den. But WASHINGTON with the ſame dignified compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as when victorious, he received a check, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained defeat; for reſigned to and confiding in the God of Battles, even from diſaſter he ſoon finds means to originate freſh victories.</p>
            <p>IT is ſometimes the frailty of even great men, to be avaricious; the alloy in others is the undue love of power. Had any tincture of the former been in the heart of the man we all admire, the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing millions of Britain would have diſcovered the contaminated ſpot, had the latter been his propenſity, he had the opportunity to have become a ſecond Cromwell. But as the virtues of Waſhington were luminous ſo they were alſo ſolid; and for this reaſon becauſe they originated from the fear of his Creator; and becauſe they originated here, they were uniform through the variety of high ſtations which he filled, and from this uniformity, aroſe that peculiarity of character, by which he is ſo pre-eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
            <p>MILITARY Talents alone, have often procured the appellation of greatneſs to their poſſeſſors; politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal abilities have been viewed as meriting the ſame reward, and ſuperior virtue is ſelf-evidently more

worthy of it, than either; but when in one man we thus behold the concentration of them all, and of them all in ſo tranſcendant a degree; we diſcover a ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and elevation of character, but rarely if ever found amongſt the frail deſcendants of Adam.</p>

               </note> we muſt recall the great theatres of action on which this very character itſelf, exhibited to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view, its every trait.</p>
            <p>WE muſt remember that WASHINGTON was a member of the firſt Congreſs. That he accepted the chief command of the Colonial Armies when ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have denominated him the leader of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. That through a long and arduous ſtruggle he had not only an army to command, but in ſome meaſure alſo; that army to create. That his final tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was the eſtabliſhment of his country's inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. That in the Convention which origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the admired fabric of our Federal government he filled the firſt and moſt influential place.—That as he was the firſt, ſo he was twice unanimouſly choſen to be the Magiſtrate who ſhould guide the ſupreme councils of the newly conſtructed government.—That though ſtricken in years, the voice of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try finds him once more obedient to her call, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy if needful to lead her vigorous youth againſt the embattled foe. And laſtly, That when his cup of human felicity is full, his country rejoicing around him, and he juſt about to ſtep into the infirmities of old age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he in peace is called to ſleep with his fathers; and with a placid confidence worthy of his former greater greatneſs, bids his laſt adieu to terreſtrial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; I aſk where, amongſt men is the greatneſs that can compare with his? Amongſt the Kings there is none worthy, Freedom's Champion will not rank with thoſe who combined to ſtrangle her at her birth—La Fayette and Koſciuſco, even if ſucceſsful were but his pupils. Doria and Tell, tho' great of ſtature were not half his height. The firſt Brutus bore ſome reſemblance, but he fell in battle, e'er his country's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039116_0012_1013A92120BE7240"/>
cauſe was vindicated; in ſhort to form the portrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of our hero, you muſt ſelect the wiſdom of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the integrity of an Ariſtides, the amiableneſs of the Scipios, the prudence of a Fabius, the ſimplicity and greatneſs of Cincinnatus, with the piety and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Cyrus: concentrate theſe and you behold a WASHINGTON</p>
            <p>BUT what is human glory? or what the life of the moſt illuſtrious? The one is a vapor—the other like the fading flower.—Oh death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> potent is thine arm; Kings haſt thou ſlain and Nobles haſt caſt down—but now greater is thy triumph, for before thee the mighty is fallen—the man of war—the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent—the ancient—the honourable. Venerable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of thy country! vain for thee are now our plaints. The tears of millions confeſs to thee in vain the weight of obligation—thou art now beyond the reach of mortal tribute—with thy God alone is the meaſure of thy actions, with him the weight of thy reward.</p>
            <p>THE numerous teſtimonials of gratitude, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played throughout theſe States; although they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance not the bliſs of our regretted Benefactor; yet they may ſtimulate ſucceſſors high in office, to tread a luminous path already traced; and by impreſſing on our national character the ideas of ability to diſcern, and eagerneſs, to reward merit, may contribute to wipe from Republics, the reproach of jealouſy and ingratitude towards their moſt brilliant and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſons. But whilſt we thus ſecure the character of being grateful and political, let us not forfeit that of being religious; let nothing that is done favour of idolatry; let not that tribute be paid to a creature, that is due to God alone; from ſecond cauſes let our gratitude, our affections, our hopes, all aſcend to the great, the firſt, the only, the tranſcendant cauſe of all. If WASHINGTON was prepared, was raiſed up, was girded with ſtrength, and made victorious, to Jehovah alone belongeth the high praiſe, to him who raiſed up the wiſe, the illuſtrious, the mighty of all ages—and who, ſhould we need, and be found worthy of them, will raiſe up yet to us, heroes and deliverers not leſs excelling.</p>
            <p>PAUSING now to contemplate the ſubjects thus
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039116_0013_1013A922AC25D588"/>
diſcuſſed, we diſcover an error no leſs popular than pernicious, viz. the modern doctrine of the equality of man. That all men have (unleſs forfeited by crimes) an equal claim to the unmoleſted poſſeſſion of liberty, of property and life, none but the aſſaſſin, the robber, or the deſpot will deny. And chriſtianity in maintaining our deſcent from one firſt pair, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims aloud our equality in nature. But when we behold the tranſcendant characters from Moſes down to Waſhington, vaſt inequalities appear. We then perceive men, riſing above men, even as the lofty pine or towering cedar out tops the ſhrubs on which the cattle browſe. And how eſſential this variety, without it there were no heroes to have reſcued from oppreſſion, no Columbus to have led our way acroſs the dreary deep—no Sages, Prophets or Apoſtles who teach the way to God—no accommodating artiſt nor ingenuity which yields embelliſhment—no Newton ſcrutinizing nature's poize—nor Herſchel, who, to bring us tidings, traverſed the lunar orb—nor yet a Bacon making viſible the microſcopal world.</p>
            <p>AND thro' this variety, are we not admoniſhed of the expediency of order, and ſubordination in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Is not the latter as an army in the day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, where inſubordination yields but defeat and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Or is it not a body politick, with an head and various members; all ſuited to their ſeveral offices; no part ſuperfluous, but each eſſential, to the vigour, health and ſafety of the whole? Nor let us be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, ſhould ours be an inferior ſtation in this body. The part alloted us, if adapted to our talents is the only one we can perform with honour or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Let us remember, that in the eſtimation of God it is not greatneſs but goodneſs that is rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with bliſs. And that ſuperior talents, abuſed or neglected here, will receive hereafter but the greater condemnation; whilſt the meaneſt talent faithfully occupied in this life, will through the rewards of grace in Chriſt, entitle its pious poſſeſſor, to inconcievably greater felicity and honour, in the immortal regions, than even WASHINGTON poſſeſſed, in this world in all his glory. But I would now addreſs the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary officers, who aſſembled in the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

feel impreſſively, in their Country's loſs, a double portion of bereavement.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, You have now heard the ſmall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute paid the memory of the late illuſtrious Head and Arm of our Republic. Like Sheba's Queen you are ready to ſay "The one half hath not been told us." You know better his great worth. There are ſome amongſt you who ſtood with him in the day of his Country's danger; who beheld him ſtand as an hoſt where danger moſt impended, who imbibed his ſpirit and learned from him to conquer. You ſaw him at Trenton and Princeton nobly roll back the ſwelling tide of adverſe war—You ſaw his many victories, his final triumph, and virtuous retirement to rural ſcenes. You beheld him twice unanimouſly choſen to fill, with unrivalled dignity and talents, the Preſidential chair. Again he girds his armour on, and you rejoice that under ſuch a Leader you ſhall repel the hoſtile approaching foe. But you have heard the tidings our Father is no more—Have witneſſed your Country all in tears—Our temples ſhrouded in the habiliments of ſorrow—and now you wiſh to honour the memory of him, whoſe name ages yet unborn ſhall long revere. Tranſcribe then into your hearts and lives his many virtues. If called to the ſanguine field combine prudence with valour—ſcientific ingenuity with force. In civil life be like him the firſt to yield homage to the laws. In office, civil or military, let integrity, punctuality, and vigilance, characterize like his your every action, maintain inviolably the Federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. WASHINGTON aided in its conſtruction and was clad in armour for its defence; it is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, in which are depoſited the liberties and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of your Country. But above all contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate eternity; this only is ſubſtance, all elſe is ſhadow. What availed it in the moment of mortality to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved proſtrate Chief, that a nation ſhould decree him many honours, that millions ſhould weep for him, or his name fill the faireſt page of hiſtory? Nought then availed him but religion. Secure then by faith the favour of him, in whoſe name alone is ſalvation; whoſe death deſtroyed the power of death: and whoſe reſurrection, proclaims immortality, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the juſt.</p>

PERMIT me alſo now, to addreſs, briefly, the aſſembly?</p>
            <p>FRIENDS, Brethren and Fathers: With our deep regret we ſhould this day alſo combine grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements: for, rich has been the diſtribution of providential gifts to theſe ſtates. There was a WASHINGTON—a <hi>Montgomery</hi>—a <hi>Greene</hi>—a <hi>Warren</hi>—and many whom we muſt now omit—There is ſtill an ADAMS, and others high in office, replete with talents and virtues. The beſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our gratitude to God for characters ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable; will be to encourage theſe his ſervants in their ſeveral ſtations, by our earneſt prayers for their proſperity, and by a chearful and ready ſubmiſſion to all their conſtitutional and lawful appointments.</p>
            <p>BUT whilſt we pay tribute to illuſtrious merit found in men, or mourn our fallen chief; let us not forget his bereaved conſort. He was freedom's champion, ſhe at his intimation announces the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of her ſlaves; he endured the toils, anxieties and dangers of eight years warfare, ſhe yielded him up, and ſympathiſing partook the whole. He now bath ceaſed his labours, but ſhe bereaved feels with indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual force a nation's ſorrow. Illuſtrious woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
