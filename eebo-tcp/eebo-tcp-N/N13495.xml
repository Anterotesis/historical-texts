            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>THIS board having maturely conſidered the general tenor and courſe of the military command exerciſed by major general Arnold in this city and ſtate, and divers tranſactions which have appeared to this board during his command, <hi>do reſolve unanimouſly,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſame hath been in many reſpects oppreſſive to the faithful ſubjects of the ſtate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his rank and ſtation, highly diſcouraging to thoſe who have manifeſted their attachment to the liberties and intereſts of America, and diſreſpectful to the ſupreme executive authority of the ſtate.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, <hi>reſolved unanimouſly,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Second,</hi> That nothing but the moſt urgent and preſſing neceſſity can juſtify or induce this board to call forth any waggons or militia, or otherwiſe ſubject the good people of this ſtate to the power and command of the ſaid general Arnold within the ſtate, ſhould he reſume it upon his return.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Third, Ordered,</hi> That the attorney general do proſecute the ſaid general Arnold, for ſuch illegal and oppreſſive conduct as is cognizable in the courts of law.</p>
                           <p>And, that this board may not be ſuppoſed capable of paſſing the above reſolves upon mere general grounds, and more eſpecially in the caſe of one who has formerly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they think proper to declare, that the conſideration laſt mentioned has hitherto reſtrained them from taking proper notice of general Arnold, hoping that every unworthy tranſaction would be the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017047_0004_0F9FBDB7801EFD98"/>laſt, or that a becoming ſenſe of ſuch improprieties would effect an alteration of conduct. But finding that tenderneſs has only led to inſult and farther oppreſſion, duty to the ſtate, regard to the intereſt and happineſs of the good people thereof, who muſt be affected by all abuſes of power, oblige us thus to take notice thereof; and farther declare, that the ſaid reſolves are founded upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing articles, in which they have ſufficient ground to eſteem general Arnold culpable.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> That while in the camp of general Waſhington at Valley Forge, laſt ſpring, he gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a veſſel belonging to perſons then voluntarily reſiding in this city with the enemy, and of diſaffected character, to come into a port of the united ſtates, without the knowledge of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſtate, or of the commander in chief, though then preſent.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Second,</hi> In having ſhut up the ſhops and ſtores on his arrival in the city, ſo as even to prevent officers of the army from purchaſing, while he privately made conſiderable purchaſes for his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as is alledged and believed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Third,</hi> In impoſing menial offices upon the ſons of freeman of this ſtate, when called forth by the defire of congreſs to perform militia duty; and when remonſtrated to hereupon, juſtifying himſelf in writing, upon the ground of having power ſo to do; for that, <q>when a citizen aſſumed the character of a ſoldier, the former was intirely loſt in the latter; and that it was the duty of the militia to obey <hi>every</hi> order of his aids (not a breach of the laws and conſtitution) as his (the general's) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judging of the propriety of them.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourth,</hi> For that, when a prize was brought into this port by the Convention brig, of this ſtate, whereon a diſpute aroſe reſpecting the capture, which would otherwiſe in great probability have been amicably adjuſted between the claimants, general Arnold interpoſed by an illegal and unworthy purchaſe of the ſuit, at a low and inadequate price, as has been publicly charged by a reputable citizen; to which may in ſome degree be aſcribed the delay of juſtice in the courts of appeal, and the diſpute in which the ſtate may probably be involved with congreſs hereupon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fifth,</hi> The appropriating the waggons of this ſtate, when called forth upon a ſpecial emergency laſt autumn, to the tranſportation of private property, and that of perſons who voluntarily remained with the enemy laſt winter, and were deemed diſaffected to the intereſt; and independence of America.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixth,</hi> In that, congreſs by a reſolve of the twenty firſt of Auguſt laſt, having given to the executive powers of every ſtate, an excluſive power to recommend perſons deſirous of going within the enemy's lines, to the office: there commanding, general Arnold, in order, as may reaſonably be inferred, to elude the ſaid reſolve, wrote a letter, as appears by compariſon of hands and the 'declaration of the intended bearer, recommendatory for the above purpoſe, and cauſed his aid de camp, major Clarkſon, to ſign the ſame. But the ſaid device not taking effect, through the vigilance of the officers at Elizabeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, general Arnold, without diſcloſing any of the above circumſtances, applied to council for their permiſſion, which was inſtantly refuſed, the connection, character and ſituation of the party being well known and deemed utterly improper to be indulged with ſuch permiſſion, thereby violating the reſolve of congreſs, and uſurping the authority of this board.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventh,</hi> This board having, upon the complaint of ſeveral inhabitants of Cheſter county, through the late waggon maſter general, <hi>requeſted</hi> of the ſaid general Arnold to ſtate the ſaid tranſaction reſpecting the waggons, in order that they might ſatisfy the complainants, or explain the ſame without farther trouble, received in return an indecent and diſreſpectful refuſal of any ſatisfaction whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eighth,</hi> The diſcouragement and neglect manifeſted by general Arnold, during his command, to civil, military and other characters, who have adhered to the cauſe of their country—with an entire different conduct towards thoſe of another character are too notorious to need proof or illuſtration. And if this command has been, as is generally believed, ſupported at an expence of four or five thouſand pounds per annum to the united ſtates, we freely declare we ſhall very unwillingly pay any ſhare of expences thus incurred.</p>

                           <p>I THIS day received an order, ſigned by the ſecretary of the honorable council of this ſtate, requeſting I would give them information reſpecting a brigade of waggons under the conduct of Jeſſe Jordan, a waggon maſter from Cheſter county, the council having been informed that I ſent them to Egghar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to convey private property to this city. I ſhall at all times be ready to give your excellency and the honorable council every information you think neceſſary for the good of the public, or this ſtate in particular, which relates to my office, or the buſineſs of the department, as I have no deſire to conceal any part of my conduct as a public officer, having conducted the buſineſs under my direction with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and juſtice to the public. The following are the ſtate of the facts required, viz.</p>
                           <p>In the month of October laſt, at the time the enemy had landed ſome troops at Eggharbour, general Arnold deſired I would furniſh him with a brigade of teams, which he wanted to ſend to the Jerſies, and that he would pay the hire of them, they being wanted to remove property which was in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. I informed him, he ſhould have the waggon maſter of the faſt brigade which could be ſpared from public ſervice, ſent to him, when he would give ſuch orders as he pleaſed. Accordingly, about the 22d of October mr. Jordan was ſent to the general, to receive his directions, having at that time ſent forward a large ſupply for the army, &amp;c. When Jordan returned, he was deſired to make out his account to general Arnold, to be paid. I do not know where the loading was ſtored, nor whoſe property it was, further than what is before mentioned. A greater number of continental teams coming in than I expected, enabled me to comply with general Arnold's requeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inconvenience to the ſervice. If there is any thing further, in which I can ſatisfy your excellency and the council, I will wait on you at any time with pleaſure.</p>

                           <p>I received a letter from mr. Timothy Matluck, your ſecretary, of the 22d inſtant, incloſing an order of council of the 18th, colonel Mitchell's anſwer of the 19th, and a ſubſequent order of council of the 21ſt inſtant.</p>
                           <p>I think it very extraordinary, that after colonel Mitchell had, by his letter of the 19th, ſo fully and clearly anſwered the requiſition of council in their order of the 18th, they ſhould have patled the order of the 21ſt. In anſwer I ſhall only ſay, that I am at all times ready to anſwer my public conduct to congreſs or general Waſhington, to whom alone I am accountable.</p>

Mr. Mitchell, admitting the fact, alledged in juſtification, that the waggons had been ſo employed by the direction of general Arnold, then the military commanding officer of this ſtate. This board having thereupon tranſmitted to general Arnold a copy of their proceedings, with mr.

After theſe papers were read, the judge advocate exhibited as charges againſt major general Arnold, the firſt, ſecond, third, and fifth articles contained in the proceedings of the council of the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, to which the general pleaded NOT GUILTY.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of the firſt charge, the judge advocate produced a protection given by major general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, to captain Robert Shewell, jun. and others, for the ſchooner Charming Nancy, dated, camp, Valley Forge, June 4, 1778, which being read, is as follows:</p>

               <p>Major general Arnold admitted that he gave the protection while in the camp of his excellency gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington at Valley Forge, without the knowledge of the authority of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, or the commander in chief, though then preſent.</p>
               <p>To prove the character and reſidence of the perſons to whom the protection was given, the judge advocate produced Timothy Matlock, <abbr>eſq</abbr> who, on his affirmation, ſays,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the character of the perſon to whom general Arnold gave the permiſſion?</p>
               <p>A. Generally, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his character at the time?</p>
               <p>A. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, was, at the time of that paſs being given, generally reputed not to be well affected to the united ſtates of America, as I underſtand. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, informed me, that he was ordered to leave general Waſhington's camp, in conſequence of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that had been given of him; and upon his appearing on parade afterwards, he was ordered to leave general Waſhington's camp on pain of impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did captain Robert Shewell, junior, reſide in Philadeiphia at that time?</p>
               <p>A. He informed me he did voluntarily reſide there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know whether general Arnold knew captain Robert Shewell, junior's, general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at the time he gave the permiſſion?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of captain Shewell's being ordered to leave the camp of general Waſhington, previous to his having given him the permit?</p>
               <p>A. I had no opportunity of being acquainted with the circumſtances of the caſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the perſons who were concerned in the veſſel with captain Shewell at that time?</p>
               <p>A. It was ſuppoſed mr. Shirtliff was concerned, and ſeveral others, whoſe characters I know nothing of and cannot give; and it was ſuppoſed that general Arnold was concerned in the veſſel or cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know mr. Shirtliff's character?</p>
               <p>A. So little as not to be able to give his character generally.</p>
               <p>General Arnold's queſtion. What converſation introduced captain Shewell's mentioning to you, his being ordered from the camp of general Waſhington? and did he tell you the reaſon of it?</p>
               <p>A. I believe the converſation took its riſe from mr. Shewell's mentioning to me, that he was likely to be treated ill, upon a charge of his having ill treated mr. Paul Fooks at the coffee houſe in Philadelphia, while the enemy had poſſeſſion of the city. The reaſon he aſſigned to me, for his being ordered to leave general Waſhington's camp, was, he ſuppoſed he had been repreſented to general Waſhington as being untriendly to America.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017047_0008_0F9FBDBE8FF2D708"/>
General Arnold's queſtion. Have you underſtood, that upon ſeveral alarms captain Shewell turned out with the militia, and did duty with them?</p>
               <p>A. I know nothing of that matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conſider captain Robert Shewell, junior, at the time the protection was given, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the united ſtates of America?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>

               <p>The court met, according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Timothy Matlack, <abbr>eſq</abbr> on his affirmation, ſays, That ſome time during the enemy's having poſſeſſion of the city of Philadelphia, information was given to the board of war, that property belonging to captain Robert Shewell, junior, was arrived in Virginia, part of a veſſel and cargo in which the Wykoffs, one or more of that family, was concerned. Upon the repreſentation being made, an order was iſſued for their being ſeized, as belonging to captain Robert Shewell, junior, who was deemed unfriendly to the united ſtates of America. They were ſeized on that order, and were detained: the length of time the cannot aſcertain; neither does he know of their being delivered up to this day. This information he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from mr. Shewell and from mr. lſaac Wykoff.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Was this order iſſued by the board of war before captain Robert Shewell, junior, obtained the permiſſion of general Arnold?</p>
               <p>A. Moſt probably ſeveral months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of the board of war having iſſued the order reſpecting the ſeizure of captain Shewell's property?</p>
               <p>A. I know of no circumſtance that ſhould afford me an opportunity to judge concerning that.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Where did the board of war ſit at the time?</p>
               <p>A. I ſuppoſe at Yorktown.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know where general Arnold was at that time?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, further than it was a general knowledge that he was with the army at the northward.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of the ſecond charge, the judge advocate produced his excellency general Waſhington's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to major general Arnold, dated June 18, 1778, a reſolution of the honorable the congreſs, dated June 5, 1778, and a copy of a proclamation iſſued by major general Arnold, dated June 19, 1778; which being read, are as follow:</p>

               <p>Queſtion by general Arnold to Timothy Matlack, <abbr>eſq</abbr> Is the depoſition of colonel Fitzgerald, in your hand writing?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; it was dictated to me by colonel John Fitzgerald, and while in the rough by him altered and amended, and afterwards copied fair. The next day he called at my houſe, and informed me he had ſeen you, in conſequence of your requeſt; that there was one or two alterations he wiſhed to make, in conſequence of the converſation with you, which alterations are interlined, and written preciſely in the words he dictated, having I believe written them on a piece of paper, before me. Colonel Fitzge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald was a perfect ſtranger to me, having to the beſt of my knowledge never ſeen him before to know him.</p>
               <p>The judge advocate produced major Franks, aid de camp to major general Arnold, who was ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. On general Arnold's arrival in Philadelphia, do you know whether himſelf or any perſon on his account, made any conſiderable purchaſes of goods?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. At or before general Arnold's arrival in Philadelphia, did you receive orders from general Arnold to purchaſe goods, or do you know of general Arnold's having given orders to any other perſon to make purchaſes of goods?</p>
               <p>A. I did receive from general Arnold, that paper which colonel Fitzgerald has mentioned in his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. There are circumſtances leading to it which I muſt explain. I had, by being in the army, injured my private affairs very conſiderably, and meant to leave it, if a proper opportunity of entering into buſineſs ſhould happen. I had ſeveral converſations on the ſubject with general Arnold, who promiſed me all the aſſiſtance in his power; he was to participate in the profits of the buſineſs I was to enter into. At that time, previous to our going into Philadelphia, I had ſeveral particular converſations with him, and thought that the period, in which I might leave the army with honour, and enter into buſineſs, I received at that time, or about that time, I think ſeveral days before the enemy evacuated the city, the paper mentioned in colonel Fitgerald's depoſition that was not ſigned, as well as the other. Upon our coming into town we had variety of military buſineſs to do. I did not purchaſe any goods, neither did I leave the army. The paper was entirely neglected, neither did I think any thing concerning it, until I heard of colonel Fitgerald's depoſition. General Arnold has told me ſince, which is ſince I came from Carolina ſometime in Auguſt laſt, on ſpeaking about the paper, that the reaſon for his not ſupporting me in buſineſs was, ſuppoſing that I had left the army, it was incompatible with his excellency's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and the reſolution of congreſs.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did general Arnold aſk you upon his coming into Phiadelphia, or at any time after, why you had not executed the contents of the paper?</p>
               <p>A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. court. What day did you arrive in Philadelphia?</p>
               <p>A. The 18th day of June, in the evening, the day the enemy left Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Are you certain that the order for purchaſing the goods was given to you ſeveral days before you went into Philadelphia?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot be particular as to the time; it might have been three, four, five, or twenty days; but it was ſome time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to the enemy evacuating the city of Philadelphia, did you underſtand from general Arnold that be was to have the command in the city, on the evacuation taking place?</p>
               <p>A. I did; but it was a ſhort time before, I believe a day or two. The general, on his return from head-quarters, mentioned it was hinted to him at general Waſhington's, that he ſhould, when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my evacuated Philadelphia, have the command, and deſired me not to mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the inſtructions to purchaſe goods given to you before the general mentioned this matter to you?</p>
               <p>A. I believe they were, though I am not certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017047_0011_0F9FBDC0830E2A60"/>
General Arnold's queſtion. Were not my minute and invoice books always open to your inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Had you any reaſon to ſuppoſe that any purchaſes were made directly or indirectly by my orders or on my account, previous to the opening of the ſtores?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Did you not ſuppoſe my ſhowing you the inſtructions from general Waſhington to me, previous to your going into the city, a ſufficient countermand of the order I had given you to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe goods?</p>
               <p>A. I did not form any ſuppoſition on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. For what purpoſe were you ſent into the city before me?</p>
               <p>A. To procure quarters, and to provide neceſſaries for the family.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of the third charge the judge advocate produced Timothy Matlack, eſquire's letter to major general Arnold, dated October 5.; the general's anſwer, dated October 6.; Mr. Matlack's letter dated October 10.; and the general's anſwer of the 12th of October 1778; which were read, and are as follows:</p>

                           <p>THE militia ſerjeant who attended at your quarters on Sunday, complains that major Franks, one of your aids, had given him orders to call his barber, which order was obeyed; that on the barber not appearing the order was repeated, and the ſerjeant, though hurt both by the order itſelf, and the manner of it, again obeyed; he alſo informs me, that he has, this morning, made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this complaint, and that you had been pleaſed to ſay, that every order given by you or your aids, is to be obeyed. This, I ſuppoſe, muſt intend every proper order.</p>
                           <p>The militia of the ſeveral ſtates have, occaſionally, rendered the great cauſe in which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſuch ſervices, as muſt convince every man that it is of very great importance to treat thoſe who are neceſſarily called out, in ſuch manner as to make the duty as agreeable to them as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſervice to which they are called: For it is upon their will, more than upon the force of any law, that we are to depend for their aſſiſtance in the time of need. The ſeverity of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline in ſuch a caſe as that above mentioned, where no important end is to be anſwered by it, muſt make every freeman feel. At a time when you were one of the militia of the ſtate of which you are a citizen, what would have been your feelings, had an aid of your commanding officer ordered you to call his barber? From your feelings in ſuch a caſe, it will be eaſy to judge of that of other men. Freemen will be hardly brought to ſubmit to ſuch indignities; and if it is intended to have any of the reſpectable citizens of a ſtate, in ſervice in the militia, military diſcipline in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances muſt be relaxed; but if it is an object to render the militia in the ſeveral ſtates contemptible and uſeleſs, the continuance of ſuch treatment will probably effect it. Military duty of every kind is rather diſagreeable; and perhaps, to freemen, garriſon duty more diſagreeable than any other. The ſerjeant above mentioned entered the ſervice to diſcharge his duty, and as an example to other young men of the city, and not from neceſſity, in any ſenſe of the word.</p>
                           <p>It appears to me a duty which I owe to the public, to repreſent this matter to you in a reſpectful manner, in expectation that, from attachment to the public intereſt, you will give ſuch orders as will prevent any farther complaints of this kind, which is all the ſatisfaction ſought after, either by the ſerjeant, who is my ſon, or,</p>

                           <p>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yeſterday, reſpecting the militia ſerjeant who complains of being ill treated. No man has a higher ſenſe of the rights of a citizen and freeman than myſelf: they are dear to me, as I have ſought and bled for them, and as it is my higheſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moſt ardent wiſh to reſume the character of a free citizen, whenever the ſervice of my country will permit. At the ſame time I beg leave to obſerve, that whenever neceſſity obliges the citizen to aſſume the character of a ſoldier, the former is intirely loſt in the latter, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to a citizen is by no means to be paid to the ſoldier, any farther than his rank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017047_0012_0F9FBDC1621C4108"/>him to it. This is evident from the neceſſity of military diſcipline, the baſis of which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience, and however the feelings of a citizen may be hurt, he has this conſolation, that it is a ſacrifice he pays to the ſafety of his country.</p>
                           <p>You are pleaſed to aſk, "What my feelings would have been on a ſimilar occaſion." They have been tried; I have ſerved a whole campaign under the command of a gentleman, who was not known as a ſoldier until after I had been ſome time a brigadier: My feelings were hurt not only as a citizen, but more ſo as a ſoldier; they were however ſacrificed to the intereſt of my country. The event proved unfortunate to me; but I have the ſatisfaction to think I rendered ſome ſervice to my country.</p>
                           <p>I wiſh to make the duty as agreeable to the militia as is conſiſtent with the good of the ſervice, for which purpoſe military diſcipline has been greatly relaxed; was it executed with ſtrictneſs, moſt of the militia, from their inattention, would feel the effects of it.</p>
                           <p>I cannot think (as you ſeem to imagine) any indignity is offered to the citizen, when he is called upon to do the duty of a ſoldier in the ſtation he is in, which was the caſe of the ſerjeant; who though he may be a more reſpectable character as a citizen, yet, as an orderly ſerjeant, it is his duty to obey every order of my aids, not a breach of the laws or principles of the conſtitution, as mine, without judging of the propriety of them; neither can I have any idea from the militia's being put on the ſame footing as the ſtanding army, they will refuſe their aſſiſtance, as ſelf preſervation is the firſt principle of human nature, theirs will ever induce them to turn out and defend their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>

                           <p>I RECEIVED your letter of the 6th inſtant; and it gives me real and great pleaſure to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of your patriotic behaviour in the caſe you mention. Such conduct is the effect of genuine ſpirit and true greatneſs of mind; but it is very different from the caſe I ſtated. You obeyed, becauſe the effential intereſt of your country was concerned, and a regard to your own ſame required it; but the ſame principles, which induced this conduct, would have induced you to ſpurn at commands dictated by pride and inſolence.</p>
                           <p>I cannot bring myſelf to believe, that the reſpect due to the citizen is entirely loſt when he takes upon himſelf the character of a ſoldier: I entertain a higher ſenſe of the rights of citizens and freemen.</p>
                           <p>If, on the one hand, ſoldiers are bound implicitly to obey military orders, ſo, on the other hand, are officers accountable for the orders which they give; and their propriety or impropriety often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend entirely on time and circumſtance. Occaſions may occur in which an officer may juſtify com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which expoſe a citizen to certain death; but I know of none which would juſtify a command to a citizen ſerving in the militla to clean his officers ſhoes. The neceſſity of implicit obedience on the part of the citizen, when in military ſervice, is ſo far from being ground, on which to juſtify every command which may be given, that it is the ſtrongeſt poſſible reaſon, why an officer ſhould be very cautious and circumſpect in his orders; and it alſo lays the citizen under a neceſſity of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers to a ſtrict account for the orders which they give. I will venture to ſay, that, in a free government, implicit obedience will not be ſubmitted to much longer than commanders uſe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with great prudence and diſcretion, and, if it be really neceſſary, commanders, who deſtroy it, by degrading and unneceſſary orders, they will be accountable for the conſequences, You ſay it is the duty of an orderly ſerjeant <q>to obey every order of your aids (not a breach of the laws or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution) as yours, without judging of the propriety of them.</q> This ſentiment muſt have dropt from your pen in a moment of haſte; as it appears to me to be a ſentiment impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be entertained either by the citizen or ſoldier: For even common ſoldiers retain ſome right to judge of the propriety of the orders which they have obeyed; and to demand ſatisfaction in caſes where improper or unneceſſary orders have been given: And freemen will judge for themſelves and ſpeak for themſelves with decency and firmneſs when the occaſion requires it. The calling of major Franks's barber to dreſs his hair, was the office of a menial ſervant, not the duty of a ſoldier; and I ſtill think it an indignity to a free citizen to be ordered to go on ſuch an errand. Such commands cannot be miſtaken for and obeyed as the orders of a wiſe and prudent general.</p>
                           <p>My letter to you was written for the ſingle purpoſe of preventing orders being madvertently given, which would offend a militia who have ſuffered greatly many ways; and I had a hope, that you would have thought it proper to have given ſome aſſurance that attention would have been paid to this, as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017047_0013_0F9FBDC293484B68"/>it appears to me, neceſſary precaution; but I am not a little mortified to find the order, of which I complained, ſo fully juſtified and ſupported by you. If it is your intention, as commanding officer, to countenance orders of this kind, it is my duty, as a father, to withdraw my ſon from a ſervice in which commands are to be given him which to obey would leſſen him in the eſteem of the world; and I ſhall conſider it as a duty which I owe to myſelf to acquaint my fellow citizens of my reaſon for ſo doing.</p>

                           <p>BY your letter of the 10th, I perceive that my ſentiments are not clearly underſtood; but it is needleſs to diſcuſs a ſubject which will perhaps be determined more by the feelings than the reaſon of men. If the declaration, that you will withdraw your ſon from the ſervice, and publiſh the reaſons, is intended as a threat, you have miſtaken your object. I am not to be intimidated by a newſpaper. To vindicate the rights of citizens, I became a ſoldier, and bear the marks upon me. I hope your candour will acquit me of the inconſiſtency of invading what I have fought and bled to defend. As I am earneſtly deſirous of cloſing this correſpondence. I ſhall confine myſelf to what occaſioned it. "An improper order," as you conceive, <q>given by major Franks, my aid de camp, to the orderly ſerjeant, your ſon.</q> Without examining into the propriety or impropriety of the order, about which we may differ, I perfectly agree with you, that the delivering of it in a haughty, imperious or inſolent manner, is blameable; and if the ſerjeant had ſo repreſented it to me at the time, he would have had juſtice. The affair is now out of my hands, and lies between the ſerjeant and the major. If the latter hath behaved amiſs, it is his duty to make reparation. I truſt I never ſhall countenance pride or inſolence to inferiors in him, or any other officer under my command. Let me add, that diſputes, as to the rights of citizens and ſoldiers, in conjunctures like the preſent, may be fatal to both.</p>

               <p>After the reading of theſe letters, the judge advocate produced Mr. William Matlack, who, having affirmed, ſays,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend at general Arnold's quarters in Philadelphia as an orderly ſerjeant from the militia?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive an order from major Franks, aid de camp to major general Arnold, while you attended in that ſtation, to fetch a barber?</p>
               <p>A. I received my firſt order from a ſervant girl, who came and aſked me if I was an orderly ſerjeant? I told her I was. She ſaid major Franks' orders were, that I ſhould fetch his barber; which order I obeyed, as ſuppoſing it to come from him. Soon after my return, major Franks came to where I was ſtationed, and aſked me if I had been for his barber? I told him I had, but he was not at home, and that I had left the orders that were neceſſary for his coming up, as ſoon as he ſhould come home. Major Franks then ſaid, he did not believe he would come, and then went away. Some conſiderable time after, he came again, and ſaid he did not believe he would come, and he believed I had better go again; to which I made no reply, but walking back in the entry, after a few minutes, I aſked a Negro man if it was cuſtomary to give ſuch orders to the orderly ſerjeants? He ſaid it was. I then replied, that major Franks ought to conſider, that the militia could not be expected to do ſuch duty, or words to that purport. Major Franks then came out of a back room, and ſaid, ſerjeant, I thought I had ordered you to go for my barber. I told him I had received no ſuch order. He then aſked me why I did not go? I told him I waited his orders. He then told me to go, and I told him, with his orders I would go, and did go. Major Franks, on my return, aſked me if I had been? I told him I had, and left the ſame orders as before. In the morning I made a complaint to the general, nearly in them words; and he informed me it was cuſtomary for ſerjeants to do ſuch duty; and gave to me underſtand, not in an abrupt manner, that if I did not like ſuch duty. I ſhould not have come there.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017047_0014_0F9FBDC2C49BD328"/>The general ſaid, at the time, that if major Franks had inſulted me at the time be gave me the order, it was wrong, and he did not approve of that.</p>
               <p>General Arnold's queſtion. Was any menial office impoſed upon you, or upon any orderly ſerjeant, to your knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. I conceived the office that was impoſed on me as menial; and the orderly ſerjeant who ſtood at the ſame time with me, belonging to the continental troops, complained of major Franks giving him a ſmall bundle of paper in his hand, bidding him follow him, which he did; and upon his coming to a houſe a ſmall diſtance off, bid him give him the bundle of papers and return; which the man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to me, when he returned, as an inſult.</p>

I am doubtful all the teams in York and Carliſle will be wanted to go to Pittſburgh; therefore Lancaſter muſt ſend the number to thoſe places. Two hundred teams will be immediately wanted to convey the proviſions from Lancaſter, Lebanon and Rhemes-town, and four hundred to convey the proviſions from this city to New Windſor. It is abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould be furniſhed without the leaſt delay, as the conſequences may be of the worſt kind; the fleet and army depend on it, as the proviſions provided for the army have been ſent to the fleet.</p>

                           <p>BEFORE Plunket Fleeſon, eſquire, one of the juſtices of the peace in and for the ſame city, comes Jeſſe Jordan; who, being duly ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, That he, the deponent, on the ſixteenth of October laſt, and for ſome time before and after, was one of the waggon maſters for Cheſter county, in this ſtate; that upon that day he received orders from Andrew Boyd, waggon maſter general for Cheſter county, to proceed to Philadelphia with a brigade of waggons, twelve in number, and there take orders from the quarter maſter in Philadelphia, and proceed in purſuance of such orders as he ſhould further direct, on the public ſervice; that the brigade was called out to perform their tour of duty, under the waggon law of this ſtate; that he accordingly proceeded with the brigade to Philadelphia, drawing forage and rations on the way, on the written order of Andrew Boyd for that purpoſe; that in Philadelphia, this deponent applied to colonel John Mitchell, deputy quarter maſter general, for orders; that colonel John Mitchell ordered him to proceed to Mr. Reeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh's office in Market-ſtreet, for orders to get a loading; that mr. Reeſburgh's orders were to go down to one Coleman's to get a load of flour and bread, and proceed towards camp; that deponent proceeded to Coleman's, and bad him prepare the loading, and deponent returned to his brigade and got it in readineſs to receive the loading; that ſoon after one mr. Ruſk or Luſk told the brigade they muſt go to Eggharbour, and deponent came down Cheſnut-ſtreet, and ſtopt the waggons before co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Mitchell's door, and deponent enquired of him where they muſt go, whether towards camp or to Eggharbour. Colonel Mitchell told them they might go to Eggharbour, and to go to general Arnold and receive orders from him; that he went accordingly to general Arnold, and ſoon after received the orders from his aid de camp in writing, ſigned David S. Franks, aid de camp; that in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe orders, he proceeded with the brigade of waggons empty to the forks of Eggharbour; that until they arrived within about twenty or twenty five miles of the forks, the deponent was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they were employed in the public ſervice of the continent, and expected they were to take in a loading of public ſtores, and the firſt cauſe of his doubting it was, that they were denied proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the commiſſary of iſſues there, who took copies of general Arnold's and mr. Boyd's orders, and ſaid he was ſure it was private property they were going for; that if deponent had known they were going for private property, he would not willingly have gone, for that he was offered £ 4, a day, and to be found, or £ 6 : 5, and find himſelf, before he left home, to go to Indian river, but choſe rather to go his tour of duty in the public employ; that he proceeded with the brigade to the forks of Eggharbour, drawing proviſions and forage as before, after copies had been taken of the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before mentioned; that they loaded there with ſugar, tea, coffee, ſix ſwivel guns, caſks of nails, broad cloths, linens, cheſts, ſail cloth, and ſome other articles, and brought them up to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; that they croſſed the river loaded, and delivered part of their loading on this ſide the ferry, and the remainder at Stephen Collins's in Second-ſtreet, by order of captain Moore, at the forks, to whom he was referred by the written orders of general Arnold, and who accompanied them up; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent gave no receipt for goods, nor took any on their delivery, captain Moore ſuperintending the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017047_0017_0F9FBDC75A3D6C28"/>delivery in perſon; for that he refuſed a receipt becauſe he was not informed of any public ſtore at which to deliver them, and becauſe the goods were ſo mixed and jumbled together; that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no pay, but that on Saturday laſt he applied to colonel Mitchell with his pay roll, in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual form ſigned by Mr. Boyd, who gave him the order; that colonel Mitchell told him he would have nothing to do with it, deponent muſt apply to general Arnold, that he accordingly went to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold, and gave him his pay roll, in which was charged 55<abbr>ſ.</abbr> a day, being the uſual charge in public ſervice; that general Arnold looked at it, and told him to call again in the evening, and then either he would pay it, or colonel Mitchel would; that deponent returned to colonel Mitchell and informed him of this; colonel Mitchell aſked him how much forage he had drawn, that he (Mitchell) had got an account of his drawing one days forage from Mr. Smith the forage maſter, deponent told him to the beſt of his knowledge he had drawn from Smith for eight days; that colonel Mitchel ſent up and got the account of eight days forage, and then bad deponent go and get his pay roll again from general Arnold, and alter it; that deponent told him he had drawn forage for the whole fourteen days he was out from home; that colonel Mitchel told him then, there muſt be a new pay roll made out; that deponent thereupon went to general Arnold's, and brought back the firſt pay roll, and made out a new pay roll, and was ordered by colonel Mitchell to charge 75<abbr>ſ.</abbr> a day, and go to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold and receive it, and then go to the forage maſter colonel Biddle, (he would ſhew him where when he returned) and pay him 20<abbr>ſ.</abbr> a day for the forage; that deponent carried the new pay roll to general Arnold's, but he was gone out; that deponent returned to colonel Mitchell's, who was alſo gone out, and told his clerk of this; that in making out his pay roll at colonel Mitchell's, before he went this time to general Arnold's, colonel Mitchell ſaid he ſhould not charge or have pay for more than twelve days, (omitting two days of the fourteen) for that they were too ſlow in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Cheſter, although in fact deponents brigade were in town the day before others, who ſet off a day before them; that hereupon deponent took up his papers and was going away, and ſaid he would not ſettle then; colonel Mitchell ſaid he ſhould make it out and ſettle it before he went away, or he (colonel Mitchell) would make a priſoner of him, whereupon deponent complied through ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; that ſince the notice above mentioned to colonel Mitchell's clerk, deponent has made no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther application for his money; that when deponent returned the ſecond time from general Arnold's he brought back the firſt pay roll to colonel Mitchell, with a note wrapped round it, importing that general Arnold thought he ought only to pay from the day that the waggons left Philadelphia, till they returned thither, and that colonel Mitchel might pay the remainder, and colonel Mitchel wrote a note which he ſent by his boy to general Arnold (as he ſaid) informing him that he (general Arnold) muſt pay the whole; that the teams of deponents brigade were appraiſed before they left home, and ſome of the horſes got lamed in the journey; that deponent came to town this time, not being ſent for, in order to ſettle his account, expecting to be paid, as uſual, by the public, for that he never heard from any perſon, before laſt Saturday, that he was to be paid any other way; that ſome time ſince he received a letter from mr. Boyd that juſtice Young, the waggon maſter general wanted to ſee him about this affair, and deſiring him to come to Philadelphia; but that when he left home he ſet off for the head of Elk, not intending or thinking to come to Philadelphia, and after he was at the head of Elk, determined to come here for the ſake of getting his money; that colonel Mitchell told him the executive council wanted to ſee him; that he had no other reaſon to think the public were to pay him, but that he was ordered out in his tour of duty by mr. Boyd.</p>

Q. To mr. Matlack, Do you know any thing reſpecting the erazures and obliteration made in colonel Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell's minute-book?</p>
               <p>A. Having had ſome buſineſs with mr. Mitchell, which remained unfiniſhed, he called to me when I paſſed by his door, while this matter was altercation, informed me, that the buſineſs that was depending between us, was now ſettled in ſuch a manner, that he could pay the money, and that his clerk would pay it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me to ſtep into a back room, as he wanted to ſay ſomething to me upon the ſubject of the certificate of the entry of the waggons, ſaid to be employed by general Arnold, for tranſporting private goods; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to induce me to believe, that the council of Pennſylvania had, without a foundation, ſuſpected that he had detained ſome certificates they had requeſted of him reſpecting theſe waggons: he declared, that there was no entry of the diſcharge of Jeſſe Jordan contained in his books, nor no other entry, but the entry that he had furniſhed them with. The only entry that he had furniſhed to the council was in theſe words: "1778, Oct. 22, Jeſſe Jordan w.m. 12 teams, Cheſter county, went to Egg-harbour, by the direction of general Arnold." This declaration ſurpriſed me, as I knew it otherwiſe, by ſuch kind of evidence as I could not doubt. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I mean to allude to, is a converſation with Jeſſe Jordan, who could have no knowledge of any uſe that could be made of it at that time, who declared, that he ſaw and read in mr. Mitchell's memorandum-book, an entry of his diſcharge from the public ſervice, which was after he returned from Egghabour; and as Jordan was a man of reputation, I could not doubt the fact. I told mr. Mitchell, that I had ſome reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the copy he ſent to the council was not a genuine one. He declared it was. The acquaintance I had with the fact, induced ſome ſurpriſe at the declaration, and I heſitated ſome time before I made him any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I told him, I ſhould take it as a favour, if he would ſhew me the book, in order that it might remove the ſuſpicions that were in my mind with reſpect to the fact. He expreſſed ſome difficulty, on account of his not being able to lay his hand on the book at that time, and ſome reaſons of that kind, which appeared to me to be trifling; and I ſo told him. He ordered his clerk upon that to bring that book, and looked over the book in ſuch a manner, as if he ſound ſome difficulty in recurring to the entry. I mentioned, it was made the twenty-ſecond of October, and he would find it, if he turned to that date. He opened the book at the date, and read the entry. We were ſitting cloſe together at the time, face to face, when he read the entry. I knew it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the words of the certificate he had given; and he then laid the book upon the further end of the table, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four feet from us. Upon his laying down the book, I obſerved the alteration, and aſked him to hand me the book, that I might look at it. With ſome heſitation, he handed it. Upon looking at it, I told him, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration had been made preciſely in the manner I was informed it was made. He then declared that the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was nothing material, and it was made by his order. As the book lay open, the obliteration ſtruck my eye; and ſuch a one as I had never ſeen in a book before, according to my recollection: It ſtruck me, that that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration was on the thirtieth of October, the laſt entry made that day, the day the waggons arrived from Egg-habour, which had croſſed after ſunſet. After conſidering the matter ſome time, I determined to mention what I had ſeen to the council of Pennſylvania, and mentioned it accordingly. Mr. Mitchell was ſent for, and requeſted to bring the book of entries. He appeared and produced the book, and after he was examined, and much having been ſaid on the ſubject, he acknowledged, that the entry on the twenty-ſecond of October had been altered by his direction; that the note on the margin originally ſtood, Gone to Egg-harbour, by order. The word <hi>gone</hi> being altered to the word <hi>went,</hi> and the word <hi>order,</hi> to the word <hi>direction,</hi> abbreviated. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he acknowledged, that the words, <hi>of general Arnold,</hi> were added or not, I cannot aſcertain. And he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the obliteration of the thirtieth of October, in his book, was ordered to be made by him, and intended to conceal and deſtroy an entry of the diſcharge of Jeſſe Jordan, and his brigade, from public ſervice.</p>
               <p>Q Did mr. Mitchell acknowledge, that the words, <hi>of general Arnold,</hi> ſtood in the entry, previous to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration being made?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot recollect. At that day there appeared to be ſome difference in the ink, and I thought the words, <hi>of general Arnold,</hi> appeared to be added.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did mr. Mitchell ſay, or intimate, that the alteration of the entry of the twenty-ſecond of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or the obliteration of the thirtieth of October, was made by the knowledge or advice of general Arnold.</p>
               <p>A. I know of no circumſtance that ſhould induce a ſuſpicion, that he had made the alteration either with the advice or knowledge of general Arnold.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did you enquire of mr. Mitchell what his motives were for making the alterations and obliteration!</p>
               <p>A. Much was ſaid upon the ſubject, and he put it off in this manner, that he wiſhed not to have it known that ſuch an entry had been made, as he thought the entry was an improper one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he aſſign any reaſon why he thought the entry an improper one?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect that he ever aſſigned any clear, explicit reaſon on that ſubject. It appeared to me, that he was fearful, that if the waggons ſhould be conſidered as being in public ſervice, he ſhould be blamed for the manner they were employed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017047_0020_0F9FBDC996CEC690"/>
Q. by general Arnold. What were the reaſons mr. Mitchell aſſigned to council for his making the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and obliteration in the book?</p>
               <p>A. After the acknowledgment of the alterations and obliteration, I believe there were not many queſtions put to him on that head; to thoſe that were, he anſwered evaſively. The anſwers, preciſely, I cannot recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Did mr. Mitchell inform the preſident and council, that the reaſon of the alterations being made, was, that the firſt entry was an improper one, and made by one of his clerks without his knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. I am uncertain, whether he gave that as a reaſon to the council, but I am certain he gave that to me as a reaſon, and added, that it was a memorandum-book that lay in his office, and the entries were made in it by his clerk, without his knowledge, buſineſs being done in his office, as in other offices, by his clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Who were to pay for theſe waggons, and at what price?</p>
               <p>A. The pay-rolls were made out at the common pay allowed for waggons in the public ſervice, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolls were ſent to general Arnold, by order of mr. Mitchell, as I underſtood.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Did the preſident and council ſend for mr. Jordan, with reſpect to the pay of the waggons?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of or recollect. I believe the fact was, they deſired mr. John Mitchell to ſend for him to give evidence before the committee of congreſs.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Did Jeſſe Jordan complain to the preſident and council that he was refuſed payment, previous to their deſiring colonel Mitchell to ſend for him, to give evidence before the committee of congreſs?</p>
               <p>A. The general complaint reſpecting the employment of the waggons was made to council by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Boyd waggon maſter of Cheſter county, through James Young waggon maſter of the ſtate. The council expected that Jeſſe Jordan would be in the city in conſequence of their requeſt to John Mitchell to ſend for him, and did not ſend for him that I know of or recollect. When Mr. Jordan came to the city, information was given to the council of his being in the city, and a reference being had to the depoſition of Jordan, it will appear the manner of his coming to the city. After the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was taken, application was made by him to council, to know how he was to receive his money? and he complained of the ill treatment he had received by a threat from mr. Mitchell of being confined. The council conceiving themſelves bound to take care that the waggoners had their money, advanced to Jeſſe Jordan a ſum to pay thoſe who were in the greateſt neceſſity, conceiving that general Arnold was bound to pay, and that a price would be received of him equal to the price of private hire, and the money ſo advanced ſtands charged accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Did Jeſſe Jordan at any time complain to the preſident and council that I had refuſed him payment of his account which he had preſented to me for the hire of his waggons?</p>
               <p>A. No otherwiſe that I knew of, but by his depoſition which is before the court, and his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have mentioned already, how he ſhould get it?</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Was not the complaint reſpecting the waggons inſtituted by the deſire of the preſident and council, or ſome one of them.</p>
               <p>A. It was not, to the beſt of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know nearly the amount which Jeſſe Jordan charged at firſt for the hire of his brigade of waggons?</p>
               <p>A. No otherwiſe than what appears by the original pay rolls, which were lodged in my office by Andrew Boyd, and which I now deliver to the court.</p>

               <p>Q. by ditto. Did not the preſident and council adviſe mr. Jordan to charge eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon, and to ſend the account to the attorney-general to proſecute?</p>
               <p>A. To anſwer the queſtion generally, I ſay, not that I know; but, in particular, I believe they adviſed him to commence an action for the recovery of the pay, which was allowed for waggons in private ſervice, and I myſelf told him, that ten pounds a day was the price paid in New-Jerſey for that kind of ſervice.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Did the preſident and council write an official letter to mr. Jeſſe Jordan, with theſe words: <hi>We make no doubt but you will be allowed eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon;</hi> and ordering, or adviſing him to ſend the account to the attorney-general to proſecute?</p>
               <p>A. As I had no expectation of being queſtioned concerning a matter of that nature, and having none of the papers preſent, it is impoſſible I ſhould give a preciſe anſwer with reſpect to the words of a letter written ſo
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017047_0022_0F9FBDCB0088DB28"/>long ago; but it was very probable ſomething of that kind was written, as I recollect to have heard ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that kind expreſſed by members of the council of Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>The court adjourned until to-morrow, eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>THE court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major general Arnold acknowledged, that captain Moore, to whom Jeſſe Jordan was ordered to apply for orders at Eggharbour, is the ſame captain Moore, who is named in the protection, as commanding the ſchooner Charming Nancy.</p>
               <p>The judge advocate having produced his evidence with reſpect to the ſeveral charges exhibited againſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold, the general was deſired to proceed in his defence; who called on Timothy Matlack. <abbr>eſq</abbr> and aſked the three following queſtions:</p>
               <p>Q. Did not captain Shewell take the oath of allegiance to the ſtate of Pennſylvania, agreeable to law, by the firſt day of June, 1778?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not inform you that he had?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did captain Shewell produce to the preſident and council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, a certificate of his having taken the oath of allegiance to the ſtate, as required by law?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of or recollect.</p>
               <p>Major general Arnold produced the depoſitions of col. Thomas Proctor, David Beveridge, and Mr. Stephen Collins, which were read, and are as follows:</p>

                           <p>DAVID BEVERIDGE, of the city of Philadelphia, merchant, doth ſolemnly affirm in the above cauſe, that mr.

Shirtliff had divulged the ſcheme of the voyage to ſeveral perſons, and ſpoken too publicly of it) told him he could not be concerned in the matter, and abſolutely declined it, having juſt before this got out of jail, where he had been kept for ſome time, by order of general Howe; that deponent, when he engaged to be part owner of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017047_0023_0F9FBDCD5ED3B558"/>ſaid ſchooner, called on governor M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Kinley, who was lately from Wilmington, then a priſoner in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, and aſked him, what he thought of ſending into Wilmington a cargo of ſalt, and that the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſaid, it would be very acceptable, but in his ſituation, being a priſoner, on parole, he did not chooſe to ſay any thing on the ſubject; that deponent aſked the governor, if he could not give them ſomething like a paſſport, certifying the intention of the voyage, in caſe of accident, which the governor, for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid reaſon, declined; that affirmant adviſed the ſaid company to load her ſo deep with ſalt, as to prevent her taking in goods on freight, the refuſal of which might cauſe a ſuſpicion of their intention, in caſe of her not being fully loaded; that the company accordingly purchaſed a large quantity of ſalt, and put it on board; that affirmant underſtood ſalt was of ſo little value at New-York, that no body would carry it there for nothing; that at the time of the enemy's leaving ſaid city, very high prices were given for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of goods upon freight, and great numbers of veſſels, or the owners thereof, were very deſirous of having their veſſels employed in that way; that he is perfectly ſatisfied, it would have been much to the advantage of the ſaid company, if they had intended going to New-York, to have thrown the ſaid ſalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yerboard, and carried goods upon freight, as he has no doubt at all, but the money they might have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for freight, would have been of much greater value than the ſalt when arrived at New-York, and he thinks of equal value with the ſaid veſſel; that Robert Shewell and William Shirtliff, of the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, were the perſons who conſulted him on the abovementioned ſcheme; that they appeared to be owners of the ſaid ſchooner, as they acted upon all occaſions as ſuch, both as to planning the voyage, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with their goods, and fitting her out; that at the time of purchaſing the ſaid ſalt, it ſold for about three ſhllings and nine-pence per buſhel, but at New-York it was of no value, and ſtore-room would not be given for it, and much had been given away there as he underſtood, and that no veſſels at all carried ſalt to New-York when the fleet went; that he has no reaſon at all to ſuppoſe it was their intention to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any port in poſſeſſion of the enemy; that he went on board the ſaid veſſel and viewed her, but ſaw no guns on board her.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017047_0024_0F9FBDCE90583440"/>and private of the price of ſalt at New York, at the time of purchaſing the ſaid ſalt by the ſaid company, he is ſatisfied the ſaid ſalt, if it had ſafe arrived at New York, would not have ſold for more than one half the ſum it coſt at Philadelphia; that about the time of the enemy's evacuating the ſaid city, it was a very common practice to unload ſalt out of veſſels, for the purpoſe of taking other articles upon freight, that being much more profitable; that this deponent is fully ſatisfied, that had it been the intention of the ſaid Shirtliff and co. to go to New York, it would, after they had bought the ſalt, and put it on board, been really to their advantage to have thrown the ſaid ſalt into the river, and carried goods upon freight for the people, inaſmuch as the ſaid ſalt would not have ſold for near ſo much money there, as the freight of a cargo of merchandiſe for other people would have come to; that this deponent well knows that the ſaid Shirtliff and co. loaded and fitted out another veſſel nearly obout the time abovementioned, and upon the like plan; that ſhe ſailed as he thinks with the firſt diviſion of the fleet, and it afterwards became a matter of public notoriety in the ſaid city, that the ſaid other veſſel made her eſcape from the enemy into Wilmington creek; that the ſuſpicion of the enemy had been very ſtrong againſt the ſaid Shirtliff and co. by reaſon of ſuch large quantities of ſalt being taken on board, which ſuſpicion encreaſed to ſuch a degree after it was known in the city of the ſaid other veſſel's making her eſcape, that it was ſtrongly talked of by the enemy of confining in irons the ſaid Shirtliff who was on board the ſaid ſchooner; that this deponent verily believes that the real and abſolute owners of the ſaid two veſſels with their cargoes are William Shirtliff, William Conſtable, Robert Shewell, James Seagrove, and David Shoemaker, he having been conſulted by ſeveral of them upon the above mentioned plan, having generally underſtood that they were the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and having ſeen them exerciſe every act of ownerſhip therein; that the ſaid veſſel could not have ſailed before the fleet, if it had been the deſire of the owners, unleſs in company with other Britiſh veſſels; that he is totally clear, and has no kind of doubt, but that from the whole tenor of the ſaid company's conduct, it was their intention to run into ſome port in the united ſtates not in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the enemy; that he adviſed them to let ſome of their goods paſs under the name of other perſons, to prevent ſuſpicions in caſe they appeared to be the ſole owners; that mr.

We do not know of general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold's making any purchaſes of goods of any kind, directly or indirectly; and we have every reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that no ſuch purchaſes were made either by general Arnold or his agents, except a few trifling ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to furniſh his table, and for his family's uſe, moſt of which were ſupplied him by the quarter maſter or commiſſary. General Arnold's invoices, minute and account books being always open to our inſpection, confirms us in our belief as mentioned above.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Q. to major Franks. Were you preſent at juſtice Paſchall's when major Clarkſon made oath to the contents of the paper you have heard read?</p>
               <p>A. I was; and that is the paper which major Clarkſon ſigned, it having been written by him.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold to major Franks. What do you know about ſhe ſhutting up the ſhops and ſtores in Philadelpia?</p>
               <p>A. The day after I came into town, which was the day general Arnold came, general Joſeph Reed, who is now preſident of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and myſelf met. He told me that they were ſelling goods in town, and adviſed me to ſend a crier round to prohibit the ſale of goods. I at firſt agreed to it, but afterwards thought it was doing more than I had a right to. I met him again, and told him that I would put it off until general Arnold came. When general Arnold came to town, general Reed came to his quarters, and upon conſulting with him, wrote a proclamation, which I think was the ſame that was publiſhed, with ſome alterations.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Were the alterations made in it, material?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you poſitive that general Reed drew up the proclamation?</p>
               <p>A. I ſaw general Reed at the table drawing it up; general Arnold and mr. Boudinott were in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know of my having given licences to purchaſe goods, though applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made by my intimate friends for them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know of your intimate friends having aſked for licences to purchaſe goods; but I know that many applications were refuſed, and I know of no licences being granted to any perſon to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe goods.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know at what time the ſhops and ſtores were opened, and every body permitted to purchaſe?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the particular time?</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know whether general Arnold, or any perſon by his orders, directed any goods to be laid by for his uſe?</p>
               <p>A. No; except ſome trifling articles from the commiſſary and quarter maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:017047_0026_0F9FBDD03B8FECC0"/>
Q. by general Arnold. Do you know of any articles being laid by, except ſome trifling articles for my own uſe, the uſe of my family, for general Waſhington, and for one or two other officers?</p>
               <p>A. No; except two pipes of wine, which were afterwards drank in the family!</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know whether the two pipes of wine were purchaſed or laid by previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſhops being opened?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect that they were purchaſed before the ſhops were opened.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know whether any of the articles that were laid by, were taken from the ſhops previous to the legal opening of them?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Were not all the articles of clothing of conſequence that were ſupplied me, which are mentioned to have been for general Waſhington and ſeveral other officers, as well as myſelf, ſupplied by the clothier general or his agent?</p>
               <p>A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know what time Congreſs arrived in Philadelphia?</p>
               <p>A. I do not. They were there the fourth of July.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Were not the ſhops open at that time?</p>
               <p>A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. by the court. Do you know whether general Arnold purchaſed any part of the Charming Nancy or her cargo?</p>
               <p>A. I do not of my own knowledge; but I have heard general Arnold ſay he did, and I have alſo heard Mr. Seagrove ſay he did.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Was it previous or ſubſequent to general Arnold's granting the paſs?</p>
               <p>A. It was ſubſequent.</p>
               <p>The court adjourned until to morrow eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>The court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major general Arnold adverted to the firſt charge, and proceeded to produce evidence reſpecting it.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold to Timothy Matlack, <abbr>eſq</abbr> Do you know whether the owners of the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nancy voluntarily remained with the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. Mr. Shewell did as I underſtand. I underſtood it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Did Mr. Shewel aſſign his reaſon for remaining with the ememy?</p>
               <p>A. If he aſſigned any reaſons I do not recollect what they were?</p>
               <p>Lieutenant colonel Hamilton being ſworn,</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know Mr. Seagrove's general political character?</p>
               <p>A. I have heard it frequently diſcuſſed, and very different opinions entertained of it. Many were of opinion that he was warmly attached to the American cauſe, and others that he was not. He had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial connection of a very delicate nature with a mr. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Evers, reputedly a diſaffected perſon, which was ſuppoſed by thoſe acquainted with him to have reſtrained his political conduct, and made him leſs active in favour of America than he otherwiſe would have been; others conſidered him as a man of addreſs, who wiſhed to ſtand fair with both parties, though in reality more friendly to the oppoſite party than to us. I have heard ſeveral liberal men ſpeak of his ſituation with a degree of compaſſion, as producing an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his principles and his private connections. My own opinion of him was favourable, from a general idea of his integrity, and from a particular circumſtance which happened as our troops were evacuating New York. I was among the laſt of our army that left the city; the enemy was then on our right flank, between us and the main body of our army. At about three miles from town, on our march out, mr. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove was at a houſe, the name of which I forget, in company with ſeveral ladies and gentlemen, he left them, and came up to me with ſtrong appearances of anxiety in his looks, informed me that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had landed at Harlaam, and were puſhing acroſs the iſland, adviſed us to keep as much to the left as poſſible, to avoid being intercepted; the information he gave us, I believe, was not true, as to the place where he ſaid the enemy had landed, they having in fact landed in a different place, but he could not have framed it for any bad purpoſe, becauſe the advice he gave us muſt have been good and proper in any event, as it was known that the enemy had not landed any troops in the north river on our left, by inclining to which courſe we ſtood the beſt chance of avoiding that body which had landed on our right. The favourable impreſſions I before had of mr. Seagrove were confirmed by this incident, not ſo much from the nature of the tranſaction, as from an appearance of ſincerity and concern ſtrongly pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017047_0027_0F9FBDD108179438"/>in his countenance; which had the more weight as he remained in the city, and might have run ſome riſque from what he did. At an early period of the war he entered into an independent company, but the company afterwards came to nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Has not the political conduct of Mr. Seagrove ſince confirmed the favourable impreſſions you had before of him?</p>
               <p>A. It has, ſo far as it has come to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto to major Franks. Do you know Mr. Seagrove's general political character?</p>
               <p>A. I knew nothing of his political general character of my own knowledge, previous to your giving the protection for the Charming Nancy; but I have underſtood that he was conſidered as a whig. Since that period I have been in actual ſervice with him.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know the political general character of the perſons who were owners of the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nancy, previous to my giving the protection for her?</p>
               <p>A. I never knew either mr. Shirtliff or mr. Conſtable before I went to Philadelphia, or ſaw them in my life before, that I remember. I knew mr. Shewell before the protection was granted, and always ſuppoſed him to be well affected to America. He was in one of the militia companies in Philadelphia, ſome time before the enemy got poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did he tell you his reaſons for ſtaying in Philadelphia?</p>
               <p>A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. court. What were they?</p>
               <p>A. The impracticability of removing at the time; his wife having been brought to bed and dangerouſly ill. He told me frequently that his intentions were to remove out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Did captain Shewell inform you that he had taken the oath of allegiance to the ſtate of Pennſylvania, previous to my granting him the paſs?</p>
               <p>A. I think he did, and ſaid previous to the time directed by the ſtate of Pennſylvania; and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from him that he had taken it out of town, and had a certificate of it.</p>
               <p>Q. by the court. Did he inform you at what place and before whom he took the oath of allegiance?</p>
               <p>A. He did not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Did you underſtand, at the time captain Shewell applied to me for the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he produced to me a certificate of his having taken the oath of allegiance to the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, agreeable to law?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know what paſſed at the time, but I underſtood from him at that time, that he had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of that nature.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did you underſtand how long mr. Shewell had been out of Philadelphia before he obtained the protection from general Arnold?</p>
               <p>A. He was time enough out to take the oath of allegiance to the ſtate of Pennſylvania, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from him, which was ordered to be taken, I think, by the firſt of June. I know that mr. Shewell gave his vote at an election in Philadelphia, which he would not have been permitted to give, had he not produced a certificate of his having taken the oath of allegiance by the firſt of June.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the fifth charge, major Franks produced in behalf of the general ſays, That he went to colonel Mitchell's by deſire of general Arnold, to know whether he could ſpare him ſome waggons to tranſport ſome goods that were in danger of falling into the enemy's hands at Eggharbour. He was told, either by colonel Mitchell or his clerk, that waggons could not be ſpared at that time, but that ſoon it might happen, as they expected a number of waggons in town; he brought that anſwer to general Arnold, and ſome days after general Arnold told him to go to the quarter maſter's, to enquire and ſee if poſſible the waggon maſter who was to conduct a brigade of waggons for him, and to order them to go to Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbour, or the forks, and there to take a captain Moore's directions, reſpecting what he was to do. When he got to the office he wrote a letter ordering the waggon maſter ſo to do, and ſigned it officially; after which the waggon maſter went.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Were not frequent applications made for the waggons before I procured them?</p>
               <p>A. I went once myſelf, as I have ſaid before, and I believe major Clarkſon went once or twice, and I believe you went yourſelf. It appeared to me ſeveral applications had been made for them.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Did you not view the requeſt made for the waggons of a private nature, and not officially?</p>
               <p>A. I underſtood you were to pay for the waggons for the tranſportation of the goods, and that it was a matter of favour in colonel Mitchell to let you have them.</p>
               <p>Q. de. How happened it that you ſigned the order to Jeſſe Jordan officially?</p>
               <p>A. I had no particular directions from you ſo to do; that from cuſtom I always ſigned aid de camp at
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017047_0028_0F9FBDD1D1B74358"/>the end of my name; I myſelf might have probably thought at that time, that it might have been the means of his executing the order with more alacrity, as diſpatch was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Q. by gen. Arnold. Do you know of my ſending to colonel Mitchell for the account of the hire of the waggons, previous to any charge or publication made againſt me?</p>
               <p>A. I do; I went once or twice myſelf, and I believe you ſent major Clarkſon.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. When I went to camp in February 1779, was not money left with major Clarkſon for the purpoſe of paying for the waggons, and orders given to him accordingly?</p>
               <p>A. I think, before we ſet out to go to camp, the waggon maſter brought an account againſt you for the hire of the waggons. You told the man to get it certified by colonel Mitchell, to come in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon with the certificate, and you would pay him. Whether he came in the afternoon or not, I cannot ſay; but we ſet out for camp, and you informed me that you had left money with major Clarkſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that account. Clarkſon told you when you returned, that he had not paid the money, as the man had not called, or that he could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. court. How long was the account preſented for the hire of the waggons, before you ſet out for camp?</p>
               <p>A. I believe two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. by court. Was that the firſt time the account had been preſented to general Arnold?</p>
               <p>A. I think it was, as there had been frequent applications made for the account, and it could not be procured.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Did you at any time, through the courſe of the tranſaction, underſtand that general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold officially employed theſe waggons?</p>
               <p>A. I underſtood that general Arnold was to pay for the waggons; that he got them as a favour, and that they were not to tranſport public ſtores, but private property for himſelf and friends, and that he did not order them officially.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. When you went to colonel Mitchell for the waggons, did you inform him that they were wanted to tranſport private property?</p>
               <p>A. I did. I told him that the goods were in imminent danger, and told him, that the loſs of ſo many goods would be a loſs to the continent, as we wanted goods.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the laſt charge againſt the general, Mr. John Hall was produced, who was ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the alterations in colonel Mitchell's minute book, of the twenty-ſecond of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the obliteration in the ſame book, of the thirtieth of October, reſpecting Jeſſe Jordan's wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the original entry yourſelf with or without orders?</p>
               <p>A. I made it myſelf without orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the entry in the margin reſpecting the waggon?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. With or without orders?</p>
               <p>A. Without any orders.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the original entry?</p>
               <p>A. As far as I can recollect, it was, Gone to Eggharbour, by order; or went, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words, <hi>of general Arnold</hi> mentioned in the firſt entry in the margin?</p>
               <p>A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the addition of the words, <hi>of general Arnold</hi> made, and what was the reaſon of it?</p>
               <p>A. It was made in the courſe of one day, or two days, and it was made to aſſiſt my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the alteration with or without orders?</p>
               <p>A. I made it without orders.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reaſon of your making the alteration?</p>
               <p>A. The firſt reaſon was, I thought it was not good Engliſh, and when I came to reflect on it, I made the alteration, thinking I worded the entry improper.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reaſon of your changing the word order to direction?</p>
               <p>A. I can give no reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did general Arnold make application for waggons to go to Eggharbour?</p>
               <p>A. Major Franks or major Clarkſon came to colonel Mitchell's office, where I was, and made the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to me, in colonel Mitchell's abſence.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the application made?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:017047_0029_0F9FBDD2B7F5BEA0"/>
A. The application was, that he, general Arnold, wanted a brigade of waggons, and to ſend the waggon maſter to him for directions: It was not made in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either major Franks or major Clarkſon mention for what purpoſe the waggons were wanted?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did colonel Mitchell ſpeak to you reſpecting the waggons, previous to the application?</p>
               <p>A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did he converſe with you on the ſubject afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. Not until ſome time a January.</p>
               <p>Q. court. What paſſed between you then?</p>
               <p>A. When Jordan came to town, ſometime in January, and had his pay roll made out, colonel Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell told him, he muſt go to general Arnold, and get his pay. I then turned to the book, and ſaw he had been from the twenty ſecond to the thirtieth of October. Colonel Mitchell told me, that it ſhould not be there at all, and had no buſineſs in the book, as general Arnold was to pay the hire of the waggons, and he was angry with me on account of it, upon which I took up my pen and obliterated the entry of the thirtieth of October, determining in my own mind, that col. Mitchell ſhould never give me a frown for it again, and that it ſhould not appear in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did you underſtand why the hire of the waggons ſhould become a private charge to general Arnold?</p>
               <p>A. I then underſtood by colonel Mitchell's mentioning what I have ſaid to me, that they had been ſent to tranſport property that was not the public's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time any converſation with Jeſſe Jordan, or any of the waggoners employed in that affair, on the ſubject?</p>
               <p>A. Not until after Jordan returned from Eggharbour: When he returned, I went and made a mark of his return, and told him to make his pay roll out: He ſaid, he had not time to do it then, but would when he came to town again.</p>
               <p>Q. court. What converſation paſſed between you and Jordan when he returned again?</p>
               <p>A. Col. Mitchell was in the office when he produced his pay roll; he handed the pay roll to colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Mitchell, who looked at it. Colonel Mitchell turned to me, and aſked, whether Jordan had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any orders for forage? I anſwered, No; and he aſked Jordan himſelf whether he had received any forage? he ſaid, he had got an order for forage, and on being aſked by colonel Mitchell from whom, he ſaid, from colonel Hilzeimer at the ſtables. The colonel ſent up to mr. Hilzeimer, to know what number of days he had got. I don't recollect the number of days that he got an order for from mr. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeimer, but colonel Mitchell mentioned, that he muſt make out his pay roll at the price, as if he had got no forage, and was angry at his having got forage, and that general Arnold was to pay him, and deſired him to go and repay mr. Hilzeimer the amount of what forage he had received from him. Jordan, as far as I recollect, made out another pay roll.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Had you ever any converſation with general Arnold, about the waggons?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did general Arnold know of any of theſe entries being made, or the alteration of them, previous to your doing it?</p>

                           <p>Mr. Boudinot's ſtate of facts, relative to general Arnold's ſhutting up the ſhops in Philadelphia, in 1778, as far as he can recollect, given at general Arnold's requeſt.</p>
                           <p>IT will be neceſſary to premiſe, that the tranſactions referred to happened eighteen months ago; ſince which I have been afflicted with a ſevere indiſpoſition for ten months: therefore cannot but ſpeak with great diſſidence as to particular circumſtances.</p>
                           <p>Being at Philadelphia when general Arnold took poſſeſſion of the city, I called on him ſeveral times, and found him in a ſtate of health, which I thought rendered him unequal to the fatigue of his then ſtation. He was much crowded with buſineſs, and I ventured to warn him of the ill conſequences of ſo much attention to it, and adviſed to ſeveral regulations I thought neceſſary. He ſhewed me certain reſolutions of congreſs relative to the goods, that ſhould be found in the city, until the arrival of joint committees of congreſs and the executive council, and the public officers who were to purchaſe for the army, or ſomething to this effect.</p>
                           <p>I adviſed the general to the iſſuing of public orders, to prevent the ſelling of goods until the arrival of the committees aforeſaid, and alſo to nominate a number of the citizens of eſtabliſhed character, to ſuperintend and regulate the little affairs of the citizens in the mean while, ſo as to prevent his being perplexed with the civil as well as military department; and I mentioned ſeveral gentlemen, whoſe political characters I thought he might depend on. While we were talking, mr. Joſeph Reed, (now his excellency the preſident of the ſtate) then alſo a member of congreſs, came in and told the general he had been making a few memorandums of ſome little matters which he (mr. Reed) thought
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017047_0031_0F9FBDD5CBFB8140"/>neceſſary for his attention, and which otherwiſe might eſcape the general's notice. Mr. Reed then read them from a paper he produced, and I immediately told him they were very ſimilar to what I had juſt been recommending to the general, and repeated to him what I had been ſaying. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he had the ſubſtance of it down, except one or two points, which one of us immediately added to the paper he had. The general then begged, that we would draw up what we thought neceſſary, and he would have it printed. Mr. Reed then ſat down and drew up a draught of what he thought proper, and I believe I corrected it, but am not certain. I cannot with certainty aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the particulars of this draught, but and clear in my own mind, that it contained the amount of what we both adviſed the general to, and particularly to the prevention of the ſale of goods, until the orders of congreſs were complied with. And my reaſon for this is, that I well remember to have adviſed ſeveral friends to be careful not to ſell the next day, as ſuch a public prohibition had gone to the preſs.</p>

               <p>With reſpect to the laſt charge, the general produced colonel Mitchel, d. q. m. g. who being ſworn, ſays, About the middle of October laſt, general Arnold ſent for me; on my waiting on him, he informed me he wanted ten or twelve waggons to go to Eggharbour to bring ſome goods, which were in danger of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the enemy's hands, and that he would pay the expence. I informed him, I had none at that time could be ſpared from public ſervice; but when there was, I would ſend the waggon maſter to him. He aſked me, if there was not waggons ſent to Eggharbour with forage and proviſions, and if they could not bring a load back for him. I anſwered, yes, there were ſeveral ſent, but I believed they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, that if I had occaſion to ſend any more with either proviſion or forage, and there was no public ſtorm to bring up, they might load for him, and it would ſave the public half the expence, as he muſt pay the hire back; this he ſeemed pleaſed with, but not having occaſion to ſend any of the articles above-mentioned, the general ſent to me ſeveral times to know, if I could let him have the waggons; my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, he ſhould have the firſt could be ſpared without injury to the public ſervice. On the 22d of October, Jeſſe Jordan, a waggon maſter from Chaſter county, came to town with twelve towns; a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Jordan to go to general Arnold, who wanted him to go to Egghar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that he would pay him, and give him his directions. Mr. Jordan accordingly want from me, and, I believe, called on the general. From that time I heard nothing farther on the ſubject, till mr. Jordan had returned, when he was told to call on general Arnold for his pay; in anſwer to which he ſaid he would not ſtay at that time to make out a pay roll, but would return and get his pay, or words to that effect. And after he was gone home ſome time, I aſked one of the clerks if he heard whether Jordan was paid by general Arnold. I think he ſaid he did not know. I afterwards ſaw the general, who told me the waggon maſter had not called on him for his pay, and deſired when I ſaw him I would let him know, or words to that purpoſe. I deſired my clerk to be careful that mr. Jordan's hire was not paid in my office, and to pay no rolls without my approbation. From this time, about the beginning of November, I heard nothing of the matter that I can recollect, till the ſecretary of the executive council wrotes me for what information I could give them reſpecting the waggons ſent by general Arnold to Eggharbour, to which requeſt I gave the following anſwer, dated the 19th January.</p>

I ſhall at all times be ready to give your excellency and the honourable council every information you think neceſſary for the good of the public, or this ſtate in particular, which relates to my office, or the buſineſs of the department; as I have no deſire to conceal any part of my conduct as a public officer, having conducted the buſineſs under my direction with integrity and juſtice to the public. The following are the ſtate of the facts required, viz. In the month of October laſt, at
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017047_0032_0F9FBDD702FF0378"/>the time the enemy had landed ſome troops at Eggharbour, general Arnold deſired I would furniſh him with a brigade of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

I informed him he ſhould have the waggon maſter of the firſt brigade, which could be ſpared from the public ſervice, ſent to him, when he would give him ſuch orders as he pleaſed. Accordingly, about the 22d of October mr. Jordan was ſent to the general to receive his directions, having at that time ſent forward a large ſupply for the army, &amp;c. When Jordan returned, he was deſired to make out his account to general Arnold, to be paid. I do not know where the loading was ſtored, nor whoſe property it was, further than what is before mentioned. A greater number of continental teams corning in than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, enabled me to comply with general Arnold's requeſt without any inconvenience to the ſervice. If there is any thing further in which I can ſatisfy your excellency and the council, I will wait on you at any time with pleaſure.</p>

Jordan, a waggon maſter in his ſervice might be ſent for; on which I ſent two expreſſes to enquire if he was in the quarter maſter's department, and if ſo, to ſend him up to wait on the preſident and council; but they returned with information that he was not in the ſervice. This I informed his excellency of, who, if I can recollect, and to the beſt of my memory and recollection, ſaid the council had laid the matter before congreſs, and therefore it was not neceſſary to ſend again for him. I offered to ſend any orders of his, by expreſs or otherwiſe, as he thought proper. The next I heard of this affair was on the 30th of January, when mr. Jordan came to town, and called at my office. I told him to go to general Arnold for his pay, that I had nothing to do with it, and aſked him why he did not call for it long before that time. He anſwered he had been ſick, and could not come to town, and I think ſaid he was ſick when he returned from Eggharbour. I told him he muſt wait on the preſident and council before he left town; that they had ſent for him, and it was neceſſary he ſhould call on them. I alſo aſked him if he had made any complaints to colonel Boyd, and for what reaſon he did make ſuch complaints. He ſaid, he had made none, nor had he ſeen colonel Boyd ſince his return from Eggharbour; but he believed ſome of the waggoners had made ſome complaints which he had never ſeen. On this he went from me, as I believe, to general Arnold, and returned with a note from him to me, as follows, viz.</p>

               <p>This anſwer was ſent directly to the general. Whether mr. Jordan went to him then or not, I do not recollect; but on producing his pay roll, I found he had charged as if he received forage, which ſurprized me much, not having been informed or known he had drawn any forage for more than one day; on which I ſent to the forage maſter to know the truth of it, who returned me an account that he had drawn forage. I then deſired he would make out his pay roll as if he had not forage, and to pay the amount of the forage to Owen Biddle, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> agent for the com. gen. of forage. Mr. Jordan had made

I told him of it, and the mode eſtabliſhed for payment of teams, and that it was agreeable to the waggon law, and the opinion of the late waggon maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter general, James Young, <abbr>eſq</abbr> He ſeemed not contented with this deduction of two days at firſt, but on my aſſuring him it was the uſual and cuſtomary time, and offering to ſhew him ſeveral pay rolls ſettled agreeable to the law, and what I then ſaid, and that I inſiſted on the matter being ſettled before he left town, as I wiſhed to be clear of any further trouble with it, and deſiring him not to neglect to call on the preſident of this ſtate, and informing him where he lived, he aſked for paper, pen, and ink, and liberty to make out his pay roll in the office, all which were granted him, he ſeemed to me perfectly ſatisfied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and in good humour. I aſſiſted him in bringing out the amount, and I believe the clerk caſt it up for him. He left me in this diſpoſition, and went to general Arnold to receive his money, but ſoon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, the general was out. I told him to call on him again, and let me know if he refuſed to pay him. From that time I never ſaw mr. Jordan, but once at ſome diſtance. General Arnold called on me on the Monday, Tueſday, or Wedneſday following, I cannot recollect which, and aſked me if I heard anything of mr. Jordan; that he wanted to pay him; that he was going out of town; that he would leave the money with major Clarkſon, and requeſted I would ſend mr. Jordan to him to receive his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but if he would not come, begged I would ſend for major Clarkſon, who would bring the money. I have omitted to mention in the proper place, that on mr. Jordan's return, he was told to call on general Arnold for his pay; in anſwer to which he ſaid, he would not ſtay at that time to make out his pay roll, but would return and get his pay, or words to that purpoſe. On looking at a memorandum book in the office, kept to aſſiſt my memory and my clerks only, I ſaw the words, "Gone to Eggharbour, by order of general Arnold," oppoſite to the word Jeſſe Jordan, w. m. 12 teams, Cheſter county, as here put down. I told the clerk, general Arnold did not give me orders to ſend him, and therefore it ſhould be, "Went to Egghar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by directions of general Arnold," which he immediately altered; and on obſerving on the other ſide, 30th, Jeſſe Jordan returned from Eggharbour, I told the clerk, as I did not think I had any concern with the waggons after they had been ſent to general Arnold, that thoſe words were unneceſſary, and deſired he would ſtrike it out, which he did immediately. This happened the week after Jordan was at my office laſt. On general Arnold's return, he ſent to let me know, he wanted a certificate of what paſſed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waggons and the payment. As I wiſhed to avoid any further concern in this matter, I did not go to wait on him, till he ſent ſeveral times. When I waited on him, He was in his chamber; he told me what he ſent for me was, to give him a certificate of what I knew reſpecting the waggons he ſent to Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbour, and what I knew reſpecting his deſire to pay them, as the council had charged him with refuſing to pay them. I anſwered, I was very deſirous to have no further concern in the affair; that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the preſident and council what I knew of it, a copy of which I believed he had, and that I had alſo given a committee of congreſs what information I could; that I would freely go before any authority that had right to enquire into it, and give my teſtimony, but I could not give any certificate, or have my name in the public papers, which might ſubject me to diſagreeable anſwers, as the papers were full of vindictive and abuſe on many reſpectable characters. He ſaid, it was very cruel and hard to be refuſed a true ſtate of the matter, and ſhewed me a paper he had wrote, I believe read it, I alſo read it, when he aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, if it was the true ſtate of the matter. I anſwered, it might be near it, but if I ſigned any I would write it myſelf; that the words were not expreſſed as I would do, if I gave any, but ſtill requeſted he would not inſiſt on it, and wiſhed he would excuſe me; and alſo ſaid, I would relate the matter, if he would not publiſh it; but his anſwer was, that would not do, as he wanted the facts to publiſh. I endeavoured to excuſe myſelf, but he earneſtly requeſted, as a gentleman, I would give him a ſtate of the matter, and requeſted I would take the paper home, and ſend him a certificate. I told him, I would conſider of it, and let him know. On full conſideration, I was ſtill deſirous of avoiding any thing that was to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with my name; but on his ſending to me ſeveral times for a certificate, I wrote one, which, on conſulting a friend, whoſe opinion I eſteemed, he thought an improper one, on which I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to give a copy of my letter to his excellency, of the 19th January, which is before recited; but from the words, on Saturday, the 30th January, as recited in the former part of this narrative, was added as what paſſed reſpecting the payments. This I ſent to the general, who returned it the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſiring I would ſend him a certificate. I told the gentleman who brought it, I could give no other than that. He ſaid he believed it would not do. I anſwered I would do no more. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the paper he gave me, was ſent for, (as I kept no copy, do not recollect the contents) which I returned. The general afterwards called on me, and requeſted I would give him a certificate. I aſſured him I could give no other, and wiſhed he would excuſe me. He ſeemed diſpleaſed at my
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017047_0034_0F9FBDD8850A15B8"/>anſwer, and ſaid another gentleman's influence, naming him, was greater than his. I aſſured him I was not influenced by any one, and only wanted to avoid any publication, but that he might have the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I wrote him. He took it, and left me, as I thought diſpleaſed. And thus this matter ended, having had no converſation with the general on the ſubject ſince.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of February, I received a letter from colonel Pettit, a. q. m. gen. encloſing a letter from the ſecretary of council, deſiring a certificate of the entry of the waggons ſent to Eggharbour, of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they croſſed, and of their return; to which gave the following anſwer:</p>

                     <p>IN anſwer to your's of this morning, I have to inform you, that I have no other entry of Jeſſe Jordan, w. m. than a memorandum of his coming to my office, on the 22d October laſt, when he was deſired to call on general Arnold, who wanted him to go to Eggharbour, that he would pay him, and give him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. From that time I conceived mr. Jordan's waggons to be totally diſcharged from being under my directions. I therefore neither gave him orders to go to any ferry, or any kind of inſtructions, but what is mentioned above. I do not know at what ferry he paſſed, either going or returning. I ſhall at all times moſt cheerfully give the preſident and council every information and ſatisfaction, on this or any other tranſaction in my department, which they may require. All that I know of the matter, I have communicated to them.</p>

The reaſon was there fully explained.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of February, colonel Pettit called on me to aſk me for the memorandum book, to ſhew to the council. I told, he ſhould have any book I had, with pleaſure, from this time to the 25th, when I was directed to appear before council, by their order of the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. After the waggons had been employed, and previous to any charge made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me for the ſame, did I not ſeveral times ſend to you for the account, or to direct the waggon maſter to call on me, that I might pay him?</p>
               <p>A. You did.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Did mr. Jordan ever inform you that I had refuſed payment?</p>
               <p>A. Jordan did not tell me that you had refuſed to pay him, but had refuſed to pay the pay roll, as it was made out, and I underſtood from you, that you wanted to know what you had to pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Do you know whether Jeſſe Jordan ſaw me, after his pay roll was properly made out?</p>
               <p>A. I do not; but he told me he called, and you were not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. Do you know the reaſon why he did not ſee me after his pay roll was made out, to get his money?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know, having no converſation with him after the anſwer before given.</p>
               <p>Q. by ditto. When you gave Jeſſe Jordan orders to call on me for inſtructions, did you think he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he was diſcharged from the public ſervice?</p>
               <p>A. I am not certain that he underſtood it ſo, but that was my meaning, as I was buſy at the time, and did not explain myſelf more particularly. I had uſually given written inſtructions, but did not give Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan any, and for this reaſon I thought he underſtood he was diſcharged from the public ſervice.</p>
               <p>Q. Were theſe waggons drawn from the ſtate of Pennſylvania for the public ſervice?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:017047_0035_0F9FBDD943C16918"/>
A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a great demand made on the ſtate of Pennſylvania by you, about that time, or a ſhort time previous to it, for waggons for the public ſervice?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, for a conſiderable number, but the number I do not recollect, in conſequence of applications made from different departments to me for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were theſe waggons part of the number that were demanded?</p>
               <p>A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did general Arnold know of there having been a great demand made on the ſtate for waggons, when he applied to you for a number of them?</p>
               <p>A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conſider general Arnold's application to you for waggons as a requeſt, or an official order?</p>
               <p>A. General Arnold being commanding officer in the ſtate, he made that requeſt to me, and I conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as my duty to oblige him as my ſuperior officer in every thing in my power, which I would not have done to any others officer in the united ſtates, who was then preſent. General Arnold having made that requeſt to me, and telling me the reaſon, that it was to remove property that was likely to fall into the hands of the enemy, I complied with it, thinking it was my duty to do ſo, he paying all the expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not general Arnold's orders during his command in Philadelphia generally couched in terms of requeſt or deſire?</p>
               <p>A. They were generally polite, and ſuch as one gentleman would write to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceive that you would have been accountable officially to general Arnold for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, had you refuſed a compliance with his requeſt for the waggons?</p>
               <p>A. I did not conſider that matter at the time the requeſt was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceive yourſelf at liberty either to comply with the requeſt or refuſe it?</p>
               <p>A. From the request being frequently repeated, I conceived that I would not refuſe it without incurring his diſpleaſure, as commanding officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you thought the requeſt official, would you not have complied with it without a repetition?</p>
               <p>A. Had it been communicated to me in writing, I ſhould have complied with it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did you think the refuſal of the requeſt would or could have been treated as a diſobedience of orders?</p>
               <p>A. I did not think of it in that point of view at all. General Arnold having requeſted of me waggons to bring off property them in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, I conceived it my duty to let him have them, as ſoon as it could be done without injury to the public ſervice, be paying the whole expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put theſe waggons into general Arnold's hands in the uſual courſe of your official buſineſs?</p>
               <p>A. General Arnold having requeſted of me waggons to bring off property then in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, I conceived it my duty to let him have them, as ſoon as it could be done, without injury to the public ſervice, he paying the whole expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the waggon maſter of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in his letters, tell you, the waggons could not go out of the ſtate, and remonſtrate againſt the great call?</p>
               <p>A. There was a hundred and fifty waggons called for from the quarter maſter of the ſtate of Jerſey; the time I do not recollect, but believe it to be ſome weeks before Jordan's waggons were ſent to Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbour. Upon that requeſt being made to furniſh them the waggon maſter general of the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania remonſtrated againſt the great call for waggons, and gave as a reaſon that no waggons were to be ſent to the ſtate of Jerſey, to carry ſtores from thence to the army, in conſequence of which, none were ſent to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of this remonſtrance?</p>
               <p>A. I believe he did, but cannot be certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What reaſons had you to ſuppoſe the general knew of the remonſtrance?</p>
               <p>A. No other than that the general was uſually acquainted with every tranſaction I was, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, of that nature, and this matter was much talked of, not in his preſence that I recollect; and I believe ſome of the delegates of the ſtate of Pennſylvania had a meeting with the waggon maſter general on that ſubject.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Don't you recollect when I applied for the waggons, that I requeſted the favour of you, if they could not be ſpared from the public ſervice, to let your people hire me private waggons?</p>
               <p>A. At one time when you ſpoke to me upon the ſubject, you mentioned the words than you have now mentioned, and I told you it was impoſſible it could be done, or I would do it with pleaſure. You then ſaid, as ſoon as they could be ſpared from public ſervice, you would be glad to have them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:017047_0036_0F9FBDDA0396FDB8"/>
Q. When you ſent the waggon maſter Jordan to general Arnold, did you inform general Arnold that he was in public ſervice with the waggons?</p>
               <p>A. I ſent no notice to general Arnold at all; only told the waggon maſter to call on him for his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that he would ſend him to the Jerſeys and pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Jordan refuſed a compliance with your orders to go to general Arnold, would you have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed him accountable to you for his refuſal?</p>
               <p>A. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did you on reading general Arnold's note of the 30th of January, conceive that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold's intention that the public ſhould pay any part of the hire of Jordan's waggons?</p>
               <p>A. I conceived from general Arnold's note, that he thought he only ought to pay for the time the waggoners were ſent to him until the day they returned; but my opinion was, that he ſhould pay from the time the waggons were called out into public ſervice until they returned home. But I did not conceive that general Arnold meant by that, that the public ſhould pay any part, but that it was a miſtake in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of calculating the pay.</p>
               <p>Q. If you conceived that general Arnold did not expect that the public ſhould pay for any part of the hire of Jordan's teams, what was the reaſon of your mentioning in your's of the 30th of January, 1779, that if he ordered you ſhould pay any part of the time due Jordan for the hire of his teams, you would obey be order?</p>
               <p>A. Becauſe, as commander in chief, I ſhould have conſidered his written order for that purpoſe, as a sufficient voucher to produce to the public.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Did general Arnold know any thing of the entries made in your memorandum book, or of the alterations or obliteration made afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Were theſe alterations or obliterations mode in the book previous to an inquiry being made into the general's conduct, or ſubſequent?</p>
               <p>A. The alterations was made immediately after the entry; the obliteration within a few days after the 30th of January, but the particular day I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the political general characters of mr. James Seagrove, or captain Robert Shewell, junior?</p>
               <p>A. I know very little of either of them, but I have heard and thought before we got into Philadelphia that they were diſaffected perſons. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, was always thought to be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſon. Mr. Seagrove, at New York, paid particular reſpect to general Waſhington, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him at that time as a good whig, but his coming into Philadelphia, while the enemy were there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to alter my opinion of him.</p>
               <p>The court adjourned until to morrow eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>The court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Q. to colonel Mitchell. What time was Jordan's brigade of waggons to continue in the public ſervice, whom they were ordered out?</p>
               <p>A. I think the law of the ſtate, to the beſt of my remembrance, ſays thirty days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jordan's brigade of waggons or any part of them continue in the public ſervice, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Eggharbour?</p>
               <p>Not one of them, to my knowledge. I was afterwards told, ſome of them came out in another bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, but I did not know them as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the time they were employed by general Arnold conſidered by you, or the waggon maſter of the ſtate, as part of their tour of duty?</p>
               <p>A. It was not conſidered by me, otherwiſe I ſhould have detained them until it was over; but as they were ſent to general Arnold, I did not conſider I had any charge of them, not conſidering them to be in public ſervice. I do not know how the waggon maſter conſidered the time they were employed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had no converſation with him upon the ſubject, to the beſt of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were waggons uſually diſcharged from the public ſervice, after they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted their tour of duty?</p>
               <p>A. By paying them for the time they ſerved, and letting them go home. No written diſcharge being given.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:017047_0037_0F9FBDDAF68D60B8"/>
Q. How long had mr. Jordan been in town with the waggons under his care, before he was ordered by you to go to general Arnold for inſtructions?</p>
               <p>A. To the beſt of my recollection, he was ordered to go to general Arnold for inſtructions the morning I knew of his arrival, but the hour of the day I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not order Jordan to proceed with his waggons to one of the public ſtores, on his arrival in town, to take a load of ſtores for camp?</p>
               <p>A. To the beſt of my recollection or knowledge, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. When I applied for the waggons, did not you tell me, that there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently public waggons lying idle in town, when proviſions did not arrive to load them, as expected, in which caſe, they could be ſpared and it would be a ſaving to the public, as they were obliged to pay for the hire of the waggons when called out, whether they were employed or not?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect my telling you ſo, but the circumſtances have happened. At that time there were no more waggons called for from the ſtate, but what could be employed; but a number of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental teams coming in, which I did not expect, enabled me to let you have the waggons at that time.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the laſt charge, dr. Gardiner was produced by the judge advocate, and ſworn, upon his being deſired to give the court what information he was poſſeſſed of concerning it: he ſaid as follows;</p>
               <p>That upon the return of Jordan's brigade of waggons from Eggharbour to Philadelphia, he then being in the city, upon public buſineſs, was called upon by ſome perſons belonging to the brigade, to viſit a ſick wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner; be went with them to the continental yard, where the waggons were ſtanding, and finding the man very ill, in the firſt ſtage of a nervous fever, he propoſed giving him ſome medicines, and at the ſame time adviſed them to ſend him home, as he, the deponent, ſuppoſed his diſorder would be tedious. Some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſing with reſpect to the method of ſending him, they at length agreed to try, if the whole brigade could obtain a temporary diſcharge, upon their promiſing to return again in a ſhort time, and perform the remainder of their tour. They told him, they did apply, and were accordingly diſcharged or permitted to return, upon the aforeſaid condition. Sometime afterwards, a complaint was made by col. Young, waggon maſter general of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, to ſome members of the general aſſembly, then ſitting, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome abuſes of the waggons, called out under the law for public ſervice, being employed in private ſervice, and particularly with reſpect to the miſapplication of Jordan's brigade, in removing private proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Eggharbour, and at the ſame time drawing forage and rations from the public magazines. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſeemed diſpoſed to have taken up the matter, but being about to riſe in a ſhort time, and thinking that the matter might be taken up in another channel, ſome of the members adviſed colonel Young to lay the caſe before the executive authority of the ſtate, which he, the deponent, afterwards heard he did. He then heard but little more of the matter, 'till, he thinks, in the latter end of January, or the beginning of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, when Jordan called at his houſe in Philadelphia, and told him, that he had conſiderable delays in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pay for the ſervice of his brigade laſt fall, and requeſting his advice as a friend, what ſteps would be moſt adviſeable for him to take, to have the matter ſettled. He, the deponent, aſked him for his papers; he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him two pay rolls, or one altered pay roll; one charged to the united ſtates, and the other charged to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold. The latter, or the alteration, Jordan told him he made in conſequence of colonel Mitchell's directions. He likewiſe ſhewed him, (the deponent) his orders from general Arnold, ſigned by a mr. Franks as one of his aides. He aſked Jordan what reaſon general Arnold gave for not diſcharging the debt. He anſwered, that general Arnold was not willing to pay for more than ſix or ſeven days ſervice, which was the time he was performing his journey from Philadelphia to Eggharbour and back again. He adviſed Jordan to apply to the executive authority of the ſtate, and accordingly went with him to mr. Bryan's, who was then vice preſident of the ſtate. He likewiſe accompanied the vice preſident, and mr. Clingan, one of the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and Jordan, to the preſident's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other information that Jordan's brigade of waggons was diſcharged from the public ſervice, or permitted to return, upon their promiſing to return again in a ſhort time and perform their tour of duty, but what you had from the waggoners?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know to whom they applied for permiſſion to return home?</p>
               <p>A. I do not; but I was preſent when they made the agreement to apply, and they agreed to apply to colonel Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. court. Do you know whether Jordan's brigade returned to complete their tour of duty?</p>
               <p>A. Not as Jordan's brigade. One of the waggoners being ſick, and Jordan's quitting the ſervice at that time, ſeveral of the waggoners came out under another waggon maſter; but I cannot ſay whether they came out to complete their former tour of duty or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:017047_0038_0F9FBDDB79AA8AF0"/>
Q. by general Arnold. Did Jeſſe Jordan inform you that I had refuſed him payment for the hire of his waggons?</p>
               <p>A. Jeſſe Jordan informed me that he went to colonel Mitchell to get his pay, having his pay roll drawn in its uſual form; that colonel Mitchell informed him that the pay roll was wrong, that the united ſtates were charged, but you ought only to be charged; that agreeable to colonel Mitchell's orders he altered the pay roll or drew a new one, I cannot tell which, in which he charged you inſtead of the united ſtates; that after the pay roll was made out in that manner, colonel Mitchell gave him a note to you, and deſired him to call on you, which he ſaid he delivered to you, and when be called, you refuſed paying him for the number of days charged in the pay roll, which were twelve or thirteen, and made ſome difficulties as to paying him for ſix or ſeven days; that he then returned to colonel Mitchell with a note or meſſage from you, with reſpect to the number of days he was in ſervice; that when he came to colonel Mitchell he again ſent him back to you; not finding you at home, he returned to colonel Mitchell's, and after telling him of it, Jordan ſaid he would give over any attempts to get the money in that manner; that he was employed by Mr. Boyd, and would apply to him about it; upon which colonel Mitchell told him he muſt not attempt to go away without ſettling it, or he would put him in the guard houſe; he further told me, he put his papers quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his pocket and ſlipped off, being fearful that he ſhould be put in the guard houſe, and he told me he did not make any other attempt to get payment at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. by general Arnold. Did you not underſtand that there was ſome intimation given by ſome of the council to colonel Boyd, colonel Young, or Jordan, or ſome other perſon, to make a complaint reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waggons; or was the complaint made without the knowledge or deſire of the council or ſome member of it?</p>
               <p>A. No member of the council, to my knowledge, influenced any perſon to make the complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know whether Jeſſe Jordan called on the preſident and council voluntarily, or was ſent for when he was paid a ſum of money for the hire of his waggons?</p>
               <p>A. I believe he came voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. by do. Do you know whether the preſident or any member of the council adviſed or wrote a letter to Jordan deſiring him to make out his account, and charge eighty pounds for each waggon, and to apply to the attorney general to commence an action for the money?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>The judge advocate, in addition to the other evidence before the court, deſired permiſſion to produce a certificate of the ſpeaker of the houſe of aſſembly of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, to ſhew how the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint by the executive council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania againſt major general Arnold, for employing Jeſſe Jordan's brigade of waggons, originated, which was granted. The certificate was produced, and authenticated by dr. Gardner. On being read, it is as follows:</p>

But as the houſe was greatly hurried with other important buſineſs, and were anxious to riſe, I mentioned the matter to his excellency the preſident, and ſome other members of the council, who thought it would be beſt for the waggon maſter to lay the affair before council in writing; in conſequence of which, ſome weeks after, information was given to council.</p>

               <p>Mr. Nicholſon was produced by the judge advocate relative to the ſecond charge againſt the general and ſworn.

                     <salute>Mr. preſident, and gentlemen of this honourable court,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I APPEAR before you, to anſwer charges brought againſt me by the late ſupreme executive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the commonwealth of Pennſylvania. It is diſagreeable to be accuſed; but when an accuſation is made, I feel it a great ſource of conſolation, to have an opportunity of being tried by gentlemen, whoſe delicate and refined ſenſations of honour, will lead them to entertain ſimilar ſentiments concerning thoſe who accuſe unjuſtly, and thoſe who are juſtly accuſed. In the former caſe, your feelings revolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conduct of the proſecutors; in the latter, againſt thoſe who are deſerved objects of a proſecution. Whether thoſe feelings will be directed againſt me, or againſt thoſe, whoſe charges have brought me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, will be known by your juſt and impartial determination of this cauſe.</p>
                  <p>When the preſent neceſſary war againſt Great Britain commenced, I was in eaſy circumſtances, and enjoyed a fair proſpect of improving them. I was happy in domeſtic connections, and bleſſed with a riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing family, who claimed my care and attention. The liberties of my country were in danger. The voice of my country called upon all her faithful ſons to join in her defence. With cheerfulneſs I obeyed the call. I ſacrificed domeſtic caſe and happineſs to the ſervice of my country, and in her ſervice have I ſacrificed a great part of a handſome fortune. I was one of the firſt that appeared in the field; and from that time, to the preſent hour, have not abandoned her ſervice.</p>
                  <p>When one is charged with practices, which his ſoul abhors, and which conſcious innocence tells him, he has never committed, an honeſt indignation will draw from him expreſſions in his own favour, which on other occaſions, might be aſcribed to an oſtentatious turn of mind. The part which I have acted in the American cauſe, has been acknowledged by our friends, and by our enemies, to have been far from an indifferent one. My time, my fortune, and my perſon have been devoted to my country, in this war; and, if the ſentiments of thoſe who are ſupreme in the united ſtates, in civil and military affairs, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have any weight, my time, my fortune, and my perſon have not been devoted in vain. You will indulge me, gentlemen, while I lay before you ſome honourable teſtimonies, which congreſs, and the commander in chief of the armies of the united ſtates, have been pleaſed to give of my conduct. The place where I now ſtand juſtifies me in producing them.</p>

                              <p>"IF the event mentioned by general Schuyler ſhould not have happened, we cannot doubt, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Burgoyne has come up the lake, determined, if poſſible, to carry his point, I mean, to poſſeſs himſelf of our poſts in that quarter, and to puſh his arms further. Suppoſing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are ſo deficient in their number, our ſecurity and ſafety will require, that aids from the militia ſhould be called forth, in caſes of emergency. If it has, there is now as abſolute neceſſity for their turning out to check general Burgoyne's progreſs, or the moſt diſagreeable conſequences may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Upon this occaſion, I would take the liberty to ſuggeſt to congreſs, the propriety of ſending an active, ſpirited officer to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has ſettled his affairs, and can be ſpared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this buſineſs, and that he ſhould immediately ſet out for the northern department. He is active, judicious and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repoſe great confidence. Beſides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routs and moſt important paſſes and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, or be more uſefully employed at this time, than in this way. I am perſuaded his preſence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and ſpur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wiſh him to be engaged in a more agreeable ſervice, to be with better troops; but circumſtances call for his exertions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honour he has already acquired."</p>

                  <p>If theſe teſtimonies have any foundation in truth (and I believe the authority of thoſe who gave them will be thought <hi>at leaſt equal</hi> to that of thoſe who have ſpoke, and wrote, and publiſhed concerning me in a very different manner) is it probable that after having acquired ſome little reputation, and after having gained the favourable opinion of thoſe, whoſe favourable opinion it is an honour to gain, I ſhould all at once ſink into a courſe of conduct equally unworthy of the patriot and ſoldier? No pains have been ſpared, no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice has been left untried to perſuade the public that this has been the caſe. Uncommon aſſiduity has been employed in propagating ſuſpicions, invectives, and ſlanders to the prejudice of my character. The preſſes of Philadelphia have groaned under libels againſt me, charges have been publiſhed, and officially tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the different ſtates, (and to many parts of Europe, as I am informed) before they were regularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and long before I could have an opportunity of refuting them; and indeed every method that men ingeniouſly wicked could invent, has been practiſed to blaſt and deſtroy my character. Such a vile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of power, and ſuch inſtances of glaring tyranny and injuſtice, I believe are unprecedented in the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017047_0041_0F9FBDE1056082B8"/>annals of any free people. I have long and impatiently wiſhed for an opportunity of vindicating my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and have frequently applied for it; but the ſituation of affairs at the beginning and during the continuance of the campaign, neceſſarily, and againſt the general's inclination, prevented it, until now. But now it is happily arrived, and I have the moſt ſanguine hopes of being able to avail myſelf of it, by ſatisfying you, and, through your ſentence, by ſatisfying the world, that my conduct and character have been moſt unwarrantably traduced, and that the charges brought againſt me are, <hi>falſe, malicious,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt charge is, Granting a protection, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer, The permiſſion was given on the fourth day of June 1778, when, though I had no formal inſtructions from the general to take the command in Philadelphia, I had intimations given me that I ſhould be found upon for that appointment. The gentleman who applied for the protection in behalf of himſelf and company, was not them reſiding in the city with the enemy; he had taken the oath of allegiance to the ſtate of Pennſylvania, required by its laws, as appeared by a certificate which he produced to me. What his political character, and thoſe of the others, in whoſe behalf he applied to me, were, I pretend not to aſcertain; nor do I mean to become their advocate, any further than the juſtice due to an injured character requires. I think it has been clearly proved by the teſtimony of ſeveral gentlemen (not parties in this matter) that the general character of thoſe gentlemen was unexceptionable, ſome of them had taken an active part in favour of theſe ſtates; and the tenor of their conduct ſince, will I preſume juſtify a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of them. It is enough for me to ſhew that their intentions with regard to this veſſel and cargo ſeemed to be upright, and that the deſign of ſaving them for the uſe of the citizens of the united ſtates, appeared to be laudable, inſtead of being reprehenſible. This appears evident from the depoſitions of mr. Collins, mr. Beveridge, and colonel Proctor.</p>
                  <p>Why the protection is viewed as an indignity to the authority of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, I own I cannot diſcover. This preſident and council of that ſtate were then in Lancaſter; the paſs to the veſſel was to "ſail into any of the ports of the united ſtates of America." To ſail into the port of Philadelphia was not the object, the veſſel was there already. If there was an encroachment upon the authority of any ſtate, it muſt have been ſome other than the ſtate of Pennſylvania. The veſſel ſailed into one of the ports of New Jerſey; the government of that ſtate, though far from being inſenſible to its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, has never complained of the indignity offered to it by my protection; a jury of that ſtate acquitted the veſſel by their verdict; and the judge of admiralty of that ſtates confirmed the verdict by his decree, which is in evidence before this honourable court.</p>
                  <p>It is part of this charge that the permiſſion was granted without the knowledge of the commander in chief, though then preſent. I think it peculiarly unfortunate that the armies of the united ſtates have a gentleman at their hand, who knows ſo little about his own honour, or regards it ſo little, as to ſay the preſident and council of Pennſylvania under the neceſſity of ſtepping forth in its defence, perhaps it may be of uſe to hint,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The general is inveſted with power, and he poſſeſſes ſpirit to check and to puniſh every inſtance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect ſhown to his authority; but he will not proſtitute his power by exerting it upon a trifling occaſion; far leſs will be pervert it when no occaſion is given at all.</p>
                  <p>His excellency knew, and you, gentlemen, well know, it has been cuſtomary for general officers of the army to grant paſſes, protections for perſons and property, to the inhabitants of the united ſtates, who appeared friendly to the ſame. The utility of the meaſure, which was evident in the preſent caſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any precedent, I conceive to be a ſufficient juſtification. The protection was deſigned only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſoldiery from plundering the veſſel and cargo, coming from the enemy, that proper authority might take cognizance of the matter. I muſt beg leave to mention a reſolution of congreſs in point. I do not recollect the date. It was, however, previous to the paſs. That honourable body therein promiſe, to all perſons in the enemy's ſervice, for their encouragement and reward, all veſſels and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes that they ſhall ſeize upon, in poſſeſſion of the enemy, and bring into any of the united ſtates. If ſuch reward is given to our enemies, can it be eſteemed criminal to protect the property of the citizens of theſe united ſtates, when coming from the enemy. Certainly not. At the time the protection was given, I had no doubt of the right or propriety of giving it. I am now confirmed in my opinion, and that the reſolution of congreſs I have mentioned, warrants the meaſure. But, it ſtrictly conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it ſhall be thought that I exceeded my power, by granting the protection, I hope his excellency gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington, and this honourable court, will do me the juſtice to believe, that it was not out of any
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017047_0042_0F9FBDE19092EB80"/>diſreſpect to his authority, but an error in judgment, as I was convinced at the time I had a right to grant the paſs; and had I refuſed I ſhould have thought myſelf culpable.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond-charge conſiſts in having ſhut up the ſhops and ſtores on my arrival in the city, ſo as even to prevent officers of the army from purchaſing, while I privately made conſiderable purchaſes for my own uſe, <hi>as is alledged and believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reſolution of congreſs, <q>directs me to take early and proper care to prevent the removal, transfer, or ſale of any goods, wares, or merchandize, in the poſſeſſion of the inhabitants of the city, until the property of the ſame ſhall be aſcertained by a joint committee, conſiſting of perſons appointed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and of perſons appointed by the ſupreme executive council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania.</q> My inſtructions from the general mention, <q>that I will find the objects of my command ſpecified in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of congreſs, and that the means of executing the powers veſted in me were left to my own judgment.</q> How could I better prevent the removal, transfer, or ſale of any goods, wares and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, in the poſſeſſion of the inhabitants of the city, "than by ſhutting up the ſhops and ſtores?"</p>
                  <p>If "the officers of the army were prevented from purchaſing," it was becauſe the ſale of any goods was directed by congreſs to be prevented, in which the ſale of goods to officers was neceſſarily included; and it was in order (as is ſtated in the proclamation prohibiting the removal, ſale, or transfer of goods) <q>that the quarter maſter, commiſſary and clothier generals, might contract for ſuch goods, as were wanted for the <hi>uſe of the army.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have already mentioned, renders it ſurpriſing that the ſhutting up the ſhops and ſtores ſhould be made a charge againſt me by <hi>any</hi> man, or body of men: what I am going to mention, renders it peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ſurpriſing that this charge ſhould he made againſt me by the gentleman, who is now preſident of the ſtate of Pennſylvania. It is in evidence before this honourable court, that this very gentleman propoſed to one of my aids, that he, even before my arrival in town, <q>ſhould publiſh an order to prevent the ſelling any goods or merchandize; that this very gentleman was urgent to have this done; that this very gentleman, after my arrival in town, drew up a proclamation for that purpoſe, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me.</q> The ſame gentleman now exhibits the ſame meaſure as an article of accuſation againſt me.</p>
                  <p>The laſt part of this charge is of a ſerious nature inſtead: it is that, while I prohibited others from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing, I privately made conſiderable purchaſes for my own benefit, "as is <hi>alledged and believed:</hi>" if this part of the charge is true, I ſtand confeſſed, in the preſence of this honourable court, his vileſt of men; I ſtand ſtigmatized with indelible diſgrace, the diſgrace of having abuſed an appointment of high truſt and importance, to accompliſh the meaneſt and moſt unworthy purpoſes: the blood I have ſpent in defence of my country, will be inſufficient to obliterate the ſtain.</p>
                  <p>But if this part of the charge is void of truth; if it has not even the ſemblance of truth, what ſhall I ſay of my accuſers? what epithets will characterize their conduct, the ſentence of this honourable court will ſoon determine.</p>
                  <p>It is "ALLEDGED and BELIEVED," that I privately made conſiderable purchaſes for my own benefit. I am not converſant in the ſtudy of juriſprudence; but I have always underſtood, that <hi>public</hi> charges ought to have ſome other foundation to reſt upon, than mere unſupported <q>
                        <hi>allegation</hi> and <hi>belief.</hi>
                     </q> Who "<hi>alledge</hi> and <hi>believe</hi>" this accuſations? None, I truſt, but the preſident and council of Pennſylvania; becauſe, I truſt, none elſe would alledge and believe any thing tending to ruin a character, without ſufficient evidence. Where is the evidence of this accuſation? I call upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers to produce it: I call upon them to produce it, under the pain of being held forth to the world, and to poſterity, upon the proceedings of this court, as public defamers and murderers of reputation.</p>
                  <p>They have indeed produced the evidence of a certain colonel Fitzgerald, to prove that he ſaw an anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous paper in the hands of major Franks, one of my adds. I ſhall take no notice of the paper he alludes to, as it cannot be deemed a proof, or admitted as evidence; but the manner of his procuring a ſight of the paper, I cannot help taking notice of: lodging in the ſame houſe with major Franks, in his abſence, colonel Fitzgerald's <hi>curioſity prompted him to examine major Franks's papers,</hi> when he ſtumbled upon a ſecret too big for him to keep. Was not this a groſs violation of the confidence ſubſiſting between gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen? but what ſhall I ſay of the uſe this gentleman made of his ſecret? I will not ſay it was a diſgrace to the character of a ſoldier and gentleman. I will leave it to the gentleman's own feeling, which (if he in not callous) will ſay more to him than I can poſſibly do on the ſubject. In the nature of things, it is impoſſible for me to prove, by poſitive and direct evidence, the <hi>negative</hi> ſide of a charge: but I have done all that in the nature of things is poſſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:017047_0043_0F9FBDE2404D35A0"/>
On the honour of a gentleman and ſoldier, I declare to gentlemen and ſoldiers, that the charge is falſe.</p>
                  <p>My aids de camp were acquainted with my tranſactions, and had acceſs to my papers: <q>My invoice, my minute and account books, were always open to their inſpection.</q> Could I have made conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purchaſes, without their knowledge? <q>and yet they did not know of my making any purchaſes of goods of any kind, directly or indirectly; and they had every reaſon to think, that no ſuch purchaſes were made, either by me or my agents, except a few trifling articles to furniſh my table, and for my family's uſe; moſt of which were ſupplied me by the quarter maſter, commiſſary and clothier generals.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I made conſiderable purchaſes, conſiderable ſales muſt have been made to me by ſome perſon in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. Why are not theſe perſons produced? Have my proſecutors ſo little power and influence in that city, as to be unable to furniſh evidence of the truth?</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the third charge of the ſupreme executive council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, I think it neceſſary to make ſome obſervations on it, becauſe it is evidently calculated, by a falſe colouring of a trifling and innocent tranſaction, to ſubject me to the prejudice of the freemen of theſe ſtates, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the militia of the ſtate of Pennſylvania.</p>
                  <p>I am charged <q>with impoſing menial offices upon the ſons of freemen of this ſtate, when called forth by deſire of congreſs to perform militia duty; and when remonſtrated to thereupon, juſtifying myſelf in writing, upon the ground of having power ſo to do.</q> The letters which are in evidence before this honourable court, which paſſed between mr. ſecretary Matlack and myſelf, will explain the ſole tranſaction, upon which this general accuſation is founded.</p>
                  <p>By what ſtrained conſtruction the ſentiments which I have expreſſed, "that when a citizen aſſumes the character of a ſoldier, the former was entirely loſt in the latter," ſhould be extended to a juſtification of myſelf, on the mere <hi>principal</hi> of <hi>power,</hi> is ſomewhat extraordinary. My opinion in this matter is confirmed, not only by the ſentiments of many of the moſt enlightened patrons of liberty in this and other countries, but ſanctified by the militia law of ſeveral free ſtates, both in Europe and America, particularly Switzerland and the ſtate of New-York, where (if I am not miſtaken) the militia of the latter, when called forth into continental ſervice, are ſubjected to the ſame rules of diſcipline, with the troops of the united ſtates; the character and conduct of that militia prove the policy of this principle. My ambition is to deſerve the good opinion of the militia of theſe ſtates, not only becauſe I reſpect their character and their exertions, but becauſe their confidence in me may (as I flatter myſelf it has hitherto been) prove beneficial to the general cauſe of America: but having no local politics to bias my voice or my conduct, I leave it to others to wriggle themſelves into a temporary popularity, by aſſaſſinating the reputation of innocent perſons, and endeavouring to render odious a principle, the maintenance of which is eſſential to the good diſcipline of the militia, and conſequently to the ſafety of theſe ſtates. I flatter myſelf the time is not far off, when, by the glorious eſtabliſhment of our independence, I ſhall again return into the maſs of citizens: 'tis a period I look forward to with anxiety; I ſhall then cheerfully ſubmit as a citizen, to be governed by the ſame principle of ſubordination, which has been tortured into a wanton exertion of arbitrary power.</p>
                  <p>This inſinuation comes, in my opinion, with an ill grace from the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in whoſe more immediate defence I ſacrificed my feelings as a ſoldier, when I conceived them incompatible with the duties of a citizen, and the welfare of that ſtate.</p>
                  <p>By a reſolution of congreſs, I found myſelf ſuperſeded (in conſequence of a new mode of appointment of general officers) by ſeveral who were my juniors in ſervice; thoſe who know the feelings of an officer, (whoſe utmoſt ambition is the good opinion of his country) muſt judge what my ſenſations were at this apparent mark of neglect. I repaired to the city of Philadelphia in the month of May, 1777, in order either to attain a reſtoration of my rank, or a permiſſion to reſign my commiſſion; during this interval, the van of general Howe's army advanced, by a rapid march, to Somerſet court houſe, with a view (as was then generally ſuppoſed) to penetrate to the city of Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding I had been ſuperſeded, and my feelings as an officer wounded, yet, on finding the ſtate was in imminent danger from the deſigns of the enemy. I ſacrificed thoſe feelings, and with alacrity put myſelf at the head of the militia, who were collected to oppoſe the enemy, determined to exert my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the benefit of the public, although I conceived myſelf injured by their repreſentatives. How far the good countenance of the militia under my command operated, in deterring general Howe from marching to the city of Philadelphia, I will not pretend to ſay; certain it is, he altered his route.</p>
                  <p>What returns I have met with from the ſtate of Pennſylvania, I leave to themſelves to judge, in the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017047_0044_0F9FBDE3174323A0"/>cool hour of reflection, which (notwithſtanding the phrenzy of party, and the pains ſo induſtriouſly taken to ſupport a clamour againſt me) muſt ſooner or later ariſe.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude this ſubject, by reading a letter from mr. Matlack, received ſubſequent to the letters which have been already read, which I conſider as an inſult and indignity. The letter will ſpeak for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the ſpirit and tendency of it are very obvious.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding all the influence of the ruling powers of Pennſylvania, which muſt be well known by ſeveral of this honourable court; the unexampled method adopted by the council to prejudice the minds of the citizens againſt me, previous to a trial, and the daily calumnies invented and induſtriouſly circulated to prevent the popular heat from ſubſiding; the impartiality and good ſenſe of a body of freemen of the city of Philadelphia, were impregnable to all the arts made uſe of to poiſon the fountain of juſtice. And here I cannot but congratulate my countrymen upon the glorious effects of the exertions we have made, to eſtabliſh the liberties of ourſelves, and poſterity, upon the firm baſis of equal laws. Had it not been for the grand bulwark againſt the tyranny of rulers, the trial by peers, it is eaſy to forſee, from the ſpirit of thoſe who have been my accuſers, what muſt have been my fate. When I reflect on this circumſtance, I contemplate, with a grateful pleaſure, the ſcars I have received in defence of a ſyſtem of government, the excellence of which, though frequently before the ſubject of my ſpeculation, is now brought home to my <hi>feelings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is difficult to account for the extraordinary mode purſued by the ſtate of Pennſylvania, to damn my reputation, and for the aſperity with which I was perſecuted, on any other principle, than one, by which ſtates, as well as individuals, are too often tempted to commit the moſt flagrant acts of injuſtice, <hi>I mean intereſt.</hi> The ſloop Active, which was the object of the ſuit, which I was accuſed of unlawfully maintaining, was taken by part of the crew of the veſſel, who were Americans, who roſe upon the reſt, and after having confined the captain and others, were bringing her into port. In this ſituation ſhe was boarded by a veſſel belonging to the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and brought in, and afterwards libelled as a prize taken by themſelves. The original captors, who were (ſome of them) born in Connecticut, my native country, with whoſe connections I was acquainted, applied to me for my aſſiſtance in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>juſtice.</hi> I aſſiſted them both with my advice, my time, and my purſe; and though three fourths of the veſſel and cargo were, by the lower court of admiralty for the ſtate of Pennſylvania, adjudged to the ſtate captors, this ſentence was, by an unanimous opinion of a court of appeals, reverſed and adjudged to thoſe whom I patronized, as appears by their decree, which I beg leave to read, with their report to congreſs, and the reſolutions of congreſs thereupon.</p>

                              <p>THE committee to whom was referred the report of the committee on appeals of January 19th, 1779, having, in purſuance of the inſtructions to them given, examined into the cauſes of the refuſal of the judge of the court of admiralty for the ſtate of Pennſylvania, to carry into execution the decree of the court or committee of appeals, report,</p>
                              <p>That on a libel in the court of admiralty for the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in the caſe of the ſloop Active, the jury found a verdict in the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> "one fourth of the net proceeds of the ſloop Active and her cargo to the firſt claimants, three fourths of the net proceeds of the ſaid ſloop and her cargo to the libellant and the ſecond claimant, as per agreement between them;" which verdict was confirmed by the judge of the court, and ſentence paſſed thereon. From this ſentence or judgment and verdict, an appeal was lodged with the ſecretary of congreſs and referred to the committee appointed by congreſs, "to bear and determine finally upon all appeals brought to congreſs," from the courts of admiralty of the ſeveral ſtates:</p>
                              <p>That the ſaid committee, after ſolemn argument and full hearing of the parties by their advocates, and taking time to conſider thereof, proceeded to the publication of their definitive ſentence or decree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reverſing the ſentence of the court of admiralty, making a new decree, and ordering proceſs to iſſue out of the court of admiralty for the ſtate of Pennſylvania, to carry this their decree into execution:</p>
                              <p>That the judge of the court of admiralty refuſed to carry into execution the decree of the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee on appeals, and has aſſigned as the reaſon of his refuſal, that an act of the legiſlature of the ſaid ſtate, had declared that the finding of a jury ſhall eſtabliſh the facts in all trials of the courts of admiralty, without re-examination or appeal, and that an appeal is permitted only from the decree of the judge:</p>
                              <p>That having examined the ſaid act, which is intitled "an act for eſtabliſhing a court of admiralty," paſſed at a ſeſſion which commenced the 4th of Auguſt, 1778, the committee find the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> "the finding of a jury ſhall eſtabliſh the facts, without re-examination or appeal," and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth ſection of the ſame act the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> "in all caſes of captures an appeal from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the judge of admiralty of this ſtate, ſhall be allowed to the continental congreſs or ſuch perſon or perſons as they may from time to time appoint for hearing and trying appeals."</p>
                              <p>That although congreſs, by their reſolution of November 25th, 1775, recommended it to the ſeveral legiſlatures to erect courts for the purpoſes of determining concerning captures, and to provide that all trials in ſuch caſes be had by a jury, yet it is provided that in all caſes an appeal ſhall be allowed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs or to ſuch perſon or perſons as they ſhall appoint for the trial of appeals:" whereupon</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That congreſs, or ſuch perſon or perſons as they appoint to hear and determine appeals from from the courts of admiralty, have neceſſarily the power to examine as well into deciſions on facts as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions on the law, and to decree finally thereon, and that no finding of a jury in any court of admiralty or court for determining the legality of captures on the high ſeas, can or ought to deſtroy the right of appeals and the re-examination of the facts reſerved to congreſs:</p>
                              <p>

That no act of any one ſtate can or ought to deſtroy the right of appeals to congreſs in the ſenſe above declared:</p>
                              <p>That congreſs is by theſe united ſtates veſted with the ſupreme ſovereign power of war and peace:</p>
                              <p>That the power of executing the law of nations is eſſential to the ſovereign ſupreme power of war and peace:</p>
                              <p>That the legality of all captures on the high ſeas muſt be determined by the law of nations:</p>
                              <p>That the authority ultimately and finally to decide on all matters and queſtions touching the law of nations, does reſide, and is veſted in the ſupreme ſovereign power of war and peace:</p>
                              <p>That a controul by appeal is neceſſary, in order to compel a juſt and uniform execution of the law of nations:</p>
                              <p>That the ſaid controul muſt extend as well over the deciſions of juries as judges in courts for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the legality of captures on the ſea; otherwiſe the juries would be poſſeſſed of the ultimate ſupreme power of executing the law of nations in all caſes of captures, and might at any time exerciſe the ſame in ſuch manner as to prevent a poſſibility of being controuled; a conſtruction which involves many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and abſurdities, deſtroys an eſſential part of the power of war and peace entruſted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and would diſable the congreſs of the united ſtates from giving ſatisfaction to foreign nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a violation of neutralities, of treaties or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury in any one ſtate to involve the united ſtates in hoſtilities; a conſtruction which for theſe and many other reaſons is inadmiſſible:</p>
                              <p>That this power of controuling by appeal the ſeveral admiralty juriſdictions of the ſtates has hitherto been exerciſed by congreſs, by the medium of a committee of their own members.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That the committee before whom was determined the appeal from the court of admiralty for the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in the caſe of the ſloop Active, was duly conſtituted and authoriſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſame:</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>This, gentlemen, is my cardinal guilt; hence proceeds the vengeance of an intereſted government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; hence the pain and anxiety I have ſuffered, in ſeeing the fair fabric of reputation, which I have been with ſo much danger and toil raiſing ſince the preſent war, undermined by thoſe, whoſe poſterity (as well as themſelves) will feel the bleſſed effects of my efforts, in conjunction with you and others, in reſcuing them from a tyranny of the moſt cruel and debaſing nature.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the fifth charge, of appropriating the waggons of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, when called forth upon a ſpecial emergency, laſt autumn, to the tranſportation of private property, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evidence relative to that tranſaction, before the court, will, I doubt not, juſtify my conduct in their opinion. It has been clearly proved by the teſtimony of colonel Mitchell and major Franks, that the waggons were ſupplied by the deputy quarter maſter general upon a private requeſt, and not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in the public ſervice, when employed. Suppoſe application had been made to me, for waggons, during my command in the city of Philadelphia, for removing property belonging to private perſons, which was in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, and I found the ſame could be done without injury to the public, ſhould I be juſtified in refuſing the public aſſiſtance? Certainly not. Does then the criminality conſiſt in removing the property, becauſe I was intereſted in it? Had the ſupplies for the continental army been obſtructed by this tranſaction, or had I endeavoured to make it a public charge, my conduct would certainly have been blame worthy; but as it evidently appears, that neither the one or the other was the caſe, I flatter myſelf, that my conduct, inſtead of being condemned by this honourable court, will be approved, and that an honourable acquittal will follow from the facts I have proved.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of the conduct of the preſident and council of Pennſylvania, reſpecting the waggons?
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017047_0049_0F9FBDE9771BECE8"/>They firſt charge me with employing public waggons to remove private property, inſinuating, that the waggon maſter was refuſed payment for the hire of his waggons, and that I intended to defraud the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. It would have been but candid, had they informed the public, that Jeſſe Jordan the waggon maſter had not been refuſed payment for the hire of his waggons, but that by their influence and advice, he had been prevented calling on me for his pay, that they might have ſome pretence for inſtituting an action and this charge againſt me.</p>
                  <p>In the next inſtance, they wrote, or cauſed to be wrote, a letter to Jeſſe Jordan, directing him to make out the account of the hire of his waggons, aſſuring him, that if he charged eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon, (more than double the firſt account which he had preſented to me) they did not doubt of his recovering the whole ſum, and directed him to ſend his account to the attorney general, who had orders to commence an action againſt me for the ſame, which he accordingly did; and there is now an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, depending in one of the courts of Pennſylvania, for upwards of eleven hundred pounds, for the hire of thoſe waggons.</p>
                  <p>Is it not very extraordinary, that I ſhould be accuſed and tried before this honourable court, for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying public waggons, and at the ſame time, and by the ſame perſons, be proſecuted in a civil court of Pennſylvania, for employing the ſame waggons as private property.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſixth charge, purporting, that by my recommendatory letter to general Maxwell, to grant a paſs to miſs Levy to go to New-York, I had violated the reſolve of congreſs, and uſurped the authority of the ſtate of Pennſylvania. To attempt a ſerious refutation, would be as ridiculous as the charge itſelf. Let the letter wrote on this occaſion ſpeak for itſelf. I kept no copy of it, but well remember the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which was nearly as follows:</p>

                  <p>As to the ſeventh charge, of an indecent and diſreſpectful behaviour to the council of Pennſylvania.</p>
                  <p>True it is, I refuſed to obey an arbitrary mandate, (to render to them an account of my conduct) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to criminate myſelf. They complain, that by my refuſal their <hi>dignity is wounded.</hi> Had I obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſoldiers and citizens might juſtly have ſaid, that I had betrayed their <hi>rights,</hi> and <hi>wounded their dignity. The very demand was an inſult to common ſenſe.</hi> I beg leave to obſerve, that no one has a greater reſpect than myſelf for the civil authority, and no one is more convinced of the neceſſity of ſupporting it. But when public bodies of men ſhew themſelves actuated by the paſſions of anger, or envy, and apply their effects to ſap the character of an individual, and to render his ſituation miſerable, they muſt not think it extraordinary, if they are not treated with all the deference which they may think their due.</p>
                  <p>It is the dignity with which an office is executed, much more than the name, that can ever ſecure reſpect and obedience from a free people, and true dignity conſiſts in exerciſing power with wiſdom, juſtice and moderation. Had I experienced this, and had any unguarded expreſſions eſcaped my pen in my letters to the preſident and council of Pennſylvania, I would cheerfully, in a cooler hour of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have made an acknowledgment; but they have thought proper to take vengeance for themſelves: I ſhall therefore leave it to the impartial public of America to judge betwixt us.</p>
                  <p>The anathema of the ſupreme executive council, cloſes with obſerving, "That the diſcouragement and neglect manifeſted by general Arnold to civil, military and other characters, who have adhered to the cauſe of their country, with an entire different conduct to thoſe of another character, are too notorious to need proof or illuſtration," <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ſenſible, mr. Preſident, of having neglected any gentlemen, either in the civil or military line, who have adhered to the cauſe of their country, and who have put it into my power to take notice of them; with reſpect to gentlemen in the civil line and army, I can appeal to the candour of congreſs and to the army, as ſcarcely a day paſſed but many of both were entertained by me; they are the beſt judges of my company and conduct.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to attention to thoſe of an oppoſite character, I have paid none but ſuch, as in my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017047_0050_0F9FBDEAABF737F0"/>was juſtifiable on the principles of common humanity and politeneſs. The preſident and council of Pennſylvania will pardon me, if I cannot diveſt myſelf of humanity, merely out of complaiſance to them.</p>
                  <p>It is enough for me, mr. preſident, to contend with men in the field; I have not yet learned to carry on a warfare againſt <hi>women,</hi> or to conſider every man as diſaffected to our glorious cauſe, who, from an oppoſition in ſentiment to thoſe in power in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, may, by the <hi>clamour of party, be ſtiled a tory:</hi> it is well known, that this odious appellation has, in that ſtate, been applied by ſome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſeveral of illuſtrious character, both in the civil and military line.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion I think I may be allowed to ſay, without vanity, that my conduct, from the earlieſt period of the war to the preſent time, has been ſteady and uniform. I have ever obeyed the calls of my country, and ſtepped forth in her denfence, in every hour of danger, when many were deſerting her cauſe, which appeared deſperate: I have often bled in it; the marks that I bear, are ſufficient evidence of my conduct. The impartial public will judge of my ſervices, and whether the returns that I have met with are not tinctured with the baſeſt ingratitude. Conſcious of my own innocence, and the unworthy methods taken to injure me, I can with boldneſs ſay to my perſecutors in general, and to the <hi>chief</hi> of them in particular, that in the hour of <hi>danger,</hi> when the affairs of America were a <hi>gloomy aſpect,</hi> when our il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious general was retreating through New Jerſey, with a handful of men, I did not propoſe to my aſſociates, baſely to quit the general, and ſacrifice the cauſe of my country to my perſonal ſafety, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to the enemy, and making my peace. I can ſay I never baſked in the ſunſhine of my general's favour, and courted him to his face, when I was at the ſame time treating him with the greateſt diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and villifying his character when abſent. This is more than a ruling member of the council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania can ſay. <hi>"as is alledged and believed."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave to read before this honourable court a report of a committee of enquiry of congreſs, on the charges publiſhed againſt me by the council of Pennſylvania, with ſeveral letters I did myſelf the honour to write to congreſs, and a letter from their committee in anſwer: I do not preſume to offer theſe as evidence, but as they ſhew the anxiety I had to have my conduct inveſtigated, and the reluctance of my accuſers to bring matters to an iſſue, I think it incumbent on me as an officer, to lay them before you.</p>

                              <p>AFTER the conference between your honourable committee and this board on Wedneſday laſt, the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017047_0051_0F9FBDEB8B91CAC0"/>propriety of our farther appearing to congreſs on that part of the ſubject, which related to the employ of our public waggons, was conſidered; and it now becomes my duty to acquaint you, that this council preferring the public good to all other conſiderations, and more eſpecially to thoſe in which a ſenſe of indignity offered us, may be ſuppoſed to mingle, have concluded to give you all the information that is now in our power. In addition therefore to the papers encloſed, I would mention, that if mr. Mitchell's ſtate of that buſineſs ſhould appear to be defective, one Jeſſe Jordan, late a waggon maſter in the quarter maſter's department, can give teſtimony in the matter. We had ſent to the quarter maſter to order him up, before mr. Mitchell's ſtate was given us, but we find he has quitted the ſervice, and we ſuppoſing that ſtate of the matter to afford ſufficient ground of complaint, have taken no meaſures ſince to bring him up for examination.</p>
                              <p>But while we thus act upon motives ſuperior to the gratification of our own feelings, we think we ſhould be wanting in public duty and ſpirit, if we concealed; and while we are deliberating upon the meaſures to which we are competent, for the vindication of our own honour, we muſt freely, 'though reſpectfully, declare, that, if in the execution of public duty and the reſolves of congreſs, your officers may fruſtrate our good intentions, and affront us without feeling any marks of your diſpleaſure, it will greatly diſcourage our proſecuting any enquiries into public abuſes, and executing your reſolves farther than the ſpecial exigencies and conveniencies of our ſtate ſhould require: for we cannot but feel great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to commit the authority and honour of the ſtate, and our own perſonal feelings, in diſputes with perſons who, in many caſes, may, by that means, be elevated into undeſerved conſequence.</p>

                              <p>I DID myſelf the honour of writing to you on the 12th ult. to which aſk leave to refer. I am grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſenſible of the attention, which congreſs paid to my requeſt, in appointing a committee of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable body to enquire into the charges publiſhed againſt me by the preſident and council of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; and having been informed, that the committee have finiſhed their enquiry, and delivered in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I pray you, ſir, to recommend to congreſs, to examine, and decide thereon as ſoon as poſſible. I am ſenſible of the multiplicity of buſineſs before congreſs, yet I flatter myſelf, that they will conſider the cruel ſituation in which I am placed by the perſecution of my enemies, and relieve me by a ſpeedy deciſion.</p>
                              <p>As an individual, I truſt I ſhall ever have ſpirit to be the guardian of my own honour; but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of congreſs, when attacked by a public body, I conſider myſelf bound to make my appeal to that honourable body, in whoſe ſervice I have the honour to be; and whilſt my conduct and the charges againſt me are under their conſideration, I think it my duty to wait the iſſue, without noticing the many abuſive miſrepreſentations and calumnies, which are daily circulated by a ſet of wretches, beneath the notice of a gentleman and man of honour; yet permit me to ſay, that theſe calumniators, employed and ſupported by perſons in power and reputable ſtations, whilſt my cauſe remains undetermined before congreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves ſecure, and induſtriouſly ſpread their inſinuations and falſe aſſertions through theſe united ſtates, to poiſon the minds of my virtuous countrymen and fellow citizens, and to prejudice them againſt a man whoſe life has ever been devoted to their ſervice, and who looks on their good opinion and eſteem, as the greateſt reward and honour he can receive. Thus circumſtanced, I cannot be charged with undue impatience for ſoliciting an immediate deciſion on the charges brought againſt me; and I flatter myſelf, that every member of that honourable body muſt have ſome idea of what I have ſuffered on this occaſion, and that they will relieve me from a ſituation, the cruelty of which is beyond my power to expreſs.</p>

                              <p>I FIND by a reſolution of congreſs of the 3d inſtant, that they have directed his excellency general Waſhington to call a court martial on the 1ſt, 2d, 3d and 5th charges contained in the reſolves of the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017047_0052_0F9FBDEC1DC80DD0"/>executive council of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, of the 3d of February, the ſaid charges being only cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable by a court martial.</p>
                              <p>I cannot but teſtify my ſurprize, that a court martial ſhould be ordered to try me for offences, ſome of which the committee of congreſs in their report, ſay, <q>there appears no evidence tending to prove the ſame, that the ſaid charges are fully explained, and the appearances they carry of criminality fully obviated by clear unqueſtionable evidence.</q> If congreſs have been induced to take this meaſure for the public good, and to avoid a breach with this ſtate, however hard my caſe may be, and however I am injured as an individual, I will ſuffer with pleaſure, until a court martial can have an opportunity of doing me juſtice by acquitting me of theſe charges a ſecond time.</p>
                              <p>As congreſs have not decided on the 6th, 7th and 8th charges, 'though their committee have acquitted me, I muſt now beg the favour of their deciſion on thoſe charges: I aſk it as a piece of juſtice due to a faithful and honeſt ſervant, and make no doubt of their immediately complying with my requeſt.</p>

                              <p>I DID myſelf the honour of writing to you on the 8th and 12th of February, and again on the 14th inſtant, reſpecting the moſt cruel and unjuſt attempt made by the preſident and council of this ſtate, to injure my character, to which letters I beg leave to refer. In conſequence of the two former, congreſs were pleaſed to appoint a committee to inveſtigate the charges againſt me, to the end, that I might be, on their report, either acquitted or tried; and though the committee, after three weeks fruitleſs applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſident and council of this ſtate, were not able to obtain any evidence in ſupport of the two firſt charges, and in their report to congreſs, ſay, "That there is no evidence tending to prove the ſame; that the ſaid charges are fully explained, and the appearances they carry of criminality, fully obviated, by clear, unqueſtionable evidence."</p>
                              <p>Yet, I find, by a reſolution of congreſs, of the 3d inſtant, they have ordered a court martial to try me for thoſe charges, of which their committee have fully exculpated me, and have refuſed to decide on the report of the committee on the three laſt charges, which are not cognizable either in a civil law court, or court martial, and of which I ſtill ſuffer under the imputation, although this committee have fully acquitted me. I muſt once more beg congreſs will do me the juſtice to decide on thoſe charges. I aſk for no favour, but juſtice, and my right; and I flatter myſelf, when congreſs conſider my paſt ſervices and ſuffering in the cauſe of my country, they will no longer withhold the juſtice from me I am entitled to, however diſagreeable it may be to my cruel and implacable enemies, who, without cauſe, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed their intentions to ruin me, and who, if juſtice is not denied me, will be held up to the public in their true clours.</p>
                              <p>Upon application to the ſecretary of congreſs, for copies of all the papers relative to the charges againſt me, I have been informed, that I cannot have the report of the committee of congreſs, or the letters which paſſed between them and the ſupreme executive council, without an order of congreſs, which I now requeſt, as thoſe papers are abſolutely neceſſary to lay before the court martial, that the affair may appear in a proper point of light. A court martial can never, I preſume, ſuppoſe congreſs would have ordered me tried for charges, of which their committee had acquitted me. If therefore the report of the committee, or any other papers, tending to elucidate the affair, is withheld from the court martial, it will, doubtleſs, operate on their minds to my diſadvantage, and a fair trial can by no means be obtained. As the committee of congreſs have acted as a court of enquiry, I have an undoubted right (agreeable to the cuſtoms of all ſuch courts) to the whole proceedings, and every paper relative to the matter. This, I preſume, congreſs will not deny me. I therefore requeſt, that they will be pleaſed to order copies of thoſe letters, report, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> delivered me as ſoon as poſſible, as the court martial is ordered to ſit for my trial on the firſt of May.</p>

                              <p>AS congreſs cannot poſſibly comply with your requeſt, the committee can make no report, that will be of any ſervice to you. You cannot have a copy of the report you refer to, nor of the letters which paſſed between the committees, becauſe, on the late conference and accommodation between congreſs and the ſtate of Pennſylvania, thoſe proceedings are to ceaſe, and not to be brought again into view or diſcuſſion. The whole of the evidence, which relates to the charges on which you are to be tried, is tranſmitted to general Waſhington, with the charges, and there is nothing kept back, which you could avail yourſelf of in your defence. As to the reſolutions of the report acquitting you of particular charges, they were founded, you know, on <hi>ex parte</hi> hearing. The committee were obliged to finiſh the report, and as the executive council, from ſome difference between their committee and the committee of congreſs, would not produce the evidence in ſupport of thoſe charges, the committee took up the evidence offered on your part, and paſſed the reſolutions of acquittal; but the executive council and congreſs having ſettled the miſunderſtandings between the committees, and congreſs not having decided on the report, and the ſaid executive council having offered to produce the evidence before a court martial, the reſolutions of the committee can have no operation whatever: when we therefore come to report on your late applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt report, that your application cannot be complied with.</p>

                  <p>This report was never acted upon by congreſs, the council of Pennſylvania having had ſufficient influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and addreſs to quaſh any proceedings upon it: my reputation thus became for ſome time longer a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to what I charitably ſuppoſe was deemed by congreſs a neceſſary <hi>ſtate policy,</hi> to which individuals, however inconvenient, muſt ſometimes, without repining, ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>I have now gone through all the charges exhibited againſt me; and have given to each ſuch an anſwer as I thought it deſerved. Are they all, or are any of them ſupported by truth and evidence? or rather, does not each of them appear to this honourable court to be totally deſtitute of every ſemblance of a foundation in fact? and yet baſeleſs as they themſelves are, they were intended to ſupport a fabric; with the weight of which, attempts were made to cruſh my reputation and fortunes: I allude to the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſolution of the council, containing ſevere but general ſtrictures upon my character and conduct; ſtrictures of ſuch a ſerious and important nature, that they themſelves were ſenſible the public would not think them juſtified in making them, unleſs upon the moſt unqueſtionable grounds. Let them now be meaſured by their own ſtandard. Had they unqueſtionable grounds to go upon? Why then, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to every principle of candour and juſtice, in oppoſition to their own ideas of candour and juſtice, did they make and publiſh reſolutions, containing cenſures of ſuch a high import againſt me?</p>
                  <p>An artful appearance of tenderneſs, and regard for my ſervices, by which the council are pleaſed to ſay, I <hi>formerly</hi> diſtinguiſhed myſelf, is held forth in the introduction to their charges. Did they mean by this to pour balſam, or to pour poiſon into my wounds? I leave it to this court, and to the world to judge, whether they intended it to balance the demerits, they then urged againſt me, by my former good conduct, as far as it would go; or whether they deſigned it as a ſting to their charges, by perſuading the public, that my demerits were ſo enormous, that even the greateſt and moſt unaffected tenderneſs for my character, would not excuſe them in continuing ſilent any longer.</p>
                  <p>If, in the courſe of my defence, I have taken up the time of the court longer than they expected, they
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017047_0054_0F9FBDED873B6508"/>will, I truſt, impute it to the nature of the accuſations againſt me; many of which, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before you as charges, were alledged as facts, and were of ſuch a complexion as to render it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make ſome obſervations upon them; becauſe they were evidently calculated to raiſe a prejudice againſt me, not only among the people at large, but in the minds of thoſe who were to be judges.</p>
                  <p>I have looked forward with pleaſing anxiety to the preſent day, when, by the judgment of my fellow ſoldiers, I ſhall (I doubt not) ſtand honourably acquitted of all the charges brought againſt me, and again ſhare with them the glory and danger of this juſt war.</p>

               <p>The court met agreeable to adjournment, and having conſidered the ſeveral charges exhibited againſt general Arnold, the evidence produced on the trial, and his defence, are of opinion, with reſpect to the firſt charge, that he gave permiſſion for a veſſel to leave a port in poſſeſſion of the enemy, to enter into a port in the united ſtates, which permiſſion, circumſtanced as he was, they are clearly of opinion he had no right to give, being a breach of article 5th, ſection 18th of the rules and articles of war. Reſpecting the ſecond charge, that although it has been fully proved, that the ſhops and ſtores were ſhut by general Arnold's orders on his arrival in Philadelphia, they are of opinion, that he was juſtifiable in the order by the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of congreſs of the 5th of June, 1778, and his excellency the commander in chief's inſtructions of the 18th of June, 1778: and with reſpect to the latter part of the ſame charge, the making conſiderable purchaſes while the ſhops and ſtores were ſhut, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> clearly of opinion, that it is entirely unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they do fully acquit general Arnold of it. They do acquit general Arnold of the third charge, Reſpecting the fourth charge, it appears to the court, that General Arnold made application to the deputy quarter maſter general, to ſupply him with waggons to receive property then in imminent danger from the enemy; that waggons were ſupplied him by the deputy quarter maſter general on this application, which had been drawn from the ſtate of Pennſylvania for the public ſervice; and it alſo appears, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arnold intended this application as a private requeſt, and that he had no deſign of employing the waggons otherwiſe than at his private expence, nor of defrauding the public, nor injuring or imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

The court, in conſequence of their determinations reſpecting the firſt and laſt charges exhibited againſt major general Arnold, do ſentence him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
