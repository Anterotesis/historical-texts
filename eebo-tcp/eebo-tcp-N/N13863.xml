            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <q>THAT mankind univerÅ¿ally Å¿hall, in the final iÅ¿Å¿ue of the GoÅ¿pel plan of mercy, be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of corruption, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the felicity of the Å¿ons of God,</q>
we are told by the compiler of the pamphlet now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration, "is no novel doctrine." This is the <hi>truth,</hi> but not the <hi>whole truth.</hi> Had this gentleman been diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to have made his information compleat, he would have Å¿ubjoined, it is a doctrine, which has moÅ¿t generally been reprobated in the ProteÅ¿tant Churches, as moÅ¿t erroneous, and deÅ¿tructive to the Å¿ouls of men.</p>
            <p>In the following Å¿heets, the author has endeavoured to explain the paÅ¿Å¿ages of Å¿cripture, which have been offered in defence of UniverÅ¿al Salvation. To this he has added a Å¿hort view reÅ¿pecting the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniÅ¿hment, and the ends it anÅ¿wers in the moral government of God. Brevity was the object for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent; Å¿ince it is very probable this important Å¿ubject will employ other pens, and, in proper time, be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ed more at large.</p>
            <p>The author is no friend to controverÅ¿y, for its own Å¿ake. He cannot, however, be of opinion with thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons, who believe that controverÅ¿ial writings, on the fundamentals of religion, and when carried on with decency, are almoÅ¿t always unprofitable, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of them imprudent, and unwiÅ¿e: For certainly, whenever any doctrines, Å¿uppoÅ¿edly erroneous, are not only exhibited, but very much attended to, and by numbers, even favourably thought of, there is no better method of counteracting the conÅ¿equences which are likely to follow, than by publicly bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Å¿tandard of all Å¿acred truth, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by this rule, a fair and candid trial. And it is much to be doubted, whether a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to check every thing of this kind, can be attributed to any thing Å¿hort of the want of proper zeal in the cauÅ¿e
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017524_0003_0FA12B646F0B51D8"/>
of truth, or what may be called Å¿inful laÅ¿Å¿itude, and Å¿piritual Å¿leep.</p>
            <p>The compiler of the pamphlet on UniverÅ¿al Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Å¿eems to promiÅ¿e that it will act as an antidote againÅ¿t the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> of
<q>a Å¿tranger, who has of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf aÅ¿Å¿umed the character of a preacher,</q>
and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿ed on this Å¿ubject,
<q>in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of the New TeÅ¿tament books, from their beginning to their end.</q>
It is true, that learning and human judgment muÅ¿t be at a very low Å¿tate indeed, when it Å¿hall become neceÅ¿Å¿ary to reaÅ¿on in a formal manner againÅ¿t opinions of this kind, or in oppoÅ¿ition to the writer <note n="*" place="bottom">Relly on Union.</note> from whom they are Å¿elected or deduced. But, Å¿ince the compiler, juÅ¿t mentioned, while he promiÅ¿es unconditional, and eternal Å¿alvation to all men, attempts not to aÅ¿certain any preciÅ¿e period to the duration of the puniÅ¿hment which is to proceed,â€”and it may be judged, that the moÅ¿t of men, from a diÅ¿poÅ¿ition to Å¿elf-flattery, and an unconÅ¿ciouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the evil of Å¿in, will be ready to believe it will be very Å¿hort, it ought to have occurred to his mind, that the oppoÅ¿ition he is profeÅ¿Å¿ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e, who preÅ¿ume there will be no degree of puniÅ¿hment after the judgment day, is very trifling;â€”that they will be ready enough to eÅ¿teem him as one of their own party, and imagine that a coaleÅ¿cence in opinion is not far remote.â€”
<q>If this kind of preaching</q>
and writing
<q>be encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to civil Å¿ociety, as to religion.</q>

               <hi>FUTURE PUNISHMENT</hi> ILLUSTRATED AND PROVED.</head>
            <p>THE firÅ¿t text produced in favour of univerÅ¿al Salvation, is 1 Tim. ii. 3.
<q>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be Å¿aved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The more general opinion of commentators, who have written on this paÅ¿Å¿age, and the moÅ¿t obvious of all is, that it was deÅ¿igned to militate againÅ¿t the prejudices of the Jews, who had imbibed very contracted ideas concerning the benefits which were to reÅ¿ult from the miÅ¿Å¿ion, and death of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>It is well known<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that at firÅ¿t they Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, he was to become a temporal Prince, and redeem them from the Roman yoke; and although, by his Å¿ufferings and crucifixion, they were undeceived in this, they Å¿till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the opinion, that Å¿alvation was to be confined to their own nation.</p>
            <p>When the ApoÅ¿tle Peter was Å¿ent to the houÅ¿e of Cornelius, to preach to a number of Gentiles, and
<q>the Holy GhoÅ¿t fell on them which heard the word, then they of the circumciÅ¿ion were aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed, as many as came with Peter, becauÅ¿e that on the Gentiles
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017524_0005_0FA12B65EF592F70"/>
alÅ¿o, was poured out the gift of the Holy GhoÅ¿t.</q>
Acts x. 44, 45. And Å¿o powerfully did this miÅ¿con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception prevail, that even afterwards, there aroÅ¿e very great debates on the Å¿ubject.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul, therefore, in giving advice to Timothy, whom he calls his own Å¿on in the faith, takes pains to caution him againÅ¿t this error, by aÅ¿Å¿uring him, that "God the Saviour, would have all men to be Å¿aved;" that is, all people, nations, or claÅ¿Å¿es of men; intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as by the death of ChriÅ¿t, the <hi>Jews</hi> were put into a Å¿alvable Å¿tate, Å¿o were the nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and that whatÅ¿oever Å¿piritual benefits, it was proper for them to preach to the <hi>one,</hi> is was proper for them to preach to the <hi>others</hi> alÅ¿o. "Whereunto," Å¿ays he, the more effectually to confirm him in the faith,
<q>I am ordained a Preacher, and an ApoÅ¿tle; I Å¿peak the truth in ChriÅ¿t, and lie not; a teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in faith and verity.</q>
â€”In conformity with which opinion, "I exhort," adds he,
<q>that Å¿upplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prayers, interceÅ¿Å¿ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men, even for Kings, and for all that are in authority <note n="*" place="bottom">Whenever any perÅ¿ons are put into a Å¿alvable Å¿tate, or may obtain mercy, if they repent and believe, as was the caÅ¿e with thoÅ¿e men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the ApoÅ¿tle, they are the proper Å¿ubjects of the prayers of their fellow men. But in all the prayers of meer men, who cannot look into the particular counÅ¿els of God, as they relate to individuals, I conceive that the matter petitioned for, is to be reÅ¿igned to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Divine Will; and therefore, although Saint Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that all nations and claÅ¿Å¿es of men, being put into a Å¿alvable Å¿tate, are to be prayed for, yet it in no Å¿ort follows from hence, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual perÅ¿on, will finally be Å¿aved, any more than it does, that when worn with Å¿ickneÅ¿s, we pray for health, we Å¿hall moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be reÅ¿tored. And yet Å¿uch a prayer may be very Å¿criptural and proper. In evidence of which, only read the words of ChriÅ¿t, John xvii. 9. "I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haÅ¿t given me." Our Saviour, in various parts of this chapter, utters expreÅ¿Å¿ions in a manner, which would be very unbecoming <hi>us.</hi> He Å¿peaks with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He Å¿eems in the text quoted, to be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the future, and particular Å¿tate of things. By this knowledge, he directs his petition; and well aÅ¿Å¿ured, it was not a fact, that every individual perÅ¿on on earth would be Å¿aved, he here moÅ¿t fully expreÅ¿Å¿es his aÅ¿Å¿ent unto it, including in his interceÅ¿Å¿ions, thoÅ¿e only who were given him out of the world, or did <hi>already,</hi> or might in <hi>future,</hi> believe in him, and keep his word; that is, all believers, and friends of God.â€”This alone is a Å¿ufficient argument againÅ¿t the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for if there are any perÅ¿ons, who are not intereÅ¿ted in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ions of the Saviour, but for whom he even refuÅ¿es to plead, what poÅ¿Å¿ibility is there, that they will be Å¿aved?</note>:</q>
which he thus enforces,
<q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, who gave himÅ¿elf
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017524_0006_0FA12B66B2F7E9A0"/>
a ranÅ¿om for all,</q>
even for Gentiles as well as Jews, "to be teÅ¿tified," or proved, "in due time;" which was in part <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, in the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of the Church, by the power of God, among the Gentile nations, and will be fully done, when, with the preÅ¿ent unbelieving Jews, the fulneÅ¿s of the Gentiles will be brought in.â€” The argument in the words, "For there is one God," &amp;c. appears to be this, That the univerÅ¿ality of God's government and dominion over all people, made it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that his beneficence and mercy was equally extenÅ¿ive; and therefore that his Son was not Å¿ent to be a Mediator for the Jews only, but alÅ¿o for the Gentiles, or all nations whatÅ¿oever:â€”Which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was intended to refute the contracted ideas of the Jews, who conÅ¿idered ChriÅ¿t as a Saviour to them alone, Å¿o alÅ¿o it was equally oppoÅ¿ed to the opinion of the idolatrous nations, who conÅ¿idered the God of the Jews, as having no dominion over, or concern about <hi>them</hi>; which opinion it was very needful to remove, as being utterly againÅ¿t the doctrine the ApoÅ¿tle deÅ¿ired to inculcate, reÅ¿pecting the extent of the benefits reÅ¿ulting from the mediatorÅ¿hip of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us.</p>
            <p>A particular attention is paid by Mr. White, the firÅ¿t and principal author introduced by the compiler, to 1 Tim. iv. 10.
<q>The living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eÅ¿pecially of thoÅ¿e that believe.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017524_0007_0FA12B689F7F6A60"/>It is obÅ¿erved by Å¿everal writers, that the original word here tranÅ¿lated <hi>Saviour,</hi> equally Å¿ignifies, and is very often uÅ¿ed for <hi>PreÅ¿erver</hi>;â€”that the ApoÅ¿tle Paul, in order to encourage Timothy while encountering the labours and reproaches he met with in his miniÅ¿terial office, puts him in mind of that Å¿ubÅ¿tantial Å¿upport which always aroÅ¿e from truÅ¿ting in God, who was the Saviour, or PreÅ¿erver of all men, but whoÅ¿e preÅ¿erving care was more eÅ¿pecially extended into true believers.</p>
            <p>But not to inÅ¿iÅ¿t on this; it is readily admitted, that although ChriÅ¿t be more emphatically the Saviour of believers than others, yet there is a Å¿enÅ¿e, in which he may be Å¿aid to be the Saviour of all men, implying every individual perÅ¿on, but this very different from the one, which thoÅ¿e who hold to the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al Salvation, exhibit to us.
<q>If any man Å¿in we have an advocate with the Father, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the righteous, who is the propitiation for our Å¿ins, and not for ours only, but for the Å¿ins of the whole world.</q>
Or, Titus ii. 11. according to the offered tranÅ¿lation,
<q>the grace of God, which bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men, hath appeared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The language of the GoÅ¿pel is,
<q>WhoÅ¿oever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, may be Å¿aved;â€”WhoÅ¿oever will, may drink of the waters of life freely: For he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall in no wiÅ¿e be caÅ¿t out, but in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, is accepted with him.</q>
In conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the obedience and death of ChriÅ¿t, there is a general proclamation madeâ€”pardon is offered unto all menâ€”"the Å¿in of the world is taken away;" that is, this great obÅ¿tacle, which deÅ¿erves the wrath of God, is declared to be Å¿o Å¿et aÅ¿ide, as that he who repents of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or, in a Å¿criptural Å¿enÅ¿e, is an accepter of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may enter Heaven, and enjoy his Maker, as though he had never Å¿inned. The choice is left with man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017524_0008_0FA12B68F0F5BCB8"/>I preÅ¿ume this truth will not be doubted. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expreÅ¿s word of God, it is plain, that mercy cannot be granted without an atonement; and where it cannot be granted, it Å¿urely cannot be offered; and therefore an offer of mercy Å¿o compleat and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al as has been mentioned, muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally compleat, and Å¿ufficient for the Å¿alvation of the whole world.</p>
            <p>Should any doubts ariÅ¿e reÅ¿pecting this point, let it be conÅ¿idered, that the perÅ¿on who made atonement, is the Son of God, and repreÅ¿ented in the Å¿cripture, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateÅ¿t price, or gift, which the Father had to beÅ¿tow on mankind: From whence it follows, that if this atonement be not equal to what has juÅ¿t been Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible with God, out of all his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures, to offer any that Å¿hould.</p>
            <p>A certain perÅ¿on comes to me at a time, when by Å¿ome misfortune, I have ruined my affairs, and loÅ¿t my <hi>all.</hi> He tells me, he is Å¿enÅ¿ible of my neceÅ¿Å¿ity, and has brought me relief. Only conÅ¿ent, Å¿ays he, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of itâ€”acknowledge the gift, and it is yours. Now while it is at my own option, and in my power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure happineÅ¿s to myÅ¿elf, by this perÅ¿on, may I not conÅ¿ider him as my deliverer, and friend? JuÅ¿t in the Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿e, is ChriÅ¿t the friend and deliverer of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.â€”But are we to conclude, becauÅ¿e the atonement of our Saviour has opened the way for the offer of mercy unto all men, that it will be <hi>accepted</hi> by all? Or becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us has brought pardon, life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to every man, that for a certainty, every man will <hi>receive</hi> it? When it is Å¿aid therefore, that
<q>JeÅ¿us gave himÅ¿elf a ranÅ¿om for <hi>all,</hi> and was a propitiation for the Å¿ins of the whole world, or taÅ¿ted death for every man,</q>
the prepoÅ¿ition <hi>for,</hi> and the <hi>univerÅ¿ality</hi> contained in the whole words taken together, have in view the univerÅ¿al offer of mercy which is made to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017524_0009_0FA12B69B04C5D58"/>
mankind, or the Å¿alvable Å¿tate which men are put into, in conÅ¿equence of ChriÅ¿t's death, without any reference to the effects or conÅ¿equences which this offer will have; for this is a wholly diÅ¿tinct thing.</p>
            <p>Further, it is not only true that ChriÅ¿t is a ranÅ¿om and propitiatory Å¿acrifice for all men, including every individual, becauÅ¿e through him they are the Å¿ubjects of offered mercy, but in addition to this, there are Å¿ome bleÅ¿Å¿ings, which every perÅ¿on on earth, does in a poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manner enjoy, and which are to be attributed Å¿olely to what he has Å¿uffered and done. This appears thus:â€” The deÅ¿ert of <hi>Å¿in</hi> is <hi>death,</hi> in its comprehenÅ¿ive Å¿enÅ¿e. When our firÅ¿t parents Å¿inned, by eating the forbidden fruit, they in a Å¿enÅ¿e died immediately; for with reÅ¿pect to Å¿piritual death, they loÅ¿t the image of God; added to this, their bodies were brought into a <hi>corruptible, mortal</hi> condition from that moment. The ground of their enjoyment of any earthly comfort in this Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence afterwards, was the introduction of the Å¿cheme of redemption, which had already been deviÅ¿ed,â€”the effects of which, began now to operate. And this is the reaÅ¿on of each perÅ¿on's continuance in the preÅ¿ent world, and his participation of any bleÅ¿Å¿ing whatÅ¿oever, but the Å¿malleÅ¿t portion of time, after he has been the Å¿ubject of one Å¿inful volition.â€”Immediately on the fall of Adam, the whole world was put under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial government;â€”agreeably to the deÅ¿igns of this government, we enter lifeâ€”enjoy the comforts which the world affordsâ€”our food and raimentâ€”our friends, and all our bleÅ¿Å¿ings. Every Å¿ingle gift is the fruit, or conÅ¿equence of ChriÅ¿t's obedience and death; the whole which happens to us, being intended as the means to accompliÅ¿h the vaÅ¿t purpoÅ¿es of the mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017524_0010_0FA12B6A6EE29FE0"/>We Å¿ee then in what Å¿enÅ¿e it may be Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t is the Saviour of the whole world, and yet this afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no manner of proof, that all men will finally be happy.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the conÅ¿ideration of two other paÅ¿Å¿ages of Å¿cripture, introduced by the Å¿ame author in behalf of his favourite Å¿cheme.
<q>That in the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the fulneÅ¿s of times, he might gather together in one, all things in ChriÅ¿t, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</q>
Eph. i. 10.â€”
<q>And having made peace, through the blood of his croÅ¿s, by him to reconcile all things to himÅ¿elf, by him, I Å¿ay, whether they be things on earth, or things in Heaven.</q>
Col. i. 20.</p>
            <p>The deÅ¿ign of the ApoÅ¿tle in theÅ¿e chapters, Å¿eems to be, to communicate to the ColoÅ¿Å¿ian and EpheÅ¿ian churches, thoÅ¿e honourable ideas, which it was their duty, and would be their intereÅ¿t to form, concerning the greatneÅ¿s of that Saviour, whoÅ¿e name they had Å¿o lately profeÅ¿Å¿ed. In doing this, he repreÅ¿ents him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theÅ¿e principal charactersâ€”as the creator of all things which were created in Heaven and earthâ€”the upholder of all things upheld, and the reconciler of all things reconciled; that is, in Å¿um, the great agent in the <hi>whole,</hi> unto whom all the work, included in each of theÅ¿e articles belonged, and by whom it was all performed.</p>
            <p>The argument contained in Mr. White's obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, that the words <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>univerÅ¿al</hi> in their Å¿ignification, and therefore that <hi>all men,</hi> and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, muÅ¿t naturally be included in them. In anÅ¿wer to which, it may be obÅ¿erved, that if we conÅ¿ider the expreÅ¿Å¿ions, <hi>gathering together in one,</hi> and <hi>reconciling,</hi> to imply, the reducing from a Å¿tate of moral <hi>diÅ¿order</hi> to <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or <hi>enmity</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> it is certain, that the words <hi>all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017524_0011_0FA12B6B2FECB510"/>
things,</hi> cannot imply an <hi>entire univerÅ¿ality,</hi> becauÅ¿e with reÅ¿pect to the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the holy Angels, who have never Å¿inned, are in no propriety of Å¿peech, the Å¿ubjects of Å¿uch change and reconciliation; and thus the idea of <hi>univerÅ¿ality</hi> is infringed on. The queÅ¿tion then is, if in <hi>one</hi> caÅ¿e the idea of univerÅ¿ality muÅ¿t be given up, why not alÅ¿o in the <hi>other?</hi> If the words are Å¿o reÅ¿tricted in their Å¿ignification, as that with reÅ¿pect to the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> they do not contain univerÅ¿ality, why Å¿hould they be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to contain univerÅ¿ality, with reÅ¿pect to the things on <hi>earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ApoÅ¿tle Paul is here diÅ¿courÅ¿ing of ChriÅ¿t and the Church. By the things brought into a Å¿tate of <hi>union</hi> and <hi>reconciliation,</hi> it is therefore in no degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to Å¿uppoÅ¿e he intended <hi>the whole redeemed Church,</hi> not only compoÅ¿ed of the Å¿aints on earth, but alÅ¿o of the Å¿aints in Heaven, who had lived before the crucifixion of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿hould be Å¿aved equally with the others; the words <hi>all things,</hi> plainly referring to the <hi>whole</hi> which was included under the denomination of what he was then Å¿peaking of.</p>
            <p>And there are various paÅ¿Å¿ages of Å¿cripture in which the like general expreÅ¿Å¿ions are uÅ¿ed, when at the Å¿ame time, it is well known that a certain limitation is Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed. In the 9th ch. Exodus and 6th verÅ¿e, we are informed, that "all the cattle of Egypt died:" Yet in the 20th verÅ¿e of the Å¿ame chapter, it is Å¿aid, that
<q>he that feared the Lord, amongÅ¿t the Å¿ervants of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, made his cattle flee into the houÅ¿es;</q>
which cattle did not die. In Job xx. 12. we read,
<q>Man lieth down, and riÅ¿eth not again 'till the Heavens be no more: They Å¿hall not awake, nor be raiÅ¿ed out of their Å¿leep.</q>
It is however expreÅ¿Å¿ly Å¿aid in Matth. xxvii. 52, 53 that at the crucifixion of our Saviour,
<q>the graves were opened, and many bodies of Å¿aints
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017524_0012_0FA12B6BEFEFBA80"/>
which Å¿lept aroÅ¿e, and came out of the graves after his reÅ¿urrection, and went into the Holy city, and appeared unto many.</q>
In the epiÅ¿tle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans it is written,
<q>By one man Å¿in came into the world, and death by Å¿in, and Å¿o death paÅ¿Å¿ed upon all men, for that all have Å¿inned.</q>
But <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> were tranÅ¿lated to Heaven, without Å¿eeing death.</p>
            <p>Nor is it conÅ¿idered improper, but on the other hand, it is a licence always taken in language, to make uÅ¿e of expreÅ¿Å¿ions of <hi>general import,</hi> which admit of Å¿ome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>; Å¿ince, if the <hi>exceptions</hi> are fully known, or by any manner, particularly Å¿pecified, the meaning of Å¿uch general expreÅ¿Å¿ions, is well aÅ¿certained, and the true deÅ¿ign of language, which is to communicate ideas, is adhered to, without the trouble, which a minute expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would put us to, every time we write or Å¿peak.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion, however, of Å¿everal writers, that the terms <hi>gather together in one, and reconcile,</hi> amount to more than the meerly bringing the Å¿ubject Å¿poken of into a Å¿tate of <hi>friendÅ¿hip,</hi> from a Å¿tate of <hi>enmity</hi>; and really refer to that condition of <hi>reconcileableneÅ¿s,</hi> which mankind in general, may be Å¿aid to be in, Å¿ince the blood of ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ufficient for the Å¿alvation of the whole world, and whoÅ¿oever <hi>will</hi> may be Å¿aved.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who conÅ¿ider the meaning to be, that <hi>all things</hi> are actually Å¿o <hi>gathered together into one, and reconciled,</hi> as that they are wreÅ¿ted from that diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Å¿tate, into which they had been reduced by Å¿in, and are now put under a fixed plan of mediatorial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; according to which, all events and things, even the different Å¿tates of men, with reÅ¿pect to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and miÅ¿ery, in the preÅ¿ent, and future world, will promote the purpoÅ¿es of God's glory, and be to his praiÅ¿e; agreeably to thoÅ¿e words in Å¿acred writ,
<q>the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017524_0013_0FA12B6CAF1F04D0"/>
wrath of man Å¿hall praiÅ¿e him;</q>
for as <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>of</hi> him, likewiÅ¿e <hi>all things</hi> will be <hi>to</hi> him, for evermore. In both of theÅ¿e interpretations, the univerÅ¿ality of the expreÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>all things,</hi> is as fully admitted, as is contended for: So that on the whole, in whatÅ¿oever Å¿enÅ¿e we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider the words <hi>gather together in one, and reconcile</hi>; and whether we allow the idea of <hi>univerÅ¿ality</hi> to belong to the term <hi>all things,</hi> or not, it appears that the doctrine of univerÅ¿al Å¿alvation, is by no means, neceÅ¿Å¿arily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in either the <hi>one</hi> caÅ¿e, or the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Å¿hall make but one remark more on this point. That after the reÅ¿urrection of the dead, and appearance of the world before the judge, every true believer will be received into Heaven, and every unbeliever be caÅ¿t into Hell, this Mr. White himÅ¿elf allows, although he Å¿uppoÅ¿es the puniÅ¿hment to be but <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It Å¿eems his ideas are, that this puniÅ¿hment is <hi>diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary,</hi> or the mean to be uÅ¿ed in accompliÅ¿hing the <hi>gathering together all things, or perÅ¿ons, into one,</hi> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their final Å¿alvation;â€”moreover, that <hi>Hell</hi> is the place, in which this work is to be done, and that the period between the <hi>day of judgment,</hi> and what he calls the <hi>end,</hi> is the time allotted for the performance of it.</p>
            <p>Now the ApoÅ¿tle Paul aÅ¿Å¿ures us, that the <hi>gathering together in one, all things in ChriÅ¿t,</hi> is to be done
<q>in the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the fulneÅ¿s of times,</q>
which, without a critical conÅ¿ideration of the words, muÅ¿t Å¿urely be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to refer to <hi>the time particularly appointed by God, for the work of grace, and the goÅ¿pel to operate.</hi> This being the caÅ¿e, it follows, from what our author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf allows, that the Å¿eaÅ¿on allotted for the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners, is, at leaÅ¿t, a <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of the fulneÅ¿s of times</hi>; and that the work of grace, is in <hi>part</hi> to be performed in <hi>Hell.</hi> But does it not appear a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017524_0014_0FA12B6D6E170E98"/>
unuÅ¿ual, to conÅ¿ider the exhibitions of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> againÅ¿t the impenitent, as the exhibitions of his <hi>grace</hi> in their <hi>behalf?</hi> If the future puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners is to be of the diÅ¿ciplinary kind, then it is like the afflictions of the righteous on earth, working out for them, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. According to Å¿uch a repreÅ¿entation, the Å¿inner is Å¿ent to Hell for his <hi>advantage,</hi> and Tophet was ordained of old, as the place in which the Almighty might exerciÅ¿e <hi>mercy</hi> on offenders, and not <hi>justice and judgment only.</hi> Let any one Å¿eriouÅ¿ly aÅ¿k himÅ¿elf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can reconcile this, with the plain language of Å¿acred writ?</p>
            <p>The next paÅ¿Å¿age I Å¿hall remark on, introduced by Mr. White, is Romans, v. from the 15th to the 19th verÅ¿e.â€”
<q>But not as the offence, Å¿o alÅ¿o is the free gift: For if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that Å¿inned, Å¿o is the gift: For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juÅ¿tification. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, Å¿hall reign in life by one, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even Å¿o, by the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto juÅ¿tification of life. For as by one man's diÅ¿obedience, many were made Å¿inners, Å¿o by the obedience of one, Å¿hall many be made righteous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the firÅ¿t part of theÅ¿e words, by Å¿everal obÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein contained, the evident deÅ¿ign is to prove the Å¿tronger degree of willingneÅ¿s in God, that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>goodneÅ¿s</hi> Å¿hould abound by <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> than that <hi>Å¿in</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017524_0015_0FA12B6E31537CB8"/>
               <hi>evil,</hi> Å¿hould abound through <hi>Adam.</hi> The principal part of them, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to favour the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al Salvation, is,
<q>as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even Å¿o, by the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juÅ¿tification of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the offence of <hi>one,</hi> Å¿in was introduced into the world;â€”all the deÅ¿cendants of Adam have partook of his wicked nature, and judgment has come upon all men to condemnation. The point inÅ¿iÅ¿ted on by our author is, that the <hi>free gift</hi> is as univerÅ¿al as the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This I think may readily be granted, and yet in no degree countenance his favourite Å¿entiment. Adam, our firÅ¿t parent, before he tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, was in a Å¿tate of <hi>probation.</hi> He might have Å¿ecured the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if he had remained perfect. As by his eating the forbidden fruit, he fell, and this introduced Å¿in among his deÅ¿cendants, who have fallen with him, a compleat loÅ¿s of the right to <hi>life</hi> has followed;â€”the whole world has forfeited the privilege of being in a probationary condition, for judgment, which is the deÅ¿ert of Å¿in, is come upon all men to condemnation. This is the conÅ¿equence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence. What then is the conÅ¿equence of the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi>?
<q>The free gift is come upon all men unto juÅ¿tification of life;</q>
the natural explanation of which is, the free gift, or the grace of the goÅ¿pel, is come, or propoÅ¿ed unto all men, bringing with it <hi>juÅ¿tification,</hi> which juÅ¿tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation produces, or ends in life: That is, as by the Å¿in of <hi>Adam,</hi> which introduced Å¿in among his deÅ¿cendants, <hi>all men</hi> have fallen from a Å¿tate of probation, and are under condemnation, Å¿o by the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t, the propoÅ¿al of grace and pardon, or the <hi>free gift,</hi> has come upon, or unto all;â€”whoÅ¿oever <hi>will,</hi> may be Å¿aved, being in fact put into an <hi>equal</hi> Å¿tate of probation, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017524_0016_0FA12B705C003298"/>
entitled to an <hi>equal</hi> privilege with <hi>that,</hi> which exiÅ¿ted before the fall, and any Å¿tate of trial whatÅ¿oever; or which would have exiÅ¿ted, if Adam had never Å¿inned, and his poÅ¿terity had not joined in rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thus is the free gift as <hi>univerÅ¿al</hi> as the judgment; for certainly the offer of mercy, may be called a <hi>free gift.</hi> It was eÅ¿Å¿ential to our author's point, that he Å¿hould diÅ¿prove it, and Å¿how that by the free gift's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, or unto all, was intended, not only that it was offered unto all men, but that it Å¿hould finally, be univerÅ¿ally accepted. This would be difficult; for comparing Å¿cripture with Å¿cripture, the very contrary, is plainly intimated, in a very Å¿triking paÅ¿Å¿age, among others, on this Å¿ubject, by the Å¿ame <hi>ApoÅ¿tle</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who Å¿peaking concerning his being Å¿ent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Å¿ays, that he
<q>magnifies his office, if by any means, he may provoke to emulation them which are his fleÅ¿h, and might Å¿ave SOME of them.</q>
AlÅ¿o, from Gal. iii. 22.

            <p>We may conÅ¿ider the whole repreÅ¿entation thus: The firÅ¿t and Å¿econd doxology, is the real expreÅ¿Å¿ion of the joy and rapture of the redeemed church, and angels in Heaven, when the Lamb comes, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the book. But, as if this were not a Å¿ufficient cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his praiÅ¿e at Å¿uch an event, by a grand <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onification,</hi> the third is exhibited as the echo of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿al nature, in which, for the period, every being in the univerÅ¿e, and the whole inanimate creation, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented as alÅ¿o becoming <hi>vocal,</hi> and at once breaking out into <hi>that praiÅ¿e,</hi> which praiÅ¿e, as the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t tells us, is ever expreÅ¿Å¿ed, though in Å¿ilent language, by all the works of God.</p>
            <p>There is a beautiful Å¿imilitude between this part of the viÅ¿ion of Saint John, and thoÅ¿e words of David, in which he calls upon all things to praiÅ¿e their Maker.
<q>PraiÅ¿e him ye Å¿un and moon: PraiÅ¿e him all ye Å¿tars of light. PraiÅ¿e him ye dragons, and all deeps. Fire and hail, Å¿now and vapour, Å¿tormy wind; mountains and all hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars. BeaÅ¿ts and all cattle, creeping things, and flying fowl. Kings of the earth, and all people; praiÅ¿e ye the Lord.</q>
And whereas in this <hi>PÅ¿alm,</hi> the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017524_0018_0FA12B712CF913A8"/>
is invited to join in the hymn of praiÅ¿e,â€”in what the <hi>ApoÅ¿tle</hi> was witneÅ¿s to, the anthem is repreÅ¿ented as if really Å¿ung, and the whole Å¿yÅ¿tem of univerÅ¿al nature engaged in loud reÅ¿ponÅ¿es to the doxology of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed church, and the celeÅ¿tial angels.</p>
            <p>I Å¿hall proceed now to the conÅ¿ideration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks made on the quotation from the EpiÅ¿tle to the Corinthians, taking alÅ¿o in view, the obÅ¿ervations on Gen. iii. 15. concerning our Saviour's bruiÅ¿ing the head of the Å¿erpent.â€”
<q>Then cometh the end, when he Å¿hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he Å¿hall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he muÅ¿t reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laÅ¿t enemy that Å¿hall be deÅ¿troyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he Å¿aith, all things are put under him, it is manifeÅ¿t that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things Å¿hall be Å¿ubdued unto him, then Å¿hall the Å¿on alÅ¿o himÅ¿elf be Å¿ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</q>
1 Cor. xv. 24th. to 28th verÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>In the uÅ¿e which is made of theÅ¿e words, in defence of the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Salvation, it might in the firÅ¿t place, have been expected of the expoÅ¿itor, that, as being Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential to his point, he would have entered more particularly into the argument, to Å¿how, that by our Saviour's vanquiÅ¿hing, or putting all enemies under his feet, and bruiÅ¿ing the head of the Å¿erpent, is not intended what is uÅ¿ually believed.</p>
            <p>He might have been told, that the enemies of ChriÅ¿t are vanquiÅ¿hed, and the head of the Å¿erpent bruiÅ¿ed, when at the judgment day they are Å¿ent into puniÅ¿hment, and all the plots deviÅ¿ed againÅ¿t the kingdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t of ChriÅ¿t, are wholly diÅ¿appointed, and even made the means of illuÅ¿trating his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017524_0019_0FA12B71F03E8660"/>But the vanquiÅ¿hment of God's enemies, according to his idea of it, is very different: It implies in it <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>: It is not a <hi>curÅ¿e,</hi> but a <hi>bleÅ¿Å¿ing</hi>: It conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the beÅ¿towment of <hi>everlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿s.</hi> And if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand the argument rightly, it involves in it the idea of the Å¿alvation of the <hi>devils,</hi> as well as <hi>wicked men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queÅ¿tion now is, whether we moÅ¿t accommodate ourÅ¿elves to the common uÅ¿e and acceptation of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in Å¿aying, that when it was written, that our Saviour would Å¿ubdue, or vanquiÅ¿h his enemies, it was hereby Å¿ignified that he would beÅ¿tow on them <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>everlaÅ¿ting gain,</hi> or in Å¿aying, that this vanquiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment implies, that they Å¿hall be overtaken with <hi>diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment diÅ¿grace</hi> and <hi>loÅ¿s?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another particular which might have been expected from this writer, is, that he Å¿hould have offered Å¿ome kind of argument to Å¿how, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>delivery of the kingdom</hi> here Å¿poken of, is not to be at the Å¿econd coming of ChriÅ¿t, and day of judgment, but at a future period.</p>
            <p>On the truth of this Å¿ingle article, I conceive that the reaÅ¿onings on this text, and indeed this whole Å¿cheme of univerÅ¿al Å¿alvation entirely depend; for as it is granted, that after the day of judgment, the wicked will be turned into <hi>Hell,</hi> to be puniÅ¿hed for a <hi>Å¿eaÅ¿on,</hi> that is, 'till the <hi>end</hi> comes; if therefore, according to the Å¿cripture account, the period of time emphatically Å¿tiled the <hi>end,</hi> is to commence at the Å¿econd coming of ChriÅ¿t, or judgment day, I infer, that the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Salvation, as thus exhibited to us, cannot be true, and that all the arguments brought in favour of it, are unÅ¿upported, and nothing to the purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The ApoÅ¿tle had, in the beginning of this chapter, been diÅ¿courÅ¿ing of the general reÅ¿urrection of the dead, immediately preceding the judgment.
<q>Then cometh the end, when he Å¿hall have delivered up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017524_0020_0FA12B72AE24FD00"/>
to God even the Father,</q>
&amp;c. But when is this to be? After
<q>he hath put all enemies under his feet.</q>
And
<q>the laÅ¿t enemy which Å¿hall be deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is death,</q>
or ceÅ¿Å¿ation of exiÅ¿tence, in a compleat Å¿enÅ¿e: And therefore Saint Paul adds, in evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the whole,
<q>ElÅ¿e what Å¿hall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead riÅ¿e not at all?</q>
And in full aÅ¿Å¿urance of his having proved his point, he Å¿ubjoins,
<q>Oh death! where is thy Å¿ting? Oh grave! where is thy victory?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before our author could Å¿uppoÅ¿e that he had gained any Å¿trength from this whole quotation, it was neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it Å¿hould appear, and it belonged to him to prove, that the deÅ¿truction of death here mentioned, has no reference at all to natural death, and the reÅ¿urrection. This he does not attempt, but allows in general, that according to his own interpretation of the words at large, the <hi>firÅ¿t,</hi> and the <hi>Å¿econd death,</hi>
               <q>will be totally and abÅ¿olutely deÅ¿troyed;</q>
meaning by the <hi>firÅ¿t death,</hi> the mortality of the body, or the ceÅ¿Å¿ation of life and exiÅ¿tence; and by the <hi>Å¿econd death,</hi> the exiÅ¿tence of Å¿in, and the puniÅ¿hment of it. Indeed, the connection obÅ¿ervable through the whole chapter, will not admit the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, that the ApoÅ¿tle's words have <hi>no relation</hi> to the <hi>firÅ¿t death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears then, that the deÅ¿truction of death men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this quotation, is joined with the Å¿ubjection of all things; each article, Å¿pecified in the verÅ¿es, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreÅ¿ented, as if belonging to <hi>one</hi> work and to take place at the <hi>Å¿ame time</hi>;â€”the deÅ¿truction of death, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently making a capital part in the victory which our Saviour is to obtain at the Å¿eaÅ¿on deÅ¿cribed.</p>
            <p>If then, by theÅ¿e words, <hi>the laÅ¿t enemy which Å¿hall be deÅ¿troyed is death,</hi> the ApoÅ¿tle refers, though it be but in part, to <hi>natural death,</hi> and the <hi>reÅ¿urrection,</hi> does it not plainly follow, if we would preÅ¿erve any <hi>beauty,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017524_0021_0FA12B736D0C5558"/>
union, among the parts of the deÅ¿cription, in the whole verÅ¿es quoted, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>Å¿ubjection of all things, and delivery of the kingdom,</hi> will exiÅ¿t at the <hi>reÅ¿urrection of the dead,</hi> or <hi>general judgment</hi> immediately following. For Å¿uppoÅ¿ing, as this writer does, that the deÅ¿truction of death, the laÅ¿t enemy to be deÅ¿troyed, includes in it, both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral death,</hi> and that the former will be entirely deÅ¿troyed at the reÅ¿urrection, but the latter, not until a <hi>long</hi> or <hi>unknown period</hi> afterwards, in this caÅ¿e there is evidently a <hi>diÅ¿memberÅ¿hip</hi> in the parts of the deÅ¿criptionâ€”<hi>two</hi> periods of time are introduced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where there is only the appearance of <hi>one,</hi> and the harmony of the <hi>whole</hi> is broken.â€”I cannot therefore conceive, that there is any other method to do juÅ¿tice to the ApoÅ¿tle's words, and the arrangement of his ideas throughout this chapter, than by believing that the <hi>whole deÅ¿truction</hi> he refers to, is in fact to be performed at the reÅ¿urrection of the dead, and appearance of ChriÅ¿t to judge the world.</p>
            <p>In further confirmation of this truth, and as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the end and reÅ¿ignation of the mediatorial kingdom, will commence at the appearance of ChriÅ¿t, on the reÅ¿urrection day, we may conÅ¿ider thoÅ¿e words in Acts iii. 21.
<q>Whom the Heaven muÅ¿t receive, until the times of reÅ¿titution of all things.</q>
â€”It will readily be granted, I imagine, that the <hi>times,</hi> or <hi>time</hi> of <hi>reÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>reÅ¿ignation of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial kingdom,</hi> are one and the Å¿ame: And therefore, if the reÅ¿titution of all things, will be at the reÅ¿urrection, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>delivery of the kingdom</hi> will alÅ¿o. What then is the idea contained in the declaration, that the Heaven will receive our Saviour until the reÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things? I anÅ¿wer, it is thisâ€”that he will never be again Å¿een by the world, or make his appearance to men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> until that important Å¿eaÅ¿on.
<q>Whom the Heaven muÅ¿t receive until the times of reÅ¿titution of all
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017524_0022_0FA12B7433BFE8D8"/>
things.</q>
But the Heaven will moÅ¿t certainly receive him <hi>after</hi> the reÅ¿titution of all things, as well as <hi>before.</hi> There Å¿eems therefore, to be no circumÅ¿tance to Å¿et in oppoÅ¿ition to the idea already mentioned, viz. that our Saviour will remain in the Heaven, until the time of reÅ¿titution referred to. And while this interpretation of the words appears rational and eaÅ¿y, it has alÅ¿o the very great advantage, of being the moÅ¿t conformable to the general language of Å¿cripture, which often expreÅ¿Å¿ly makes mention of the <hi>Å¿econd</hi> appearance of our Saviour, which is to be at the reÅ¿urrection and judgment day, but makes no mention of <hi>any,</hi> which is called a <hi>third</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>On the whole then, it appears, that all theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages of Å¿cripture, are <hi>againÅ¿t</hi> the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For if the <hi>reÅ¿titution of all things,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>reÅ¿ignation of the mediatorial kingdom,</hi> will be at the appearance of ChriÅ¿t at the reÅ¿urrection, at which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, even our author allows, he will conÅ¿ign the wicked, though but for a Å¿eaÅ¿on, to <hi>Hell,</hi> it follows, that all the hopes of reÅ¿toration to future favour and happineÅ¿s, will be entirely cut off, becauÅ¿e, when the mediatorial kingdom is ended, there can no longer, be any mercy beÅ¿towed on Å¿inners, Å¿ince all mercy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed for ChriÅ¿t's Å¿ake: And by the mediatorial king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's being ended, is obviouÅ¿ly meant, that there is an abÅ¿olute cloÅ¿e put to the period, wherein there is the laÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ibility of a Å¿ingle addition being made to the number of the redeemed, then exiÅ¿ting.</p>
            <p>But I wiÅ¿h to reaÅ¿on a little further on this Å¿ubject, and aÅ¿k, in what Å¿enÅ¿e it is that <hi>Hell</hi> is to be a Å¿tate of <hi>purification?</hi> for this is the idea which is offered to us concerning it, by theÅ¿e writers.<note n="*" place="bottom">In proof of this, I might refer the reader, to a number of paÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Å¿aid pamphlet. If the puniÅ¿hment of <hi>hell</hi> is to be,
<q>in order that</q>
the Å¿ubjects of it, "may be made the willing people of God;" if they will not be
<q>delivered from their Å¿uffering, till this is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> or till their puniÅ¿hment Å¿hall have produced a proper effect, or "burnt out Å¿in and luÅ¿t," certainly, if there be any meaning in words, the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners in the other world, is to be <hi>purgative,</hi> and their dwelling-place, may be Å¿trictly termed PURGATORY.</note> Is the <hi>purification</hi> to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017524_0023_0FA12B74F0C79450"/>
be produced <hi>gradually?</hi> Then it Å¿eems there is a holy and virtuous principle in Å¿inners, which is capable of being wrought upon by <hi>puniÅ¿hment</hi>â€”which <hi>puniÅ¿hment,</hi> by the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, is to have very different effects than that which was once inflicted upon Pharaoh and his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoÅ¿e hearts were thereby hardened. And may it not plainly be inferred from hence, that <hi>Å¿inners</hi> and <hi>Å¿aints</hi> on earth, are perÅ¿ons of the very Å¿ame character; for there is no <hi>Å¿aint,</hi> of whom more can be Å¿aid, than that he is virtuous in <hi>part,</hi> or in <hi>a degree,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the poÅ¿ition, the Å¿ame muÅ¿t be allowed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect to <hi>Å¿inners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, is this <hi>purification</hi> to be performed <hi>all at once,</hi> and when the <hi>end</hi> is come? If Å¿o, it is evident that <hi>puniÅ¿hment</hi> will not be the means of it <hi>at all,</hi> for if this will have no influence of the kind at <hi>firÅ¿t,</hi> neither can it have influence at <hi>laÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But paÅ¿Å¿ing by the conÅ¿ideration of theÅ¿e things, it is probable it will be allowed, that when any of mankind continue to be impenitent, and unbelievers, to the end of life, the puniÅ¿hment to be inflicted on them in <hi>Hell,</hi> will be done, in order to Å¿atisfy, or manifeÅ¿t the divine juÅ¿tice; and, that in <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> it will be Å¿o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, as to be the <hi>juÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>full</hi> reward of Å¿in. This indeed Å¿eems to be the Å¿entiment of Mr. White himÅ¿elf, in the pamphlet under conÅ¿ideration, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding he may, at the Å¿ame time, conÅ¿ider future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment as <hi>purgative,</hi> or <hi>diÅ¿ciplinary,</hi> yet Å¿ays, that the deÅ¿ign of God in this puniÅ¿hment of Å¿in, is
<q>to glorify his wrath againÅ¿t it, and his juÅ¿tice alÅ¿o.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017524_0024_0FA12B75AD718B80"/>Be this as it may, the Å¿cripture is plainly deciÅ¿ive in the repreÅ¿entation of this fact. When the Lord Å¿hall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on Å¿inners, and conÅ¿ign them to future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment, his buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, as we are informed, will be to <hi>reward their Å¿in, and evil works</hi>: Whether therefore this puniÅ¿hment be conÅ¿idered as <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>leÅ¿s</hi>â€”as <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>not eternal,</hi> it is certain, that it will be according to the full meaÅ¿ure of the demerit of Å¿in; for the <hi>reward</hi> of Å¿in, muÅ¿t in the nature of things, have reÅ¿pect to the <hi>degree</hi> of it. It will be the execution of the threatning of God's word; or as it is called, the
<q>recompence of the Lord</q>
againÅ¿t the Å¿inner, and the diÅ¿play of his <hi>juÅ¿tice,</hi> from which, as the Å¿cripture aÅ¿Å¿ures us, there can be no poÅ¿Å¿ibility of eÅ¿caping, until it be compleatly Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and the debt which is due to it be paid, to
<q>the uttermoÅ¿t farthing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now enquire what will be the conÅ¿equence, if it Å¿hould even be allowed, that there will be Å¿ome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time hereafter, when it may be Å¿aid, that Å¿inners have Å¿uffered a puniÅ¿hment wholly adequate to their crimes. It is thisâ€”that Å¿uppoÅ¿ing they Å¿hould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be admitted into Heaven, it cannot be Å¿aid, if we would give the word its <hi>comprehenÅ¿ive</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> meaning, that this is the work of <hi>Å¿alvation.</hi> Are the <hi>holy Angels</hi> the Å¿ubjects of <hi>Å¿alvation.</hi> No. But why? They have never Å¿inned, or merited <hi>evil. Salvation and redemption,</hi> in a <hi>full Å¿criptural</hi> Å¿enÅ¿e, imply deliverance from Å¿ome <hi>deÅ¿erved evil.</hi> But if it be true, that the Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has Å¿uffered all the evil he has deÅ¿erved, the idea of <hi>deliverance</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> is at an end, for there remains nothing as the <hi>object</hi> of theÅ¿e things. He is in the Å¿ame Å¿ituation, as if he had juÅ¿t begun to exiÅ¿t, and had not been the Å¿ubject, either of a <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> volition. It may be Å¿aid indeed, that it is by the <hi>goodneÅ¿s</hi> of God, he is admitted into Heaven, but it is not by <hi>grace:</hi> Nor
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017524_0025_0FA12B769CD66688"/>
is there any Å¿ort of neceÅ¿Å¿ary connection implied between him and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> or any <hi>propitiatory Å¿acrifice,</hi> or <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then it be a <hi>revealed truth,</hi> that whenever Å¿inners are puniÅ¿hed in the other world, it is in a <hi>degree,</hi> equal to the <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>demerit</hi> of Å¿in, it is plainly to be inferred, that notwithÅ¿tanding theÅ¿e Å¿everal writes on UniverÅ¿al Salvation, may profeÅ¿s to offer Å¿alvation to all men, yet to thoÅ¿e who will thus be puniÅ¿hed in the other world, it is really not <hi>Å¿alvation</hi> or <hi>redemption,</hi> in the <hi>full Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Å¿enÅ¿e of theÅ¿e words, but meerly <hi>happineÅ¿s</hi> which they offer;â€”the idea of <hi>Å¿alvation,</hi> to the Å¿ubjects now made mention of, being wholly without <hi>foundation,</hi> and in truth, a manifeÅ¿t <hi>inconÅ¿iÅ¿tency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reflecting on theÅ¿e things, Å¿hould it not occur to the compiler of the pamphlet preÅ¿ented to us, and all thoÅ¿e who abet and encourage the Å¿entiments it contains, that they are engaged in preÅ¿enting to mankind, what is not to be found in the Å¿acred volumeâ€”for which there appears to be no manner of <hi>permiÅ¿Å¿ion</hi> or <hi>warrant</hi> from God:â€”If Å¿oâ€”then what Angel from on high, Å¿hall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the work? Or what mortal on earth Å¿hall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume to do it?â€”The obvious remark from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, is therefore by way of enquiryâ€”Can that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be true, which offers to any <hi>claÅ¿s,</hi> or <hi>number</hi> of men, <hi>eternal happineÅ¿s,</hi> but which is not to come to them through the channel of <hi>free grace,</hi> and <hi>pardoning love,</hi> exhibited in the <hi>goÅ¿pel,</hi> nor for the <hi>Redeemer's Å¿ake</hi>?</p>
            <p>I beg the reader's patience to but one thing more in reply to the reaÅ¿oning of Mr. White, from the laÅ¿t quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted verÅ¿es. It is this, When our Saviour was ariÅ¿en from the dead, and was about to leave the <hi>world,</hi> and aÅ¿cend to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he gives this Å¿olemn commiÅ¿Å¿ion to his diÅ¿ciples,
<q>Go ye into the world, and preach the goÅ¿pel to every creature.</q>
He immediately adds,
<q>He that believeth Å¿hall be Å¿aved; but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017524_0026_0FA12B787551F2B8"/>
not Å¿hall be damned.</q>
There follows not a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle remark on this head. This is the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the whole.
<q>He is taken up, and a cloud receives him from their Å¿ight.</q>
â€”If now the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al Salvation be trueâ€”much more, if it be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doctrine, which is intimated to us by Mr. White, is it probable, when our Saviour was juÅ¿t parting with his friends and diÅ¿ciplesâ€”when he was no more to Å¿peak to them in the body reÅ¿pecting it, and when it was of eÅ¿Å¿ential importance that, through his words, they Å¿hould form no inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent or diÅ¿honorary ideas,â€” is it probable, I aÅ¿k, that he would have made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? Is it probable, moreover, that he would have uÅ¿ed a mode of Å¿peech which, allowing the doctrine to be true, may be conÅ¿trued like a Å¿eeming intention to conceal it? And laÅ¿tly, is it probable, that he would have Å¿o aranged his ideas and words, as to leave it, at leaÅ¿t very plauÅ¿ible, that he intended abÅ¿olutely to deny it?</p>
            <p>"He that believeth not, Å¿hall be damned;" that is, as theÅ¿e gentlemen muÅ¿t explain it, <hi>He that believeth not, Å¿hall be puniÅ¿hed by a temporary damnation, but this Å¿ucceeded by never ending Å¿alvation.</hi> Although, therefore, there was Å¿ome reaÅ¿on for the obÅ¿ervation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, "He that believeth not Å¿hall be damned," yet, by the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, it would have been as true, and for any thing which appears to the contrary, there would have been as great, and greater reaÅ¿on for it, if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation had been exactly the reverÅ¿e, <hi>He that believeth not, Å¿hall be Å¿aved.</hi> But if in the communication of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ideas, and the common concerns of life, it would be thought <hi>intolerable,</hi> in Å¿uch a manner, to confound the uÅ¿e of language, does it Å¿eem rational to think, that the great light of the world, and teacher of men, would have thus Å¿et us the example?</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017524_0027_0FA12B78AE1D5FC8"/>It only remains now to anÅ¿wer Mr. Scott, another writer introduced by the compiler; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider the obÅ¿ervations he has made on the words <hi>eternal, everlaÅ¿ting, for ever and ever.</hi> He remarks,
<q>That he has not been able to find one Å¿ingle text, in which this article of an eternal and endleÅ¿s miÅ¿ery, is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿sly affirmed, or neceÅ¿Å¿arily implied:</q>
and that,
<q>the original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, Å¿ignify nothing more than an <hi>age,</hi> and in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>ages,</hi> either longer or Å¿horter, definite or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In reply to which, I beg to obÅ¿erve, that wherever theÅ¿e words are uÅ¿ed in the Old TeÅ¿tament, they denote the duration of the thing Å¿poken of, as long as poÅ¿Å¿ible, compared with the <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>Å¿ubject,</hi> unto which it Å¿tands related or applies. The <hi>hills</hi> and <hi>mountains</hi> are called <hi>everlaÅ¿ting</hi>; the meaning of which is, they are to continue as long as mountains can continue, compared with the Å¿ubject unto which they apply, namely the <hi>earth</hi>; that is, they are to continue as long as the <hi>earth itÅ¿elf.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>PaÅ¿Å¿over</hi> is Å¿aid to have been inÅ¿titut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the IÅ¿raelites, as an ordinance <hi>for ever</hi>; that is, to exiÅ¿t as long as the oeconomy of that people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, which was eÅ¿Å¿ential to the exiÅ¿tence of the PaÅ¿Å¿over. It is very obvious, therefore, that the words <hi>everlaÅ¿ting,</hi> and <hi>for ever,</hi> imply much more than what is expreÅ¿Å¿ed, when we Å¿ay of any thing, that it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for <hi>ages,</hi> or <hi>ages of ages</hi>; for with reÅ¿pect to the mountains, this would be true, if they Å¿hould abide even Å¿ome thouÅ¿and years, but ceaÅ¿e to exiÅ¿t, before the world was at an end: or if the PaÅ¿Å¿over Å¿hould continue through a long number of generations, but become unobÅ¿erved before the oeconomy of the Jews was diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved: Whereas, the particular idea pointed out, is in direct: <hi>oppoÅ¿ition</hi> to this, or any other conÅ¿truction of the words, which excludes the certainty of the exiÅ¿tence
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017524_0028_0FA12B796D9D1BD8"/>
of the thing Å¿poken of, as long as the nature and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances of the Å¿ubject, to which it Å¿tands related, will poÅ¿Å¿ibly admit.</p>
            <p>Having now diÅ¿covered in what Å¿enÅ¿e we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider the words, <hi>everlaÅ¿ting, eternal, for ever and ever,</hi> when applied to things belonging to the <hi>preÅ¿ent</hi> world, let it be enquired, how we are to conÅ¿ider them, when applied to things belonging to the <hi>next</hi>: I anÅ¿wer, in a Å¿enÅ¿e admitting of perfect <hi>analogy</hi> in both caÅ¿es. The hills, and mountains, are things belonging to <hi>this</hi> Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence. The happineÅ¿s of the Å¿aints in Heaven, and the miÅ¿ery of Å¿inners in Hell, are things belonging to the <hi>future.</hi> As the mountains therefore are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>for ever,</hi> that is, throughout the <hi>whole</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence, Å¿o, the happineÅ¿s of the Å¿aints in Heaven, and the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners in Hell, are to endure, throughout the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>next</hi> Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence. In other words, as the duration of <hi>being,</hi> is to be <hi>compleat,</hi> and <hi>as long as poÅ¿Å¿ible,</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> inÅ¿tance, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is to be <hi>compleat,</hi> or <hi>as long as poÅ¿Å¿ible,</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> For if this be not the caÅ¿e, the analogy, juÅ¿t mentioned, and moÅ¿t clearly obÅ¿ervable, is broken through, and the expreÅ¿Å¿ions, both in the Old and New TeÅ¿tament, which refer to future duration, are improperly uÅ¿ed, and in a manner, evidently calculated to miÅ¿guide the mind of the reader.</p>
            <p>Thus much has been obÅ¿erved on the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition that the original words, tranÅ¿lated, <hi>eternal, everlaÅ¿ting, for ever and ever,</hi> imply no more than <hi>ages,</hi> and <hi>ages of ages,</hi> or excited no other ideas in the minds of thoÅ¿e who Å¿poke the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> languages, than what <hi>we</hi> have annexed to the <hi>laÅ¿t</hi> of theÅ¿e words. But how does this appear to be the caÅ¿e? If the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> language be Å¿o much more copious, than either the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the <hi>Greek,</hi> as to admit the expreÅ¿Å¿ions <hi>ever and ever,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o <hi>ages of ages,</hi> yet what proof is this, that the original
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017524_0029_0FA12B7A34822B50"/>
words did not excite the very Å¿ame ideas in the minds of thoÅ¿e who Å¿poke them, as <hi>we</hi> have when we uÅ¿e the <hi>former</hi> of theÅ¿e? more eÅ¿pecially when we add, that theÅ¿e words, both in the Hebrew and the Greek, as is univerÅ¿ally allowed, are the very fulleÅ¿t, which either of theÅ¿e languages contain, to expreÅ¿s what we intend, when we Å¿ay, <hi>ever and ever.</hi> When we conÅ¿ider alÅ¿o, that they are the only original words made choice of to Å¿ignify the proper eternity of God, and that the word in the New TeÅ¿tament, is oftner uÅ¿ed, when his own eternity is the Å¿ubject treated of, than any other, is it in any degree probable, that out of all the languages he <hi>then had,</hi> or <hi>could have made,</hi> he would have choÅ¿en, <hi>two,</hi> which did <hi>not</hi> do it? We may conclude, therefore, they really did, and that the declaration of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pecting his own eternity, is not, as theÅ¿e writers tell us, left wholly out of Å¿acred writ; which opinion, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, is confirmed by this circumÅ¿tance, viz. that the tranÅ¿lators of both the original languages have rendered the words as moÅ¿t fully expreÅ¿Å¿ive of what is intended by <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>ever and ever.</hi> This was done firÅ¿t in the <hi>Latin,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> and other living languages; and according to all probability, would not have been attempted, except from a knowledge, that theÅ¿e were the true ideas always annexed to them in the <hi>original</hi>; Å¿ince eÅ¿pecially with reÅ¿pect to the firÅ¿t tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the miÅ¿take, or fraud, if there had been any, would have been Å¿o liable to <hi>detection,</hi> as Å¿carcely to have left a <hi>poÅ¿Å¿ibility</hi> of Å¿ecurity from it.</p>
            <p>Surely alÅ¿o, it is a very melancholy idea, if there be no word in the Old and New TeÅ¿tament, or in the Hebrew or Greek, which aÅ¿Å¿ures us of the <hi>everlaÅ¿ting</hi> happineÅ¿s of the Å¿aints in Heaven. We are told by theÅ¿e writers, that this would in fact be the caÅ¿e, were it not that the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiÅ¿Å¿oluble, immortal,</hi> not to <hi>die any more,</hi> are expreÅ¿s to this purpoÅ¿e. It may be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017524_0030_0FA12B7AF2568150"/>
however, that the following expreÅ¿Å¿ions, <hi>their worm</hi> which <hi>dieth not;â€”the fire</hi> which <hi>is not quenched,</hi> are, by theÅ¿e Å¿ame writers plainly <hi>denied</hi> to be Å¿ignificant of eternal duration. And what is the meaning of the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiÅ¿Å¿oluble, immortal?</hi> Certainly the whole which can be meant is, that the Å¿ubjects Å¿poken of <hi>Å¿hall not die.</hi> It Å¿eems then, that the expreÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>Å¿hall not die,</hi> may in <hi>one caÅ¿e</hi> be conÅ¿idered as clearly Å¿ignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>eternal duration,</hi> and in <hi>another,</hi> as conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the abÅ¿olute <hi>denial</hi> of it. NotwithÅ¿tanding then, that the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiÅ¿Å¿oluble, immortal, not to die any more,</hi> do indeed evidently expreÅ¿s the eternal exiÅ¿tence of the righteous, yet it may be inferred, that all theÅ¿e writers, muÅ¿t, by their own method of reaÅ¿oning, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce the idea. The Å¿tate of facts therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account given us, is juÅ¿t this, that there is no <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> words throughout the Å¿acred volume of inÅ¿piration, which aÅ¿certain the certainty of any <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration</hi> whatÅ¿oever; but every poÅ¿itive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reÅ¿pecting <hi>eternity,</hi> is entirely left out of this book.</p>
            <p>But in what manner can theÅ¿e words,
<q>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,</q>
and thrice Å¿olemnly repeated, be conÅ¿idered as conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Salvation? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler obÅ¿erves, it is intimated by one and another of the beforementioned writers, that if they prove any thing, it is <hi>this</hi>â€”
<q>That the torments of the wicked Å¿hall laÅ¿t as long as their next Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence laÅ¿ts, without determining how long that Å¿hall be;</q>
that is to Å¿ay, if they prove any thing, it is, that the wicked Å¿hall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure puniÅ¿hment, 'till their next Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence be at an end. The conÅ¿equence of this is, that they muÅ¿t be <hi>deprived</hi> of all Å¿alvation; for there can be no <hi>Å¿alvation,</hi> where there is no <hi>exiÅ¿tence.</hi> And thus the doctrine of univerÅ¿al Å¿alvation, inÅ¿tead of being <hi>proved,</hi> is by the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017524_0031_0FA12B7BAEEA96F0"/>
very eÅ¿pouÅ¿ers of it, abÅ¿olutely <hi>denied.</hi>â€”This is plain reaÅ¿oning, as even the compiler muÅ¿t allow;â€”unleÅ¿s, by the words, "their next Å¿tate of exiÅ¿tence," he would refer merely to the Å¿inner's Å¿tate of pain and puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;â€”which if he does, the interpretation of the text quoted, is exactly thisâ€”<hi>The wicked Å¿hall be puniÅ¿hed, as long as they Å¿hall be puniÅ¿hed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more in the obÅ¿ervation reÅ¿pecting the <hi>valley of Hinnom,</hi> than what is contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.â€”But as it has been judged proper to introduce the verÅ¿e already conÅ¿idered, and thrice Å¿olemnly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour, would it not have been as well, if the preceding verÅ¿e, had been added alÅ¿o? And then the whole together would have read thusâ€”
<q>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half into life, than having two feet, to be caÅ¿t into Hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</q>
Let any one calmly peruÅ¿e the whole together, and muÅ¿t he not think that the idea of eternal, and never ceaÅ¿ing puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is fully comprized, and that if theÅ¿e words do not comprize it, there is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility that any others ever Å¿hould?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:017524_0032_0FA12B7C71192338"/>HAVING now gone through the various texts which have been produced, in the pamphlet referred to, in favour of UniverÅ¿al Salvation, I Å¿hall proceed to offer to the reader the ground on which the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ite doctrine is founded, and exhibit the valuable ends which the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners will anÅ¿wer, in the Å¿yÅ¿tem of God's moral government;â€”in doing which, I Å¿hall be as Å¿hort and comprehenÅ¿ive as the caÅ¿e will admit.</p>
            <p>The grand object or deÅ¿ign of the Deity, I conceive to be thisâ€”that by all which takes place in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Å¿yÅ¿tem, from firÅ¿t to laÅ¿t, including all things, which <hi>already have,</hi> and Å¿hall in <hi>future</hi> exiÅ¿t, his own <hi>divine perfection,</hi> and the true nature of <hi>perfection itÅ¿elf,</hi> may be illuÅ¿trated in the beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t compleat man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Å¿um of which, in a moral view, is <hi>holineÅ¿s,</hi> or <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known, that a beautiful object never appears with Å¿uch conÅ¿picuous luÅ¿tre, as when contraÅ¿ted with its <hi>oppoÅ¿ite.</hi> In even a piece of painting, Å¿ome Å¿hades are requiÅ¿ite to Å¿et off the more Å¿triking parts, which Å¿hades alone, would be diÅ¿agreeable to the eye, but by a happy diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, they aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t in forming a moÅ¿t ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable piece. May we not conclude, that when the great Ruler of Heaven and earth, permitted Å¿in to come into exiÅ¿tence, the reaÅ¿on was, that it might Å¿erve as a mean to give <hi>diÅ¿tinction</hi> to <hi>holineÅ¿s,</hi> and by the force of <hi>contraÅ¿t,</hi> illuÅ¿trate its beauty in a more Å¿triking light.</p>
            <p>But beÅ¿ides the advantage which the exiÅ¿tence of Å¿in has in raiÅ¿ing the luÅ¿tre of its oppoÅ¿ite, there is <hi>one</hi> Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of love, which could not have been known at all without it; and this is, love to the <hi>unworthy,</hi> and to <hi>enemies,</hi> or whatÅ¿oever is included under the head of <hi>pardoning love, free grace,</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> exhibited in the goÅ¿pel; which exhibition of the Deity is evidently repreÅ¿ented, as the greateÅ¿t and moÅ¿t aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017524_0033_0FA12B7D30AAE878"/>
ever exiÅ¿ted; in the making of which, the treaÅ¿ures of his <hi>wiÅ¿dom, power,</hi> and <hi>goodneÅ¿s</hi> are Å¿aid to be opened to our view, to the great wonder of the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>What has been now obÅ¿erved reÅ¿pects the <hi>exiÅ¿tence</hi> of Å¿in: Next then; as to the <hi>puniÅ¿hment</hi> of it; it may in the firÅ¿t place be noted, that as to the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>Å¿enÅ¿ative</hi> pain, if I may Å¿o expreÅ¿s myÅ¿elf, which will hereafter be the portion of Å¿inners, it is beyond the reach of man, to form any adequate, or particular ideas. We muÅ¿t leave the diÅ¿covery of this, as alÅ¿o of the natural or Å¿enÅ¿itive pleaÅ¿ures, which the Å¿aints will enjoy in Heaven, till we have done with the body. Where the Å¿cripture mentions theÅ¿e things, it is in <hi>figurative,</hi> or <hi>metaphorical</hi> language. <hi>Heaven,</hi> is deÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as a <hi>city,</hi> the Å¿treets and gates of which, are made of <hi>gold,</hi> and exquiÅ¿ite <hi>pearl</hi>: And <hi>Hell,</hi> as a place of fire and burning. If the <hi>one</hi> deÅ¿cription be <hi>figurative,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> may be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be Å¿o likewiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The principal idea conveyed to us in theÅ¿e repreÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is, that the happineÅ¿s of the Å¿aints, and miÅ¿ery of Å¿inners, and the means of promoting it, will be very great: But there is not the leaÅ¿t degree of probability, that like the operation of fire on the human body, the Å¿enÅ¿itive pain of the wicked will be Å¿uch, as to deÅ¿troy <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>reflection,</hi> any more than <hi>exiÅ¿tence</hi>: On the other hand, it is far more rational, and Å¿criptural to Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that the <hi>intellectual powers</hi> will be left in <hi>full force,</hi> and the <hi>moral affections</hi> be in <hi>conÅ¿tant action</hi>; and that, at leaÅ¿t <hi>one</hi> part of the unhappineÅ¿s of Å¿inners, will conÅ¿iÅ¿t in <hi>theÅ¿e affections themÅ¿elves</hi>; Å¿o that the pain and evil experienced by them, may truly be Å¿aid to be the effect of a <hi>voluntary choice,</hi> and Å¿uch as the exiÅ¿tence of <hi>contrary</hi> affections would deÅ¿troy. And indeed it may be judged, that this is the very <hi>chief</hi> part of the puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Å¿in. The little we know of the unhappineÅ¿s attending the evil and diÅ¿cordant paÅ¿Å¿ions of men on
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017524_0034_0FA12B7DEF72E578"/>
earth, may Å¿erve, in Å¿ome degree, to convince us, how vaÅ¿tly more intolerable the anguiÅ¿h will be, when the like paÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿hall come into action, in the other world, without <hi>reÅ¿traint,</hi> and grow <hi>big,</hi> as we cannot now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, and at the Å¿ame time, be accompanied with that mortification and diÅ¿appointment, which, where there is no mean of gratification, muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Å¿in, and which the Diety will now Å¿uffer to exiÅ¿t in full force, as its proper and deÅ¿erved recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>The Å¿cripture warrants us to believe, that the future Å¿tate and condition of Å¿inners, will be open to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or view of the inhabitants of Heaven. With reÅ¿pect therefore to the <hi>puniÅ¿hment</hi> of Å¿in, I conceive the end, and advantage of it to be this, viz. as the <hi>exiÅ¿tence</hi> of Å¿in, in any Å¿tate, or degree of it, is adapted, by means of <hi>contraÅ¿t,</hi> to make a more exalted exhibition of the nature of holineÅ¿s, Å¿o the exiÅ¿tence of it, while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the painful conÅ¿equences now deÅ¿cribed, and while it nature and tendency, and the manifeÅ¿t anger of the Almighty againÅ¿t it, are thus diÅ¿played, will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly adapted to, and by the wiÅ¿e direction of God, will in fact produce this effect in the Å¿trongeÅ¿t manner: Moreover, as the permiÅ¿Å¿ion, or exiÅ¿tence of Å¿in, was eÅ¿Å¿ential to the diÅ¿play of the <hi>pardoning</hi> love of God, or any knowledge, or idea of it, among created beings, in like manner the perception of its real tendency and conÅ¿equences, will greatly help to enlarge, and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up the view thereof, to the great benefit, not of thoÅ¿e who are the Å¿ubjects of future Å¿in and puniÅ¿hment, but of the holy beings in Heaven: For by Å¿uch a diÅ¿covery of the evil nature, and deÅ¿tructive tendency of Å¿in, the Å¿aints will diÅ¿cover more fully, what they are delivered fromâ€”they will diÅ¿cover the Å¿enÅ¿e the Almighty has eÅ¿pecting the malignity of Å¿inâ€”they will diÅ¿cover what muÅ¿t have been the Å¿trength in that love in God, which
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017524_0035_0FA12B7EB4963C08"/>
inclined him to pardon it in <hi>them</hi>: By Å¿uch thoughts, the greatneÅ¿s of free grace will be enhancedâ€”the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put on new gloryâ€”the crucified Saviour appear in charms more exquiÅ¿itely bright, and raviÅ¿h his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's hearts:â€”The angels who are witneÅ¿Å¿es to theÅ¿e things, will be loÅ¿t in wonderâ€”redeeming love be the object of all their thoughts, and "God be all in all."</p>
            <p>From this view then, it Å¿hould Å¿eem that we are to conÅ¿ider the Å¿tate of Å¿inners, and their puniÅ¿hment in the other world, as a real <hi>good</hi> in the created Å¿yÅ¿tem. And is not this the true light, in which it is conÅ¿idered in Å¿acred writ? wherein we learn, that nothing is done by God, but for a valuable end.â€”He
<q>overthrew Pharoah and his hoÅ¿t in the Red Sea; for his mercy endureth for ever.</q>
And
<q>Å¿mote great Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever. And Å¿lew famous Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever.</q>
In the book of IÅ¿aiah, the Å¿eraphims are repreÅ¿ented in a view of the judgments of God, to be executed on a Å¿inful people, as crying unto one anotherâ€”
<q>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoÅ¿ts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</q>
And in the Revelation made to John the Divine, after Babylon is deÅ¿cribed as being deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he
<q>heard a voice of much people in Heaven, Å¿aying, Halleluia. And her Å¿moke roÅ¿e up for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In what manner now Å¿hall we account for it, that theÅ¿e <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> beings, Å¿hould be thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in rendering praiÅ¿e to God, in the view of his judgments? for the <hi>puniÅ¿hment</hi> or <hi>miÅ¿ery</hi> of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cannot, in itÅ¿elf, that is, Å¿eparate from the idea of its ends and effects, be an <hi>agreeable object</hi> to any <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent, created</hi> mind, any more than to the mind of God, who, as we are told,
<q>delighteth not in the death of the Å¿inner;</q>
whereas, theÅ¿e acts of praiÅ¿e, are plainly deÅ¿cribed to us as expreÅ¿Å¿ive of the holy and

virtuous manner, in which theÅ¿e heavenly and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Å¿pirits are employed. The only rational concluÅ¿ion we can draw is, that in their eÅ¿timation, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed on Å¿inners, are a <hi>good,</hi> becauÅ¿e they are among the means, by which, they became more fully acquainted with the character of that perfect Beingâ€”. the knowledge of which, is at the foundation of all their happineÅ¿s. <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be obÅ¿erved by the reader, that but little is Å¿aid, reÅ¿pecting the diÅ¿play of God's <hi>power, truth,</hi> and <hi>wiÅ¿dom,</hi> in the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners; or of his <hi>aÅ¿Å¿ertion of the rights of his government,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Having thus conÅ¿idered the advantages reÅ¿ulting from puniÅ¿hment in a general view of it, let us next enquire in particular, how the matter Å¿tands, with reÅ¿pect to <hi>eternal</hi> puniÅ¿hment.â€”It may be argued thusâ€”The puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners, as appears from the foregoing, is <hi>one mean</hi> uÅ¿ed by the Deity, of more fully illuÅ¿trating the nature of holineÅ¿s, and his divine perfections,â€”the diÅ¿covery of which, is a Å¿ource of joy to the church in Heaven, and in this reÅ¿pect, a <hi>good.</hi> Now if the puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Å¿inners Å¿hould ever <hi>ceaÅ¿e,</hi> this <hi>mean</hi> of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the perfections of God, would <hi>ceaÅ¿e</hi> at the Å¿ame time, and of courÅ¿e the <hi>good</hi> reÅ¿ulting from it. But as it is not conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the character of an infinitely good being, to Å¿uffer <hi>any mean</hi> of <hi>good</hi> to <hi>ceaÅ¿e,</hi> he will therefore never Å¿uffer this to be the caÅ¿e with reÅ¿pect to the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inners, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this puniÅ¿hment will never <hi>ceaÅ¿e,</hi> but be <hi>eternal.</hi> This may be called rational evidence, drawn from the argument of <hi>benevolence itÅ¿elf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:017524_0037_0FA12B802F21FE88"/>If it Å¿hould be objected, that a long courÅ¿e of puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment admitting <hi>end,</hi> will be Å¿ufficient to anÅ¿wer all the purpoÅ¿es mentioned, inaÅ¿much as it is in the power of God, to impreÅ¿s for ever on the <hi>memory</hi> of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ideas they have once received; I anÅ¿wer, that with reÅ¿pect to <hi>memory,</hi> or the impreÅ¿Å¿ion made by any particular event, which is not to occur again, it is known by <hi>univerÅ¿al experience,</hi> that it gradually, decreaÅ¿es by <hi>time.</hi> The argument from <hi>experience</hi> therefore, is againÅ¿t this Å¿uppoÅ¿ition. Added to this, it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervable, that in the communication of ideas to created beings, the Deity always has made uÅ¿e of means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their nature. When he pardoned Å¿in, he had a right to have done it, if it had pleaÅ¿ed him, without an atonement, or the death of his beloved Son. But this important event was tranÅ¿acted as a mean, by which his Å¿enÅ¿e of the great evil of Å¿in might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; to the intent, that the greatneÅ¿s of his love in the pardon of it, might the more fully be diÅ¿played. If then in the communication of pardon and grace, Å¿o important an <hi>event,</hi> and itÅ¿elf conÅ¿idered, Å¿o great an <hi>evil</hi> as the <hi>death of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> muÅ¿t be uÅ¿ed as the <hi>mean,</hi> Å¿urely we cannot argue againÅ¿t either the <hi>propriety</hi> or <hi>neceÅ¿Å¿ity</hi> of <hi>means,</hi> in <hi>other,</hi> or the <hi>like</hi> caÅ¿es.â€”It is very eaÅ¿y to comprehend, that the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is admirably calculated to continue the exhibition which our Saviour's death made reÅ¿pecting the evil of Å¿in, and the oppoÅ¿ition of the mind of God againÅ¿t it, by which exhibition the wonders of the atonement, and the work, of redemption and free grace, are Å¿et off, to the greateÅ¿t advantage: And thus not only all the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but all the things in <hi>Hell,</hi> will in this Å¿enÅ¿e, be tending towards the Å¿ame point, and for ever adding Å¿trength, though in a totally different manner, to the great work, which JeÅ¿us died to promote.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:017524_0038_0FA12B80EFD77790"/>The reader will here perhaps anticipate another Å¿entiment of great importance. In every rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception concerning future puniÅ¿hment, it is not only needful to contemplate it as a mean of <hi>good,</hi> but alÅ¿o to conÅ¿ider this <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>happineÅ¿s,</hi> as far greater, than the evil, or pain, contained in the puniÅ¿hment itÅ¿elf, and as conÅ¿piring, among other things, to produce the greateÅ¿t advantage of the created Å¿yÅ¿tem at large, or all things taken together.â€”If in the Å¿yÅ¿tem of intelligent, created being, and extending the idea throughout eternity, there will exiÅ¿t more <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> than <hi>good</hi> or <hi>happineÅ¿s,</hi> it is moÅ¿t certainly a melancholy Å¿yÅ¿tem indeed. If there will exiÅ¿t <hi>more good</hi> than <hi>evil,</hi> but yet <hi>leÅ¿s good</hi> than <hi>might</hi> exiÅ¿t, in this caÅ¿e, it is an <hi>imperfect</hi> Å¿yÅ¿tem. But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the degree of <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> the ballance of <hi>good</hi> will be the <hi>greateÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ible,</hi> in this caÅ¿e, it is a Å¿yÅ¿tem which is worthy of God who formed, and created it. In Å¿uch a view we may well join the celeÅ¿tial choir in the triumphant Å¿ong,
<q>Hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The queÅ¿tion then is, in what manner Å¿hall we, on the principles already mentioned, and by mean of <hi>Å¿acred writ,</hi> be able to vindicate the Å¿entiment, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t good of the Å¿yÅ¿tem will, on the whole exiÅ¿t, unleÅ¿s we Å¿uppoÅ¿e that by far the greateÅ¿t number of mankind will be Å¿aved: For it is to <hi>Å¿acred writ</hi> we muÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e, in all our reaÅ¿onings and proofs, Å¿ince it will be wholly inÅ¿ufficient to depend on human, conjecture. To Å¿acred writ let us now apply.</p>
            <p>And with reÅ¿pect to the number of men which will be <hi>redeemed,</hi> it has indeed been Å¿uppoÅ¿ed by Å¿ome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, that it will be much <hi>leÅ¿s</hi> than the number, which will be <hi>loÅ¿t.</hi> This opinion has been partly founded on the declaration of our Saviour, that
<q>many are called, but few are choÅ¿en;</q>
together with theÅ¿e words, "fear not little flock," and Å¿ome other paÅ¿Å¿ages to the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017524_0039_0FA12B81AFC0FDA8"/>
Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e. A diÅ¿cuÅ¿ion of each of theÅ¿e particulars, would be too lengthy for my preÅ¿ent deÅ¿ign. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever examines them thoroughly, and in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, will, I preÅ¿ume, find no reaÅ¿on to doubt, that they referred to the times in which they were Å¿poken, or the Å¿tate of things <hi>then</hi> exiÅ¿ting, or <hi>Å¿imilar</hi> in kind, and of courÅ¿e, that they are <hi>limited</hi> in their Å¿ignification.</p>
            <p>In the 13th chapter of Luke, our Saviour compares the kingdom of God, to a <hi>grain of muÅ¿tard Å¿eed,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o to a portion of <hi>leaven.</hi> Immediately one Å¿ays,
<q>unto him, Lord, are there, few that be Å¿aved?</q>
Who the perÅ¿on was, or whether the queÅ¿tion was put with a friendly or unfriendly deÅ¿ign, we are not informed of. Our Saviour in reply bids him,
<q>Å¿trive to enter into the Å¿trait gate,</q>
which certainly <hi>many</hi> Å¿hould fail of doing; but does not think proper to anÅ¿wer his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And why? The parable was Å¿ufficient. As the grain of muÅ¿tard Å¿eed, which, when Å¿owed, was the <hi>Å¿malleÅ¿t</hi> of all Å¿eeds, Å¿hould in time grow to be the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t tree</hi> of the kind, Å¿o that the fowls of the air Å¿hould find Å¿helter in its branches:â€”And as the leaven, which at firÅ¿t was <hi>hid,</hi> Å¿hould in the end, leaven the <hi>whole meal</hi>; in like manner, the kingdom of God, or the mediatorial kingdom, which at the beginning, and when it was firÅ¿t preached, was received by a very Å¿mall number, compoÅ¿ing the <hi>leaÅ¿t</hi> Å¿ectary in the world, Å¿hall in the proper Å¿eaÅ¿on, diffuÅ¿e its power and reliÅ¿h over the <hi>whole</hi> world, and triumph in every place, and be like the <hi>Å¿tone,</hi> out without hands, deÅ¿cribed by the prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and repreÅ¿enting this Å¿ame kingdom, which at length became a <hi>great mountain,</hi> and filled the <hi>whole</hi> earth.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive there is abundant reaÅ¿on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a glorious time before the end of the world, and general judgment, commonly called the <hi>Millennium,</hi> becauÅ¿e it is to laÅ¿t a thouÅ¿and years; at which time
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017524_0040_0FA12B826E1F01C0"/>
the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and holineÅ¿s univerÅ¿ally prevail.</p>
            <p>The paÅ¿Å¿ages of Å¿cripture, on which the proof of this depends, are Å¿uch as theÅ¿eâ€”
<q>All the ends of the world Å¿hall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations Å¿hall worÅ¿hip before thee. PÅ¿al. xxii. 27. He Å¿hall have dominion from Å¿ea to Å¿ea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. Yea all Kings Å¿hall fall down before him: All nations Å¿hall Å¿erve him. They Å¿hall fear thee, as long as the Å¿un and moon endure, throughout all generations. His name Å¿hall endure for ever: His name Å¿hall be continued as long as the Å¿un: And men Å¿hall be bleÅ¿Å¿ed in him; all nations Å¿hall call him bleÅ¿Å¿ed. PÅ¿al. lxxii. 5, 8, 11, 17. Every val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Å¿hall be exalted, and every mountain and hill Å¿hall be made low: And the crooked Å¿hall be made Å¿traight, and the rough places plain. And the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord Å¿hall be revealed, and all fleÅ¿h Å¿hall Å¿ee it together: For the mouth of the Lord hath Å¿poken it. IÅ¿a. xl. 4, 5. Thy people alÅ¿o Å¿hall be all righteous. IÅ¿a. lx. 21. They Å¿hall all know the Lord from the leaÅ¿t of them to the greateÅ¿t. Jer. xxxi. 34. And they Å¿hall beat their Å¿words into plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hares, and their Å¿pears into pruning-hooks. IÅ¿a. ii. 4. The wolf alÅ¿o Å¿hall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard Å¿hall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child Å¿hall lead them. They Å¿hall not hurt, nor deÅ¿troy in all my holy mountain: For the earth Å¿hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Å¿ea. IÅ¿a. xi. 6, 9. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatneÅ¿s of the kingdom under the whole Heaven, Å¿hall be given to the people of the Å¿aints of the MoÅ¿t High, whoÅ¿e
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017524_0041_0FA12B8332844040"/>
kingdom is an everlaÅ¿ting kingdom, and all domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Å¿hall Å¿erve and obey him. Dan. vii. 27.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be preÅ¿umed that theÅ¿e things have already been accompliÅ¿hed. The Å¿acred Å¿criptures inform us of a certain time, when the kingdom of <hi>AntichriÅ¿t,</hi> which has exalted itÅ¿elf againÅ¿t the kingdom of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> will be deÅ¿troyed, and
<q>Satan be bound a thouÅ¿and years, and be caÅ¿t into the bottomleÅ¿s pit, and Å¿hut up, that he deceive the nations no more, till the thouÅ¿and years be fulfilled.</q>
This is the Å¿ame period of time refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to in the beforementioned texts. That it will take place before the end of the world, is evident from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the whole account, and among others, from this circumÅ¿tance in particular, viz. that the nations of the earth, will then beat their <hi>Å¿words</hi> into <hi>plough-Å¿hares,</hi> and their <hi>Å¿pears</hi> into <hi>pruning-hooks.</hi> It cannot conÅ¿iÅ¿tently be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed that this will be done, after the earth is burned up with fire. And as a further proof that this Å¿eaÅ¿on will be before the end of the world, or general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are informed that when Satan has been bound a thouÅ¿and years, during which time it is, that all this promiÅ¿ed peace and holineÅ¿s is to exiÅ¿t, he is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards to be
<q>looÅ¿ed a little Å¿eaÅ¿on and go out to deceive the nations,</q>
or people,
<q>which are in the four quarters of the earth;</q>
that is, the Å¿ame nations with thoÅ¿e beforementioned, or their natural deÅ¿cendents; for what other can they be? The conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theÅ¿e efforts of the deceiver, we are told, will be the prevalence of Å¿in in Å¿o great a degree, as that <hi>a part</hi> of the inhabitants of the earth, will riÅ¿e up againÅ¿t the <hi>other part,</hi> and there will be the moÅ¿t violent diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and contention among them;â€”an event which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot happen to the righteous after the day of judgment, Å¿ince it is expreÅ¿Å¿ly declared in Å¿acred writ, that the appearance of ChriÅ¿t at that time, will bring to them everlaÅ¿ting peace, and deliverance from all
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017524_0042_0FA12B83F8A16408"/>
trouble. In addition to this, according to the order of the Å¿acred narration, the day of judgment is introduced as an event, which is to <hi>follow</hi> the convulÅ¿ion and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order now deÅ¿cribed; for after mention is made of the Å¿ignal interpoÅ¿ition of Heaven in behalf of the Å¿aints in this conteÅ¿t with the wicked, the very next verÅ¿es in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the appearance of the Judgeâ€”of the books being openedâ€”the dead Å¿tanding before him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged out of thoÅ¿e things written in the books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works.</p>
            <p>The Å¿um of the whole Å¿eems to be thisâ€”that prior to the Å¿econd advent of our Saviour, the kingdom which he hath eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed on earth, will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, and overturn the kingdoms of the world, and of AntichriÅ¿t, which are oppoÅ¿ed unto it;â€”that the glory of it will laÅ¿t a thouÅ¿and years, in which time holineÅ¿s, peace and joy, will prevail, over the whole earth, and continue to the end of the world; or as it is written in the 72d PÅ¿alm,
<q>as long as the Å¿un, and moon endure, throughout all generations,</q>
except, that after the thouÅ¿and years are compleated, it will be partially interrupted for a little Å¿eaÅ¿on, by numbers of perÅ¿ons becoming Å¿o corrupt, as to riÅ¿e up, and contend againÅ¿t the Å¿aintsâ€”which conteÅ¿t will be decided by the interpoÅ¿ition of Heaven, and immediately followed by the reÅ¿urrection of the dead, and judgment of the whole world.</p>
            <p>As to the commencement of the happy time we have been conÅ¿idering, it has already been hinted, and the Å¿cripture makes it very evident, that it will be at the <hi>cloÅ¿e</hi> of the <hi>reign,</hi> or at the <hi>downfal</hi> of <hi>AntichriÅ¿t.</hi> There would be no difficulty in aÅ¿certaining this period with accuracy, if we knew when to date the <hi>beginning</hi> of his reign, for the whole of it together is to be <hi>a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> or twelve hundred years. As the <hi>riÅ¿e</hi> of this kingdom was <hi>gradual,</hi> it is probable its <hi>fall</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:017524_0043_0FA12B84B64E9A68"/>
will be <hi>gradual</hi> alÅ¿o. The writers on prophecy are well agreed, that it will be Å¿ome time about the <hi>two</hi> thouÅ¿andth year of the ChriÅ¿tian aera, and the <hi>Å¿ix</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿andth year, from the creation of the world.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, the earth was peopled by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons only. Two thouÅ¿and years elapÅ¿ed before the flood; but a little part of the world was inhabited; the waters came, and deÅ¿troyed the whole, except Noah, and thoÅ¿e who were with him in the ark. By this Å¿ingle family, the earth began to be peopled again; but even in our Saviour's time, only an inferior part of it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and Å¿ickneÅ¿s, peÅ¿tilence, and war, had in the mean while, Å¿wept off a vaÅ¿t number of its inhabitants, and retarded the increaÅ¿e. It is but of late years that America, which is called the NEW WORLD, has been explored, before which time, it was occupied only by the Indians, thinly diÅ¿perÅ¿ed on the Å¿ea Å¿hore.</p>
            <p>ConÅ¿idering now the vaÅ¿t increaÅ¿e of inhabitants, which probably will take place in <hi>future,</hi> and the great number the whole earth will be capable of Å¿upporting, when, as it may be expected in the Millenium,
<q>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ert will bloÅ¿om like a roÅ¿e,</q>
which number then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿ting, is Å¿aid, in the book of Revelation, to be,
<q>as the Å¿ands of the Å¿ea,</q>
there is no manner of difficulty in admitting the belief, that many more, it may be, as Å¿ome writers have Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, in even the proportion of many thouÅ¿ands to one, will live in this <hi>one laÅ¿t thouÅ¿and years,</hi> called the Millenium, than will live in the <hi>Å¿ix thouÅ¿and</hi> preceeding: And as this will be a Å¿tate of univerÅ¿al holineÅ¿s, and the falling away afterwards, will be but for a <hi>Å¿hort Å¿eaÅ¿on,</hi> and this only <hi>partial,</hi> even Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing almoÅ¿t the whole of thoÅ¿e to be loÅ¿t who exiÅ¿ted prior to this time, it may notwithÅ¿tanding be the caÅ¿e, that many more, and perhaps Å¿ome thouÅ¿ands to one, will be <hi>Å¿aved,</hi> than <hi>loÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017524_0044_0FA12B8571152F80"/>This Å¿ubject is copious and grand. Can it be thought, when on account of the atonement made by ChriÅ¿t, the whole world has been put under his government, and given to his diÅ¿poÅ¿al, that in the cloÅ¿e of the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of things, he will Å¿uffer Satan, who has exalted himÅ¿elf againÅ¿t him, to collect into his own party, the <hi>majority</hi> of mankind? Can it be thought, that the number of the redeemed will be <hi>leÅ¿s</hi> than ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, may be preÅ¿umed to judge, to be the moÅ¿t for his own honour? Is it not fit alÅ¿o, that the great work of man's Å¿alvation, and the kingdom of our Saviour, Å¿hould be done, and glorified, in the <hi>Å¿ame</hi> world, in which it has been Å¿et up, and oppoÅ¿ed, and thus Satan be conquered on his own aÅ¿Å¿umed ground? And once more, may it not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that all this will be Å¿o performed, and brought into readineÅ¿s, as that at the <hi>very firÅ¿t general aÅ¿Å¿embly</hi> of men and angels, and appearance of ChriÅ¿t, the whole work done by him, may be Å¿een in perfect gloryâ€” every doubt be Å¿atisfied, and every mind be Å¿truck with awe?</p>
            <p>To return now to the point with which I began:â€” as a Å¿ummary view of the whole that has been obÅ¿erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reÅ¿pecting the doctrine of future puniÅ¿hment, and the permiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿in in the moral Å¿yÅ¿tem, I beg the reader to take the followingâ€”that it is a mean of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luÅ¿tre of holineÅ¿s or virtue more fully into view, of explaining the nature of redeeming love, and more gloriouÅ¿ly illuÅ¿trating the character of the Deity:â€” That being in itÅ¿elf an <hi>evil,</hi> no greater degree of it will be Å¿uffered to exiÅ¿t, than is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to promote theÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es, or operate in Å¿uch a manner, as that the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>good</hi> may be greater than without it, yea the greateÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ible: And further, that as in its nature it is a mean of this good, it will never be Å¿uffered by God to ceaÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e, if it did, the good thereby effected, would ceaÅ¿e together with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:017524_0045_0FA12B862DF6F3D8"/>As explanatory of this, it is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be very conceivable, that the view of any moral object, is greatly heightened by a view of its oppoÅ¿ite. By the exiÅ¿tence of both <hi>Å¿in</hi> and <hi>holineÅ¿s,</hi> in the other world, the total difference of their nature will be perceived: In proportion to the degree in which each of theÅ¿e will diÅ¿play its Å¿trength, and act out in new force, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traÅ¿t will become brighter and brighterâ€”holineÅ¿s will appear in increaÅ¿ing beauty, and the character of the MoÅ¿t High in glory, and in majeÅ¿ty, more divine. By Å¿uch knowledge communicated, the Deity, as it were, will approach nearer and nearer to all the holy, and heavenly beings:â€”By Å¿uch knowledge received, they will approach nearer and nearer unto <hi>him,</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>one</hi> with <hi>them,</hi> and they become <hi>one</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus will all things be rendered Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to the great purpoÅ¿es of the Son of God, whoÅ¿e atonement and buÅ¿ineÅ¿s on earth, which in itÅ¿elf was Å¿ufficient for the Å¿alvation of the whole world, will be better reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than if every individual among men were Å¿aved; and whoÅ¿e victory and triumph over Satan; will be far more compleat, than if the Å¿erpent had not Å¿ucceeded in any of his temptations on earth, becauÅ¿e his very Å¿ucceÅ¿s will be to his diÅ¿appointment, confuÅ¿ion, and Å¿hame.</p>
            <p>What unknown worlds of intelligent beings, will be brought into exiÅ¿tence, to behold theÅ¿e wonders, we cannot tell. But Å¿urely if the end, and deÅ¿ign of all things, and among them, of the exiÅ¿tence of Å¿in, and the puniÅ¿hment of it, <hi>be</hi> that the glory of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be unfolded to the view of creatures, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to rejoice. Does both the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> diÅ¿coverable in the <hi>natural world</hi> affect us with delight? Are we not only pleaÅ¿ed with the cheering rays of each returning Å¿unâ€”the opening of the Å¿pring, and the gentle fanning of the zephyrs, but do we Å¿ometimes
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017524_0046_0FA12B86EFBB5C40"/>
with admiration hear the rolling thunder, and Å¿ee the clouds begin to thicken, and the red lightnings play? And Å¿hall we not admire the Å¿ame diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of things in Å¿ome reÅ¿pects, in the <hi>moral world,</hi> by which not <hi>one,</hi> or a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many</hi> of the attributes of the Godhead are diÅ¿played, and <hi>beauty</hi> is Å¿een cloathed in <hi>glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such admiration then, be your employment, ye friends of Heaven and virtue,â€”ye people of the MoÅ¿t High. Well did the Angels, at only the birth of ChriÅ¿t, fill the air with melody, while the wondering Å¿hepherds heard,
<q>Glory to God in the higheÅ¿t; and on earth peace; good-will towards men.</q>
And could the laws of nature be diÅ¿penÅ¿ed with in our favour, as they were in favour to the Å¿hepherds, we Å¿hould hear theÅ¿e celeÅ¿tial beings Å¿till engaged in praiÅ¿e, and the hymn go round. But the work, which JeÅ¿us at that time had but <hi>begun,</hi> is now <hi>compleated</hi>: Their Å¿ong therefore is more triumphant, and divine. Yet <hi>yours</hi> Å¿hall be more triumphant Å¿till. When at the laÅ¿t great day, the harmony of God's works, and the beauty of his glory will be unfolded, then Å¿hall you break forth in the victorious Å¿ongâ€”then Å¿hall you unite with ten thouÅ¿and times ten thouÅ¿and of like happy beings, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>BleÅ¿Å¿ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that Å¿itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</q>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:017524_0047_0FA12B87B1AA10C8"/>BEFORE I put a cloÅ¿e to this writing, I aÅ¿k the reader to indulge me in a few remarks, concerning the tendency of the pamphlet, lately publiÅ¿hed in favour of UniverÅ¿al Salvation.â€”As it conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of extracts from authors, who can give no account to men, being gone to render their account to an impartial Judge, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler muÅ¿t anÅ¿wer for them, who, it is to be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed would Å¿end nothing to the <hi>preÅ¿s,</hi> but what accorded with his own Å¿entiments, and he would be willing to defend.</p>
            <p>And without any exaggeration, the doctrine exhibited and recommended, is <hi>this</hi>â€”There is no crime whatever, which Å¿hall exclude a man from Heaven;â€”let him live as he liÅ¿tsâ€”let him be an enemy to the worldâ€”his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryâ€”his friendsâ€”yea, and his own life;â€”let him deÅ¿piÅ¿e the offered mercy of his Saviour, till death has taken him hence,â€”by the blood of this Saviour, he Å¿hall be <hi>Å¿aved</hi>: For although he be informed, that he muÅ¿t endure the dreadful weight of a <hi>temporary</hi> puniÅ¿hmentâ€”yet as <hi>no temporary</hi> puniÅ¿hment, can bear any compariÅ¿on with <hi>everlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿s,</hi> which according to the Å¿cheme propoÅ¿ed, is to follow, it Å¿till remains, that all things taken into conÅ¿ideration, he Å¿hall be a partaker of <hi>infinite bliÅ¿s,</hi> which the greateÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿ible degree of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or the moÅ¿t horrid crimes, and unÅ¿ucceeded by a Å¿ingle penitential thought through life, Å¿hall not be able to deprive him of.</p>
            <p>I have never yet heard, what amounts to but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable anÅ¿wer to an objection, which has often been made againÅ¿t this doctrine, viz. that its natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in this degenerate world, is to encourage libertiniÅ¿m â€”give the reins to corruption among all orders of men, both in public and private life, and
<q>undermine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the very root.</q>
â€”Whenever I perceive it to be greatly applauded and eÅ¿teemed, it brings to my mind, the following deÅ¿cription of IÅ¿aiah, concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017524_0048_0FA12B886E6B1E20"/>
of IÅ¿rael,â€”
<q>Which Å¿ay unto the Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, PropheÅ¿y not unto us right things; Å¿peak unto us Å¿mooth things; propheÅ¿y deceits: Get you out of the way; turn aÅ¿ide out of the path; cauÅ¿e the holy One of IÅ¿rael to ceaÅ¿e from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it Å¿eems Å¿trange, but according to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it is equally true, that the language of God's word, and the addreÅ¿s of the Almighty to the very Å¿ame claÅ¿s and character of perÅ¿ons, Å¿hould <hi>on the one Å¿ide,</hi> beâ€”If ye Å¿in againÅ¿t me, ye Å¿hall die:â€”If ye believe not, ye Å¿hall not Å¿ee life;â€”ye Å¿hall drink of the wine of my wrath, and have your portion, where is the blackneÅ¿s of darkneÅ¿s for ever.â€”<hi>And on the other Å¿ide</hi>â€”If ye Å¿in againÅ¿t me, and repent not in the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate, I will be your friend notwithÅ¿tanding;â€”I will never leave you, nor forÅ¿ake youâ€”my mercy Å¿hall reach you, even in hell, and cauÅ¿e you to rejoice in my Å¿alvation: For if ye believe not in this world, ye Å¿hall participate of everlaÅ¿ting life, in the world to come.</p>
            <p>ConÅ¿idering the parts of this addreÅ¿s collectively,â€” where is the <hi>threatening?</hi> It is loÅ¿t in the promiÅ¿e of <hi>good,</hi> which is far greater than the <hi>evil</hi> threatened; and in a complex view of the Å¿ubject, there is in fact no Å¿uch thing as a <hi>threatening</hi> againÅ¿t Å¿inners, in the whole word of God.</p>
            <p>It may be remarked furtherâ€”on Å¿uppoÅ¿ition the doctrine of UniverÅ¿al Salvation Å¿hould not prove true, it is evident at firÅ¿t thought, that the encouragement of it, may in the end, prove a mean of the loÅ¿s of many Å¿ouls, the blood of which muÅ¿t be accounted for at the bar of God. For judging of human nature by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent Å¿tate, it will be in vain to deny, that while perÅ¿ons can comfort themÅ¿elves with the hopes of Å¿o great a degree of bliÅ¿s, as is hereby promiÅ¿ed to them, and comparatively Å¿o Å¿mall an evil to precede, they will be
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017524_0049_0FA12B892E6555A8"/>
much more likely to indulge mental Å¿ecurity, in reÅ¿pect to the important article of preparation for another world.â€”Admitting therefore, that there is only a <hi>poÅ¿Å¿ibility</hi> that the doctrine is an <hi>error,</hi>â€”and that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ite doctrine, which has been held by far the greateÅ¿t part of ProteÅ¿tant divines is the <hi>true one,</hi> ought not this very circumÅ¿tance to be conÅ¿idered as a Å¿ufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the exerciÅ¿e of the utmoÅ¿t caution, in the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and encouragement of it? If it be an <hi>error,</hi> it is an <hi>error</hi> on the <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> Å¿ide. And,
<q>is he a chriÅ¿tianâ€”is he a manâ€”has he the tenderneÅ¿s and bowels of a manâ€”does he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s even humanity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, or an equal degree of charity with Dives in Hell,</q>
who will not uÅ¿e every poÅ¿Å¿ible degree of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿pection, leaÅ¿t he Å¿hould be an inÅ¿trument, to Å¿ome one, or more of his fellow creatures, of an injury, Å¿o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreÅ¿Å¿ibly great?</p>
            <p>I conceive therefore, that every honeÅ¿t man, who diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes the Å¿entiment, will be free to declare it, and this <hi>plainly.</hi> I take the liberty to add, that Å¿uch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration will come with particular propriety, and weight from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> It is the work of goodneÅ¿s, and love. "Watchman! what of the night?" Every good Å¿piritual guide of the flock of ChriÅ¿t, when he perceives danger near, immediately gives the alarm. "Watchman! what of the night?" It is as the language of the Almightyâ€”as the voice of God, unto GoÅ¿pel MiniÅ¿ters. May it not be Å¿uÅ¿pected, that he, who in the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of things, does not diÅ¿charge this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent office, and lift up his voice againÅ¿t the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is either in doubt whether it be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falÅ¿e,</hi> or if not <hi>publicly,</hi> is <hi>Å¿ecretly,</hi> its abettor, and friend?</p>
            <p>ImpreÅ¿Å¿ed with a belief of its deÅ¿tructive tendency, I cannot help aÅ¿king, if it be not time for the friends of truth, in whatever Å¿tation in life, Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to realize the evil which has already appeared, and is Å¿till like to flow

from it in many places, and particularly in this town. If we believe in the doctrine of the immortality of the Å¿oul, with what importance do the things of futurity, preÅ¿ent themÅ¿elves to us?â€”Eternity! how vaÅ¿t the idea! And Å¿hall any thing ariÅ¿e, which will probably injure the eternal intereÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e around us? The leaÅ¿t we can do, is to inform them of their danger, and by every proper method, endeavour to counteract the meaÅ¿ures by which it is brought.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX, In AnÅ¿wer to a late Letter, entitled, DIVINE GLORY BROUGHT TO VIEW, In the FINAL SALVATION of all MEN. AddreÅ¿Å¿ed to the Writer of this Pamphlet.</head>
            <p>IT is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed by the author of this letter, that the writer of the foregoing Å¿heets, believes that God earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ires the Å¿alvation of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of the human race, meaning by this deÅ¿ire, as he apparently explains it, not barely a pleaÅ¿ure in the Å¿alvation of his creatures, as an object in itÅ¿elf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which is readily allowed, but an abÅ¿olute choice reÅ¿pecting the accompliÅ¿hment of the event, all things taken into conÅ¿ideration. To this it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition is a miÅ¿take. There is no Å¿uch Å¿entiment contained in the explanation given to 1 Tim. ii. 3. or in any page of the pamphlet; but the very contrary is moÅ¿t clearly expreÅ¿Å¿ed, eÅ¿pecially in the laÅ¿t part, wherein the deÅ¿ign of future puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conÅ¿idered. In evidence of which, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reader is chearfully appealed to. The inference which this author draws from the Å¿uppoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the conÅ¿equential incoherence he endeavours to point out, is therefore without foundation, and is Å¿et aÅ¿ide. The ground of the miÅ¿conception of this Gentleman Å¿eems to be, that he has blended together in his own mind the interpretations of 1 Tim. ii. 3. and 1 Tim. iv. 10. as if they had been treated of as implying one and the Å¿ame thing; whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is conÅ¿idered in a limited Å¿enÅ¿e, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017524_0052_0FA12B8B6D69FA00"/>
by the apoÅ¿tle to be an anÅ¿wer to the Jews, who were diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to believe that Å¿alvation was to be confined to their own nation, excluding all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, people, or claÅ¿Å¿es of men.</p>
            <p>As to the other particular objected againÅ¿t, <hi>viz.</hi> that the atonement of ChriÅ¿t, is Å¿ufficient for the Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, including every individual perÅ¿on, as the offer of Å¿alvation to all men is a proof of, and yet that every individual perÅ¿on will not be Å¿aved, an anÅ¿wer may already be found to it in this book. The deÅ¿ign of the atonement was, that the Å¿alvation of Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, might appear to be a work of grace. In order to illuÅ¿trate this, ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us magnified the law, and made it honourable. This being done, the mercy of God, became as open to the whole world, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> of it. The whole world was put under the Mediatorial government, in conÅ¿equence of which and as the means of furthering the deÅ¿igns of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it has come to paÅ¿s, that every perÅ¿on on earth enjoys even his temporal benefits. Now, if the puniÅ¿hment of a certain number of men, who actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will, and God foreknew would remain impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will be for the beÅ¿t on the whole;â€”or, if in the way of vindictive juÅ¿tice, the future manifeÅ¿tation of the mind of the Deity, reÅ¿pecting the vaÅ¿t evil of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting and trampling on divine grace, will be one mean, by which the greatneÅ¿s of this grace, and God's Å¿enÅ¿e of its greatneÅ¿s, will be illuÅ¿trated, as the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidently affirms, how can it poÅ¿Å¿ibly appear, as the writer of the letter intimates, that the doctrine of a compleat mediation or atonement, implies in it, that the deÅ¿ign of God, in Å¿ending his Son into the world, is in a meaÅ¿ure diÅ¿appointed, and the Å¿ucceÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t in the Mediatorial undertaking, is fruÅ¿trated or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿hed?â€”There is therefore no manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on for the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, that "<hi>univerÅ¿al redemption,</hi>"
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017524_0053_0FA12B8C312D4778"/>
or as it might perhaps be better expreÅ¿Å¿ed, that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al atonement</hi> "neceÅ¿Å¿arily infers <hi>univerÅ¿al Å¿alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;" but the idea, that the atonement is Å¿ufficiently full and compleat to anÅ¿wer a general offer of mercy, in conÅ¿equence of which atonement, the mercy of God is as readily opened to all men as to a number only, and which is the chief or Å¿pecial Å¿enÅ¿e in which, as allowed in the foregoing pamphlet, ChriÅ¿t died for every man,â€”this idea, it is inÅ¿iÅ¿ted on, is moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconcileable with the doctrine, that there will be Å¿ome individuals, even all impenitent perÅ¿ons, and deÅ¿piÅ¿ers of the goÅ¿pel grace, who will finally periÅ¿h, and never enter heaven.</p>
            <p>Were it needful to reaÅ¿on with this Gentleman on his own principle, which is, that <hi>univerÅ¿al atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the exiÅ¿tence of which <hi>he</hi> believes, muÅ¿t ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arily infer <hi>univerÅ¿al Å¿alvation</hi> or <hi>happineÅ¿s,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e God is diÅ¿appointed in his benevolent wiÅ¿hes in Å¿ending his Son into the world, it might be aÅ¿ked him how he accounts for the future, and vaÅ¿t puniÅ¿hment, which he himÅ¿elf allows? If <hi>univerÅ¿al atonement</hi> neceÅ¿Å¿arily infers <hi>univerÅ¿al Å¿alvation</hi> or <hi>happineÅ¿s,</hi> does not the acknowledgment of a future, unutterable yet <hi>temporary</hi> puniÅ¿hment, Å¿uppoÅ¿e, although in a leÅ¿Å¿er degree, the Å¿ame Å¿pecies of diÅ¿appointment? On the principles advanced in this pamphlet, no Å¿uch diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is conceived of, and an anÅ¿wer is offered to every Å¿uch objection againÅ¿t the doctrine of puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he who believes that <hi>univerÅ¿al atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to which he concedes, infers <hi>univerÅ¿al Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> becauÅ¿e producing in the iÅ¿Å¿ue, <hi>univerÅ¿al hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s,</hi> is inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the doctrine of <hi>eternal</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment, and yet holds to a <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>unutterable,</hi> though <hi>temporary</hi> puniÅ¿hment in the other world, muÅ¿t certainly feel that the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed difficulty or objection lies on his own Å¿ide, and that the propoÅ¿al itÅ¿elf, or conception of the difficulty, leaves him chargeable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017524_0054_0FA12B8CF39E3BC0"/>
with the very incoherence, which he imagines to be in the way of his opponent.</p>
            <p>The obÅ¿ervations of our author, in the beginning of his letter, reÅ¿pecting the worÅ¿hip of the Deity, are rather too looÅ¿e and exceptionable. Surely it is not peculiar to the UniverÅ¿aliÅ¿ts to
<q>bow the knee to a being <hi>intrinÅ¿ically</hi> excellent, and who would be the admiration of all his creatures, even were guilt and Å¿uffering baniÅ¿hed the creation.</q>
It is enquired of him, how this <hi>intrinÅ¿ic</hi> excellence of the Deity is to be <hi>known</hi> by creatures, except from the illuÅ¿trations of it by Å¿ome <hi>means,</hi> or what may be called his <hi>works?</hi> The <hi>intrinÅ¿ic</hi> excellence of God, is the very object to which the writer of this pamphlet would deÅ¿ire to lead the mind of the reader, the doctrine contained in it being thisâ€”that by all the works of the Deity, and by what already has, and will in future exiÅ¿t, the divine perfections, which conÅ¿titute this <hi>intrinÅ¿ic</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, will be illuÅ¿trated in the beÅ¿t manner, and the God of glory, love and beauty, be moÅ¿t perfectly diÅ¿covered to the intelligent, created Å¿yÅ¿tem.</p>
            <p>The author of the letter under conÅ¿ideration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he is not a little Å¿urpriÅ¿ed at the reception which the foregoing Å¿heets met with, "even from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons who call themÅ¿elves CALVINISTS." The writer does not profeÅ¿s to have any claim upon the good opinion of others. If the pamphlet has met with their approbation in any degree, he would impute it to the eaÅ¿y evidence of the main doctrine, which by Å¿acred writ, it profeÅ¿Å¿es to maintain; and he Å¿incerely wiÅ¿hes he had been much better able to do it juÅ¿tice. Our author, however, would chooÅ¿e at leÅ¿t to put the perÅ¿ons referred to in mind, that in the article now mentioned, they are inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with themÅ¿elves, for in the firÅ¿t place, it is Å¿uggeÅ¿ted, that the pamphlet is not <hi>CalviniÅ¿tick</hi>: and Å¿econdly, it favours of <hi>FataliÅ¿m.</hi>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017524_0055_0FA12B8DAFD0D840"/>If it be not CalviniÅ¿tick, why Å¿hould this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man object to it on <hi>Å¿uch</hi> an account?

               </gap> CalviniÅ¿m, than is Å¿uggeÅ¿ted. Among the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this claÅ¿s, which the writer of it has at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent by him, he can produce Poole, Burkitt, Henry, and Edwards, the laÅ¿t of whom is a well known Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, and New England defender of the CalviniÅ¿tick doctrines, who in the very article in which this pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is declared by the letter writer to have departed from CalviniÅ¿m, are each of the Å¿ame opinion, and profeÅ¿Å¿edly believed that the atonement of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, was compleatly anÅ¿werable to the univerÅ¿al of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of mercy which has been made from Heaven, and yet that Å¿ome men would periÅ¿h for ever.</p>
            <p>ReÅ¿pecting the fear Å¿uggeÅ¿ted, that the writer of this pamphlet is a <hi>FataliÅ¿t,</hi> this alÅ¿o is foreign from the Å¿ubject, and is liable to the Å¿ame imputation of fault with the laÅ¿t particular adverted to, being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblance of that mode of conteÅ¿t often uÅ¿ed by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemick writers, when they have been preÅ¿Å¿ed cloÅ¿e by various obÅ¿tacles, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> found it difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a favourite Å¿cheme. It is impoÅ¿Å¿ible, that a perÅ¿on Å¿hould believe in divine revelation, and be a <hi>FataliÅ¿t.</hi> That men have "no will of their own," in the Å¿enÅ¿e affixed to the expreÅ¿Å¿ion, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of. Each perÅ¿on chuÅ¿es and refuÅ¿es, loves and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017524_0056_0FA12B8FED453BC0"/>
hates, and is conÅ¿cious of it. Should any one aÅ¿Å¿ert, that men are not moral agents, it would be like aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erting that they have no Å¿ouls. And by the way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually abÅ¿urd would it be, to rejoice in the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of wickedneÅ¿s, and commit Å¿in on the pretext, that by the wiÅ¿e direction of God, it is made a mean, as the ApoÅ¿tle Paul aÅ¿Å¿ures us, of the enhancing or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of grace. That Å¿in Å¿hould be over-ruled for this <hi>good,</hi> is indeed a proper matter of joy. But it is the <hi>good</hi> only, which is the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed object of the joy, and this is a virtuous feeling. Sin is an evil in its own nature. To rejoice in it as Å¿uch, is abÅ¿olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject and oppoÅ¿e the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> which, not by men or angels, but by the power and wiÅ¿dom of God, to whom alone the work belongs, it is rendered a mean of illuÅ¿trating. The 6th chap. of Romans, is a complete anÅ¿wer to all that is contained in our author's letter on this matter.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the Å¿um of the doctrine contained in the foregoing Å¿heets, as relating to theÅ¿e Å¿uppoÅ¿ed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, is as follows:â€”That in the government of God, in the moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive view of it, there is a grand and glorious Å¿cheme deviÅ¿ed, the object of which is on the whole the greateÅ¿t goodâ€”That all events will take place in correÅ¿pondency with it, each one having an influence in its place, and becoming a mean of advancing its deÅ¿ired endâ€”That for this reaÅ¿on, even the exiÅ¿tence of Å¿in, among other things, was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the puniÅ¿hment of the ungodly will be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutedâ€”That man is a moral agent, and being Å¿uch, is a proper Å¿ubject of blame worthineÅ¿s when he Å¿insâ€” And that the object of the Deity's mind, as to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which he permits, being to illuÅ¿trate his own glorious character, the contemplation of which is the Å¿ource of the moÅ¿t refined and exalted happineÅ¿s that can exiÅ¿t in the intelligent Å¿yÅ¿tem, and which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿t

in the greateÅ¿t degree, therefore he is infinitely worthy the love and adoration of all intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Now, is there any article here mentioned, which does not Å¿et the character of the Almighty in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable point of light? It is further aÅ¿ked, is there any one of theÅ¿e particulars which being denied, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not alÅ¿o an implicit denial of Å¿ome perfection or other eÅ¿Å¿ential to Jehovah?</p>
            <p>As to the manner in which things come into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence, or the Å¿ubject of <hi>cauÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> it was not the writer's deÅ¿ign to enter into the debate. The object of the Deity's mind, concerning the exiÅ¿tence of all events being declared in this pamphlet to be, in a univerÅ¿al Å¿enÅ¿e, the greateÅ¿t good and glory, his moral character, is of courÅ¿e, profeÅ¿Å¿edly vindicated, for this is the point which aÅ¿certains it, and proves its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. With reÅ¿pect to the other particular, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's firm belief isâ€”That is the true Å¿yÅ¿tem, be it which it will, that without impeaching what are called the <hi>moral</hi> attributes of God, maintain his <hi>natural</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes alÅ¿o, and not confounding the idea of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiÅ¿dom,</hi> honours and exalts his <hi>holineÅ¿s,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ents him as all grandâ€”all gloriousâ€”and all lovely.</p>
            <p>Be this the object of our adoration! Be this the God we love! In regard to the author of the letter now replied to, although this Appendix bears the form of controverÅ¿y, the writer wiÅ¿hes him to accept his undiÅ¿Å¿embling and fervent deÅ¿ire, that the Å¿pirit of all truth may Å¿o influence both their hearts, as that when the deÅ¿igns of the Mediatorial government Å¿hall be diÅ¿played in inconceivable glory at the reÅ¿urrection of the juÅ¿t and the laÅ¿t great day, they may mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unite in worÅ¿hipping the <hi>one true God,</hi> and join with the Prophets and ApoÅ¿tlesâ€”the Å¿aints and angels, in Å¿ublimely chanting his eternal praiÅ¿e.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017524_0058_0FA12B90AE03F010"/>And if, as Pope Å¿ays, "Whatever is, is rightâ€”" much more, if, as the inÅ¿pired writers declare, all events will finally terminate in the moÅ¿t exalted illuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the glory of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> then let it be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate language of every reader's mind, "Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah! the Lord Å¿itteth King for ever."</p>
