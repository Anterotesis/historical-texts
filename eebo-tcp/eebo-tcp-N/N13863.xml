            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <q>THAT mankind univerſally ſhall, in the final iſſue of the Goſpel plan of mercy, be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of corruption, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the felicity of the ſons of God,</q>
we are told by the compiler of the pamphlet now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, "is no novel doctrine." This is the <hi>truth,</hi> but not the <hi>whole truth.</hi> Had this gentleman been diſpoſed to have made his information compleat, he would have ſubjoined, it is a doctrine, which has moſt generally been reprobated in the Proteſtant Churches, as moſt erroneous, and deſtructive to the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>In the following ſheets, the author has endeavoured to explain the paſſages of ſcripture, which have been offered in defence of Univerſal Salvation. To this he has added a ſhort view reſpecting the neceſſity of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, and the ends it anſwers in the moral government of God. Brevity was the object for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; ſince it is very probable this important ſubject will employ other pens, and, in proper time, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed more at large.</p>
            <p>The author is no friend to controverſy, for its own ſake. He cannot, however, be of opinion with thoſe perſons, who believe that controverſial writings, on the fundamentals of religion, and when carried on with decency, are almoſt always unprofitable, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of them imprudent, and unwiſe: For certainly, whenever any doctrines, ſuppoſedly erroneous, are not only exhibited, but very much attended to, and by numbers, even favourably thought of, there is no better method of counteracting the conſequences which are likely to follow, than by publicly bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the ſtandard of all ſacred truth, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by this rule, a fair and candid trial. And it is much to be doubted, whether a diſpoſition to check every thing of this kind, can be attributed to any thing ſhort of the want of proper zeal in the cauſe
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017524_0003_0FA12B646F0B51D8"/>
of truth, or what may be called ſinful laſſitude, and ſpiritual ſleep.</p>
            <p>The compiler of the pamphlet on Univerſal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeems to promiſe that it will act as an antidote againſt the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of
<q>a ſtranger, who has of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſumed the character of a preacher,</q>
and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on this ſubject,
<q>in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of the New Teſtament books, from their beginning to their end.</q>
It is true, that learning and human judgment muſt be at a very low ſtate indeed, when it ſhall become neceſſary to reaſon in a formal manner againſt opinions of this kind, or in oppoſition to the writer <note n="*" place="bottom">Relly on Union.</note> from whom they are ſelected or deduced. But, ſince the compiler, juſt mentioned, while he promiſes unconditional, and eternal ſalvation to all men, attempts not to aſcertain any preciſe period to the duration of the puniſhment which is to proceed,—and it may be judged, that the moſt of men, from a diſpoſition to ſelf-flattery, and an unconſciouſneſs of the evil of ſin, will be ready to believe it will be very ſhort, it ought to have occurred to his mind, that the oppoſition he is profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making againſt thoſe, who preſume there will be no degree of puniſhment after the judgment day, is very trifling;—that they will be ready enough to eſteem him as one of their own party, and imagine that a coaleſcence in opinion is not far remote.—
<q>If this kind of preaching</q>
and writing
<q>be encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to civil ſociety, as to religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Would to God it might be realized," not only
<q>that there is the ſame reaſon from Scripture, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a <hi>Hell,</hi> as a <hi>Heaven,</hi>
               </q>
but, that as all impenitent perſons and workers of iniquity, ſhall have their portion in the <hi>one,</hi> ſo they ſhall, for ever, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the <hi>other.</hi>

               <hi>FUTURE PUNISHMENT</hi> ILLUSTRATED AND PROVED.</head>
            <p>THE firſt text produced in favour of univerſal Salvation, is 1 Tim. ii. 3.
<q>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The more general opinion of commentators, who have written on this paſſage, and the moſt obvious of all is, that it was deſigned to militate againſt the prejudices of the Jews, who had imbibed very contracted ideas concerning the benefits which were to reſult from the miſſion, and death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is well known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at firſt they ſuppoſed, he was to become a temporal Prince, and redeem them from the Roman yoke; and although, by his ſufferings and crucifixion, they were undeceived in this, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the opinion, that ſalvation was to be confined to their own nation.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle Peter was ſent to the houſe of Cornelius, to preach to a number of Gentiles, and
<q>the Holy Ghoſt fell on them which heard the word, then they of the circumciſion were aſtoniſhed, as many as came with Peter, becauſe that on the Gentiles
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017524_0005_0FA12B65EF592F70"/>
alſo, was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
Acts x. 44, 45. And ſo powerfully did this miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception prevail, that even afterwards, there aroſe very great debates on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul, therefore, in giving advice to Timothy, whom he calls his own ſon in the faith, takes pains to caution him againſt this error, by aſſuring him, that "God the Saviour, would have all men to be ſaved;" that is, all people, nations, or claſſes of men; intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as by the death of Chriſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> were put into a ſalvable ſtate, ſo were the nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and that whatſoever ſpiritual benefits, it was proper for them to preach to the <hi>one,</hi> is was proper for them to preach to the <hi>others</hi> alſo. "Whereunto," ſays he, the more effectually to confirm him in the faith,
<q>I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apoſtle; I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, and lie not; a teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in faith and verity.</q>
—In conformity with which opinion, "I exhort," adds he,
<q>that ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men, even for Kings, and for all that are in authority <note n="*" place="bottom">Whenever any perſons are put into a ſalvable ſtate, or may obtain mercy, if they repent and believe, as was the caſe with thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Apoſtle, they are the proper ſubjects of the prayers of their fellow men. But in all the prayers of meer men, who cannot look into the particular counſels of God, as they relate to individuals, I conceive that the matter petitioned for, is to be reſigned to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Divine Will; and therefore, although Saint Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that all nations and claſſes of men, being put into a ſalvable ſtate, are to be prayed for, yet it in no ſort follows from hence, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual perſon, will finally be ſaved, any more than it does, that when worn with ſickneſs, we pray for health, we ſhall moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be reſtored. And yet ſuch a prayer may be very ſcriptural and proper. In evidence of which, only read the words of Chriſt, John xvii. 9. "I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me." Our Saviour, in various parts of this chapter, utters expreſſions in a manner, which would be very unbecoming <hi>us.</hi> He ſpeaks with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He ſeems in the text quoted, to be poſſeſſed of a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the future, and particular ſtate of things. By this knowledge, he directs his petition; and well aſſured, it was not a fact, that every individual perſon on earth would be ſaved, he here moſt fully expreſſes his aſſent unto it, including in his interceſſions, thoſe only who were given him out of the world, or did <hi>already,</hi> or might in <hi>future,</hi> believe in him, and keep his word; that is, all believers, and friends of God.—This alone is a ſufficient argument againſt the doctrine of Univerſal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for if there are any perſons, who are not intereſted in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Saviour, but for whom he even refuſes to plead, what poſſibility is there, that they will be ſaved?</note>:</q>
which he thus enforces,
<q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017524_0006_0FA12B66B2F7E9A0"/>
a ranſom for all,</q>
even for Gentiles as well as Jews, "to be teſtified," or proved, "in due time;" which was in part <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the eſtabliſhment of the Church, by the power of God, among the Gentile nations, and will be fully done, when, with the preſent unbelieving Jews, the fulneſs of the Gentiles will be brought in.— The argument in the words, "For there is one God," &amp;c. appears to be this, That the univerſality of God's government and dominion over all people, made it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to ſuppoſe, that his beneficence and mercy was equally extenſive; and therefore that his Son was not ſent to be a Mediator for the Jews only, but alſo for the Gentiles, or all nations whatſoever:—Which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was intended to refute the contracted ideas of the Jews, who conſidered Chriſt as a Saviour to them alone, ſo alſo it was equally oppoſed to the opinion of the idolatrous nations, who conſidered the God of the Jews, as having no dominion over, or concern about <hi>them</hi>; which opinion it was very needful to remove, as being utterly againſt the doctrine the Apoſtle deſired to inculcate, reſpecting the extent of the benefits reſulting from the mediatorſhip of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>A particular attention is paid by Mr. White, the firſt and principal author introduced by the compiler, to 1 Tim. iv. 10.
<q>The living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017524_0007_0FA12B689F7F6A60"/>It is obſerved by ſeveral writers, that the original word here tranſlated <hi>Saviour,</hi> equally ſignifies, and is very often uſed for <hi>Preſerver</hi>;—that the Apoſtle Paul, in order to encourage Timothy while encountering the labours and reproaches he met with in his miniſterial office, puts him in mind of that ſubſtantial ſupport which always aroſe from truſting in God, who was the Saviour, or Preſerver of all men, but whoſe preſerving care was more eſpecially extended into true believers.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt on this; it is readily admitted, that although Chriſt be more emphatically the Saviour of believers than others, yet there is a ſenſe, in which he may be ſaid to be the Saviour of all men, implying every individual perſon, but this very different from the one, which thoſe who hold to the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation, exhibit to us.
<q>If any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole world.</q>
Or, Titus ii. 11. according to the offered tranſlation,
<q>the grace of God, which bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men, hath appeared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The language of the Goſpel is,
<q>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, may be ſaved;—Whoſoever will, may drink of the waters of life freely: For he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Chriſt ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out, but in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with him.</q>
In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the obedience and death of Chriſt, there is a general proclamation made—pardon is offered unto all men—"the ſin of the world is taken away;" that is, this great obſtacle, which deſerves the wrath of God, is declared to be ſo ſet aſide, as that he who repents of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or, in a ſcriptural ſenſe, is an accepter of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may enter Heaven, and enjoy his Maker, as though he had never ſinned. The choice is left with man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017524_0008_0FA12B68F0F5BCB8"/>I preſume this truth will not be doubted. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expreſs word of God, it is plain, that mercy cannot be granted without an atonement; and where it cannot be granted, it ſurely cannot be offered; and therefore an offer of mercy ſo compleat and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal as has been mentioned, muſt ſuppoſe an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equally compleat, and ſufficient for the ſalvation of the whole world.</p>
            <p>Should any doubts ariſe reſpecting this point, let it be conſidered, that the perſon who made atonement, is the Son of God, and repreſented in the ſcripture, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt price, or gift, which the Father had to beſtow on mankind: From whence it follows, that if this atonement be not equal to what has juſt been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it is impoſſible with God, out of all his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to offer any that ſhould.</p>
            <p>A certain perſon comes to me at a time, when by ſome misfortune, I have ruined my affairs, and loſt my <hi>all.</hi> He tells me, he is ſenſible of my neceſſity, and has brought me relief. Only conſent, ſays he, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it—acknowledge the gift, and it is yours. Now while it is at my own option, and in my power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure happineſs to myſelf, by this perſon, may I not conſider him as my deliverer, and friend? Juſt in the ſame ſenſe, is Chriſt the friend and deliverer of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—But are we to conclude, becauſe the atonement of our Saviour has opened the way for the offer of mercy unto all men, that it will be <hi>accepted</hi> by all? Or becauſe Chriſt Jeſus has brought pardon, life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to every man, that for a certainty, every man will <hi>receive</hi> it? When it is ſaid therefore, that
<q>Jeſus gave himſelf a ranſom for <hi>all,</hi> and was a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, or taſted death for every man,</q>
the prepoſition <hi>for,</hi> and the <hi>univerſality</hi> contained in the whole words taken together, have in view the univerſal offer of mercy which is made to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017524_0009_0FA12B69B04C5D58"/>
mankind, or the ſalvable ſtate which men are put into, in conſequence of Chriſt's death, without any reference to the effects or conſequences which this offer will have; for this is a wholly diſtinct thing.</p>
            <p>Further, it is not only true that Chriſt is a ranſom and propitiatory ſacrifice for all men, including every individual, becauſe through him they are the ſubjects of offered mercy, but in addition to this, there are ſome bleſſings, which every perſon on earth, does in a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manner enjoy, and which are to be attributed ſolely to what he has ſuffered and done. This appears thus:— The deſert of <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>death,</hi> in its comprehenſive ſenſe. When our firſt parents ſinned, by eating the forbidden fruit, they in a ſenſe died immediately; for with reſpect to ſpiritual death, they loſt the image of God; added to this, their bodies were brought into a <hi>corruptible, mortal</hi> condition from that moment. The ground of their enjoyment of any earthly comfort in this ſtate of exiſtence afterwards, was the introduction of the ſcheme of redemption, which had already been deviſed,—the effects of which, began now to operate. And this is the reaſon of each perſon's continuance in the preſent world, and his participation of any bleſſing whatſoever, but the ſmalleſt portion of time, after he has been the ſubject of one ſinful volition.—Immediately on the fall of Adam, the whole world was put under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial government;—agreeably to the deſigns of this government, we enter life—enjoy the comforts which the world affords—our food and raiment—our friends, and all our bleſſings. Every ſingle gift is the fruit, or conſequence of Chriſt's obedience and death; the whole which happens to us, being intended as the means to accompliſh the vaſt purpoſes of the mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017524_0010_0FA12B6A6EE29FE0"/>We ſee then in what ſenſe it may be ſaid that Chriſt is the Saviour of the whole world, and yet this afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no manner of proof, that all men will finally be happy.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the conſideration of two other paſſages of ſcripture, introduced by the ſame author in behalf of his favourite ſcheme.
<q>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</q>
Eph. i. 10.—
<q>And having made peace, through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf, by him, I ſay, whether they be things on earth, or things in Heaven.</q>
Col. i. 20.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the Apoſtle in theſe chapters, ſeems to be, to communicate to the Coloſſian and Epheſian churches, thoſe honourable ideas, which it was their duty, and would be their intereſt to form, concerning the greatneſs of that Saviour, whoſe name they had ſo lately profeſſed. In doing this, he repreſents him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe principal characters—as the creator of all things which were created in Heaven and earth—the upholder of all things upheld, and the reconciler of all things reconciled; that is, in ſum, the great agent in the <hi>whole,</hi> unto whom all the work, included in each of theſe articles belonged, and by whom it was all performed.</p>
            <p>The argument contained in Mr. White's obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, that the words <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>univerſal</hi> in their ſignification, and therefore that <hi>all men,</hi> and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, muſt naturally be included in them. In anſwer to which, it may be obſerved, that if we conſider the expreſſions, <hi>gathering together in one,</hi> and <hi>reconciling,</hi> to imply, the reducing from a ſtate of moral <hi>diſorder</hi> to <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or <hi>enmity</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> it is certain, that the words <hi>all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017524_0011_0FA12B6B2FECB510"/>
things,</hi> cannot imply an <hi>entire univerſality,</hi> becauſe with reſpect to the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the holy Angels, who have never ſinned, are in no propriety of ſpeech, the ſubjects of ſuch change and reconciliation; and thus the idea of <hi>univerſality</hi> is infringed on. The queſtion then is, if in <hi>one</hi> caſe the idea of univerſality muſt be given up, why not alſo in the <hi>other?</hi> If the words are ſo reſtricted in their ſignification, as that with reſpect to the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> they do not contain univerſality, why ſhould they be ſuppoſed to contain univerſality, with reſpect to the things on <hi>earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Paul is here diſcourſing of Chriſt and the Church. By the things brought into a ſtate of <hi>union</hi> and <hi>reconciliation,</hi> it is therefore in no degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to ſuppoſe he intended <hi>the whole redeemed Church,</hi> not only compoſed of the ſaints on earth, but alſo of the ſaints in Heaven, who had lived before the crucifixion of Chriſt, and ſhould be ſaved equally with the others; the words <hi>all things,</hi> plainly referring to the <hi>whole</hi> which was included under the denomination of what he was then ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>And there are various paſſages of ſcripture in which the like general expreſſions are uſed, when at the ſame time, it is well known that a certain limitation is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. In the 9th ch. Exodus and 6th verſe, we are informed, that "all the cattle of Egypt died:" Yet in the 20th verſe of the ſame chapter, it is ſaid, that
<q>he that feared the Lord, amongſt the ſervants of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, made his cattle flee into the houſes;</q>
which cattle did not die. In Job xx. 12. we read,
<q>Man lieth down, and riſeth not again 'till the Heavens be no more: They ſhall not awake, nor be raiſed out of their ſleep.</q>
It is however expreſſly ſaid in Matth. xxvii. 52, 53 that at the crucifixion of our Saviour,
<q>the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017524_0012_0FA12B6BEFEFBA80"/>
which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the Holy city, and appeared unto many.</q>
In the epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans it is written,
<q>By one man ſin came into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</q>
But <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> were tranſlated to Heaven, without ſeeing death.</p>
            <p>Nor is it conſidered improper, but on the other hand, it is a licence always taken in language, to make uſe of expreſſions of <hi>general import,</hi> which admit of ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>; ſince, if the <hi>exceptions</hi> are fully known, or by any manner, particularly ſpecified, the meaning of ſuch general expreſſions, is well aſcertained, and the true deſign of language, which is to communicate ideas, is adhered to, without the trouble, which a minute expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would put us to, every time we write or ſpeak.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion, however, of ſeveral writers, that the terms <hi>gather together in one, and reconcile,</hi> amount to more than the meerly bringing the ſubject ſpoken of into a ſtate of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> from a ſtate of <hi>enmity</hi>; and really refer to that condition of <hi>reconcileableneſs,</hi> which mankind in general, may be ſaid to be in, ſince the blood of Chriſt is ſufficient for the ſalvation of the whole world, and whoſoever <hi>will</hi> may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who conſider the meaning to be, that <hi>all things</hi> are actually ſo <hi>gathered together into one, and reconciled,</hi> as that they are wreſted from that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly ſtate, into which they had been reduced by ſin, and are now put under a fixed plan of mediatorial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; according to which, all events and things, even the different ſtates of men, with reſpect to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and miſery, in the preſent, and future world, will promote the purpoſes of God's glory, and be to his praiſe; agreeably to thoſe words in ſacred writ,
<q>the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017524_0013_0FA12B6CAF1F04D0"/>
wrath of man ſhall praiſe him;</q>
for as <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>of</hi> him, likewiſe <hi>all things</hi> will be <hi>to</hi> him, for evermore. In both of theſe interpretations, the univerſality of the expreſſion, <hi>all things,</hi> is as fully admitted, as is contended for: So that on the whole, in whatſoever ſenſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words <hi>gather together in one, and reconcile</hi>; and whether we allow the idea of <hi>univerſality</hi> to belong to the term <hi>all things,</hi> or not, it appears that the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, is by no means, neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in either the <hi>one</hi> caſe, or the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall make but one remark more on this point. That after the reſurrection of the dead, and appearance of the world before the judge, every true believer will be received into Heaven, and every unbeliever be caſt into Hell, this Mr. White himſelf allows, although he ſuppoſes the puniſhment to be but <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It ſeems his ideas are, that this puniſhment is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary,</hi> or the mean to be uſed in accompliſhing the <hi>gathering together all things, or perſons, into one,</hi> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their final ſalvation;—moreover, that <hi>Hell</hi> is the place, in which this work is to be done, and that the period between the <hi>day of judgment,</hi> and what he calls the <hi>end,</hi> is the time allotted for the performance of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle Paul aſſures us, that the <hi>gathering together in one, all things in Chriſt,</hi> is to be done
<q>in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times,</q>
which, without a critical conſideration of the words, muſt ſurely be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to refer to <hi>the time particularly appointed by God, for the work of grace, and the goſpel to operate.</hi> This being the caſe, it follows, from what our author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf allows, that the ſeaſon allotted for the puniſhment of ſinners, is, at leaſt, a <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times</hi>; and that the work of grace, is in <hi>part</hi> to be performed in <hi>Hell.</hi> But does it not appear a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017524_0014_0FA12B6D6E170E98"/>
unuſual, to conſider the exhibitions of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> againſt the impenitent, as the exhibitions of his <hi>grace</hi> in their <hi>behalf?</hi> If the future puniſhment of ſinners is to be of the diſciplinary kind, then it is like the afflictions of the righteous on earth, working out for them, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. According to ſuch a repreſentation, the ſinner is ſent to Hell for his <hi>advantage,</hi> and Tophet was ordained of old, as the place in which the Almighty might exerciſe <hi>mercy</hi> on offenders, and not <hi>justice and judgment only.</hi> Let any one ſeriouſly aſk himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can reconcile this, with the plain language of ſacred writ?</p>
            <p>The next paſſage I ſhall remark on, introduced by Mr. White, is Romans, v. from the 15th to the 19th verſe.—
<q>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift: For if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto juſtification of life. For as by one man's diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt part of theſe words, by ſeveral obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein contained, the evident deſign is to prove the ſtronger degree of willingneſs in God, that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> ſhould abound by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than that <hi>ſin</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017524_0015_0FA12B6E31537CB8"/>
               <hi>evil,</hi> ſhould abound through <hi>Adam.</hi> The principal part of them, ſuppoſed to favour the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation, is,
<q>as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the offence of <hi>one,</hi> ſin was introduced into the world;—all the deſcendants of Adam have partook of his wicked nature, and judgment has come upon all men to condemnation. The point inſiſted on by our author is, that the <hi>free gift</hi> is as univerſal as the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This I think may readily be granted, and yet in no degree countenance his favourite ſentiment. Adam, our firſt parent, before he tranſgreſſed, was in a ſtate of <hi>probation.</hi> He might have ſecured the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if he had remained perfect. As by his eating the forbidden fruit, he fell, and this introduced ſin among his deſcendants, who have fallen with him, a compleat loſs of the right to <hi>life</hi> has followed;—the whole world has forfeited the privilege of being in a probationary condition, for judgment, which is the deſert of ſin, is come upon all men to condemnation. This is the conſequence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence. What then is the conſequence of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>?
<q>The free gift is come upon all men unto juſtification of life;</q>
the natural explanation of which is, the free gift, or the grace of the goſpel, is come, or propoſed unto all men, bringing with it <hi>juſtification,</hi> which juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation produces, or ends in life: That is, as by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which introduced ſin among his deſcendants, <hi>all men</hi> have fallen from a ſtate of probation, and are under condemnation, ſo by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the propoſal of grace and pardon, or the <hi>free gift,</hi> has come upon, or unto all;—whoſoever <hi>will,</hi> may be ſaved, being in fact put into an <hi>equal</hi> ſtate of probation, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017524_0016_0FA12B705C003298"/>
entitled to an <hi>equal</hi> privilege with <hi>that,</hi> which exiſted before the fall, and any ſtate of trial whatſoever; or which would have exiſted, if Adam had never ſinned, and his poſterity had not joined in rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thus is the free gift as <hi>univerſal</hi> as the judgment; for certainly the offer of mercy, may be called a <hi>free gift.</hi> It was eſſential to our author's point, that he ſhould diſprove it, and ſhow that by the free gift's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, or unto all, was intended, not only that it was offered unto all men, but that it ſhould finally, be univerſally accepted. This would be difficult; for comparing ſcripture with ſcripture, the very contrary, is plainly intimated, in a very ſtriking paſſage, among others, on this ſubject, by the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who ſpeaking concerning his being ſent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſays, that he
<q>magnifies his office, if by any means, he may provoke to emulation them which are his fleſh, and might ſave SOME of them.</q>
Alſo, from Gal. iii. 22.
<q>But the ſcripture hath included all under ſin, that the promiſe,</q>
viz. of <hi>pardon, life,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi>
               <q>by faith of Chriſt Jeſus, might be to them that BELIEVE.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next text which I ſhall conſider, is, Rev. v. 13.
<q>And every creature which is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſaying, bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The book of <hi>Revelation</hi> is a diſcovery of the vaſt works, and government of God, exhibited to us, not exactly according to the manner of their exiſtence, but in a figurative ſtile, and by means of <hi>Hieroglyphics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this chapter, the Lamb is repreſented as coming, and taking the book, with the ſeven ſeals, out of the right hand of him, that ſat upon the throne. At ſo
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017524_0017_0FA12B70AC8B4260"/>
ſolemn an event, a doxology, or hymn of praiſe, is raiſed, firſt of all by the church, or redeemed, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. The angels are next repreſented, as bearing their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part in the anthem, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand, ſaying with a loud voice,
<q>Worthy is the Lamb which was ſlain, to receive power,</q>
&amp;c. To heighten this <hi>aſcription,</hi>
               <q>every creature which is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them,</q>
are heard to ſay,
<q>bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We may conſider the whole repreſentation thus: The firſt and ſecond doxology, is the real expreſſion of the joy and rapture of the redeemed church, and angels in Heaven, when the Lamb comes, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the book. But, as if this were not a ſufficient cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his praiſe at ſuch an event, by a grand <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonification,</hi> the third is exhibited as the echo of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal nature, in which, for the period, every being in the univerſe, and the whole inanimate creation, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as alſo becoming <hi>vocal,</hi> and at once breaking out into <hi>that praiſe,</hi> which praiſe, as the Pſalmiſt tells us, is ever expreſſed, though in ſilent language, by all the works of God.</p>
            <p>There is a beautiful ſimilitude between this part of the viſion of Saint John, and thoſe words of David, in which he calls upon all things to praiſe their Maker.
<q>Praiſe him ye ſun and moon: Praiſe him all ye ſtars of light. Praiſe him ye dragons, and all deeps. Fire and hail, ſnow and vapour, ſtormy wind; mountains and all hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars. Beaſts and all cattle, creeping things, and flying fowl. Kings of the earth, and all people; praiſe ye the Lord.</q>
And whereas in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017524_0018_0FA12B712CF913A8"/>
is invited to join in the hymn of praiſe,—in what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was witneſs to, the anthem is repreſented as if really ſung, and the whole ſyſtem of univerſal nature engaged in loud reſponſes to the doxology of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed church, and the celeſtial angels.</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed now to the conſideration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks made on the quotation from the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, taking alſo in view, the obſervations on Gen. iii. 15. concerning our Saviour's bruiſing the head of the ſerpent.—
<q>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith, all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the ſon alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</q>
1 Cor. xv. 24th. to 28th verſe.</p>
            <p>In the uſe which is made of theſe words, in defence of the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, it might in the firſt place, have been expected of the expoſitor, that, as being ſo eſſential to his point, he would have entered more particularly into the argument, to ſhow, that by our Saviour's vanquiſhing, or putting all enemies under his feet, and bruiſing the head of the ſerpent, is not intended what is uſually believed.</p>
            <p>He might have been told, that the enemies of Chriſt are vanquiſhed, and the head of the ſerpent bruiſed, when at the judgment day they are ſent into puniſhment, and all the plots deviſed againſt the kingdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt, are wholly diſappointed, and even made the means of illuſtrating his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017524_0019_0FA12B71F03E8660"/>But the vanquiſhment of God's enemies, according to his idea of it, is very different: It implies in it <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>: It is not a <hi>curſe,</hi> but a <hi>bleſſing</hi>: It conſiſts in the beſtowment of <hi>everlaſting happineſs.</hi> And if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the argument rightly, it involves in it the idea of the ſalvation of the <hi>devils,</hi> as well as <hi>wicked men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion now is, whether we moſt accommodate ourſelves to the common uſe and acceptation of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in ſaying, that when it was written, that our Saviour would ſubdue, or vanquiſh his enemies, it was hereby ſignified that he would beſtow on them <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>everlaſting gain,</hi> or in ſaying, that this vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment implies, that they ſhall be overtaken with <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment diſgrace</hi> and <hi>loſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another particular which might have been expected from this writer, is, that he ſhould have offered ſome kind of argument to ſhow, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>delivery of the kingdom</hi> here ſpoken of, is not to be at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and day of judgment, but at a future period.</p>
            <p>On the truth of this ſingle article, I conceive that the reaſonings on this text, and indeed this whole ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation entirely depend; for as it is granted, that after the day of judgment, the wicked will be turned into <hi>Hell,</hi> to be puniſhed for a <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> that is, 'till the <hi>end</hi> comes; if therefore, according to the ſcripture account, the period of time emphatically ſtiled the <hi>end,</hi> is to commence at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, or judgment day, I infer, that the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, as thus exhibited to us, cannot be true, and that all the arguments brought in favour of it, are unſupported, and nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle had, in the beginning of this chapter, been diſcourſing of the general reſurrection of the dead, immediately preceding the judgment.
<q>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017524_0020_0FA12B72AE24FD00"/>
to God even the Father,</q>
&amp;c. But when is this to be? After
<q>he hath put all enemies under his feet.</q>
And
<q>the laſt enemy which ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is death,</q>
or ceſſation of exiſtence, in a compleat ſenſe: And therefore Saint Paul adds, in evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the whole,
<q>Elſe what ſhall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all?</q>
And in full aſſurance of his having proved his point, he ſubjoins,
<q>Oh death! where is thy ſting? Oh grave! where is thy victory?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before our author could ſuppoſe that he had gained any ſtrength from this whole quotation, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhould appear, and it belonged to him to prove, that the deſtruction of death here mentioned, has no reference at all to natural death, and the reſurrection. This he does not attempt, but allows in general, that according to his own interpretation of the words at large, the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond death,</hi>
               <q>will be totally and abſolutely deſtroyed;</q>
meaning by the <hi>firſt death,</hi> the mortality of the body, or the ceſſation of life and exiſtence; and by the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> the exiſtence of ſin, and the puniſhment of it. Indeed, the connection obſervable through the whole chapter, will not admit the ſuppoſition, that the Apoſtle's words have <hi>no relation</hi> to the <hi>firſt death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears then, that the deſtruction of death men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this quotation, is joined with the ſubjection of all things; each article, ſpecified in the verſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreſented, as if belonging to <hi>one</hi> work and to take place at the <hi>ſame time</hi>;—the deſtruction of death, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently making a capital part in the victory which our Saviour is to obtain at the ſeaſon deſcribed.</p>
            <p>If then, by theſe words, <hi>the laſt enemy which ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</hi> the Apoſtle refers, though it be but in part, to <hi>natural death,</hi> and the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> does it not plainly follow, if we would preſerve any <hi>beauty,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017524_0021_0FA12B736D0C5558"/>
union, among the parts of the deſcription, in the whole verſes quoted, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>ſubjection of all things, and delivery of the kingdom,</hi> will exiſt at the <hi>reſurrection of the dead,</hi> or <hi>general judgment</hi> immediately following. For ſuppoſing, as this writer does, that the deſtruction of death, the laſt enemy to be deſtroyed, includes in it, both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral death,</hi> and that the former will be entirely deſtroyed at the reſurrection, but the latter, not until a <hi>long</hi> or <hi>unknown period</hi> afterwards, in this caſe there is evidently a <hi>diſmemberſhip</hi> in the parts of the deſcription—<hi>two</hi> periods of time are introduced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where there is only the appearance of <hi>one,</hi> and the harmony of the <hi>whole</hi> is broken.—I cannot therefore conceive, that there is any other method to do juſtice to the Apoſtle's words, and the arrangement of his ideas throughout this chapter, than by believing that the <hi>whole deſtruction</hi> he refers to, is in fact to be performed at the reſurrection of the dead, and appearance of Chriſt to judge the world.</p>
            <p>In further confirmation of this truth, and as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the end and reſignation of the mediatorial kingdom, will commence at the appearance of Chriſt, on the reſurrection day, we may conſider thoſe words in Acts iii. 21.
<q>Whom the Heaven muſt receive, until the times of reſtitution of all things.</q>
—It will readily be granted, I imagine, that the <hi>times,</hi> or <hi>time</hi> of <hi>reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>reſignation of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorial kingdom,</hi> are one and the ſame: And therefore, if the reſtitution of all things, will be at the reſurrection, that the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>delivery of the kingdom</hi> will alſo. What then is the idea contained in the declaration, that the Heaven will receive our Saviour until the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things? I anſwer, it is this—that he will never be again ſeen by the world, or make his appearance to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until that important ſeaſon.
<q>Whom the Heaven muſt receive until the times of reſtitution of all
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017524_0022_0FA12B7433BFE8D8"/>
things.</q>
But the Heaven will moſt certainly receive him <hi>after</hi> the reſtitution of all things, as well as <hi>before.</hi> There ſeems therefore, to be no circumſtance to ſet in oppoſition to the idea already mentioned, viz. that our Saviour will remain in the Heaven, until the time of reſtitution referred to. And while this interpretation of the words appears rational and eaſy, it has alſo the very great advantage, of being the moſt conformable to the general language of ſcripture, which often expreſſly makes mention of the <hi>ſecond</hi> appearance of our Saviour, which is to be at the reſurrection and judgment day, but makes no mention of <hi>any,</hi> which is called a <hi>third</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>On the whole then, it appears, that all theſe paſſages of ſcripture, are <hi>againſt</hi> the doctrine of Univerſal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For if the <hi>reſtitution of all things,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>reſignation of the mediatorial kingdom,</hi> will be at the appearance of Chriſt at the reſurrection, at which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, even our author allows, he will conſign the wicked, though but for a ſeaſon, to <hi>Hell,</hi> it follows, that all the hopes of reſtoration to future favour and happineſs, will be entirely cut off, becauſe, when the mediatorial kingdom is ended, there can no longer, be any mercy beſtowed on ſinners, ſince all mercy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for Chriſt's ſake: And by the mediatorial king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's being ended, is obviouſly meant, that there is an abſolute cloſe put to the period, wherein there is the laſt poſſibility of a ſingle addition being made to the number of the redeemed, then exiſting.</p>
            <p>But I wiſh to reaſon a little further on this ſubject, and aſk, in what ſenſe it is that <hi>Hell</hi> is to be a ſtate of <hi>purification?</hi> for this is the idea which is offered to us concerning it, by theſe writers.<note n="*" place="bottom">In proof of this, I might refer the reader, to a number of paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the ſaid pamphlet. If the puniſhment of <hi>hell</hi> is to be,
<q>in order that</q>
the ſubjects of it, "may be made the willing people of God;" if they will not be
<q>delivered from their ſuffering, till this is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> or till their puniſhment ſhall have produced a proper effect, or "burnt out ſin and luſt," certainly, if there be any meaning in words, the puniſhment of ſinners in the other world, is to be <hi>purgative,</hi> and their dwelling-place, may be ſtrictly termed PURGATORY.</note> Is the <hi>purification</hi> to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017524_0023_0FA12B74F0C79450"/>
be produced <hi>gradually?</hi> Then it ſeems there is a holy and virtuous principle in ſinners, which is capable of being wrought upon by <hi>puniſhment</hi>—which <hi>puniſhment,</hi> by the ſuppoſition, is to have very different effects than that which was once inflicted upon Pharaoh and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe hearts were thereby hardened. And may it not plainly be inferred from hence, that <hi>ſinners</hi> and <hi>ſaints</hi> on earth, are perſons of the very ſame character; for there is no <hi>ſaint,</hi> of whom more can be ſaid, than that he is virtuous in <hi>part,</hi> or in <hi>a degree,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the poſition, the ſame muſt be allowed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, is this <hi>purification</hi> to be performed <hi>all at once,</hi> and when the <hi>end</hi> is come? If ſo, it is evident that <hi>puniſhment</hi> will not be the means of it <hi>at all,</hi> for if this will have no influence of the kind at <hi>firſt,</hi> neither can it have influence at <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But paſſing by the conſideration of theſe things, it is probable it will be allowed, that when any of mankind continue to be impenitent, and unbelievers, to the end of life, the puniſhment to be inflicted on them in <hi>Hell,</hi> will be done, in order to ſatisfy, or manifeſt the divine juſtice; and, that in <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> it will be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, as to be the <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>full</hi> reward of ſin. This indeed ſeems to be the ſentiment of Mr. White himſelf, in the pamphlet under conſideration, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he may, at the ſame time, conſider future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as <hi>purgative,</hi> or <hi>diſciplinary,</hi> yet ſays, that the deſign of God in this puniſhment of ſin, is
<q>to glorify his wrath againſt it, and his juſtice alſo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017524_0024_0FA12B75AD718B80"/>Be this as it may, the ſcripture is plainly deciſive in the repreſentation of this fact. When the Lord ſhall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on ſinners, and conſign them to future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, his buſineſs, as we are informed, will be to <hi>reward their ſin, and evil works</hi>: Whether therefore this puniſhment be conſidered as <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi>—as <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>not eternal,</hi> it is certain, that it will be according to the full meaſure of the demerit of ſin; for the <hi>reward</hi> of ſin, muſt in the nature of things, have reſpect to the <hi>degree</hi> of it. It will be the execution of the threatning of God's word; or as it is called, the
<q>recompence of the Lord</q>
againſt the ſinner, and the diſplay of his <hi>juſtice,</hi> from which, as the ſcripture aſſures us, there can be no poſſibility of eſcaping, until it be compleatly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and the debt which is due to it be paid, to
<q>the uttermoſt farthing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now enquire what will be the conſequence, if it ſhould even be allowed, that there will be ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time hereafter, when it may be ſaid, that ſinners have ſuffered a puniſhment wholly adequate to their crimes. It is this—that ſuppoſing they ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be admitted into Heaven, it cannot be ſaid, if we would give the word its <hi>comprehenſive</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> meaning, that this is the work of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Are the <hi>holy Angels</hi> the ſubjects of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> No. But why? They have never ſinned, or merited <hi>evil. Salvation and redemption,</hi> in a <hi>full ſcriptural</hi> ſenſe, imply deliverance from ſome <hi>deſerved evil.</hi> But if it be true, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has ſuffered all the evil he has deſerved, the idea of <hi>deliverance</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> is at an end, for there remains nothing as the <hi>object</hi> of theſe things. He is in the ſame ſituation, as if he had juſt begun to exiſt, and had not been the ſubject, either of a <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> volition. It may be ſaid indeed, that it is by the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, he is admitted into Heaven, but it is not by <hi>grace:</hi> Nor
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017524_0025_0FA12B769CD66688"/>
is there any ſort of neceſſary connection implied between him and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> or any <hi>propitiatory ſacrifice,</hi> or <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then it be a <hi>revealed truth,</hi> that whenever ſinners are puniſhed in the other world, it is in a <hi>degree,</hi> equal to the <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>demerit</hi> of ſin, it is plainly to be inferred, that notwithſtanding theſe ſeveral writes on Univerſal Salvation, may profeſs to offer ſalvation to all men, yet to thoſe who will thus be puniſhed in the other world, it is really not <hi>ſalvation</hi> or <hi>redemption,</hi> in the <hi>full ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> ſenſe of theſe words, but meerly <hi>happineſs</hi> which they offer;—the idea of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to the ſubjects now made mention of, being wholly without <hi>foundation,</hi> and in truth, a manifeſt <hi>inconſiſtency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reflecting on theſe things, ſhould it not occur to the compiler of the pamphlet preſented to us, and all thoſe who abet and encourage the ſentiments it contains, that they are engaged in preſenting to mankind, what is not to be found in the ſacred volume—for which there appears to be no manner of <hi>permiſſion</hi> or <hi>warrant</hi> from God:—If ſo—then what Angel from on high, ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the work? Or what mortal on earth ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to do it?—The obvious remark from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, is therefore by way of enquiry—Can that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be true, which offers to any <hi>claſs,</hi> or <hi>number</hi> of men, <hi>eternal happineſs,</hi> but which is not to come to them through the channel of <hi>free grace,</hi> and <hi>pardoning love,</hi> exhibited in the <hi>goſpel,</hi> nor for the <hi>Redeemer's ſake</hi>?</p>
            <p>I beg the reader's patience to but one thing more in reply to the reaſoning of Mr. White, from the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted verſes. It is this, When our Saviour was ariſen from the dead, and was about to leave the <hi>world,</hi> and aſcend to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he gives this ſolemn commiſſion to his diſciples,
<q>Go ye into the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature.</q>
He immediately adds,
<q>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017524_0026_0FA12B787551F2B8"/>
not ſhall be damned.</q>
There follows not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle remark on this head. This is the ſubſtance of the whole.
<q>He is taken up, and a cloud receives him from their ſight.</q>
—If now the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation be true—much more, if it be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doctrine, which is intimated to us by Mr. White, is it probable, when our Saviour was juſt parting with his friends and diſciples—when he was no more to ſpeak to them in the body reſpecting it, and when it was of eſſential importance that, through his words, they ſhould form no inconſiſtent or diſhonorary ideas,— is it probable, I aſk, that he would have made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? Is it probable, moreover, that he would have uſed a mode of ſpeech which, allowing the doctrine to be true, may be conſtrued like a ſeeming intention to conceal it? And laſtly, is it probable, that he would have ſo aranged his ideas and words, as to leave it, at leaſt very plauſible, that he intended abſolutely to deny it?</p>
            <p>"He that believeth not, ſhall be damned;" that is, as theſe gentlemen muſt explain it, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be puniſhed by a temporary damnation, but this ſucceeded by never ending ſalvation.</hi> Although, therefore, there was ſome reaſon for the obſervation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, "He that believeth not ſhall be damned," yet, by the ſuppoſition, it would have been as true, and for any thing which appears to the contrary, there would have been as great, and greater reaſon for it, if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation had been exactly the reverſe, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But if in the communication of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ideas, and the common concerns of life, it would be thought <hi>intolerable,</hi> in ſuch a manner, to confound the uſe of language, does it ſeem rational to think, that the great light of the world, and teacher of men, would have thus ſet us the example?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017524_0027_0FA12B78AE1D5FC8"/>It only remains now to anſwer Mr. Scott, another writer introduced by the compiler; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the obſervations he has made on the words <hi>eternal, everlaſting, for ever and ever.</hi> He remarks,
<q>That he has not been able to find one ſingle text, in which this article of an eternal and endleſs miſery, is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly affirmed, or neceſſarily implied:</q>
and that,
<q>the original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, ſignify nothing more than an <hi>age,</hi> and in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>ages,</hi> either longer or ſhorter, definite or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In reply to which, I beg to obſerve, that wherever theſe words are uſed in the Old Teſtament, they denote the duration of the thing ſpoken of, as long as poſſible, compared with the <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>ſubject,</hi> unto which it ſtands related or applies. The <hi>hills</hi> and <hi>mountains</hi> are called <hi>everlaſting</hi>; the meaning of which is, they are to continue as long as mountains can continue, compared with the ſubject unto which they apply, namely the <hi>earth</hi>; that is, they are to continue as long as the <hi>earth itſelf.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>Paſſover</hi> is ſaid to have been inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Iſraelites, as an ordinance <hi>for ever</hi>; that is, to exiſt as long as the oeconomy of that people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, which was eſſential to the exiſtence of the Paſſover. It is very obvious, therefore, that the words <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and <hi>for ever,</hi> imply much more than what is expreſſed, when we ſay of any thing, that it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for <hi>ages,</hi> or <hi>ages of ages</hi>; for with reſpect to the mountains, this would be true, if they ſhould abide even ſome thouſand years, but ceaſe to exiſt, before the world was at an end: or if the Paſſover ſhould continue through a long number of generations, but become unobſerved before the oeconomy of the Jews was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: Whereas, the particular idea pointed out, is in direct: <hi>oppoſition</hi> to this, or any other conſtruction of the words, which excludes the certainty of the exiſtence
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017524_0028_0FA12B796D9D1BD8"/>
of the thing ſpoken of, as long as the nature and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſubject, to which it ſtands related, will poſſibly admit.</p>
            <p>Having now diſcovered in what ſenſe we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words, <hi>everlaſting, eternal, for ever and ever,</hi> when applied to things belonging to the <hi>preſent</hi> world, let it be enquired, how we are to conſider them, when applied to things belonging to the <hi>next</hi>: I anſwer, in a ſenſe admitting of perfect <hi>analogy</hi> in both caſes. The hills, and mountains, are things belonging to <hi>this</hi> ſtate of exiſtence. The happineſs of the ſaints in Heaven, and the miſery of ſinners in Hell, are things belonging to the <hi>future.</hi> As the mountains therefore are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>for ever,</hi> that is, throughout the <hi>whole</hi> of <hi>this</hi> ſtate of exiſtence, ſo, the happineſs of the ſaints in Heaven, and the puniſhment of ſinners in Hell, are to endure, throughout the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>next</hi> ſtate of exiſtence. In other words, as the duration of <hi>being,</hi> is to be <hi>compleat,</hi> and <hi>as long as poſſible,</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> inſtance, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is to be <hi>compleat,</hi> or <hi>as long as poſſible,</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> For if this be not the caſe, the analogy, juſt mentioned, and moſt clearly obſervable, is broken through, and the expreſſions, both in the Old and New Teſtament, which refer to future duration, are improperly uſed, and in a manner, evidently calculated to miſguide the mind of the reader.</p>
            <p>Thus much has been obſerved on the ſuppoſition that the original words, tranſlated, <hi>eternal, everlaſting, for ever and ever,</hi> imply no more than <hi>ages,</hi> and <hi>ages of ages,</hi> or excited no other ideas in the minds of thoſe who ſpoke the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> languages, than what <hi>we</hi> have annexed to the <hi>laſt</hi> of theſe words. But how does this appear to be the caſe? If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language be ſo much more copious, than either the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the <hi>Greek,</hi> as to admit the expreſſions <hi>ever and ever,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>ages of ages,</hi> yet what proof is this, that the original
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017524_0029_0FA12B7A34822B50"/>
words did not excite the very ſame ideas in the minds of thoſe who ſpoke them, as <hi>we</hi> have when we uſe the <hi>former</hi> of theſe? more eſpecially when we add, that theſe words, both in the Hebrew and the Greek, as is univerſally allowed, are the very fulleſt, which either of theſe languages contain, to expreſs what we intend, when we ſay, <hi>ever and ever.</hi> When we conſider alſo, that they are the only original words made choice of to ſignify the proper eternity of God, and that the word in the New Teſtament, is oftner uſed, when his own eternity is the ſubject treated of, than any other, is it in any degree probable, that out of all the languages he <hi>then had,</hi> or <hi>could have made,</hi> he would have choſen, <hi>two,</hi> which did <hi>not</hi> do it? We may conclude, therefore, they really did, and that the declaration of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his own eternity, is not, as theſe writers tell us, left wholly out of ſacred writ; which opinion, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, is confirmed by this circumſtance, viz. that the tranſlators of both the original languages have rendered the words as moſt fully expreſſive of what is intended by <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>ever and ever.</hi> This was done firſt in the <hi>Latin,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other living languages; and according to all probability, would not have been attempted, except from a knowledge, that theſe were the true ideas always annexed to them in the <hi>original</hi>; ſince eſpecially with reſpect to the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the miſtake, or fraud, if there had been any, would have been ſo liable to <hi>detection,</hi> as ſcarcely to have left a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſecurity from it.</p>
            <p>Surely alſo, it is a very melancholy idea, if there be no word in the Old and New Teſtament, or in the Hebrew or Greek, which aſſures us of the <hi>everlaſting</hi> happineſs of the ſaints in Heaven. We are told by theſe writers, that this would in fact be the caſe, were it not that the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiſſoluble, immortal,</hi> not to <hi>die any more,</hi> are expreſs to this purpoſe. It may be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

however, that the following expreſſions, <hi>their worm</hi> which <hi>dieth not;—the fire</hi> which <hi>is not quenched,</hi> are, by theſe ſame writers plainly <hi>denied</hi> to be ſignificant of eternal duration. And what is the meaning of the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiſſoluble, immortal?</hi> Certainly the whole which can be meant is, that the ſubjects ſpoken of <hi>ſhall not die.</hi> It ſeems then, that the expreſſion, <hi>ſhall not die,</hi> may in <hi>one caſe</hi> be conſidered as clearly ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>eternal duration,</hi> and in <hi>another,</hi> as conſiſtent with the abſolute <hi>denial</hi> of it. Notwithſtanding then, that the words, <hi>incorruptible, indiſſoluble, immortal, not to die any more,</hi> do indeed evidently expreſs the eternal exiſtence of the righteous, yet it may be inferred, that all theſe writers, muſt, by their own method of reaſoning, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce the idea. The ſtate of facts therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account given us, is juſt this, that there is no <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> words throughout the ſacred volume of inſpiration, which aſcertain the certainty of any <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration</hi> whatſoever; but every poſitive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting <hi>eternity,</hi> is entirely left out of this book.</p>
            <p>But in what manner can theſe words,
<q>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,</q>
and thrice ſolemnly repeated, be conſidered as conſiſtent with the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler obſerves, it is intimated by one and another of the beforementioned writers, that if they prove any thing, it is <hi>this</hi>—
<q>That the torments of the wicked ſhall laſt as long as their next ſtate of exiſtence laſts, without determining how long that ſhall be;</q>
that is to ſay, if they prove any thing, it is, that the wicked ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure puniſhment, 'till their next ſtate of exiſtence be at an end. The conſequence of this is, that they muſt be <hi>deprived</hi> of all ſalvation; for there can be no <hi>ſalvation,</hi> where there is no <hi>exiſtence.</hi> And thus the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, inſtead of being <hi>proved,</hi> is by the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017524_0031_0FA12B7BAEEA96F0"/>
very eſpouſers of it, abſolutely <hi>denied.</hi>—This is plain reaſoning, as even the compiler muſt allow;—unleſs, by the words, "their next ſtate of exiſtence," he would refer merely to the ſinner's ſtate of pain and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—which if he does, the interpretation of the text quoted, is exactly this—<hi>The wicked ſhall be puniſhed, as long as they ſhall be puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more in the obſervation reſpecting the <hi>valley of Hinnom,</hi> than what is contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.—But as it has been judged proper to introduce the verſe already conſidered, and thrice ſolemnly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour, would it not have been as well, if the preceding verſe, had been added alſo? And then the whole together would have read thus—
<q>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter half into life, than having two feet, to be caſt into Hell, into the fire that NEVER SHALL BE QUENCHED: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</q>
Let any one calmly peruſe the whole together, and muſt he not think that the idea of eternal, and never ceaſing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is fully comprized, and that if theſe words do not comprize it, there is an impoſſibility that any others ever ſhould?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:017524_0032_0FA12B7C71192338"/>HAVING now gone through the various texts which have been produced, in the pamphlet referred to, in favour of Univerſal Salvation, I ſhall proceed to offer to the reader the ground on which the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite doctrine is founded, and exhibit the valuable ends which the puniſhment of ſinners will anſwer, in the ſyſtem of God's moral government;—in doing which, I ſhall be as ſhort and comprehenſive as the caſe will admit.</p>
            <p>The grand object or deſign of the Deity, I conceive to be this—that by all which takes place in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſyſtem, from firſt to laſt, including all things, which <hi>already have,</hi> and ſhall in <hi>future</hi> exiſt, his own <hi>divine perfection,</hi> and the true nature of <hi>perfection itſelf,</hi> may be illuſtrated in the beſt and moſt compleat man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the ſum of which, in a moral view, is <hi>holineſs,</hi> or <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known, that a beautiful object never appears with ſuch conſpicuous luſtre, as when contraſted with its <hi>oppoſite.</hi> In even a piece of painting, ſome ſhades are requiſite to ſet off the more ſtriking parts, which ſhades alone, would be diſagreeable to the eye, but by a happy diſpoſition, they aſſiſt in forming a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable piece. May we not conclude, that when the great Ruler of Heaven and earth, permitted ſin to come into exiſtence, the reaſon was, that it might ſerve as a mean to give <hi>diſtinction</hi> to <hi>holineſs,</hi> and by the force of <hi>contraſt,</hi> illuſtrate its beauty in a more ſtriking light.</p>
            <p>But beſides the advantage which the exiſtence of ſin has in raiſing the luſtre of its oppoſite, there is <hi>one</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of love, which could not have been known at all without it; and this is, love to the <hi>unworthy,</hi> and to <hi>enemies,</hi> or whatſoever is included under the head of <hi>pardoning love, free grace,</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> exhibited in the goſpel; which exhibition of the Deity is evidently repreſented, as the greateſt and moſt aſtoniſhing that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017524_0033_0FA12B7D30AAE878"/>
ever exiſted; in the making of which, the treaſures of his <hi>wiſdom, power,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> are ſaid to be opened to our view, to the great wonder of the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>What has been now obſerved reſpects the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of ſin: Next then; as to the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of it; it may in the firſt place be noted, that as to the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſenſative</hi> pain, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, which will hereafter be the portion of ſinners, it is beyond the reach of man, to form any adequate, or particular ideas. We muſt leave the diſcovery of this, as alſo of the natural or ſenſitive pleaſures, which the ſaints will enjoy in Heaven, till we have done with the body. Where the ſcripture mentions theſe things, it is in <hi>figurative,</hi> or <hi>metaphorical</hi> language. <hi>Heaven,</hi> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as a <hi>city,</hi> the ſtreets and gates of which, are made of <hi>gold,</hi> and exquiſite <hi>pearl</hi>: And <hi>Hell,</hi> as a place of fire and burning. If the <hi>one</hi> deſcription be <hi>figurative,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> may be ſuppoſed to be ſo likewiſe.</p>
            <p>The principal idea conveyed to us in theſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is, that the happineſs of the ſaints, and miſery of ſinners, and the means of promoting it, will be very great: But there is not the leaſt degree of probability, that like the operation of fire on the human body, the ſenſitive pain of the wicked will be ſuch, as to deſtroy <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>reflection,</hi> any more than <hi>exiſtence</hi>: On the other hand, it is far more rational, and ſcriptural to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>intellectual powers</hi> will be left in <hi>full force,</hi> and the <hi>moral affections</hi> be in <hi>conſtant action</hi>; and that, at leaſt <hi>one</hi> part of the unhappineſs of ſinners, will conſiſt in <hi>theſe affections themſelves</hi>; ſo that the pain and evil experienced by them, may truly be ſaid to be the effect of a <hi>voluntary choice,</hi> and ſuch as the exiſtence of <hi>contrary</hi> affections would deſtroy. And indeed it may be judged, that this is the very <hi>chief</hi> part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin. The little we know of the unhappineſs attending the evil and diſcordant paſſions of men on
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017524_0034_0FA12B7DEF72E578"/>
earth, may ſerve, in ſome degree, to convince us, how vaſtly more intolerable the anguiſh will be, when the like paſſions ſhall come into action, in the other world, without <hi>reſtraint,</hi> and grow <hi>big,</hi> as we cannot now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, and at the ſame time, be accompanied with that mortification and diſappointment, which, where there is no mean of gratification, muſt neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſin, and which the Diety will now ſuffer to exiſt in full force, as its proper and deſerved recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture warrants us to believe, that the future ſtate and condition of ſinners, will be open to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or view of the inhabitants of Heaven. With reſpect therefore to the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſin, I conceive the end, and advantage of it to be this, viz. as the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of ſin, in any ſtate, or degree of it, is adapted, by means of <hi>contraſt,</hi> to make a more exalted exhibition of the nature of holineſs, ſo the exiſtence of it, while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the painful conſequences now deſcribed, and while it nature and tendency, and the manifeſt anger of the Almighty againſt it, are thus diſplayed, will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly adapted to, and by the wiſe direction of God, will in fact produce this effect in the ſtrongeſt manner: Moreover, as the permiſſion, or exiſtence of ſin, was eſſential to the diſplay of the <hi>pardoning</hi> love of God, or any knowledge, or idea of it, among created beings, in like manner the perception of its real tendency and conſequences, will greatly help to enlarge, and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up the view thereof, to the great benefit, not of thoſe who are the ſubjects of future ſin and puniſhment, but of the holy beings in Heaven: For by ſuch a diſcovery of the evil nature, and deſtructive tendency of ſin, the ſaints will diſcover more fully, what they are delivered from—they will diſcover the ſenſe the Almighty has eſpecting the malignity of ſin—they will diſcover what muſt have been the ſtrength in that love in God, which
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017524_0035_0FA12B7EB4963C08"/>
inclined him to pardon it in <hi>them</hi>: By ſuch thoughts, the greatneſs of free grace will be enhanced—the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put on new glory—the crucified Saviour appear in charms more exquiſitely bright, and raviſh his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's hearts:—The angels who are witneſſes to theſe things, will be loſt in wonder—redeeming love be the object of all their thoughts, and "God be all in all."</p>
            <p>From this view then, it ſhould ſeem that we are to conſider the ſtate of ſinners, and their puniſhment in the other world, as a real <hi>good</hi> in the created ſyſtem. And is not this the true light, in which it is conſidered in ſacred writ? wherein we learn, that nothing is done by God, but for a valuable end.—He
<q>overthrew Pharoah and his hoſt in the Red Sea; for his mercy endureth for ever.</q>
And
<q>ſmote great Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever. And ſlew famous Kings; for his mercy endureth for ever.</q>
In the book of Iſaiah, the ſeraphims are repreſented in a view of the judgments of God, to be executed on a ſinful people, as crying unto one another—
<q>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</q>
And in the Revelation made to John the Divine, after Babylon is deſcribed as being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he
<q>heard a voice of much people in Heaven, ſaying, Halleluia. And her ſmoke roſe up for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In what manner now ſhall we account for it, that theſe <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> beings, ſhould be thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in rendering praiſe to God, in the view of his judgments? for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cannot, in itſelf, that is, ſeparate from the idea of its ends and effects, be an <hi>agreeable object</hi> to any <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent, created</hi> mind, any more than to the mind of God, who, as we are told,
<q>delighteth not in the death of the ſinner;</q>
whereas, theſe acts of praiſe, are plainly deſcribed to us as expreſſive of the holy and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017524_0036_0FA12B7F70CB0B08"/>
virtuous manner, in which theſe heavenly and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirits are employed. The only rational concluſion we can draw is, that in their eſtimation, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed on ſinners, are a <hi>good,</hi> becauſe they are among the means, by which, they became more fully acquainted with the character of that perfect Being—. the knowledge of which, is at the foundation of all their happineſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be obſerved by the reader, that but little is ſaid, reſpecting the diſplay of God's <hi>power, truth,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> in the puniſhment of ſinners; or of his <hi>aſſertion of the rights of his government,</hi> &amp;c. It was not the writer's deſign to enter into this ſubject at any great length.— That an <hi>infinitely</hi> holy Being, ſhould poſſeſs <hi>infinite</hi> power, and wiſdom, is of <hi>infinite</hi> importance; and conſequently, it is deſirable, beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that theſe <hi>attributes</hi> ſhould be diſplayed. But ſtill, it is the <hi>holineſs</hi> of the Deity, or his <hi>moral</hi> perfections, which are the principal objects to be rejoiced in: And it is the love which the ſaints have for <hi>theſe,</hi> which makes his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and every other <hi>natural at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,</hi> appear <hi>glorious.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the advantages reſulting from puniſhment in a general view of it, let us next enquire in particular, how the matter ſtands, with reſpect to <hi>eternal</hi> puniſhment.—It may be argued thus—The puniſhment of ſinners, as appears from the foregoing, is <hi>one mean</hi> uſed by the Deity, of more fully illuſtrating the nature of holineſs, and his divine perfections,—the diſcovery of which, is a ſource of joy to the church in Heaven, and in this reſpect, a <hi>good.</hi> Now if the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners ſhould ever <hi>ceaſe,</hi> this <hi>mean</hi> of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the perfections of God, would <hi>ceaſe</hi> at the ſame time, and of courſe the <hi>good</hi> reſulting from it. But as it is not conſiſtent with the character of an infinitely good being, to ſuffer <hi>any mean</hi> of <hi>good</hi> to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> he will therefore never ſuffer this to be the caſe with reſpect to the puniſhment of ſinners, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this puniſhment will never <hi>ceaſe,</hi> but be <hi>eternal.</hi> This may be called rational evidence, drawn from the argument of <hi>benevolence itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:017524_0037_0FA12B802F21FE88"/>If it ſhould be objected, that a long courſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment admitting <hi>end,</hi> will be ſufficient to anſwer all the purpoſes mentioned, inaſmuch as it is in the power of God, to impreſs for ever on the <hi>memory</hi> of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ideas they have once received; I anſwer, that with reſpect to <hi>memory,</hi> or the impreſſion made by any particular event, which is not to occur again, it is known by <hi>univerſal experience,</hi> that it gradually, decreaſes by <hi>time.</hi> The argument from <hi>experience</hi> therefore, is againſt this ſuppoſition. Added to this, it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that in the communication of ideas to created beings, the Deity always has made uſe of means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their nature. When he pardoned ſin, he had a right to have done it, if it had pleaſed him, without an atonement, or the death of his beloved Son. But this important event was tranſacted as a mean, by which his ſenſe of the great evil of ſin might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; to the intent, that the greatneſs of his love in the pardon of it, might the more fully be diſplayed. If then in the communication of pardon and grace, ſo important an <hi>event,</hi> and itſelf conſidered, ſo great an <hi>evil</hi> as the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> muſt be uſed as the <hi>mean,</hi> ſurely we cannot argue againſt either the <hi>propriety</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>means,</hi> in <hi>other,</hi> or the <hi>like</hi> caſes.—It is very eaſy to comprehend, that the puniſhment of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is admirably calculated to continue the exhibition which our Saviour's death made reſpecting the evil of ſin, and the oppoſition of the mind of God againſt it, by which exhibition the wonders of the atonement, and the work, of redemption and free grace, are ſet off, to the greateſt advantage: And thus not only all the things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but all the things in <hi>Hell,</hi> will in this ſenſe, be tending towards the ſame point, and for ever adding ſtrength, though in a totally different manner, to the great work, which Jeſus died to promote.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:017524_0038_0FA12B80EFD77790"/>The reader will here perhaps anticipate another ſentiment of great importance. In every rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception concerning future puniſhment, it is not only needful to contemplate it as a mean of <hi>good,</hi> but alſo to conſider this <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>happineſs,</hi> as far greater, than the evil, or pain, contained in the puniſhment itſelf, and as conſpiring, among other things, to produce the greateſt advantage of the created ſyſtem at large, or all things taken together.—If in the ſyſtem of intelligent, created being, and extending the idea throughout eternity, there will exiſt more <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> than <hi>good</hi> or <hi>happineſs,</hi> it is moſt certainly a melancholy ſyſtem indeed. If there will exiſt <hi>more good</hi> than <hi>evil,</hi> but yet <hi>leſs good</hi> than <hi>might</hi> exiſt, in this caſe, it is an <hi>imperfect</hi> ſyſtem. But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the degree of <hi>evil</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> the ballance of <hi>good</hi> will be the <hi>greateſt poſſible,</hi> in this caſe, it is a ſyſtem which is worthy of God who formed, and created it. In ſuch a view we may well join the celeſtial choir in the triumphant ſong,
<q>Hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion then is, in what manner ſhall we, on the principles already mentioned, and by mean of <hi>ſacred writ,</hi> be able to vindicate the ſentiment, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of the ſyſtem will, on the whole exiſt, unleſs we ſuppoſe that by far the greateſt number of mankind will be ſaved: For it is to <hi>ſacred writ</hi> we muſt have recourſe, in all our reaſonings and proofs, ſince it will be wholly inſufficient to depend on human, conjecture. To ſacred writ let us now apply.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to the number of men which will be <hi>redeemed,</hi> it has indeed been ſuppoſed by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that it will be much <hi>leſs</hi> than the number, which will be <hi>loſt.</hi> This opinion has been partly founded on the declaration of our Saviour, that
<q>many are called, but few are choſen;</q>
together with theſe words, "fear not little flock," and ſome other paſſages to the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017524_0039_0FA12B81AFC0FDA8"/>
ſame purpoſe. A diſcuſion of each of theſe particulars, would be too lengthy for my preſent deſign. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever examines them thoroughly, and in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, will, I preſume, find no reaſon to doubt, that they referred to the times in which they were ſpoken, or the ſtate of things <hi>then</hi> exiſting, or <hi>ſimilar</hi> in kind, and of courſe, that they are <hi>limited</hi> in their ſignification.</p>
            <p>In the 13th chapter of Luke, our Saviour compares the kingdom of God, to a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to a portion of <hi>leaven.</hi> Immediately one ſays,
<q>unto him, Lord, are there, few that be ſaved?</q>
Who the perſon was, or whether the queſtion was put with a friendly or unfriendly deſign, we are not informed of. Our Saviour in reply bids him,
<q>ſtrive to enter into the ſtrait gate,</q>
which certainly <hi>many</hi> ſhould fail of doing; but does not think proper to anſwer his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And why? The parable was ſufficient. As the grain of muſtard ſeed, which, when ſowed, was the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> of all ſeeds, ſhould in time grow to be the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tree</hi> of the kind, ſo that the fowls of the air ſhould find ſhelter in its branches:—And as the leaven, which at firſt was <hi>hid,</hi> ſhould in the end, leaven the <hi>whole meal</hi>; in like manner, the kingdom of God, or the mediatorial kingdom, which at the beginning, and when it was firſt preached, was received by a very ſmall number, compoſing the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſectary in the world, ſhall in the proper ſeaſon, diffuſe its power and reliſh over the <hi>whole</hi> world, and triumph in every place, and be like the <hi>ſtone,</hi> out without hands, deſcribed by the prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and repreſenting this ſame kingdom, which at length became a <hi>great mountain,</hi> and filled the <hi>whole</hi> earth.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive there is abundant reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a glorious time before the end of the world, and general judgment, commonly called the <hi>Millennium,</hi> becauſe it is to laſt a thouſand years; at which time
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017524_0040_0FA12B826E1F01C0"/>
the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and holineſs univerſally prevail.</p>
            <p>The paſſages of ſcripture, on which the proof of this depends, are ſuch as theſe—
<q>All the ends of the world ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee. Pſal. xxii. 27. He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. Yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him: All nations ſhall ſerve him. They ſhall fear thee, as long as the ſun and moon endure, throughout all generations. His name ſhall endure for ever: His name ſhall be continued as long as the ſun: And men ſhall be bleſſed in him; all nations ſhall call him bleſſed. Pſal. lxxii. 5, 8, 11, 17. Every val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſhall be exalted, and every mountain and hill ſhall be made low: And the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough places plain. And the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together: For the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Iſa. xl. 4, 5. Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous. Iſa. lx. 21. They ſhall all know the Lord from the leaſt of them to the greateſt. Jer. xxxi. 34. And they ſhall beat their ſwords into plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks. Iſa. ii. 4. The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain: For the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea. Iſa. xi. 6, 9. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High, whoſe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017524_0041_0FA12B8332844040"/>
kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall ſerve and obey him. Dan. vii. 27.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be preſumed that theſe things have already been accompliſhed. The ſacred ſcriptures inform us of a certain time, when the kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which has exalted itſelf againſt the kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will be deſtroyed, and
<q>Satan be bound a thouſand years, and be caſt into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut up, that he deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years be fulfilled.</q>
This is the ſame period of time refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to in the beforementioned texts. That it will take place before the end of the world, is evident from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the whole account, and among others, from this circumſtance in particular, viz. that the nations of the earth, will then beat their <hi>ſwords</hi> into <hi>plough-ſhares,</hi> and their <hi>ſpears</hi> into <hi>pruning-hooks.</hi> It cannot conſiſtently be ſuppoſed that this will be done, after the earth is burned up with fire. And as a further proof that this ſeaſon will be before the end of the world, or general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are informed that when Satan has been bound a thouſand years, during which time it is, that all this promiſed peace and holineſs is to exiſt, he is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards to be
<q>looſed a little ſeaſon and go out to deceive the nations,</q>
or people,
<q>which are in the four quarters of the earth;</q>
that is, the ſame nations with thoſe beforementioned, or their natural deſcendents; for what other can they be? The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe efforts of the deceiver, we are told, will be the prevalence of ſin in ſo great a degree, as that <hi>a part</hi> of the inhabitants of the earth, will riſe up againſt the <hi>other part,</hi> and there will be the moſt violent diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and contention among them;—an event which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot happen to the righteous after the day of judgment, ſince it is expreſſly declared in ſacred writ, that the appearance of Chriſt at that time, will bring to them everlaſting peace, and deliverance from all
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017524_0042_0FA12B83F8A16408"/>
trouble. In addition to this, according to the order of the ſacred narration, the day of judgment is introduced as an event, which is to <hi>follow</hi> the convulſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order now deſcribed; for after mention is made of the ſignal interpoſition of Heaven in behalf of the ſaints in this conteſt with the wicked, the very next verſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the appearance of the Judge—of the books being opened—the dead ſtanding before him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged out of thoſe things written in the books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works.</p>
            <p>The ſum of the whole ſeems to be this—that prior to the ſecond advent of our Saviour, the kingdom which he hath eſtabliſhed on earth, will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, and overturn the kingdoms of the world, and of Antichriſt, which are oppoſed unto it;—that the glory of it will laſt a thouſand years, in which time holineſs, peace and joy, will prevail, over the whole earth, and continue to the end of the world; or as it is written in the 72d Pſalm,
<q>as long as the ſun, and moon endure, throughout all generations,</q>
except, that after the thouſand years are compleated, it will be partially interrupted for a little ſeaſon, by numbers of perſons becoming ſo corrupt, as to riſe up, and contend againſt the ſaints—which conteſt will be decided by the interpoſition of Heaven, and immediately followed by the reſurrection of the dead, and judgment of the whole world.</p>
            <p>As to the commencement of the happy time we have been conſidering, it has already been hinted, and the ſcripture makes it very evident, that it will be at the <hi>cloſe</hi> of the <hi>reign,</hi> or at the <hi>downfal</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> There would be no difficulty in aſcertaining this period with accuracy, if we knew when to date the <hi>beginning</hi> of his reign, for the whole of it together is to be <hi>a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> or twelve hundred years. As the <hi>riſe</hi> of this kingdom was <hi>gradual,</hi> it is probable its <hi>fall</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:017524_0043_0FA12B84B64E9A68"/>
will be <hi>gradual</hi> alſo. The writers on prophecy are well agreed, that it will be ſome time about the <hi>two</hi> thouſandth year of the Chriſtian aera, and the <hi>ſix</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth year, from the creation of the world.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, the earth was peopled by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only. Two thouſand years elapſed before the flood; but a little part of the world was inhabited; the waters came, and deſtroyed the whole, except Noah, and thoſe who were with him in the ark. By this ſingle family, the earth began to be peopled again; but even in our Saviour's time, only an inferior part of it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and ſickneſs, peſtilence, and war, had in the mean while, ſwept off a vaſt number of its inhabitants, and retarded the increaſe. It is but of late years that America, which is called the NEW WORLD, has been explored, before which time, it was occupied only by the Indians, thinly diſperſed on the ſea ſhore.</p>
            <p>Conſidering now the vaſt increaſe of inhabitants, which probably will take place in <hi>future,</hi> and the great number the whole earth will be capable of ſupporting, when, as it may be expected in the Millenium,
<q>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert will bloſom like a roſe,</q>
which number then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, is ſaid, in the book of Revelation, to be,
<q>as the ſands of the ſea,</q>
there is no manner of difficulty in admitting the belief, that many more, it may be, as ſome writers have ſuppoſed, in even the proportion of many thouſands to one, will live in this <hi>one laſt thouſand years,</hi> called the Millenium, than will live in the <hi>ſix thouſand</hi> preceeding: And as this will be a ſtate of univerſal holineſs, and the falling away afterwards, will be but for a <hi>ſhort ſeaſon,</hi> and this only <hi>partial,</hi> even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing almoſt the whole of thoſe to be loſt who exiſted prior to this time, it may notwithſtanding be the caſe, that many more, and perhaps ſome thouſands to one, will be <hi>ſaved,</hi> than <hi>loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017524_0044_0FA12B8571152F80"/>This ſubject is copious and grand. Can it be thought, when on account of the atonement made by Chriſt, the whole world has been put under his government, and given to his diſpoſal, that in the cloſe of the preſent ſtate of things, he will ſuffer Satan, who has exalted himſelf againſt him, to collect into his own party, the <hi>majority</hi> of mankind? Can it be thought, that the number of the redeemed will be <hi>leſs</hi> than Chriſt himſelf, may be preſumed to judge, to be the moſt for his own honour? Is it not fit alſo, that the great work of man's ſalvation, and the kingdom of our Saviour, ſhould be done, and glorified, in the <hi>ſame</hi> world, in which it has been ſet up, and oppoſed, and thus Satan be conquered on his own aſſumed ground? And once more, may it not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that all this will be ſo performed, and brought into readineſs, as that at the <hi>very firſt general aſſembly</hi> of men and angels, and appearance of Chriſt, the whole work done by him, may be ſeen in perfect glory— every doubt be ſatisfied, and every mind be ſtruck with awe?</p>
            <p>To return now to the point with which I began:— as a ſummary view of the whole that has been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpecting the doctrine of future puniſhment, and the permiſſion of ſin in the moral ſyſtem, I beg the reader to take the following—that it is a mean of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luſtre of holineſs or virtue more fully into view, of explaining the nature of redeeming love, and more gloriouſly illuſtrating the character of the Deity:— That being in itſelf an <hi>evil,</hi> no greater degree of it will be ſuffered to exiſt, than is neceſſary to promote theſe purpoſes, or operate in ſuch a manner, as that the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>good</hi> may be greater than without it, yea the greateſt poſſible: And further, that as in its nature it is a mean of this good, it will never be ſuffered by God to ceaſe, becauſe, if it did, the good thereby effected, would ceaſe together with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:017524_0045_0FA12B862DF6F3D8"/>As explanatory of this, it is ſuppoſed to be very conceivable, that the view of any moral object, is greatly heightened by a view of its oppoſite. By the exiſtence of both <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> in the other world, the total difference of their nature will be perceived: In proportion to the degree in which each of theſe will diſplay its ſtrength, and act out in new force, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt will become brighter and brighter—holineſs will appear in increaſing beauty, and the character of the Moſt High in glory, and in majeſty, more divine. By ſuch knowledge communicated, the Deity, as it were, will approach nearer and nearer to all the holy, and heavenly beings:—By ſuch knowledge received, they will approach nearer and nearer unto <hi>him,</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>one</hi> with <hi>them,</hi> and they become <hi>one</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus will all things be rendered ſubſervient to the great purpoſes of the Son of God, whoſe atonement and buſineſs on earth, which in itſelf was ſufficient for the ſalvation of the whole world, will be better reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than if every individual among men were ſaved; and whoſe victory and triumph over Satan; will be far more compleat, than if the ſerpent had not ſucceeded in any of his temptations on earth, becauſe his very ſucceſs will be to his diſappointment, confuſion, and ſhame.</p>
            <p>What unknown worlds of intelligent beings, will be brought into exiſtence, to behold theſe wonders, we cannot tell. But ſurely if the end, and deſign of all things, and among them, of the exiſtence of ſin, and the puniſhment of it, <hi>be</hi> that the glory of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be unfolded to the view of creatures, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to rejoice. Does both the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> diſcoverable in the <hi>natural world</hi> affect us with delight? Are we not only pleaſed with the cheering rays of each returning ſun—the opening of the ſpring, and the gentle fanning of the zephyrs, but do we ſometimes
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017524_0046_0FA12B86EFBB5C40"/>
with admiration hear the rolling thunder, and ſee the clouds begin to thicken, and the red lightnings play? And ſhall we not admire the ſame diſpoſition of things in ſome reſpects, in the <hi>moral world,</hi> by which not <hi>one,</hi> or a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many</hi> of the attributes of the Godhead are diſplayed, and <hi>beauty</hi> is ſeen cloathed in <hi>glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such admiration then, be your employment, ye friends of Heaven and virtue,—ye people of the Moſt High. Well did the Angels, at only the birth of Chriſt, fill the air with melody, while the wondering ſhepherds heard,
<q>Glory to God in the higheſt; and on earth peace; good-will towards men.</q>
And could the laws of nature be diſpenſed with in our favour, as they were in favour to the ſhepherds, we ſhould hear theſe celeſtial beings ſtill engaged in praiſe, and the hymn go round. But the work, which Jeſus at that time had but <hi>begun,</hi> is now <hi>compleated</hi>: Their ſong therefore is more triumphant, and divine. Yet <hi>yours</hi> ſhall be more triumphant ſtill. When at the laſt great day, the harmony of God's works, and the beauty of his glory will be unfolded, then ſhall you break forth in the victorious ſong—then ſhall you unite with ten thouſand times ten thouſand of like happy beings, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</q>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:017524_0047_0FA12B87B1AA10C8"/>BEFORE I put a cloſe to this writing, I aſk the reader to indulge me in a few remarks, concerning the tendency of the pamphlet, lately publiſhed in favour of Univerſal Salvation.—As it conſiſts of extracts from authors, who can give no account to men, being gone to render their account to an impartial Judge, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler muſt anſwer for them, who, it is to be ſuppoſed would ſend nothing to the <hi>preſs,</hi> but what accorded with his own ſentiments, and he would be willing to defend.</p>
            <p>And without any exaggeration, the doctrine exhibited and recommended, is <hi>this</hi>—There is no crime whatever, which ſhall exclude a man from Heaven;—let him live as he liſts—let him be an enemy to the world—his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—his friends—yea, and his own life;—let him deſpiſe the offered mercy of his Saviour, till death has taken him hence,—by the blood of this Saviour, he ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi>: For although he be informed, that he muſt endure the dreadful weight of a <hi>temporary</hi> puniſhment—yet as <hi>no temporary</hi> puniſhment, can bear any compariſon with <hi>everlaſting happineſs,</hi> which according to the ſcheme propoſed, is to follow, it ſtill remains, that all things taken into conſideration, he ſhall be a partaker of <hi>infinite bliſs,</hi> which the greateſt poſſible degree of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or the moſt horrid crimes, and unſucceeded by a ſingle penitential thought through life, ſhall not be able to deprive him of.</p>
            <p>I have never yet heard, what amounts to but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable anſwer to an objection, which has often been made againſt this doctrine, viz. that its natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in this degenerate world, is to encourage libertiniſm —give the reins to corruption among all orders of men, both in public and private life, and
<q>undermine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the very root.</q>
—Whenever I perceive it to be greatly applauded and eſteemed, it brings to my mind, the following deſcription of Iſaiah, concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017524_0048_0FA12B886E6B1E20"/>
of Iſrael,—
<q>Which ſay unto the Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, Propheſy not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things; propheſy deceits: Get you out of the way; turn aſide out of the path; cauſe the holy One of Iſrael to ceaſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it ſeems ſtrange, but according to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it is equally true, that the language of God's word, and the addreſs of the Almighty to the very ſame claſs and character of perſons, ſhould <hi>on the one ſide,</hi> be—If ye ſin againſt me, ye ſhall die:—If ye believe not, ye ſhall not ſee life;—ye ſhall drink of the wine of my wrath, and have your portion, where is the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.—<hi>And on the other ſide</hi>—If ye ſin againſt me, and repent not in the preſent ſtate, I will be your friend notwithſtanding;—I will never leave you, nor forſake you—my mercy ſhall reach you, even in hell, and cauſe you to rejoice in my ſalvation: For if ye believe not in this world, ye ſhall participate of everlaſting life, in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the parts of this addreſs collectively,— where is the <hi>threatening?</hi> It is loſt in the promiſe of <hi>good,</hi> which is far greater than the <hi>evil</hi> threatened; and in a complex view of the ſubject, there is in fact no ſuch thing as a <hi>threatening</hi> againſt ſinners, in the whole word of God.</p>
            <p>It may be remarked further—on ſuppoſition the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation ſhould not prove true, it is evident at firſt thought, that the encouragement of it, may in the end, prove a mean of the loſs of many ſouls, the blood of which muſt be accounted for at the bar of God. For judging of human nature by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, it will be in vain to deny, that while perſons can comfort themſelves with the hopes of ſo great a degree of bliſs, as is hereby promiſed to them, and comparatively ſo ſmall an evil to precede, they will be
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017524_0049_0FA12B892E6555A8"/>
much more likely to indulge mental ſecurity, in reſpect to the important article of preparation for another world.—Admitting therefore, that there is only a <hi>poſſibility</hi> that the doctrine is an <hi>error,</hi>—and that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite doctrine, which has been held by far the greateſt part of Proteſtant divines is the <hi>true one,</hi> ought not this very circumſtance to be conſidered as a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the exerciſe of the utmoſt caution, in the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and encouragement of it? If it be an <hi>error,</hi> it is an <hi>error</hi> on the <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> ſide. And,
<q>is he a chriſtian—is he a man—has he the tenderneſs and bowels of a man—does he poſſeſs even humanity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or an equal degree of charity with Dives in Hell,</q>
who will not uſe every poſſible degree of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, leaſt he ſhould be an inſtrument, to ſome one, or more of his fellow creatures, of an injury, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly great?</p>
            <p>I conceive therefore, that every honeſt man, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes the ſentiment, will be free to declare it, and this <hi>plainly.</hi> I take the liberty to add, that ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration will come with particular propriety, and weight from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> It is the work of goodneſs, and love. "Watchman! what of the night?" Every good ſpiritual guide of the flock of Chriſt, when he perceives danger near, immediately gives the alarm. "Watchman! what of the night?" It is as the language of the Almighty—as the voice of God, unto Goſpel Miniſters. May it not be ſuſpected, that he, who in the preſent ſtate of things, does not diſcharge this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent office, and lift up his voice againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is either in doubt whether it be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> or if not <hi>publicly,</hi> is <hi>ſecretly,</hi> its abettor, and friend?</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with a belief of its deſtructive tendency, I cannot help aſking, if it be not time for the friends of truth, in whatever ſtation in life, ſeriouſly to realize the evil which has already appeared, and is ſtill like to flow
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017524_0050_0FA12B89EF5D5208"/>
from it in many places, and particularly in this town. If we believe in the doctrine of the immortality of the ſoul, with what importance do the things of futurity, preſent themſelves to us?—Eternity! how vaſt the idea! And ſhall any thing ariſe, which will probably injure the eternal intereſt of thoſe around us? The leaſt we can do, is to inform them of their danger, and by every proper method, endeavour to counteract the meaſures by which it is brought.</p>
            <p>Happy is the conſideration, that in every time and circumſtance, we may addreſs our prayer to Heaven. O Thou unto whom the great work of ſalvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <head>APPENDIX, In Anſwer to a late Letter, entitled, DIVINE GLORY BROUGHT TO VIEW, In the FINAL SALVATION of all MEN. Addreſſed to the Writer of this Pamphlet.</head>
            <p>IT is ſuppoſed by the author of this letter, that the writer of the foregoing ſheets, believes that God earneſtly deſires the ſalvation of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of the human race, meaning by this deſire, as he apparently explains it, not barely a pleaſure in the ſalvation of his creatures, as an object in itſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which is readily allowed, but an abſolute choice reſpecting the accompliſhment of the event, all things taken into conſideration. To this it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the ſuppoſition is a miſtake. There is no ſuch ſentiment contained in the explanation given to 1 Tim. ii. 3. or in any page of the pamphlet; but the very contrary is moſt clearly expreſſed, eſpecially in the laſt part, wherein the deſign of future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conſidered. In evidence of which, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reader is chearfully appealed to. The inference which this author draws from the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the conſequential incoherence he endeavours to point out, is therefore without foundation, and is ſet aſide. The ground of the miſconception of this Gentleman ſeems to be, that he has blended together in his own mind the interpretations of 1 Tim. ii. 3. and 1 Tim. iv. 10. as if they had been treated of as implying one and the ſame thing; whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is conſidered in a limited ſenſe, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017524_0052_0FA12B8B6D69FA00"/>
by the apoſtle to be an anſwer to the Jews, who were diſpoſed to believe that ſalvation was to be confined to their own nation, excluding all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, people, or claſſes of men.</p>
            <p>As to the other particular objected againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the atonement of Chriſt, is ſufficient for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, including every individual perſon, as the offer of ſalvation to all men is a proof of, and yet that every individual perſon will not be ſaved, an anſwer may already be found to it in this book. The deſign of the atonement was, that the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, might appear to be a work of grace. In order to illuſtrate this, Chriſt Jeſus magnified the law, and made it honourable. This being done, the mercy of God, became as open to the whole world, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of it. The whole world was put under the Mediatorial government, in conſequence of which and as the means of furthering the deſigns of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it has come to paſs, that every perſon on earth enjoys even his temporal benefits. Now, if the puniſhment of a certain number of men, who actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will, and God foreknew would remain impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will be for the beſt on the whole;—or, if in the way of vindictive juſtice, the future manifeſtation of the mind of the Deity, reſpecting the vaſt evil of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting and trampling on divine grace, will be one mean, by which the greatneſs of this grace, and God's ſenſe of its greatneſs, will be illuſtrated, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidently affirms, how can it poſſibly appear, as the writer of the letter intimates, that the doctrine of a compleat mediation or atonement, implies in it, that the deſign of God, in ſending his Son into the world, is in a meaſure diſappointed, and the ſucceſs of Chriſt in the Mediatorial undertaking, is fruſtrated or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed?—There is therefore no manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſuppoſition, that "<hi>univerſal redemption,</hi>"
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017524_0053_0FA12B8C312D4778"/>
or as it might perhaps be better expreſſed, that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal atonement</hi> "neceſſarily infers <hi>univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;" but the idea, that the atonement is ſufficiently full and compleat to anſwer a general offer of mercy, in conſequence of which atonement, the mercy of God is as readily opened to all men as to a number only, and which is the chief or ſpecial ſenſe in which, as allowed in the foregoing pamphlet, Chriſt died for every man,—this idea, it is inſiſted on, is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconcileable with the doctrine, that there will be ſome individuals, even all impenitent perſons, and deſpiſers of the goſpel grace, who will finally periſh, and never enter heaven.</p>
            <p>Were it needful to reaſon with this Gentleman on his own principle, which is, that <hi>univerſal atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the exiſtence of which <hi>he</hi> believes, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> or <hi>happineſs,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God is diſappointed in his benevolent wiſhes in ſending his Son into the world, it might be aſked him how he accounts for the future, and vaſt puniſhment, which he himſelf allows? If <hi>univerſal atonement</hi> neceſſarily infers <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> or <hi>happineſs,</hi> does not the acknowledgment of a future, unutterable yet <hi>temporary</hi> puniſhment, ſuppoſe, although in a leſſer degree, the ſame ſpecies of diſappointment? On the principles advanced in this pamphlet, no ſuch diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is conceived of, and an anſwer is offered to every ſuch objection againſt the doctrine of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he who believes that <hi>univerſal atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to which he concedes, infers <hi>univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> becauſe producing in the iſſue, <hi>univerſal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> is inconſiſtent with the doctrine of <hi>eternal</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and yet holds to a <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>unutterable,</hi> though <hi>temporary</hi> puniſhment in the other world, muſt certainly feel that the ſuppoſed difficulty or objection lies on his own ſide, and that the propoſal itſelf, or conception of the difficulty, leaves him chargeable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017524_0054_0FA12B8CF39E3BC0"/>
with the very incoherence, which he imagines to be in the way of his opponent.</p>
            <p>The obſervations of our author, in the beginning of his letter, reſpecting the worſhip of the Deity, are rather too looſe and exceptionable. Surely it is not peculiar to the Univerſaliſts to
<q>bow the knee to a being <hi>intrinſically</hi> excellent, and who would be the admiration of all his creatures, even were guilt and ſuffering baniſhed the creation.</q>
It is enquired of him, how this <hi>intrinſic</hi> excellence of the Deity is to be <hi>known</hi> by creatures, except from the illuſtrations of it by ſome <hi>means,</hi> or what may be called his <hi>works?</hi> The <hi>intrinſic</hi> excellence of God, is the very object to which the writer of this pamphlet would deſire to lead the mind of the reader, the doctrine contained in it being this—that by all the works of the Deity, and by what already has, and will in future exiſt, the divine perfections, which conſtitute this <hi>intrinſic</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, will be illuſtrated in the beſt manner, and the God of glory, love and beauty, be moſt perfectly diſcovered to the intelligent, created ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>The author of the letter under conſideration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he is not a little ſurpriſed at the reception which the foregoing ſheets met with, "even from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who call themſelves CALVINISTS." The writer does not profeſs to have any claim upon the good opinion of others. If the pamphlet has met with their approbation in any degree, he would impute it to the eaſy evidence of the main doctrine, which by ſacred writ, it profeſſes to maintain; and he ſincerely wiſhes he had been much better able to do it juſtice. Our author, however, would chooſe at leſt to put the perſons referred to in mind, that in the article now mentioned, they are inconſiſtent with themſelves, for in the firſt place, it is ſuggeſted, that the pamphlet is not <hi>Calviniſtick</hi>: and ſecondly, it favours of <hi>Fataliſm.</hi>

Among the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this claſs, which the writer of it has at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by him, he can produce Poole, Burkitt, Henry, and Edwards, the laſt of whom is a well known Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, and New England defender of the Calviniſtick doctrines, who in the very article in which this pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is declared by the letter writer to have departed from Calviniſm, are each of the ſame opinion, and profeſſedly believed that the atonement of Chriſt Jeſus, was compleatly anſwerable to the univerſal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of mercy which has been made from Heaven, and yet that ſome men would periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting the fear ſuggeſted, that the writer of this pamphlet is a <hi>Fataliſt,</hi> this alſo is foreign from the ſubject, and is liable to the ſame imputation of fault with the laſt particular adverted to, being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of that mode of conteſt often uſed by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemick writers, when they have been preſſed cloſe by various obſtacles, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> found it difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a favourite ſcheme. It is impoſſible, that a perſon ſhould believe in divine revelation, and be a <hi>Fataliſt.</hi> That men have "no will of their own," in the ſenſe affixed to the expreſſion, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of. Each perſon chuſes and refuſes, loves and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017524_0056_0FA12B8FED453BC0"/>
hates, and is conſcious of it. Should any one aſſert, that men are not moral agents, it would be like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that they have no ſouls. And by the way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually abſurd would it be, to rejoice in the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of wickedneſs, and commit ſin on the pretext, that by the wiſe direction of God, it is made a mean, as the Apoſtle Paul aſſures us, of the enhancing or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of grace. That ſin ſhould be over-ruled for this <hi>good,</hi> is indeed a proper matter of joy. But it is the <hi>good</hi> only, which is the ſuppoſed object of the joy, and this is a virtuous feeling. Sin is an evil in its own nature. To rejoice in it as ſuch, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject and oppoſe the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> which, not by men or angels, but by the power and wiſdom of God, to whom alone the work belongs, it is rendered a mean of illuſtrating. The 6th chap. of Romans, is a complete anſwer to all that is contained in our author's letter on this matter.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the ſum of the doctrine contained in the foregoing ſheets, as relating to theſe ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, is as follows:—That in the government of God, in the moſt extenſive view of it, there is a grand and glorious ſcheme deviſed, the object of which is on the whole the greateſt good—That all events will take place in correſpondency with it, each one having an influence in its place, and becoming a mean of advancing its deſired end—That for this reaſon, even the exiſtence of ſin, among other things, was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the puniſhment of the ungodly will be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted—That man is a moral agent, and being ſuch, is a proper ſubject of blame worthineſs when he ſins— And that the object of the Deity's mind, as to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which he permits, being to illuſtrate his own glorious character, the contemplation of which is the ſource of the moſt refined and exalted happineſs that can exiſt in the intelligent ſyſtem, and which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017524_0057_0FA12B9011EB43D8"/>
in the greateſt degree, therefore he is infinitely worthy the love and adoration of all intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Now, is there any article here mentioned, which does not ſet the character of the Almighty in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable point of light? It is further aſked, is there any one of theſe particulars which being denied, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not alſo an implicit denial of ſome perfection or other eſſential to Jehovah?</p>
            <p>As to the manner in which things come into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, or the ſubject of <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> it was not the writer's deſign to enter into the debate. The object of the Deity's mind, concerning the exiſtence of all events being declared in this pamphlet to be, in a univerſal ſenſe, the greateſt good and glory, his moral character, is of courſe, profeſſedly vindicated, for this is the point which aſcertains it, and proves its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. With reſpect to the other particular, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's firm belief is—That is the true ſyſtem, be it which it will, that without impeaching what are called the <hi>moral</hi> attributes of God, maintain his <hi>natural</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes alſo, and not confounding the idea of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> honours and exalts his <hi>holineſs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him as all grand—all glorious—and all lovely.</p>
            <p>Be this the object of our adoration! Be this the God we love! In regard to the author of the letter now replied to, although this Appendix bears the form of controverſy, the writer wiſhes him to accept his undiſſembling and fervent deſire, that the ſpirit of all truth may ſo influence both their hearts, as that when the deſigns of the Mediatorial government ſhall be diſplayed in inconceivable glory at the reſurrection of the juſt and the laſt great day, they may mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unite in worſhipping the <hi>one true God,</hi> and join with the Prophets and Apoſtles—the ſaints and angels, in ſublimely chanting his eternal praiſe.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017524_0058_0FA12B90AE03F010"/>And if, as Pope ſays, "Whatever is, is right—" much more, if, as the inſpired writers declare, all events will finally terminate in the moſt exalted illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the glory of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> then let it be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate language of every reader's mind, "Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah! the Lord ſitteth King for ever."</p>
