            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few Words of Preface.</head>
            <p>WHereas <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> in his Preface, begineth with a gross Falshood, to wit, that it hath been fully proved that <hi>Quakerism</hi> is <hi>Paganism</hi>; for it never yet hath been proved by him, nor any other, nor ever will be, to wit, That the Religion professed by the sincere and faithful People, called in scorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> is either <hi>Paganism,</hi> or any other thing than real <hi>Christianity;</hi> although there may be some that may be called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but are not owned by us to be our faithful Brethren, even as they are not all true <hi>Christians,</hi> who are so called, nor were they all <hi>Israel</hi> who were called <hi>Israel</hi>; The <hi>Reader</hi> may expect what full store of Lyes he may be entertained with by <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> when the first two Lines of his Preface are such a notorious Lye.</p>
            <p>And as for the Etymology of the Name <hi>Christian,</hi> which, as he alledgeth, one that appears lately in Print, as an Advocate of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> giveth as if <hi>Christianoi</hi> were <hi>Christionoi,</hi> that is, Christ's Asses; he should have given us the Name of that Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that we might have found how truly he hath cited him. It hath been thought that some of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> by way of Reproach, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>evise such an Etymology of the Name <hi>Christianos,</hi> as if it were <hi>Christionos,</hi> i. e. <hi>Christs Ass;</hi> but I judge not that to be the true Etymology of that Name, but that <hi>Christianos</hi> is as much as to say, A Follower of Christ, or one partaking of that heavenly Anointing, which in all Fullness was poured by the Father on Christ, and is derived in various Measures from Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the good pleasure of God, unto all that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:000605_0003_0FA95D71D3311600"/>

And for his supposed Load he hath imagined he hath laid on us, it toucheth us little, and returneth on himself, and will be his own Burden.</p>
            <p>And concerning <hi>Christian Lodowick</hi> his Challenge to the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> it is sufficiently answered, and he declared to be a gross Calumniator.</p>

            <p>WHereas <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> in his late <hi>Address</hi> seemeth to lay great weight on the Opinion of <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> (whom he calleth <hi>Reverend Baxter</hi>) concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I thought fit to Transcribe some few Passages of <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> in a printed Book of his, called, <hi>Directions for weak distempered Christians,</hi> that may be of some service to that injured People, called in scorn <hi>Quakers.</hi> In pag. 142. of that Book, he saith, <hi>From my own Observation, which with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000605_0005_0FA95D72D0AEFF00"/>
thing generally acknowledged by all <hi>Protestants,</hi> That where any Man or Society of Men, err not in a Fundamental Article of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> we ought to have Charity towards them, as our Christian Brethren, if in some other things they are under some Mistakes, and that their Conversation and Practice be free of Scandal. And that I may the more effectually make it apparent, how that by the Judgment of <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> neither <hi>G. K.</hi> nor his Brethren who are of his Faith, are guilty of any Fundamental Errors touching the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> I think fit to transcribe (faithfully) a Passage in his fore-cited Book, pag. 84, 85, 86. where he undertaketh to describe the intire Essence of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> as to the matter of it. <hi>The Foundation Principle</hi> (saith he) <hi>or Fundamental Matter is God the Father, Son and holy Ghost, the secondary Foundation or Fundamental Doctrine, is those Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that express our Faith in God the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost: When we name three Persons as the Object of the</hi> Christian Faith, <hi>we express Names of Relation, which contain both the Persons, Nature and Offices, and undertaken Works; without either of which God were not God, and Christ were not Christ, and the holy Ghost were not, in the sence of our Articles of Faith, the holy Ghost; as we must therefore believe, That there is one only God, so we must believe, That God the Father is the first in the holy Trinity of Persons; that the whole Godhead is perfect, and infinite in Being, and Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness, (in which all his Attributes are comprehended, but yet a distinct Vnderstanding of them all, is not of absolute necessity to Salvation;) That this God is the Creator, Preserver, and Disposer of all things, and the Owner and Ruler of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, most Iust and Merciful, that as he is the beginning of all, so he is the ultimate end, and the chief good of Man, which before all things else must be loved and Sought. Concerning the Son, we must moreover believe, That he is the same God with the Father, the second Person in Trinity, Incarnate, and so became Man, by a Personal Vnion of the Godhead and Manhood</hi> [He omitteth his being conceived of the holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which was needful to have been exprest, it being a great Article of our Christian Faith] <hi>That he was without Original or Actual Sin, having a sinless Nature, and a sinless Life; That he fullfilled all Righteousness, and was put to Death, as a Sacrifice for our sins, and gave himself a Ransom for us; and being buried, he rose again from the dead, and afterward ascended into Heaven, where he is Lord of all, and interceedeth for Believers; That he will come again,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000605_0006_0FA95D741BB21A68"/>
and raise the dead, and judge the World, the Righteous to Everlasting Life, and the Wicked to Everlasting Punishment: That this is the only Redeemer, the Way, the Truth and the Life, neither is there access to the Father but by him, nor Salvation in any other. Concerning the Holy Ghost we must believe, That he is the same one God, the third Person in Trinity, sent by the Fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now, as concerning that judged by <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> the Essence of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> as to the Matter of it, I declare sincerely, without all Equivocation or mental Reservation, in the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sence of the Words, that I have transcribed out of his said Treatise, that I know not wherein I or my Brethren, of my Faith and Perswasion differ from him in any one particular, as to the matter of it, or substance therein contained; the only exception we have, is against that unscriptural Term or Phrase of <hi>Three Persons,</hi> or a <hi>Trinity of Persons,</hi> but we own sincerely, That our Faith ought to be, and is in God the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost, and that these Names are Names of Relation, respecting the Relations, as well as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Offices, and Works of those Three; and this being granted by us, in the sincerity of our Hearts, we are excused or cleared by <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> for whose Memory I suppose <hi>C.

Son, but that they are distinct by a certain Property</hi> (to wit, in their Relative Attributes, as that the Father did beget the Son, and the Son was begotten of the Father, and that the holy Spirit did proceed from both) <hi>for I am not of such precise Austerity</hi> (said <hi>Calvin) that for bare small Words I would contend</hi>; and withall he confesseth, <hi>That the Orthodox antiently did not agree about these Terms or invented Words,</hi> that he acknowledgeth, <hi>were invented since the Apostles dayes, to guard against the</hi> Arrian, Sabellian, <hi>and other Heresies.</hi> And therefore since we are altogether free of these Heresies, and that we detest them from our very Souls, no sober <hi>Christian</hi> will judge uncharitably of us in that respect. And as for the word <hi>Distinct,</hi> if some of our Friends, taking it to signifie distant or seperated asunder one from another, as in remote and distant places, have refused it, in this and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as indeed sometimes, at least vulgarly it doth so signifie, as when we say, <hi>America</hi> is distinguished from <hi>Europe,</hi> by a great &amp; spacious Sea interveening, they ought not to be accused for so doing, seeing in that other sence of the word <hi>Distinct,</hi> that is more in use among Schollars, as when we say, Things are distinct when the one is not the other, they own a <hi>Distinction,</hi> as that the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, (though he is our Father, and is, expresly call'd in Scripture the <hi>Everlasting Father</hi>) and Christ's Manhood and Body is not the Godhead, and yet one Christ; as the Body of a Man is not his Soul, and yet Body and Soul is one Man; and in this second sence we do allow the word distinct. And as to the Manner of receiving the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> we grant with him, <hi>first,</hi> That it must not only be received, as true, into our Understanding, by a special divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that is supernatural, but must be imbraced by the Will, Heart and Affections, as good, yea, exceeding good, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, by a special divine Motion, and working of the holy Spirit, that is supernatural, in &amp; upon the Will, Heart and Affections: 2<hi>dly,</hi> That as touching all the peculiar Mysteries and Doctrines of Faith, the Scriptures have been Instrumental, by and together with the immediate working of the Spirit, to beget in us the true Faith of them: But in this we differ, I suppose, from him, as well as from <hi>C.

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000605_0008_0FA95D7A30861E80"/>
That the Spirit of God worketh in Believers, both <hi>Effectively</hi> and also <hi>Objectively,</hi> or by way of sensible Object, or sensibly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly, by its own Evidence and Demonstration to mens Hearts and Souls: And this, divers call'd <hi>Protestants</hi> have acknowledged with us, though denyed by C.

            <p>And if any say, or object, <hi>That if the Spirit worketh by way of a sensible Object, upon the inward and spiritual Senses of Believers, this would make void all use of the Scriptures, as being so much as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Instrumental to our Faith.</hi> But <hi>I Answer,</hi> denying this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and by distinguishing the Object of our Faith, to wit, that the Scriptures are the Instrumental and secondary Object of our Faith, and the holy Spirit the principal and primary Object of our Faith (as it is sensibly felt to work upon our inward and spiritual Senses) together with the Father and the Son: Even as in outward and natural Objects that work upon our outward and natural Senses, some are principal, and others are instrumental; as in our natural sight of visible Things on Earth, as <hi>Houses, Woods, Trees, Beasts,</hi> the Sun's Light is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Object of our sight, but the things are at least the secondary and instrumental Object thereof; or, as when we read on a Book, the Light that we read with is the principal Object, and the Letters of the Book are the secondary and instrumental; and though we cannot see the Letters of the Book without some light, yet we may see light, yea, the Sun himself, if we have good Eyes, without the Book; and so God, and Christ, and the Spirit may be inwardly seen, felt and known, and is frequently seen, felt, known and enjoyed by the inward and spiritual Senses of Believers, without all present use of Letters or Books, when the Knowledge is Intuitive and Sensible. But as for the Doctrinal Knowledge, as we acknowledge it is requisite, in order to bring us to so high an enjoyment of God and Christ, as <hi>Vision,</hi> or <hi>Intuitive Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Intuition,</hi> so we grant, it is commonly wrought in us and increased by means of the holy Scriptures, instrumentally working with the holy Spirit, and that therefore the holy Scriptures are of great profit and service to all Ranks and Conditions of People, yea, to such of the highest spiritual Attainments, while remaining in the mortal Body.</p>

And if perhaps there be any Citations that <hi>C.

the Chapters, Sections, Parts or Pages of them, that may be found here in <hi>America,</hi> I cannot, but with great pains and expence of Time find them out; and I judge I can much better spend my precious time, than in searching of them; and it sufficeth to me, and I hope doth to many others, that according to the best Knowledge I have of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and these most generally owned by them, as Preachers and Publishers of their Faith, of unquestioned esteem among them, and worthy of double Honour, as many such there are, I know none that are guilty of any one of such <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as he accuseth them.

place or fix an absolute Infallibility upon any Man, or Number, or Society of Men since the Apostles dayes; but through Gods mercy we are sensible of our danger of being liable to Mistakes, as well as other men, if we be not duely humble, watchful and careful to keep close and chaste to the pure openings, teachings and leadings of the infallible Spirit of Truth. And we readily grant the great benefit we have by the holy Scriptures, as being instrumental, by and with the immediate working of the Spirit, to preserve us from Error, or if any be overtaken in an Error, and beguiled by the Enemy, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and Restore them there-from; therefore it is, that in all respects we prefer the Scriptures, both to our own, and all other Writings; and if any Doctrine or Practice be found contrary thereunto, upon due and impartial Examination, we say, it ought to be disowned and denyed; for the Scriptures of Truth, and the Spirit of Truth that gave them forth, can never contradict the one to the other.</p>

And that the Scriptures may be call'd the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in a figurative Speech, and also that the True Sense signified in them, is the Word of God, I have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and so I do still; but that the inward Testimony of God in our Hearts, is more properly and immediately the Word of God, than the outward Testimony of the Scripture, I still affirm, with <hi>Augustine</hi> and other antient Writers.</p>
            <p>As for his citing <hi>William Penn's</hi> words agruing against that <hi>same Numerical Body its rising at the Resurrection</hi>; it is clear that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the same exact Number of the small Particles or Dusts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor less than what is commonly buried; and what hurt is there in that? doth not <hi>C.

            <p>And whereas he querieth, <hi>If their Primmer hath yet been corrected, wherein they read, False Teachers preach Christ without, and bid People believe in him as he is in Heaven?</hi> If he mean <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Primmer, as I believe he doth, <hi>I Answer,</hi> Yea, it hath been Corrected, in the folio Edition of his other Treatises joyned with it, as is plainly to be seen, thus, <hi>That false Teachers preach Christ only without, but true Teachers preach Christ both without us, and also within us.</hi>

            <p>As for <hi>Bodily Tremblings,</hi> that they are not so common among these called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as formerly; as good or better Reason can be given, as that these or the like unusual Motions that seized on the Bodies of some <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> about fifty Years ago, are not now so common among them, which the Author of <hi>The fulfilling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> doth plainly acknowledge, was about that time among them; and indeed many of these Tremblings and extraordinary Motions that seized on the Bodies of some <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> &amp; many call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> in these dayes, did proceed in great part, from the small experience of, and little acquaintance that these Persons had at first with that sensible manner of the working of Gods Spirit, and that there were but few at first that could well advise them to bear with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure and quiet of Body that manner of workings, whereas by more frequent Experience, many did, and do at this day, witness, and feel sensibly, not only as great, but oft greater inward Workings of the Spirit of God, on all accounts, and yet can bear them, and most willingly and gladly submit to them, with little or no Observation,

of any Bodily Trembling; for as in going to War, and hearing the dreadful Sound of Guns, Trumpets and Drums, the young Souldiers are oft afraid, even to a degree of Bodily Trembling, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, having more Experience, they feel not either that Bodily Trembling, nor such fear that is the cause of it; and as Water and Fire at its first breaking forth, is more violent, and yet afterwards is fully as effectual, without such Violence; so at the first hearing of Thunder, and seeing the terrible Flashes of Lightning, Persons are much more afraid, than after, when they are more acquainted with it, by frequency thereof; so it might be, and was so, that the Power and Spirit of God did work in former dayes with a more seeming Force upon many, and yet since doth work as effectually, now, and sometimes more without it, so as not to come under such frequent Observation; and yet even Bodily Tremblings are still wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, proceeding from the inward working of Gods Spirit, among us; as the Apostle saith, <hi>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we perswade men.</hi>

And for <hi>Christian Lodowicks</hi> Challenge against our Friends in <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> it is already answered, and they are cleared from his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and our <hi>Christian Religion</hi> sufficiently distinguished from either <hi>Paganism, Iudaism</hi> or <hi>Mahumatism.</hi> And the Exceptions he makes against my Catechism are soon answered, if his Perversions were but detected. 1<hi>st, That some who are left without either the help of the holy Scriptures, or holy Men, do yet so rightly improve the inward help of Christs Light, as to be accepted with God</hi>; This he saith is altogether contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22. But in this, as mostly every where, he perverteth my words and sense; for he hath left out my following words, [<hi>according to the present state</hi>] And what I mean by them I show a little after, <hi>That such who have a measure of sincerity in their Gentile state, but having no Faith in Christ crucified, are but Servants, and not Sons of the free Woman, but are under the Law,</hi> and though accepted so far as sincere in the Servants state, as I proved from <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1, 2, 34, 35. yet not thereby justified as Sons; for I have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>that without the Faith of Christ crucified and raised again</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, none are or can be so justified (yet they are as the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and as the Man-slayer was in the City of Refuge under the Law, till he heard of the Death of the High-Priest) <hi>and such are shut up under the Safeguard of the Law,</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> translates it) <hi>unto the Faith that is afterwards to be revealed,</hi> Gal. 3.23.

and do still grant, see <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Quest.</hi> 10. but how this Faith is wrought in such, is best to leave it until God be pleased further to open it, seeing, as the <hi>Westminster Confession</hi> saith, <hi>God worketh by his Spirit when, where and how he pleaseth</hi>; and as Christ said, <hi>The Spirit bloweth where it listeth,</hi> the <hi>greek</hi> word can well be translated Spirit, and is so by some Translators. 3<hi>dly, That the Principle of the New-Covenant is in all Men,</hi> is not contradicted by <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12. but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. and Christs Parable of the Seed sown in four grounds. And why may not the Seed of the New Covenant lie in the hearts of unregenerate Men for a Season, as the Seed of Wheat may lie not having root in the cold dry ground for a Season, till it be moistened &amp; warmed with the Showers &amp; Sun's warmth in the Spring. 4<hi>thly, That having more Wives than one was unlawful under the Law,</hi> is not contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.45, 48. for altho' Man had but one wife given him at the beginning, yet the Law that permitted such a thing to men, as the like in the case of Divorce came in afterwards. And it is absurd to think that <hi>Abraham</hi> sinned against the Law in his Conscience, writ in his very Nature (and therefore commonly call'd the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> in having two Wives at once; for all sins against the Law of Nature are hainous sins, and of great aggravation, as the <hi>Westminster Confession</hi> acknowledgeth. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such sin is charged on <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that he was in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God at that very time, it cannot be said to be against that Law writ in his Nature, though it be against the Law of the New-Covenant now under the Gospel. 5<hi>thly, That we are to wait in Silence for some aid and assistance of the Spirit, to help us to pray,</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. for as <hi>Peter</hi> commanded <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to pray, so he bid him Repent and Pray; and that he had not the Spirit, was his own fault, as it is the fault of all others (who have it not to assist them, both to wait and pray also) Nor doth mens want of the Spirit, because they depart from it, and resist the gentle Motions thereof, excuse their neglect of Prayer, no more than a mans want of Money excuseth him to pay a just Debt, yet he must not go to pay his debt with false Coyn, no more should a man pray with a Hypocritical Spirit. Nor, 6<hi>thly,</hi> doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. prove that Repentance, as well as Faith, is not a necessary Condition and Instrument of our Justification; for true Gospel Repentance is not the Work of the Law, but of Faith; and his Reverend <hi>R. Baxter</hi> doth hold with the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000605_0018_0FA95E95CE03F3A0"/>
               <hi>Quakers</hi> against him, <hi>That Faith and sincere Obedience are necessary Conditions and Instruments of Iustification, and to teach so, he doth not think Popish,</hi> as doth sufficiently appear by what he hath printed on that subject; see his <hi>Aphorisms of Iustification,</hi> pag. 80. where he saith, <hi>Some Ignorant Wretches gnash their Teeth at this very Doctrine, as if it were flat Popery,</hi> viz. <hi>That Men are justified by Faith, as it is an inward Obedience.</hi> Nor 7<hi>thly,</hi> doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. prove that <hi>Esau</hi> was a Reprobate before he was born, or at any time afterwards; yea, <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> with his <hi>Boston</hi> Brethren, in their former Book, dare not affirm, That <hi>Esau</hi> was a Reprobate, and that men are not born Reprobates, (though some are preferred to others before they are born) but become Reprobates after they have nothing good left in them, is clear from Scripture, that calleth reprobate men <hi>Dross,</hi> after the precious Mettle is extracted from it, and <hi>Chaff</hi> that hath no grain of Wheat in it. Nor 8<hi>thly,</hi> doth <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. prove that <hi>Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is with Water</hi>; for as the Practice of Circumcision, after Christs Resurrection, doth not prove it a Gospel-Precept, no more doth the practise of Water Baptism, but both Christ and <hi>Iohn</hi> did teach, <hi>That Christs Baptism was with Fire and the holy Ghost</hi>; but no where is it said, that Christ baptizeth with Water. Nor 9<hi>thly,</hi> doth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. prove, That Believers may not feed upon Christ by Faith, and so sup with him, and he with them, as well when they eat not, as when they do eat together outwardly, remembring the Lords Death, with Solemn Prayer and Thanks-giving, which we grant is good frequently to be done.</p>
            <p>And thus I have fully answer'd all his frivolous and weak Objections against my Catechism; so that he hath not discovered the least grain of Error in it; nor doth any thing that I have said in my other printed Treatises contradict the Doctrine of my Catechism, as he doth falsly alledge, perverting my words, in most things, to a sence contrary to my mind, or to what they can bear, so far is he from that Candor of giving them a favourable Construction.

M.</hi> and his Brethren, all inward objective immediate Testimony and Revelation of the Spirit. And whereas the Confession mentioneth the inward Work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word (<hi>viz.</hi> the Scripture) in our Hearts. This doth sufficiently prove, That their Confession
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000605_0020_0FA95E974BF26920"/>
doth not mean or intend any inward Testimony of the Spirit, really and properly so called, as having a standing Evidence of its own, but only borrowed from the Scripture, and therefore is no true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evidence at all, but only and altogether improper, yea, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper as if I should say, when I hear but one man give Evidence to the Truth of a thing, and that I read it also in writ from his hand, that three Evidences or Witnesses have given their Evidence to that Truth, as 1<hi>st,</hi> the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>

M. is detected, and G. K. is cleared from being no wise guilty of any Lye in the case. And what I said of <hi>Iohn Owen</hi> is true, for the Title and design of his Book is concerning <hi>The Self-Evidencing Authority of the holy Scriptures,</hi> only he confesseth the Spirits inward Work is necessary to let men see or know it; but that is no proper Witness, more than a mans hearing is one Witness, and the thing heard is another. I do therefore Appeal to all sober, impartial and judicious Readers, Whether not I, but <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> be not convicted of gross Lying or Falshood, and whether the Society he belongs unto, ought not to bring him to Repentance for such Crimes, to use some of his own wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his 5<hi>th Assertion,</hi> he doth also grosly prevaricate, and pervert the state of the Question; for we do not say, That Christ is so in the Wicked or Unconverted as he is in the Saints, but after a far other manner; for he is in the Saints by <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with them, and giveth great and glorious Manifestations of his Glory; whereas in ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his essaying to prove his 16<hi>th Assertion,</hi> he showeth himself extreamly weak, as if because God commanded the <hi>Iews</hi> to keep the <hi>Seventh Day for a Sabbath,</hi> from the beginning of the World, in the fourth Commandment, therefore <hi>he commandeth the Christians in the same fourth Commandment to keep the first Day.</hi> But I need say no more on this Head, but refer him to his much esteemed <hi>Calvin,</hi> for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, who in that doth fully agree with us, as generally do all the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and many in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 17<hi>th Assertion</hi> he is as weak and abusive as in any of the former, That he &amp; his Brethren cannot own true Piety to be essential to a true Minister of Christ, to make a necessary Provision for the everlasting Peace of renewed Souls, which cannot be saved without their Assertion, <hi>viz.

               </gap>on the People of <hi>New-England</hi>; and it is to be feared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this absurd Principle hath too much open'd a Door unto them: And for all your strict pretended Tryal of men, before they enter into the Ministry, do ye try them concerning their Piety? if nay, then
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000605_0057_0FA95EB9CCD03A48"/>
ye open a door to them who may be really Impious, if they have but wit enough to be Hypocrites, and only seemingly Pious, if Yea, this contradicts your Doctrine, who say, <hi>ye have no certain way to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men be really Pious or not</hi>; for ye reject all pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce to a discerning of Spirits, whereby to know who are really Pious, and who not; and the Marks given by <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby to try men, before they be owned to be either <hi>Bishops</hi> (i. e. <hi>Overseers,</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi>) or <hi>Deacons,</hi> were not out-side Marks of Holyness only, that Hypocrites may have, but to be really <hi>sober, just, holy, temperate (Tit.</hi> 1.8.) and where these Virtues are, they do as certainly and infallibly discover themselves in words and works, to the spiritual Discerners, as Spices and precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Perfumes, discover their sweet smell and odour to them who have the right use of their natural smelling.</p>
            <p>And as to his Question, <hi>How People may know whether we have an Immediate Call to the Ministry?</hi> To this I <hi>Answer</hi>; There must be some spiritual Ability or Gift of Discerning in such, who are able to know such a thing; for it is only the spiritual Man that is able to judge of spiritual things; and whomsoever God calleth to the Ministry by his Power and Spirit inwardly revealed (that is immediate) his Power and Presence, according to his faithful Promise, doth go along with them, so that some that hear them, though not all, are the Seal of their Ministry, and the Blind are made to see, the Deaf to hear, the Lame to walk, the Dumb to speak, and the Dead to live, to wit, spiritually. And as this was <hi>Luther</hi>'s answer to the <hi>Papists,</hi> that asked for some Signs to prove his and his Brethrens Call, who did commonly upbraid them, <hi>That they never so much as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ured a Lame Horse</hi>; so it may suffice for our Answer; for whether C. M. believe it or not, we have had the Seal of our Ministry, that many by means of our Testimony have had their inward Eyes opened, and have been turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Light, and from the Power of Sathan unto God; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Change hath had its evident Effects of <hi>Christian Piety, Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> in their outward Conversation. But such who were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hardned against the Spirit of Truth, did not know Christ nor his Apostles and Ministers, and therefore we cannot expect that such can know us. And this Question of C. M. may be easily retorted upon him, that doth so confidently affirm, <hi>That there are so many Ministers in</hi> New-England, <hi>that have and use all true Piety</hi>; let him tell us, how he or they can prove, that they are really Holy, and that their Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

is not a meer outside Holiness, that Hypocrites may have? If he say, they may be known by their Fruits, I query again, <hi>By what Fruits?</hi> Are these Fruits only outward words and works, that Hypocrites may have; for there is nothing barely outward but Hypocrites may have? But if by Fruits, he mean, that which hath some inward Virtue and savour of Life and Grace with them, that do infallibly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselves to be the Fruits of the Spirit, to such as have a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual savour and discerning; as this would contradict their Principle, so it maketh for us, to answer his Question. Nor are there sufficient Testimonies of antient <hi>Christian Writers</hi> wanting, who did agree with us in our Assertion, <hi>viz. That Hypocrites and Vnholy Men, who have not the Spirit of Christ, are not true Ministers of Christ,</hi> as not only <hi>Luther</hi> (whom I cited in my former Book) who calleth them <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Seducers, who know to preach much of Christ; but seeing they feel him not in their Hearts,</hi> (as to be sure, such do not who have no true Piety) <hi>they leave the right ground of the Mystery, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Luth.

And <hi>Athanasius,</hi> in his <hi>Interpretation of the Parables,</hi> saith, <hi>Whoever will do the Work of God, who will teach others, or be profitable unto them, it behoveth him to be in the first place Virtuous, and to receive the Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Acceptation with God. And we see also, in men of Vnderstanding and Reason, the Spirit of God dwells in them, which <hi>Tatianus</hi> describing, useth these words, <hi>The Soul is possessed with the sparks of the Power of the Spirit;</hi> and yet sometimes it is ineffective and unactive, sometimes more, sometimes less, and does no more do its work at all times, than the Soul does at all times understand. Add to this, that if there be in Infants naturally an evil Principle, a Proclivity to sin, an Ignorance and Pravity of Mind, a Disorder of Affections (as Experience teacheth us there is, and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Doctrine of the Church, and the universal Mischiefs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If there were not by Nature some evil Principle, it is not possible that all the World should chuse sin: In free Agents it was never heard, that all Individuals loved &amp; chose the same thing, to which they were not naturally inclined; neither do all men chuse to Marry, neither do all chuse to abstain; and in this Instance, there is a natural Inclination to one part; but of all the men and women in the World, there is no one t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>Gods more near and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate imparting himself to the Soul that is prepared for that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by divine Love, Humility and Resignation, in the way of a vital Touch and Sence, is a thing possible in it self, and will be a great part of our Heaven. That Glory is begun in Grace, and God is pleased to give some excellent Souls the happy Antepast. That holy men in antient Times have sought and gloried in this enjoyment, &amp; never complain so sorely as when it was with-held &amp; interrupted. That the Expressions of Scripture run infinitely this way, and the best of Modern good men, do from their own Experience attest it. That this spiritualizeth Religion, and renders its enjoyments more comfortable and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Ioan Norris, <hi>M. A. and late Fellow of</hi> All Souls <hi>Colledge in</hi> Oxford, <hi>in his Treatise,</hi> Reflections upon the Conduct of Humane Life, Reflect. <hi>2.</hi> N. <hi>9.</hi> pag. <hi>69. saith,</hi>
               <q>The Right and only Method of Inquiry after that Truth which is Perfective of the Understanding, is to consult the divine <hi>Logos,</hi> or Ideal World; for this is the Region of Truth, and here are <hi>hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge:</hi> This is that great &amp; universal Oracle lodged in every mans Breast, whereof the Antient <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was an expressive Type or Emblem. This is † <hi>Reason,</hi> this is <hi>Conscience,</hi> this is <hi>Truth,</hi> this is that <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> so darkly talk't of by some, who have, by their aukward, untoward and unprincipled way of representing it, discredited one of the Noblest Theorys in the World:</q>
[<hi>Note,</hi> If perhaps some have been shore in that thing, yet it hath been well demonstrated by many or most of that People here by him reprehended.]
<q>But the thing in it self, rightly understood, is true; and if any shall call it <hi>Quakerism</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> I shall only make this Reply at present, That 'tis such <hi>Quakerism</hi> as makes a good part of <hi>St Iohn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again, says the same substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Wisdom, <hi>Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither.</hi> And again, <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that follows me</hi> (or as the word more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifies, <hi>he that consorts,</hi> or <hi>keeps company with me) walketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
