            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DR. COTTON MATHER,</hi> tho' Born and conſtantly Reſiding in this remote Corner of <hi>AMERICA,</hi> has yet for near theſe <hi>Forty</hi> Years made ſo riſing &amp; great a Figure in the Learned World, as has attracted to Him while alive, the Eyes of many at the furtheſt Diſtance; and now deceaſed can't but raiſe a very general Wiſh to ſee the Series, and more eſpecially the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick part of ſo Diſtinguiſhing a <hi>LIFE</hi> exhibited. His printed Writings ſo full of Piety and various Erudition, his vaſt Correſpondence, and the continual Reports of Travellers who had converſed with Him; had ſpread his Reputation into other Countries: And when about <hi>Fourteen</hi> Years ago I travelled abroad; I cou'd not but admire to what Extent his Fame had reached, and how inquiſitive were Gentlemen of Letters to hear and know of the moſt particular and lively Manner both of his private Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and publick Performances among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> indeed, as a <hi>REVEREND FATHER</hi> with us has agreably obſerved <note place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. COLMAN in his Funeral Sermon.</note>. — <q>His <hi>Printed Works</hi> will not convey to Poſterity, nor give to Strangers a juſt Idea of the real Worth and great Learning of the Man. His <hi>Works</hi> will indeed inform all that read them, of his great Knowledge and ſingular Piety, his Zeal for <hi>GOD</hi> and Holineſs and Truth, and his Deſire of the Salvation of precious Souls: But it was <hi>CONVERSATION</hi> and Acquaintance with
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003188_0008_0FF0135978ACFCC8"/>Him, in his familiar and occaſional Diſcourſes and private Communications, that diſcovered the vaſt Compaſs of his Knowledge, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of his Piety, more I have ſometimes tho't than all his Pulpit Exerciſes. <hi>Here</hi> He excell'd, <hi>Here</hi> He ſhone; being exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, and bringing out of his Treaſures things new and old without meaſure. <hi>Here</hi> it was ſeen how his Wit and Fancy, his Invention, his Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Tho't and ready Apprehenſion, were all conſecrated to <hi>GOD,</hi> as well as his Heart, Will and Affections: And out of his Abundance within, his <hi>Lips</hi> overflowed, drop'd as the Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, fed all that came near Him; and were as <hi>the choice Silver,</hi> for Richneſs and Brightneſs, Pleaſure and Profit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>EVERY</hi> one who intimately knew the <hi>DOCTOR,</hi> will readily ſubſcribe to this Deſcription. By his learned Works and Correſpondence thoſe who lived at the greateſt Diſtance might diſcover much of his ſuperiour Light and Influence: But they cou'd diſcern theſe only by a more mediate and faint Reflection: They cou'd neither ſee nor well imagine that <hi>extraordinary Luſtre</hi> of pious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Literature, wherewith we were every Day entertained, ſurpriz'd and ſatisfied, who dwelt in the directer Rays, in the more immediate Viſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GREAT</hi> Abilities, and inſatiable Thirſt for all kinds of Knowledge, an extraordinary Quickneſs of Apprehenſion, Livelineſs of Fancy, with a ready Invention and Active Spirit, ſeemed to be the chief Ingredients of his <hi>Natural Genius:</hi> And all theſe being ſanctified in his early Days, indued with a divine Byaſs and turned to the nobleſt Objects; He became inflamed with the moſt ardent Deſires to amaſs unto Himſelf from all ſorts of Writings, an unbounded Treaſure of curious and uſeful Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to find out all imaginable Ways of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it, for the Glory of <hi>GOD,</hi> the Good of <hi>Men,</hi> and the Advancement of <hi>his own</hi> Perfection: Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>So</hi> much <hi>Erudition,</hi> ſuch high Degrees of <hi>Piety,</hi> and ſuch an <hi>Active Life</hi> in doing Good, united in the ſame Perſon, are very rarely ſeen among the Sons of Men. By a tranſient Acquaintance with Him, one wou'd think, that being ſanctified from the Birth, He had made the utmoſt Improvement of his Time in the <hi>PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE:</hi> But upon a further View of the Social Part of his Life, the continual Reſort of Viſitants, with his gentle and eaſy Entertainment of 'em at all Hours, and how He wou'd ſcarce let the Meaneſt or Youngeſt paſs Him without Inſtruction; It ſeem'd as if almoſt all his Time were ſwallowed up with <hi>CONVERSATION:</hi> And yet, being let into a more intimate Diſcovery of his numberleſs and perpetual Contrivances and Labours to do Good in the World; one wou'd then be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he cou'd have no Time left for <hi>Either,</hi> but muſt have ſpent it all in <hi>ACTION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HAVING</hi> made Himſelf an Early Maſter of the Learned Languages, One of the ſpecial <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODS</hi> by which he ſo well improv'd his Time and acquir'd ſuch a vaſt Extent of Science ſeem'd to be; that tho' for his Progreſs in Divine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, He kept to the conſtant Study of the <hi>SACRED ORACLES</hi> in their inſpired Originals, yet for <hi>Other Writings</hi> he cared not to trouble Himſelf with any but thoſe that were likely to bring him ſomething <hi>New,</hi> and ſo increaſe his Knowledge. In two or three Minutes turning thro' a Volumn, he cou'd eaſily tell whether it wou'd make Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the Store of his Ideas. If it cou'd not, He quickly laid it by: If otherwiſe, he read it, paſſing over all thoſe Parts which contained the things he had known before, peruſing thoſe Parts only that repreſented ſomething <hi>Novel,</hi> which he Pencil'd as he went along, and at the End re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Subſtance to his <hi>Common Places,</hi> to be review'd at Leiſure; and all this with wonderful Celerity. So ſhort a Courſe he took to univerſal Science — that as he increaſed in Years, the leſs <hi>Time</hi> he had occaſion to expend in running thro' an
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003188_0010_0FF0135F6B4992D0"/>Author; till at length there were but few Books publiſhed that would take him <hi>much</hi> to read, and many that were celebrated for their various Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he found had little in them but what he had been acquainted with before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOR</hi> were his <hi>Common-Places</hi> the only Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of his rich Ideas: They were but more Securities that He might not loſe them: And He us'd to have them at command on the moſt ſudden Incidents, and in common Converſation, which had therefore always ſomething new, and was ever entertaining and inſtructive. By this means it was that He had the moſt agreable and effectual way of <hi>Reproving</hi> a Friend for what appear'd amiſs, or of <hi>Exciting</hi> to a neglected Duty, that I ever met with. Inſtead of doing this directly, which might have been too Offenſive, He wou'd rather bring ſome Hiſtory or Obſervation in the Form of a pleaſant <hi>Narrative,</hi> which He had ready at hand for all Occaſions; and being extreamly ſuitable, wou'd leave his Friend to the moſt pungent Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> his glowing <hi>CHARITY</hi> and <hi>PIETY</hi> ſpread a further Luſtre on his other Excellencies. His burning Zeal for <hi>GOD,</hi> and fervent Benevolence and Love for <hi>Men,</hi> were continually working in Him, imploying all his Talents, Tho'ts and Cares, by Night and Day, and Breaking forth into num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Projections, and intenſe Indeavours, which waſted and conſum'd his Life. He was an utter Enemy to religious Tyranny and Impoſition: He was of very Catholick and Comprehenſive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: He never valued any particular Forms of Worſhip, unleſs they were of Divine Appointment: But it was the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> of the great Duties of Religion in the <hi>CHRISTIAN</hi> Inſtitution that his Heart was ſet on: And this He was for Propagating, by convincing and moving Arguments, warm Perſwaſions, bright Examples, and by every winning Way that cou'd be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of, agreable to its truly primitive and noble Simplicity, and to Humane Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003188_0011_0FF0136208794020"/>
               <hi>THE following Draughts</hi> will give the Publick an entertaining Specimen of his wonderful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Time, and the various and ſurprizing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods He invented and purſued for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this vital Piety, both in Himſelf &amp; Others. Tho' deliberate in Speech, yet expeditious in Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and having the Pen of a ready Writer, that knew not how to faulter in its ſwift career; He continually preſerved <hi>Records</hi> of the ſeveral Rules and Schemes He formed for his own Direction, and of his diurnal Proſecutions of them. He has by this means left a great Abundance of excellent Materials for his more private Hiſtory: And the Accounts that follow being extracted chiefly from them, are alſo agreable to that Part of his Life which fell under the Obſervation of thoſe who were acquainted with Him; and ſo nearly anſwered to theſe <hi>latent Rules</hi> now publiſhed, that we cou'd not but conclude He had them always in his Eye, tho' we had never ſeen them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HIS</hi> Son, the Compiler having theſe great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, can have therefore no Occaſion to invent any Additions to his Dear Father's Hiſtory. He has rather aimed at <hi>Brevity,</hi> and to write as little upon every Head as poſſible. And indeed, if He had Publiſhed all that his Written Memorials would have enabled him, or that himſelf and others have been Witneſſes of, He had not only ſwell'd the Volumn to too large a ſize for the preſent Age to bear, and thereby hurt its Uſefulneſs; but he muſt have alſo given ſuch a full Account of this extraordinary Perſon as would have exceeded the Belief of thoſe who were Strangers to Him. The very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have rather looked like the celebrated Life of <hi>CYRUS,</hi> and be diſputed by Poſterity whether it were deſign'd and drawn for a mixt Romance, or a real Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> native Fondneſs of a <hi>filial Mind</hi> for a Father's Honour, may give Occaſion for the Reader to ſuſpect, in ſuch a caſe as this, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>BUT</hi> now, Methinks, I have need of ſome good <hi>Apology</hi> for my own Preſumption to Preface the Life of ſuch a Man, and recommend it to the World. I have none but this, — That the now Bleſſed <hi>Subject</hi> of it having been pleaſed to admit me into an happy Intimacy with Him, upon my Return to this my Native Country; I have been thereby too highly obliged — to deny the Deſires of his <hi>Orphan Son,</hi> that I wou'd introduce him thus into the Publick view, and from my own Experience ſay ſo much as may in ſome meaſure move the curious Paſſenger, to turn aſide and look into this reflecting Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and with pleaſing Wonder contemplate the Great Original.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is agreed by <hi>all,</hi> that <hi>Lives</hi> of eminent Men are very profitable, and that the <hi>Writing</hi> of them is of great Uſe to the World; eſpecially if their <hi>Examples</hi> have bin very ſhining, and they have <hi>ſerved</hi> their <hi>Generation according to the Divine Will;</hi> and therefore it is that ſo many <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> have endeavoured to tranſmit thro' Ages down to the lateſt Poſterity the <hi>Lives</hi> &amp; Actions of their vertuous and excellent Friends.</p>
            <p>IT has <hi>ever</hi> likewiſe bin allow'd proper for SONS to communicate to the World Accounts of their good and great PARENTS; to tell what they were, what they have done and ſuffer'd, how they tho't, and on what Accounts others are, have bin, or may be the better for them: I ſay, it has bin look'd upon as convenient for <hi>Sons</hi> thus to <hi>honour</hi> their <hi>Parents; who have bin honoured and highly favoured of Heaven;</hi> for were it otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why are there ſo many Examples in <hi>later</hi>

            <p>ENCOURAGED and animated by the many <hi>Sons of Ingenuity</hi> who have gone before me, and particularly by my own FATHER and GRANDFATHER, who have raiſed <hi>literal Monuments</hi> for their <hi>Parents;</hi> I ſhall now write <hi>the Life of,</hi> I might ſay with Sir HENRY WOTTON, <hi>the</hi> BEST <hi>of Fathers:</hi> I ſhall write it with an inviolable Fidelity and Truth; and I here declare that my Deſign in <hi>this</hi> Book, is chiefly to <hi>glorify</hi> JESUS CHRIST and to <hi>ſerve</hi> HIS <hi>Church: Ac ne</hi> Patris mei <hi>Famae parcerem, ſi ejus Laus cederet in CHRISTI opprobrium &amp; Corruptionem Evangelii &amp; Scandalum Eccleſiae</hi>

AND, altho' his Deſire of Learning was very great and ſtrong, and his Attainments were truly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he was not more noted for theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> than for his early <hi>Piety</hi> and Religion.</p>
                  <p>FROM his earlieſt Days there were ſeveral <hi>good things found</hi> in him. When he began to ſpeak almoſt, he began to <hi>pray,</hi> and practiſed this Duty conſtantly while he was a School-Boy; and, altho' he uſed no <hi>Forms</hi> in Secret, he compoſed ſome for his School-Fellows &amp; obliged them to pray. Before he could write notes of Sermons <hi>in public</hi> Aſſemblies, he commonly wrote what he remembred when he came home. — He read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with ſo much <hi>Ardor</hi> and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, that <hi>fifteen Chapters</hi> a Day divided into three Exerciſes, and nothing leſs, would ſuffice him. — He would moreover reprove his Play-mates for their wicked Words and Practices.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

The Reſult of all was, that he finally pitched upon <hi>this Method.</hi> The Meditation conſiſted of two Parts: In the <hi>firſt,</hi> He proceeded more <hi>doctrinally,</hi> to <hi>inſtruct</hi> himſelf either with anſwering a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> or with explaining a <hi>Scripture,</hi> or with conſidering the <hi>Cauſes, the Effects, the Adjuncts, the Oppoſites</hi> and <hi>Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances</hi> of the Thing that was his <hi>Theme.</hi> — In the <hi>ſecond</hi> Part, he proceeded more <hi>practically</hi> to affect himſelf in three Steps; <hi>firſt,</hi> an <hi>Examination</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>next,</hi> an <hi>Expoſtulation</hi> with himſelf and <hi>laſt,</hi> a <hi>Reſolution</hi> in the Strength of Grace offered in the new Covenant.

                  <p>I am convinced of the utter Inſufficiency in my own <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to procure my <hi>Salvation.</hi> I ſee my own <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to be <hi>nothing</hi> in point of Acceptance with GOD. I ſee a woful <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> has acted me, <hi>Sluggiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me, in the very beſt of all my Services.</p>
                  <p>I perceive now no other way for my <hi>Salvation,</hi> but only by the Lord JESUS CHRIST; <hi>Refuge</hi> ſails elſewhere on every Hand.</p>
                  <p>I behold a <hi>Fulneſs</hi> &amp; a <hi>Beauty</hi> in JESUS CHRIST; HE is worth loving, worth prizing, worth <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is my Deſire to obtain an Intereſt in HIM, and make HIM the only Portion and Support of my Soul, that it is one of my greateſt Griefs, to find my Heart ſo dull in going forth after HIM.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Concerning my <hi>Love.</hi>

                  <p>I long to ſee and know the <hi>Favour of GOD</hi> unto me; the ſight of <hi>That</hi> would make all my Afflictions light.</p>
                  <p>I deſire to be as active as may be in promoting the <hi>Honour</hi> of GOD; and I ſeldome come into any

                  <p>I am ſorry, that I <hi>love</hi> GOD no more.</p>
                  <p>The Saints, that have the Image of GOD, are thoſe whom I value moſt.</p>
                  <p>A Mean Perſon with <hi>Grace</hi> is more amiable to me than another who is otherwiſe never ſo well qualified, but <hi>Graceleſs</hi> — There are ſome other of his <hi>Examinations,</hi> when in <hi>Younger</hi> Years and in <hi>advanced,</hi> which you will find in the 6th Chapter of this Book: I brought this one in here, as a Specimen of his early Senſe of Religion.</p>

                  <p>HAVING a Principle of <hi>Good-Will</hi> to Man deeply rooted in his Soul, he was <hi>very ſoon</hi> and very ſtrongly deſirous that it might grow and flouriſh, and that others might be the better for it.</p>
                  <p>HE firſt ſet himſelf to contrive what Good he might be able to do in his <hi>Father's Family,</hi> by inſtructing his Brethren and Siſters, and by exhorting the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>HE anon proceeded to impoſe it as a Rule upon himſelf, never to come into any Company where it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003188_0033_0FF0139EB28ADBA8"/>might be proper for him to <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> but he would, if poſſible, ſo order it that <hi>it</hi> might be ſerviceable to the Company; and, he ſaw the Fulfilment of that Promiſe, <hi>To him that has ſhall be given:</hi> For, upon his faithful Improvement of his Talents, He found his LORD and Maſter went on and multiplied his <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,</hi> untill he came to ſerve whole <hi>Churches, Towns and Countries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM his own happy <hi>Experience</hi> therefore, when he was advanced in Age, he would often adviſe <hi>Young Men,</hi> to contrive and ſtudy as early as poſſible <hi>to do Good,</hi> to love it and to account it a noble Thing. While <hi>We</hi> and our <hi>Opportunities</hi> are but <hi>ſmall,</hi> he would have us <hi>invent</hi> as many ways as we can to be ſerviceable: He would not have us impertinent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt or oſtentatious in our Eſſays; but would have us with humility, and yet with Readineſs, <hi>begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> with our <hi>ſmall Stock,</hi> and expect that, before we have done, GOD will do <hi>great things</hi> for us as well as by us.

                     <p>As now, I was Owner of a <hi>Watch,</hi> which I was fond of for the Variety of <hi>Motions</hi> in it.

Quickly after this there came to me a Gentlewoman, from whom I had no Reaſon to expect ſo much as a Viſit: But in her Viſit, ſhe, to my Surprize pray'd me to accept, as a Preſent from Her, a <hi>Watch,</hi> which was indeed preferible to that, with which I had parted.

7. I will conclude Sect. 4. with reciting ſome <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Rules,</hi> which He obſerved in the <hi>Education of his Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. HE pour'd out continual <hi>Prayers</hi> to the <hi>GOD of all Grace</hi> for <hi>them,</hi> That HE would be a <hi>Father</hi> to them, beſtow HIS <hi>Son</hi> &amp; <hi>Grace</hi> upon them, <hi>guide them</hi> by his <hi>Counſel</hi> and bring them <hi>to Glory.</hi> And in this Action, He mention'd them <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> every one by <hi>Name,</hi> to the LORD.</item>
                     <item>2. HE began betimes to entertain them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful <hi>Stories,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Scriptural</hi> ones: And he would ever conclude with ſome <hi>Leſſon of Piety;</hi> bidding them to learn that <hi>Leſſon</hi> from the <hi>Story.</hi>
                        <p>AND thus every Day at the <hi>Table,</hi> He uſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to tell ſome entertaining <hi>Tale</hi> before he roſe; and endeavor to make it uſeful to the <hi>Olive-Plants about the Table.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. WHEN his Children accidentally at any Time came in his way, it was his Cuſtom to let fall ſome <hi>Sentence</hi> or other, that might be monitory or profitable to them.
<p>THIS Matter occaſioned Labor, Study and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. HE betimes try'd to engage his Children in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of <hi>Piety;</hi> and eſpecially <hi>ſecret Prayer:</hi> For which he gave them very plain and brief Directions, and would ſuggeſt unto them the <hi>Petitions</hi> which he would have them make before the LORD, and which he would therefore explain to their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Capacity. And he would often call upon Them; <hi>Child, Don't you forget every Day to go alone and pray as I have directed you.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. HE betimes endeavored to form in his Children a Temper of <hi>Benignity.</hi> He would put them upon doing <hi>Services</hi> &amp; <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> for one another, and for other Children. He would <hi>applaud</hi> them when he ſaw them delight in it. He would <hi>upbraid</hi> all Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003188_0038_0FF013AC9D3CAE20"/>to it. He would Caution them exquiſitely againſt all <hi>Revenges of Injuries,</hi> and would inſtruct them to return <hi>good</hi> Offices for <hi>Evil</hi> ones. He would ſhow them, how they would by this <hi>Goodneſs</hi> become like the Good GOD and the bleſſed JESUS. He would let them diſcern he was not ſatisfied, except when they had a <hi>Sweetneſs of Temper</hi> ſhining in them.</item>
                     <item>6. AS ſoon as poſſible, he would make the Children learn to <hi>Write:</hi> And when they had the Uſe of the Pen, he would employ them in Writing out the moſt inſtructive and profitable Things he could invent for them. In this way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </list>
                  <p>HE would firſt beget in them an high Opinion of their <hi>Father's Love</hi> to them, and of <hi>his</hi> being beſt <hi>able to judge,</hi> what ſhall be good for them.</p>
                  <p>THEN he would make them ſenſible, it was Folly for them to pretend to any <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> or <hi>Will</hi> of their own: They muſt reſign all to <hi>Him,</hi> who would be ſure to do what is <hi>beſt; his Word</hi> muſt be <hi>their Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HE would cauſe them to underſtand, that it is an <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>ſhameful</hi> Thing <hi>to do amiſs.</hi> He would aggravate this on all Occaſions; and let them ſee how <hi>amiable</hi> they will render themſelves by <hi>well-doing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>firſt Chaſtiſement</hi> which he would inflict for any ordinary Fault, was <hi>to let the Child ſee and hear him in an Aſtoniſhment,</hi> and hardly able to believe that the Child could do ſo <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HE would never come to give a Child a <hi>Blow,</hi> except in caſe of <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> or ſomething that is very <hi>criminal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO be <hi>chaſed for a while out of his Preſence,</hi> he would make to be look'd upon as the ſoreſt Puniſhment in his Family.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003188_0039_0FF013AEE3B8E5C0"/>
HE would with all poſſible Inſinuations come upon them to gain this Point, That <hi>to learn all great Things, was the nobleſt Thing in the World.</hi> He was not fond of propoſing <hi>Play</hi> to them as a <hi>Reward</hi> of any diligent Application, to learn what is good; leſt they ſhould think <hi>Diverſion</hi> to be a better and nobler thing than <hi>Diligence.</hi> He would have them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and expect at this rate, <hi>I have done well; and now I will go to my Father, who will teach me ſome thing curious for it.</hi> He would have his Children account it a <hi>Privilege</hi> to be <hi>taught;</hi> and would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manage the matter ſo, that <hi>Refuſing to teach</hi> them ſomething ſhould be looked upon as a <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Strain of his <hi>Threatnings</hi> therefore was; <hi>You ſhall not be allowed to read, or to write, or to learn ſuch a thing, if you do not as I have bidden you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Slaviſh</hi> way of <hi>Education,</hi> carried on with <hi>Raving</hi> &amp; <hi>Kicking</hi> &amp; <hi>Scourging</hi> (in <hi>Schools</hi> as well as <hi>Families</hi>) he looked upon as a dreadful Judgment of GOD on the World; he tho't the <hi>Practice</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and expreſs'd a mortal Averſion to <hi>it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. THO' he found a vaſt, a wonderful Advantage in having his Children ſtrongly byaſſed by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Reaſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Honour;</hi> (which he obſerved that Children will feel and underſtand ſooner than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tho't for;) yet he would not neglect any Means and Endeavours to have <hi>higher Principles</hi> infuſed into them.</p>
                  <p>HE would therefore betimes <hi>awe</hi> them with the ſenſe of the <hi>Eye of GOD</hi> upon them in the <hi>Ways</hi> which they <hi>take.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HE would ſhow them how they muſt <hi>love our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST; and how they muſt <hi>demonſtrate</hi> it, by doing what their Parents require of them.</p>
                  <p>HE would often tell them of the <hi>good Angels,</hi> who love them, help them, guard them from Evil and do many good Offices for them; who likewiſe take a very diligent Notice of them, and ought not in any meaſure to be diſobliged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003188_0040_0FF013B148BE53B8"/>
HE would not ſay much to them of the <hi>evil Angels,</hi> becauſe he would not have them entertain any fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fancies about the Apparitions of <hi>Devils:</hi> But yet, he would briefly let them know, that there are <hi>Devils,</hi> who tempt them to Wickedneſs, who are glad when they do wickedly, and who may get leave of GOD to kill them for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HEAVEN</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> he ſet before them clearly and faithfully, as the Conſequences of their good or bad Behaviour here.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. WHEN the <hi>Children</hi> were <hi>capable</hi> of it, he would take them <hi>alone</hi> one by one; and after many affectionate, loving, ſtrong <hi>Charges</hi> unto them, to fear GOD, to ſerve CHRIST and ſhun <hi>Sin;</hi> he would <hi>pray with them</hi> in his Study, and make them the Witneſſes of the Agonies and Strong Cries, with which he, on their behalf, addreſſed the Throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. HE found much Benefit, by a particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> the Children, ſo of carrying on the <hi>Repetition</hi> of the public Sermons unto them.</p>
                  <p>THE Anſwers of the <hi>Cathechiſm</hi> he would explain, with Abundance of brief <hi>Queſtions</hi> which make them to take in the whole meaning; and he found by this Way that they did ſo.</p>
                  <p>AND when the <hi>Sermons</hi> were to be <hi>repeated,</hi> he choſe to put every <hi>Truth</hi> into a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with <hi>Yes</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> In this way he would awaken the <hi>Attention</hi> as well as enlighten the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his Children. And in this way he would take the Opportunity to ask, <hi>Do you deſire ſuch or ſuch a Grace of God?</hi> And the like: And in this way, he had Opportunity to <hi>demand,</hi> and perhaps to <hi>obtain</hi> their <hi>early</hi> and frequent (and why not <hi>ſincere?</hi>) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> unto the glorious Articles of the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> He tho't the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> might fall upon them in this Action, and they might be ſeiz'd by HIM and held as HIS Temples thro' Eternal Ages.

                  <p>I ſhall here give you the <hi>Rules</hi> he obſerved in <hi>Converſing:</hi> They may be ranked under three Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> HE would not affect <hi>Loquacity</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, but, on the contrary, much <hi>Deliberation.</hi> The <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> accompanying ſuch a Caution, he beheld as of greater Conſequence to one in all Companies, than the Reputation of <hi>Wit;</hi> which by a greater <hi>Volubility</hi> of Tongue might eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: And beſides he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>membred <hi>in many Words there wants not Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> HE would ſtudiouſly decline to utter any thing, that he foreſaw might be <hi>uſeleſs;</hi> and much more, every Thing that might be <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> to be uttered. It was his Ambition every where to ſpeak <hi>uſefully,</hi> and ſay only thoſe Things that one or other might be the <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> HE would, with all the nice <hi>Contrivance</hi> imaginable, improve Opportunities to ſay ſomething or other, that might particularly ſet off <hi>ſome Glories</hi> of his LORD: He would every where contrive, if it were poſſible, to let fall ſome Sentence or other, by which high Tho'ts of CHRIST might be raiſed in thoſe that heard Him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THINKING his <hi>Charitable Diſburſements</hi> may moſt ſuitably be reſerved for the next Chapter; I ſhall only here give you his <hi>private Sentiments of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs</hi> in his own Words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I am not unable with a little Study to write in <hi>ſeven Languages:</hi> I feaſt my ſelf with the Sweets
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003188_0043_0FF013B931D3A550"/>of all the <hi>Sciences</hi> which the more polite Part of Mankind ordinarily pretend unto. I am entertained with all kinds of <hi>Hiſtories</hi> ancient and modern. I am no ſtranger to the Curioſities, which by all ſorts of Learning are brought unto the curious. Theſe <hi>Intellectual</hi> Pleaſures are far beyond any <hi>Senſual</hi> ones.— Nevertheleſs, all this affords me not ſo much Delight as it does, to relieve the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of any one poor mean miſerable Neighbour; and much more, to do any extenſive Service for the Redreſs of thoſe Epidemical Miſeries under which Mankind in general is languiſhing, and to advance the Kingdom of GOD in the World.</q>— His pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conduct was conſonant with his Sentiments.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. IT was his watchful Deſire and Study, never to maintain a <hi>perſonal Quarrel</hi> with any Man breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but rather deny himſelf of his Humor, his Eſteem, — or any Thing in the World. His Reaſon was, becauſe no Man can manage a <hi>perſonal Quarrel</hi> without loſing abundance of precious <hi>Time,</hi> which may be laid out infinitely better in the Service of CHRIST and his Church; beſides a deal of inevitable <hi>Sin,</hi> which will inſinuate it ſelf into every <hi>perſonal Quarrel,</hi> by which one's internal Peace is broken. And further, ſince we have but a <hi>ſhort Time</hi> to live in the World, He tho't it fooliſh to throw away any of it in Squabbles.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. CONSIDERING that for Men, even <hi>good Men</hi> to <hi>ſpeak Evil</hi> one of another, is a very evil Thing—He tho't it would be a conſiderable Service to ſeek the Suppreſſion of that Vice or any Vergencies to it in himſelf. Wherefore, after Flights to his JESUS for Strength to <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Perform,</hi> he made theſe Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
                  <p>THAT he would never ſpeak <hi>falſely</hi> of any Man; and that if he ſpake <hi>Evil</hi> of any Man, it ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Limitations and Regulations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003188_0044_0FF013BACA528848"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT He would keep a <hi>Charity</hi> for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom he ſpoke, wiſhing moſt heartily that <hi>all Good</hi> might be ſpoken of him; and he would from <hi>Charity</hi> ſpeak <hi>to</hi> thoſe when with them; — always thinking, <hi>Whether what</hi> he <hi>ſaid might be for the Benefit of the Hearers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> IF He <hi>ſpoke</hi> what was <hi>Evil</hi> of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he would carefully watch over his Heart, that he did not utter it <hi>with Delight:</hi> He would manage it with Brevity and Averſion, as a very ungrateful Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> WHEN he muſt, or was obliged to <hi>ſpeak</hi> what is <hi>Evil</hi> of any Man, if he knew of any <hi>Good</hi> that could be ſpoken of him, he would beſure to balance the <hi>Evil</hi> with the mention of the <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> BEFORE he would <hi>ſpeak Evil</hi> of a Man, he would conſider whether he ſhould not firſt <hi>ſpeak</hi> to him; and, be it how it will, he would ordinarily, <hi>ſpeak</hi> nothing, but what he ſhould chearfully and contentedly ſay in the Hearing of the Man of whom he is talking.</p>
                  <p>AND, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> HE would aggravate nothing; and when he <hi>ſpoke</hi> of an <hi>Evil</hi> would not make it worſe than it was.</p>
                  <p>THESE Rules he conſcientiouſly obſerved.—Would to GOD, others were ſo careful as to take a due No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. BECAUSE he did not love to be diſturbed with <hi>tedious &amp; impertinent Viſiters,</hi> and becauſe his <hi>Friends (Amici Temporis Fures)</hi> might ſometimes <hi>unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably</hi> interrupt him, he wrote over his <hi>Study Door</hi> in Capitals, BE SHORT. And yet, let him be ever ſo buſy when a Friend came to ſee him, he threw all by, He was <hi>perfectly eaſy,</hi> with pleaſure communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Obſervations he had lately met with, and was ſo very obliging that, altho' his Friends knew his hurry and great Buſineſs, they knew not how to leave Him.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003188_0045_0FF013BE20046170"/>
8. HE would rarely ſee a torn Leaf of a <hi>Bible</hi> in the Street, but would take it up with ſome particular Mark of Reſpect; not knowing but he might find ſome <hi>ſpecial Admonition.</hi> This he found a very <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. WHEN he <hi>rode</hi> abroad, He would moſt commonly take ſome young Gentleman with him, with whom he us'd to <hi>pray</hi> in private at their Lodging in Inns and Gentlemen's Houſes, and unto whom he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in all poſſible ways to recommend <hi>Religion</hi> with the ſweet and eaſy, but ſtrong Charms of it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. WHEN he went into any conſiderable Towns, he would for the moſt part beg <hi>Play-Days</hi> for the Boys; and, as a Condition for their being excuſed from School, he would enjoyn ſome <hi>Religious Task</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. IF he heard that any Perſon had done him <hi>wrong</hi> in Word or Deed, he would ſeldom let him know that he had any Knowlege of it. The beſt Way he tho't was to <hi>forgive</hi> the wrong and bury it in <hi>Silence.</hi> For beſides the Conſideration due to the <hi>internal</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage reaped by ſuch Chriſtianity, there is <hi>this</hi> to be conſidered; Such is the <hi>Malignity</hi> in the moſt of Men, that they will <hi>hate</hi> you only becauſe they know they have <hi>wronged</hi> you. They will, as far as they can, <hi>juſtify</hi> the wrong they have done you; and becauſe they imagine you owe them a like <hi>wrong,</hi> they will bear a confirmed <hi>Spite</hi> to you. But he found the beſt way was <hi>Patience</hi> &amp; <hi>Silence;</hi> the Conſequence of which has been, thoſe who <hi>wronged</hi> him became his <hi>beſt Friends</hi> afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. I was going to relate ſome other <hi>Rules of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and alſo to tell the Methods which he kept to, to <hi>preſerve</hi> Health.

13. I will conclude this Section and Chapter with an Account of <hi>two</hi> Books in which he was writing conſtantly.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt was his <hi>Quotidiana</hi> (as he call'd it) or <hi>Common-Place Book;</hi> in which he wrote along the remarkable Paſſages in any Author as he read him; but for fear he ſhould be at a loſs in finding any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, entred as he found it, he therefore number'd every Quotation, and at the End of his Book had an <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>Names, Things,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that he could preſently have Recourſe to the Sentences he wanted.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>other</hi> Book was his <hi>Diary;</hi> in which he kept an Account of the moſt conſiderable Articles in which he had <hi>done</hi> his Duty, as well as thoſe in which He had been <hi>deficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE was a German one SEBASTIAN HEINRIC, who, not many Years ago, publiſhed for the Courſe of one Year whatever he <hi>did, read</hi> or <hi>ſaw</hi> for that Year.</p>
                  <p>MR. MATHER'S <hi>Diary</hi> was not ſuch a <hi>Medley:</hi> No! There was none but <hi>important</hi> Matters entred into it. I will only take Notice of what I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in obſerving <hi>one Day,</hi> and <hi>one Year</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>I find in one of his Diaries an Account of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>one Day</hi> as follows. <q>This Day I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Duties of my <hi>general Calling, inſtructed</hi> the Scholars under my Charge, underwent the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Meals</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> with whom I was a conſiderable while; I <hi>made</hi> a long Sermon and <hi>preached</hi> it; I ſpent more than a little Time at the <hi>private Meeting,</hi> where I preached, and read over KNOX'S <hi>Hiſtorical Relation of the Iſland of</hi> Ceylon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Obſervation of one whole Year of his Diary I took Notice of it,—</p>
                  <p>THAT he had preached above <hi>ſeventy two publick</hi> Sermons, and many <hi>private</hi> ones; perhaps near <hi>half</hi> as many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003188_0047_0FF013C31B9858A8"/>
THAT not <hi>one Day</hi> paſſed without ſome Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>to do Good</hi> invented and regiſtred; beſides, I ſuppoſe, many <hi>never</hi> entred his Memorials.</p>
                  <p>THAT no <hi>one Day</hi> had paſſed without being able to ſay at Night, that <hi>ſome</hi> of his <hi>Revenues,</hi> tho' <hi>ſmall,</hi> had been dealt out to pious Uſes.</p>
                  <p>THAT he had <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Books.</p>
                  <p>THAT he had kept <hi>ſixty Faſts</hi> and <hi>twenty two</hi> Vigils.</p>
                  <p>A vaſt Variety of other Things I find recorded, which I ſhall omit: I bring this only as a Specimen of his <hi>Diary,</hi> how it was repleniſhed and what Pains he took not to ſpend his Life in vain.</p>
                  <p>BUT notwithſtanding He took ſuch Care of ſpending his Time; yet, I often in his Books find him complaining of his <hi>Deficiencies,</hi> &amp;c. His firſt Years, He calls, <hi>Time ſo miſpent as to render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be called a</hi> Life; after he was grown in Years, he choſe rather to ſay, ſuch a <hi>Year of his Age</hi> than his Life: On one of his Books I read, ſuch a <hi>Year of a forfeited Life;</hi> on another Year, of "<hi>my ſinning againſt my precious</hi> REDEEMER": On ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>"Alas of my Unfruitfulneſs"!</hi> On a fourth, <hi>"A Year ſweel'd away in Sin and Sloth".</hi> So that it might be ſaid of Him, as was ſaid of one that was very <hi>exact in his Walk,</hi> that his Life was <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua Cenſura,</hi> a continual Cenſure of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>ALTHO' he thus complains of himſelf: it would be happy for the <hi>greateſt Part</hi> of the World, if they could give <hi>ſo good</hi> an Account of their Time and their Talents. <hi>Bleſſed is</hi> ſuch a <hi>wiſe and faithful Servant, who when his</hi> LORD <hi>cometh, is found ſo doing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might under this Chapter have given you a large Account of his <hi>Faſts,</hi> &amp;c. (which belong to this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Character and Conduct) but I had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, until the 6th Chapter obliges me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. WHILE he was full of Concern for Relief from this troubleſome Infirmity, that good old School-maſter Mr. CORLET gave him a Viſit on purpoſe to adviſe Him; <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſhould be glad if you would oblige your ſelf to a</hi> dilated Deliberation <hi>in ſpeaking; for as in</hi> Singing <hi>there is no one who</hi> Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, <hi>ſo by prolonging your</hi> Pronunciation <hi>you will get an Habit of ſpeaking without Haeſitation.</hi>

                     <p>THE apprehenſion of the curſed PRIDE (the Sin of <hi>young Miniſters</hi>) working in my Heart, fill'd me with inexpreſſible Bitterneſs and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before the LORD. In my <hi>early Youth,</hi> even when others of my Age are playing in the Streets, I preached unto very great Aſſemblies, and found ſtrange Reſpects among the People of GOD.

                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003188_0051_0FF013CF3AA32390"/>I reſolved therefore that I would <hi>ſet apart a Day,</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> my ſelf before GOD for the PRIDE of my own Heart, and entreat that by HIS Grace I may be delivered from that <hi>Sin</hi> and from all the dreadful <hi>Wrath,</hi> to which I may be by that Sin expoſed. I did ſo; And on this Day I examined my ſelf by the Diſcoveries of <hi>Pride,</hi> which I found given in ſome judicious Diſcourſes on that Subject. But I found eſpecially two Reſpects, in which I fear'd I was guilty before GOD.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> MY <hi>Applauding</hi> of my ſelf in my Tho'ts, when I have done any thing at all ſignificant; <hi>pray'd</hi> or <hi>preach'd</hi> with <hi>Enlargements;</hi> anſwered a Queſtion readily, preſently, ſuitably. <hi>Proud Thot</hi>'s I ſaw fly-blow'd my beſt Performances.</p>

                        <item>1. WHAT is <hi>Pride</hi> but the very <hi>Image of Satan</hi> on the Soul? The more any Man has of CHRIST in him, the more <hi>humble</hi> will he be, more low and vile in his own Eyes and more empty of himſelf.

HIS holy SPIRIT is <hi>grieved</hi> by it: And how vehemently does the Scripture caution againſt all Tendencies unto it? Shall I bear to think of offending that GOD who

And if that ſhould be my Fate, — <hi>LORD, Have Mercy on me!</hi>— What a Monument ſhall I be of thy direful Vengeance? O that the LORD would ſet home theſe Tho'ts for my Humiliation!</item>

IN the <hi>firſt</hi> and chief place, I would carry my diſtemper'd <hi>Heart</hi> unto the LORD JESUS, and put it into the Hands of that alſufficient <hi>Phyſician</hi> for HIM to ture it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would be daily watchful againſt my <hi>Pride,</hi> &amp; continually keep an Eye upon my Heart, and check the <hi>leaſt Beginnings</hi> and <hi>firſt Motions</hi> of this Corruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would ſtudy much the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Aggravations</hi> of this <hi>Evil,</hi> and the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Grace contrary unto it.</p>
                     <p>IN one of my Supplications this Day, I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd my ſelf;</p>
                     <p>LORD, What ſhall I do for the Cure of this Diſeaſe my <hi>Pride?</hi> Bleſſed be thy Name, Thou haſt ſhewed me a <hi>Way,</hi> and bid me <hi>walk</hi> in it. Have I not heard Thee ſaying to my ſinful, <hi>ſtung</hi> and <hi>ſwoln</hi> Soul, <hi>Look unto ME and be ſaved!</hi> And therefore by thy Grace I will do it. I have done it and have found, and to this Day find, the Benefit of it. Why is it that I am not inſenſibly and incureably forever carried away <hi>Captive</hi> by the <hi>Luſt</hi> with which I am now warring? 'Tis becauſe I had put my Heart into the Hands of the faithful <hi>JESUS,</hi> and He it is that hath not ſuffered me to go on unconcerned about the Diſtemper of my Soul, but hath awakened me to ſeek Relief at HIS Hands, as I do this Day.—And now LORD, I come to HIM. He ſees how I am <hi>labouring</hi> and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> but He has bid me <hi>come.</hi> Does He not call for <hi>my Heart?</hi> But what kind of <hi>Heart?</hi> It is not mention'd; but I am ſure it is <hi>my Heart</hi> that is called for. Hence tho' my Heart be a <hi>proud Heart,</hi> yet as long as 'tis <hi>mine,</hi> I am to bring it. And, O LORD, I bring it becauſe it is <hi>proud.</hi> But wherefore doth He call for it? Is it not that He may ſet up His <hi>Kingdom</hi> in it, fill it with His Graces, and manifeſt the power of His rich Goodneſs in it forever? Then let Him take my <hi>Heart</hi> and make it <hi>humble!</hi> It is eaſy with Him
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003188_0054_0FF013D76F964FE0"/>to do it. Tho' I cannot overcome this <hi>Pride,</hi> He can: Oh, Let Him do it, I wait upon Him for it; I believe and am ſatisfied that He will do it; I have <hi>not ſought THY Face in vain.</hi>

                  <p>THAT He would endeavour to be a <hi>faithful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> unto thoſe over whom he ſhould be placed.</p>
                  <p>THAT He would endeavour to be <hi>humble</hi> under whatever <hi>Enlargements</hi> ſhould be vouchſafed unto him.</p>
                  <p>THAT if GOD ſhould give him to build up HIS Church with an unſpotted <hi>Reputation,</hi> he would endeavor to be contented with whatever State ſhould be ordered for him in the World, tho' never ſo <hi>Poor</hi> and many other ways afflicted.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He was conſtant and unwearied in his <hi>public Miniſtry,</hi> when he was entred into it.—Sometimes he has preached a Sermon for <hi>eleven Days</hi> ſucceſſively.

                  <p>

                     <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> HE would <hi>have</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> Notes in Preaching; but yet would not ſo read his <hi>Notes,</hi> as in the leaſt to take off the <hi>Vivacity</hi> of his <hi>Eye,</hi> his <hi>Voice,</hi> his whole <hi>Action.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>HE could ſeldom diſpatch more than four or five Families in an Afternoon, and look'd on this Work as <hi>laborious</hi> as any in all his Miniſtry.

                  <p>AND in purſuance of this Intention, (that is the Exerciſe of <hi>Love</hi>) he would ask himſelf before his <hi>Evening Prayers,</hi> Who hath in the foregoing Day ſhown me any <hi>Kindneſs?</hi> And he would then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſupplicate the GOD of Heaven that he would beſtow <hi>Spiritual and Eternal Favours</hi> on each of them that had particularly obliged him.</p>

Now becauſe it is my deſire that this Hiſtory may be very unexceptionable, I ſhall treat of one or two Things only, and write of the <hi>Reſt</hi> in ſuch a <hi>General Way</hi> as to give no one any Offence.</p>
                  <p>I find my ſelf obliged to mention one or two Affairs, particularly in which Mr. MATHER was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and diſtinguiſhed himſelf.</p>
                  <p>MY Country is very ſenſible that in the Year 1688. (when one of the moſt wicked of Kings was on the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003188_0064_0FF013F178212BD0"/>Britiſh Throne) ANDROS and his Crew were very violent, illegal and arbitary in their Proceedings: I need not give any Narrative of their Managements here, becauſe there has been an Account of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given to the World.</p>
                  <p>WHILE theſe <hi>Roaring Lions</hi> and <hi>Ranging Bears</hi> were in the midſt of their Ravages; It was in the Month of <hi>April</hi> when we had News by the Edges concerning a Deſcent made upon <hi>England</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for the Reſcue of the Nations from <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> — Then a Strange Diſpoſition entred in the Body of our People to aſſert our <hi>Liberties</hi> againſt the Arbitrary Rulers that were fleecing them: But it was much feared by the more ſenſible Gentlemen at <hi>Boſton,</hi> that an unruly Company of Soldiers, who had newly deſerted the Service in which they had bin employed for the Eaſtern War, by the gathering of their Friends to them to protect them from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who, they tho't, intended nothing but Ruine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>AND therefore the principal Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with Mr. MATHER to conſult what was beſt to be done; and they all agreed, if poſſible, that they would extinguiſh all Eſſays in our People to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> but that if the Country People to the Northward by any violent Motions puſh'd on the Matter ſo far as to make a <hi>Revolution</hi> unavoidable, <hi>Then</hi> to prevent the Shedding of <hi>Blood</hi> by an ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Multitude, ſome of the Gentlemen preſent would appear in the Head of what Action ſhould be done; and a <hi>Declaration</hi> was prepared accordingly.</p>
                  <p>ON <hi>April</hi> 18. the People were ſo driving &amp; furious, that unheaded they began to ſeize our public Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors: upon which the Gentlemen aforeſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003188_0065_0FF013F4B38BA208"/>the whole Country were now in a moſt prodigious Ferment and Thouſands of exaſperated People in Arms were come into <hi>Boſton,</hi> yet there was no manner of Outrage committed; only the <hi>public Robbers</hi> that had lorded it over Us were confined. 'Twas then Mr. MATHER appeared — He was the Inſtrument of preventing the Exceſſes into which <hi>the Wrath of Man</hi> is too ready to run; He came and like a NESTOR or ULISSES reaſoned down the Paſſions of the Populace: had he liſped a Syllable for it, perhaps the People would by a ſudden <hi>Council of War</hi> have try'd, judg'd and hang'd thoſe ill Men, who would have treated him otherwiſe. Nevertheleſs he ſet himſelf both <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> &amp; <hi>privately</hi> to hinder the Peoples proceeding any further than to reſerve the Criminals for the Juſtice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
                  <p>NOW the Perſecution which was intended for Mr. MATHER was diverted; for on that very Day that he was to be committed to <hi>half a Years Impriſonment,</hi> thoſe that would have <hi>wrong'd</hi> him were <hi>juſtly</hi> taken into Cuſtody: And yet ſo generous was he as not only to expoſe his <hi>Name</hi> but even his <hi>Life</hi> unto the Rage of the Multitude for the ſaving of ſome that would have hurt him: Tho' he had no Thanks for his Ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>THE Spirit which acted him in theſe Matters is expreſſed in a Sermon he preach'd to the Convention of the Colony from 2 Chron. XV. 2. It was printed under the Title of, <hi>The Way to Proſperity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few Days before this, the Inhabitants of <hi>Boſton</hi> aſſembling together to chuſe <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> for that <hi>Convention</hi> &amp; vote <hi>Inſtructions</hi> for them, it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that the different Perſuaſions of the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>next Steps</hi> to be taken for our Settlement would have produced a Fury near to <hi>Bloodſhed;</hi> and therefore Mr. MATHER was deſired to be at their Meeting. The Meeting began with dangerous and horrible Paroxyſms, which when he ſaw, he upon it made an affectionate and moving Speech to them, at which many fell into
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003188_0066_0FF013F7C17DFD10"/>Tears and the whole Body of the People preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united in the <hi>Methods of Peace</hi> Mr. MATHER propoſed unto them.</p>
                  <p>UPON, Diſcourſing with him of theſe Affairs he has told me, that he always preſſed <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> unto a legal Government, tho' he ſuffered from ſome tumultuous People, by doing ſo; and upon the whole, has aſſerted unto me his <hi>Innocency</hi> and Freedom from all <hi>known Iniquity</hi> in that Time, but declared his Reſolution, from the View he had of the fickle Humors of the Populace that he would chuſe to be concern'd with them as little as poſſible for the future. And ſo I diſmiſs this Head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</p>

                  <p>THE Summer of the Year 1692. was a very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Time unto the whole Country. — The Devils after a moſt pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Mr. MATHER, for his Part, was always affraid of proceding to convict and condemn any. Perſon as a <hi>Confederate</hi> with afflicting <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>NEVERTHELESS, on the other ſide, he ſaw in moſt of the <hi>Judges</hi> a charming Inſtance of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Patience;</hi> and as he knew their exemplary <hi>Piety,</hi> ſo he obſerved the <hi>Agony</hi> of Soul with which they ſought the Direction of Heaven, above moſt other of our People who were enchanted into a raging, railing and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this Cauſe, tho' Mr. MATHER could not allow the <hi>Principles</hi> ſome of the Judges had eſpouſed; he could not however but ſpeak honourably of their <hi>Perſons</hi> on all Occaſions; and his <hi>Compaſſion</hi> upon the ſight of their <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which <hi>Compaſſion</hi> was raiſed by his Journeys to <hi>Salem</hi> the chief Seat of theſe Diabolical Vexations, cauſed him ſtill to go to the Place.

                  </p>
                  <p>IN this <hi>evil Time</hi> Mr. MATHER offered at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning that if the <hi>poſſeſſed People</hi> might be ſcattered far aſunder, he would ſingly provide for <hi>Six</hi> of them; and he with ſome others would ſee whether without more bitter Methods, <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting</hi> would not put an end unto theſe heavy Trials: But his Offer was not accepted.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER for a great Part of the Summer he did almoſt every <hi>Week</hi> ſpend a Day by Himſelf in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of a ſecret FAST before the LORD.

                  <p>AND that a right Uſe might be made of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Things which had been happening among us, he now compoſed &amp; publiſhed his Book entituled, <hi>The Wonders of the inviſible World;</hi> which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed ſeveral Times in <hi>London:</hi> In the Preface he ſpeaks of, <hi>"the heart-breaking Excerciſes."</hi> He went thro' in writing it.— There was a certain <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer of Witchcraft</hi> who wrote againſt <hi>this</hi> Book; but as the <hi>Man</hi> is dead, his Book died long before him.</p>

He conſidered, who were to be <hi>privately</hi> addreſs'd with his <hi>Viſits,</hi> and on what Intentions. He conſidered how he might viſit the <hi>Schools</hi> unto the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, particularly ſome <hi>Charity Schools;</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be crected. He conſidered how he might carry on Evangelical Deſigns in concert with the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in the Neighbourhood; whom he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly deſired; that they would let him know the Neceſſities of the Sick, if he were ignorant of them, and unto whom he communicated rich <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> which in his Reading he had obſerved. Many more ſuch Things he tho't upon.</p>
                  <p>ALTHO' I ſpoke ſomething before of it; yet I will here again take particular Notice of one Thing a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong his <hi>Purpoſes</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> becauſe it belongs to this Head of <hi>Conſiderations.</hi>

He contrived how to mention ſome <hi>inſtructive thing</hi> at going to Sleep, and Riſing from it.</p>
                  <p>HE conſidered what <hi>Points of Education</hi> were ſtill wanting in any of his <hi>Children,</hi> and purſued them in the moſt proper Ways. I told you before, he cauſed them to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>write</hi> ſuch things as he found out for their beſt Advantage, and moſt ſuitable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

He obliged them to retire and ponder upon that Queſtion, <hi>What ſhould I wiſh to have done, if I were now a dying?</hi> And he would oblige them to report unto him their own Anſwer to the Queſtion, of which he took Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to inculcate <hi>the Leſſons of Godlineſs</hi> on them.</p>
                  <p>HE conſidered how to drop uſeful Admonitions on his <hi>Servants,</hi> as they were waiting on him; if the Action afforded any Time for it. He provided for their Inſtruction in every thing that he ſuppoſed might be for their Good. He put ſuch <hi>Treatiſes</hi> into their Hands, as might be moſt profitable unto them in the Peruſal. And as a ſort of <hi>Crumbs</hi> falling from the Table of his <hi>Servants,</hi> he hired a Woman to keep <hi>a School,</hi> in which the Sable <hi>Sons of Ethiopia</hi> might every Evening learn to <hi>read</hi> and be taught their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>WHAT ſhall I do for my</hi> Relatives <hi>abroad?</hi> He took a <hi>Catalogue,</hi> which began with his <hi>Parents,</hi> and extended as far as the <hi>Children</hi> of his <hi>Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> With the help of this <hi>Catalogue,</hi> he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he would at proper times <hi>pray</hi> for each of them diſtinctly by Name. And that every Week he would ſingle out one of them to conſider, <hi>What Good may I do for them? Or in what Inſtance may they be the better for me?</hi> And, that he might addreſs every one of them ſucceſſively with faithful Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning their interior and eternal Intereſts, either by ſpeaking to them perſonally, or by Writing to them, or by putting <hi>Books of Piety</hi> into their Hands; he propounded in this way to glorify our bleſſed SAVIOUR, and endeavour a Conformity to him, who even on his <hi>Croſs</hi> took peculiar Care of one that was <hi>nearly related</hi> unto him. But he did not confine theſe Eſſays of Good unto his <hi>Relatives</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Limits of his Catalogue: No! Heh made them reach as far as ever he could find out Opportunities. I need not any further explain this Article; only in one Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>WHEN his Father was become aged and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and deſirous Expectation of his call out of this World, tho' he was in a good State of Health, Strength and Vigor; he reſolved that every Interview he had with him (which was almoſt every Day) ſhould have in it ſomething or other referring to the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly World,</hi> and aſſiſt their mutual Preparation for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not knowing but <hi>it might be the laſt Time</hi> of their Conferring together in this.</p>
                  <p>BUT then Secondly; When ſuch an Occaſion for it has occur'd, he intermitted the former Queſtion, and was as much concerned for <hi>his Enemies</hi> (whom GOD

                  <p>HIS <hi>Queſtion</hi> for WEDNESDAY Morning was, <hi>What ſhall I do for the</hi> Churches <hi>of the LORD, and the more general Intereſt of Religion in the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE he conſidered, what <hi>Propoſals</hi> to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his Acquaintance.

                  <p>THE Doctor ſtarted numberleſs Things in the <hi>Societies</hi> upon theſe Points. Their <hi>Regiſters</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are fill'd with them. I ſhall only add, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe <hi>Societies,</hi> that once a Year <hi>they</hi> uſed all to meet together in one Place, and have a <hi>Day of Prayer,</hi> in which they humbled themſelves for doing ſo little Good; and beſought the Pardon of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice; and implored the Bleſſing of Heaven on the Eſſays to do Good which they had made, with the Counſel and Conduct of Heaven for their further Eſſays, and ſuch Influences of Heaven as might bring about thoſe <hi>Reformations,</hi> which it was not in their Power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. On theſe Days the Doctor, with another Miniſter carried on the Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>THIS was his Method on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Mornings: But at length he found it expedient to change his Queſtion; and He made this his alternate one; <hi>Is there any particular Perſon able to do the Good, which lies out of my more immediate Reach, to whom I may offer ſome good Propoſal?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:003188_0080_0FF0141CA34530A8"/>
BY anſwering this Queſtion, he made his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſtill more uſeful. Thus he was often a Doer of Good <hi>at the Second Hand,</hi> and often had the Pleaſure not to be known to have any hand at all in what was done.</p>
                  <p>THE Queſtion for FRIDAY Morn was conſtantly this; <hi>What ſpecial Subjects of Affliction, and Objects of Compaſſion, may I take under my particular Care; and what ſhall I do for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE he took a Catalogue of the <hi>Poor</hi> in his numerous Flock; but extended his Care further than ſo, wherever he ſaw any miſerable. He minded alſo, who wanted <hi>Employment;</hi> He took notice of thoſe under <hi>peculiar Exerciſes;</hi> and was very tho'tful, what Souls were by particular Addreſſes, to be <hi>pull'd as Brands out of the Burning,</hi> becauſe of their being abandoned to flaming Wickedneſs? He conſtantly fingled out one or other of theſe to be on this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add one thing more upon this Head: He conſidered, that tho' the <hi>Wind</hi> will not fill the <hi>Hungry,</hi> yet it will turn the <hi>Mill,</hi> that will grind the <hi>Corn</hi> to fill the <hi>hungry.</hi> And therefore, having his <hi>Liſt of Miſerables</hi> commonly with him, he very often in Company would make it a Subject of the Converſation, <hi>What ſhall be done for ſuch or ſuch an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ne in my Liſt?</hi> And thus, beſides the innumerable Kindneſſes which he had himſelf more immediately done for them, he procured multitudes of Kindneſſes from others; and the firſt Spring in the Motion has been unknown to them. Very much of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of his Life was in ſuch things as theſe. And I may tell my Reader, what I gave him to underſtand before, that he did <hi>not</hi> ordinarily let <hi>one Day in a Year</hi> paſs him, without ſomething expended on <hi>pious Uſes,</hi> beſides his other continual <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> to afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted People.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:003188_0081_0FF0141E6763FC00"/>
AND at length I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trive to <hi>his Queſtion</hi> for SATUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAY Morning. I may well call it <hi>his,</hi> for it was about the Concerns of <hi>his own Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Queſtion was; <hi>What more have I to do for the Intereſt of GOD in my own Heart and Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall a little here illuſtrate his way of Thinking upon this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>HE would ſet himſelf to conſider the more <hi>ſpecial Sins of his Youth;</hi> and what more <hi>ſpecial Service</hi> he ſhould do for the Kingdom of GOD, in the greateſt Contrariety to his <hi>former Miſcarriages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HE ſet himſelf then to conſider the <hi>Reproaches</hi> he had met with; and upon this, what <hi>Services</hi> he ſhould be awakened by them to do for the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
                  <p>HE conſidered, how he was favoured with ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and uncommon Opportunities to publiſh many <hi>Books of Piety;</hi> and of what vaſt Concernment it was, that he ſhould take effectual Care <hi>his own Books</hi> did not prove at laſt his Condemnation, by his failing in thoſe <hi>Attainments in Religion,</hi> which he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto others. Wherefore (with Prayers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this) he would ſometimes on a Lord's Day Evening read over his own <hi>Books of Devotion,</hi> and work them over again upon his Heart, until his own Soul was exquiſitely conformed unto them.</p>
                  <p>HE reſolved, that whatever <hi>bodily Infirmities</hi> he might labour under, (or that he could call to mind he had been viſited with) he would make them the <hi>Occaſions</hi> and <hi>Incentives</hi> of ſome agreable Diſpoſitions in his Soul.</p>
                  <p>THUS I have given you a brief Specimen of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the <hi>laſt</hi> Queſtion: I have been the more <hi>brief</hi> here; becauſe a <hi>fuller Anſwer</hi> will be given to it in the ſixth Chapter of this Book, where I ſhall treat of his <hi>Chriſtian Life</hi> at large.</p>

               <p>HE was never much tempted to queſtion the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of the DEITY: If ever he was at all, he <hi>rejected</hi> the tho'ts with the utmoſt Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Abhorrence.</p>
               <p>WHENEVER he was tempted to any evil <hi>Frame</hi> of Soul, or any wrong <hi>Action,</hi> his conſtant Courſe was to cry out, <hi>O LORD I beſeech THEE, Deliver my Soul!</hi> and he endeavoured to form ſuch <hi>Tho'ts</hi> as ſhould be <hi>reverſe,</hi> to thoſe infuſed or excited by the Tempter, as well as to <hi>act contrary</hi> and diametrically oppoſite to what he was tempted to. Thus he <hi>reſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. I will relate one or two Inſtances of the Divine Appearance to keep him from Deſtruction, when in very great Danger.</p>
               <p>IN his 36th Year he received a Remarkable <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</hi> For, Riding over a <hi>Bridge</hi> one of the <hi>Poles</hi> on it, that was <hi>rotten,</hi> broke, and his Horſe broke thro' and <hi>ſunk down to his Breaſt.</hi> Mr. MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER choſe rather to keep the Saddle than go off into the <hi>River,</hi> and the Horſe to the Aſtoniſhment of the Company <hi>roſe</hi> again (tearing off his <hi>Shoe</hi> in Riſing) and leap'd over with Mr. MATHER ſafe upon him.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003188_0083_0FF01424C4A529C8"/>How happily do all Creatures ſerve us, while we are ſerving their and our LORD!</p>
               <p>I ſhall relate but one notable Deliverance more: When the Squadron arrived from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> on Board of which there was a conſiderable Army return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a fruitleſs Expedition there; Mr. MATHER was deſired by many of the Officers to give them a Sermon on a certain <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon an <hi>Iſland</hi> where they put aſhore to air themſelves. He raſhly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, but while he was in his Excellency's Barge, he was taken ſo very Sick that his Friends muſt needs carry him back again. As ſoon as he came Home he was well: The Admiral afterwards told him, it was well he went no further; for the Army had newly ſuffered a great Deſolation by a Sickneſs more infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive than the Plague it ſelf: And had he gone and converſed among ſuch an infectious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, it would probably have coſt him his Life, as it proved mortal to many of his Neighbours, who were ſo hardy as to go down among them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT having mentioed his being kept from ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I may now very properly add a Section of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>viſited with Sickneſs,</hi> his <hi>Thot's</hi> under it, his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> from it, with the grateful Sentiments of his Heart upon being kept from ſundry Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES, eſpecially when a Young Man, he was troubled with tormenting Pains in his <hi>Teeth</hi> and <hi>Jaws;</hi> which <hi>Pains</hi> made him loſe more Time than he was willing to ſpare, and which produced many a ſad Hour to him in his Pilgrimage. In theſe Pains he would ſet himſelf, as well as he could, to <hi>try his Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE conſidered whether or no, he had not ſinned with his <hi>Teeth?</hi> How? By ſinful and exceſſive <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And by <hi>Evil Speeches;</hi> for there are <hi>Literae Dentales</hi> uſed in them. At laſt by a courſe of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind his Ears and on the Top of his Head with <hi>Cold Water,</hi> he obtainted a Deliverance from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:003188_0084_0FF014266F1E5CD8"/>
BY Reaſon of his Sedentary Life, great Study and little Exerciſe, he was when in Years much afflicted and enfeebled with Sickneſs at his <hi>Stomach,</hi> a palled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d pained Stomach. From hence he muſt awaken himſelf to bewail his want of a Stomach for the Service of GOD, and Meditations on his SAVIOUR; he muſt mourn for his not having an Appetite for the beſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Actions; which he tho't he had not duely reliſhed: The Offences of his Stomach in the Intemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance of the Table he tho't alſo to be bewailed; he muſt beg the Pardon of his Miſcarriages thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice, and beg Grace to carry it better. Thus he fetch'd <hi>Good out of Evil;</hi> and thus Evil <hi>work'd together for</hi> his <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE laſt Thing I ſhall mention in this Section is his pious Tho'ts upon being delivered from Sickneſs <hi>in General,</hi> and <hi>five Diſeaſes</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>HE was ever deſirous, to be greatly affected with Diſpoſitions of agreable Gratitude unto the GOD of his Health; and by the Health with which he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be awakened unto ſuch Acknowledgments of GOD and ſuch Reſolutions of Piety, as he tho't were moſt emphatically expected from him. Wherefore when he viſited the Sick, he would bleſs the LORD for his own <hi>Freedom</hi> from their Diſeaſes; and would think, what <hi>moral Diſeaſes</hi> and Diſorders he had analogous to them, againſt which he ſhould be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and unto what Graces and Actions he ſhould by the Goodneſs of his SAVIOUR be animated, and he would firſt offer his <hi>Prayers</hi> and them employ his <hi>Cares</hi> for the obtaining of them.</p>
               <p>THERE are particularly <hi>five Diſeaſes;</hi> his Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from each of which, he improved in a way of exceeding <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> unto the LORD his <hi>Healer.</hi> And being delivered from <hi>them,</hi> he would on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion glorify his GOD after this manner. Since he was not lying under the living Death of a <hi>Palſey,</hi> he would be very zealous and <hi>active</hi> in the Service of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003188_0085_0FF014282B169BF0"/>GOD. Since he was not under Corroſions of a <hi>Cancer,</hi> he would have all Tendencies to <hi>Envy</hi> extinguiſhed in his Soul, and a perpetual Joy at the Proſperity of his Neighbour flouriſhing in him. Since he had not the Tortures of the <hi>Gout,</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> ſhould chearfully carry him to the afflicted, with Comfortable Words, and unto the Congregation of the Faithful; While his <hi>Hands</hi> ſhould not be idle in writing for GOD, and in diſtributing to the Poor.

               <p>I will here for ſome Cauſes inſert one Paſſage; (tho' there were ſeveral in the Doctor's Life of the ſame Importance) 'Tis this;</p>
               <p>IN the Year 1704. <hi>Octob.</hi> 10. there came ſeveral People to the Doctor very late at Night, telling him, there was a Man in the Town lay a dying, but cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the Doctor came to him (who wondred at him that he would ſo readily do it) he told him to this Purpoſe <q>That he had been a very profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that he had given himſelf a great Liberty to abuſe good Men; but had abuſed no Man in the World ſo much as Doctor MATHER, and that he could not go out of the World without confeſſing it, bewailing it unto him, and beſeeching him to pardon it.</q> The Doctor asked him, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any particular Prejudice, or ever had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or could have pretended any particular Matter of Fact, upon which his Abuſes might have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed? He gave him to underſtand, that <q>There was nothing of <hi>that,</hi> but all was downright <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> for he took him to be a Man that did <hi>more Good than</hi> others, and that was <hi>all the Reaſon</hi> why he had vilified him more than other Men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor, after his well known mild Way, told the Man, That there was no Occaſion for any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don becauſe of his Speaking <hi>diminutively</hi> of him; for, ſays he, you may ſpeak ſo of me, and do me no wrong. But, continued he, for your ſpeaking injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, falſely, calumniouſly of me, it was indeed a Fault; yet, as he would forgive it without his asking for it, had it been ten hundred times more than it was, he would join with him in crying to GOD for the Forgiveneſs of that, and every Thing elſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003188_0087_0FF0142E58CBABE8"/>he had done amiſs.' He did ſo.

               <p>MY general Remark therefore concerning moſt of the Doctor's Writings except his <hi>practical</hi> ones, is, That we need not wonder to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. I come more <hi>particularly</hi> to ſpeak of ſome of his <hi>Publications,</hi> with a <hi>Vindication</hi> of them, and an <hi>Account</hi> of others, together with the Character of ſome <hi>prepared</hi> for the Preſs, and now in my Hands.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Book, I ſhall treat of, ſhall be his <hi>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana:</hi> A <hi>Book</hi> replete with <hi>Learning,</hi> and excellently calculated for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of true <hi>Religion &amp; Undefiled:</hi> A <hi>Book,</hi> in which the good Names of above <hi>fourſcore Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,</hi> who for the Cauſe of CHRIST came over into this Land when it was a Wilderneſs, are conſign'd over with Honor, to late Poſterity: A <hi>Book,</hi> in which there is a faithful Account of the <hi>Actions</hi> &amp; <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> together with a true Relation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remarkable Providences in ſetling this Land, it's <hi>Churches, Colleges, Schools</hi> and <hi>Inhabitants:</hi> and, in a word, a <hi>Book,</hi> in which the deſigns of a <hi>Church Hiſtory</hi> are exquiſitely accommodated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:003188_0092_0FF014399A24A468"/>
BUT I had rather on this occaſion uſe the words of Mr. ALSOP (a Gentleman of great <hi>Learning</hi> &amp; <hi>Peity,</hi> as well as of finiſhed <hi>Wit</hi>) who, when an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> was propoſed in an Aſſembly of Miniſters, ſaid; <hi>It is a very improper Propoſal; 'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> to abridge it! Abridging it will injure it. There is nothing ſuperfluous in it: Inſtead of Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing it, you had better read it twice over as I have: No Man that has a Reliſh for Piety or for Variety can ever be weary of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſeveral other Letters by me from Gentlemen beyond Sea, which are <hi>full</hi> to the ſame purpoſe: And here, the Gentlemen at <hi>Scotland</hi> will give me leave to declare it, that they highly valu'd the Performance: and the equally learned and modeſt Mr. MILLAR of <hi>Paiſley</hi> in particular will forgive me, if I ſpeak of it, that in his excellent Book of <hi>the Propagation of Chriſtianity,</hi> he mentions the Doctor as well as his <hi>Magnalia</hi> with great Reſpect.</p>
               <p>IN deſcribing the <hi>Magnalia,</hi> I mentioned <hi>the Lives</hi> in it and their Number: I may take notice here, that by the Year 1718. the Doctor had publiſhed the Lives of no leſs than <hi>one hundred and fourteen</hi> Men, and more than <hi>twenty</hi> Women, and ſince that Year, he has printed Accounts and Characters of many more; not to ſay any Thing of the tranſient but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention many others have had in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Tractates.</p>
               <p>BUT I may particularly ſpeak of <hi>the Life</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> Publiſhed in the Year 1724, which may paſs for an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Magnalia:</hi> It is a very <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Life;</hi> was well received in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>this</hi> Country; and is worthy to be perus'd by every Man of Senſe, Honor, and Vertue.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor has given to the World a Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Pſalterium Americanum;</hi> the Deſign of which was, firſt, to give <hi>in Meetre</hi> an exact and literal

                  <hi>Verſion</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, without any Jingle of Words at the End; and then, at the End of each Pſalm, to produce thoſe <hi>Illuſtrations</hi> of the Text, and thoſe <hi>pious Hints</hi> that would both <hi>enlighten</hi> the Mind, and <hi>warm</hi> the Heart of the Singer. As for the <hi>Illuſtratory</hi> part, no Man that has any Value for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowlege can find Fault with it; and as for the <hi>Metrical</hi> Verſion ſome prefer it vaſtly to <hi>any other;</hi> for as on one hand it has no large <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> nor yet any <hi>Diminution</hi> of the Senſe of DAVID, ſo on the other it has no Occaſion to ſelect improper <hi>Words</hi> for the ſake of a Rhime.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Directions of a Candidate of the Miniſtry,</hi> which Dr. MATHER has printed, has occaſioned ſo many Letters of <hi>Thanks</hi> and <hi>Compliment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Doctor's <hi>Chriſtian Philoſopher,</hi> in which the learned World enjoys a rich Treaſure, is a celebrated Piece: An ingenious Gentleman from <hi>London</hi> writes of it "<hi>It is the Glory of</hi> New-England, <hi>as it is the Admiration of</hi> Old.</p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae Fratrum Nov-Anglorum,</hi> (which Title he borrow'd from COMENIUS,) has had very great Encomiums.—One of the moſt finiſh'd <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Scholars</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> one who was born for Government over Men as well as to be a Ruler in the Common-wealth of <hi>Learning,</hi> and one who is <hi>Delicium Humani Generis,</hi> has been pleas'd to write of that Book, that <hi>'it is a decent conſiſtent Method of Church-Government".</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS I have writ of one or two of the Doctor's Books, which produced him the <hi>greateſt Eſteem;</hi> theſe I choſe to ſpeak of, becauſe they were compoſed with ſtrong Tho't and great Application.</p>

I will not mention any of his <hi>ſmaller Works,</hi> many of which were never deſign'd in the compoſing for <hi>the Preſs,</hi> and therefore needed not that great <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> as if they <hi>had:</hi> And it was the Doctor's fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Wonder that <hi>thoſe Compoſures he wrote with the leaſt Trouble and Care, found a Paſſage into the World, while many of his elaborate Compoſures lay by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT yet in and by thoſe <hi>ſmaller Books</hi> (which he ever modeſtly call'd <hi>Eſſays.</hi>) he ſhow'd he was in <hi>Labour, more abundant,</hi> he diſcover'd the great <hi>Reach</hi> of his <hi>Tho't</hi> and <hi>Compaſs</hi> of his <hi>Learning,</hi> did a vaſt deal of Good and procured the Thanks of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

               <p>THERE is likewiſe his <hi>Triparadiſus,</hi> which was ſent to Mr. WYAT Bookſeller in <hi>London</hi> in order to be publiſhed: Since which I am informed the <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller</hi> is dead, and know not what is become of the <hi>Manuſcript.</hi> It is pity it ſhould be loſt: It ſhow'd a great Acquaintance with <hi>Divine and Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

WHEN the <hi>Diploma</hi> was ſent unto Dr. MATHER, the moſt excellent <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of the Univerſity wrote very kindly to him I will take the very great Freedom to quote a Paragraph or two of his Letter;
<q>The high Value (writes he the Univerſity here has for you, I hope, you will no longer doubt, when I tell you, they have confer'd the higheſt Academical Degree upon You the Doctorate in Divinity; which <hi>I am perſuaded is but what you deſerve.</hi> Be pleaſed therefore to receive your <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploma,</hi> which could not be ſent ſooner, in regard no ſuch ſure Occaſion offered until now. Sir, I ſhall henceforth reckon you under a nearer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Society, and as one of us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Dean of the Faculty</hi> alſo about the ſame time writes thus: <q>Upon a Motion made in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of this Univerſity, that ſome Teſtimony be given of the Senſe we have of your Merit, it was unanimouſly agreed unto, that the Honor of <hi>Doctor of Divinity</hi> ſhould be conferred on you. And, according to the Power they have by their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Charter, granted ſome Hundreds of Years ago, They have (diſpenſing with your Abſence) created you <hi>Doctor of Divinity;</hi> and having ordered your <hi>Diploma</hi> they have ſigned it, and appended the Univerſities great Seal. This their Deed is as valid, as any Univerſity in <hi>Europe</hi> can make it</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>FROM this Time Dr. MATHER had a very intimate Friendſhip and Correſpondence with ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Univerſity: He heartily lov'd them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Death, and never ſpoke of them but with Terms of the greateſt Reſpect.</p>

                  <p>WHEN he received his <hi>Diploma,</hi> he immediately look'd upon it as an Encouragement unto him in the Service of CHRIST and HIS Kingdom: He rendred Thanks to Heaven, and beg'd Grace to make ſuch an Improvement of the Encouragement as might anſwer the Demands of Heaven from him: And he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conſider, What <hi>Sanctity,</hi> what <hi>Gravity,</hi> what <hi>Uſefulneſs,</hi> what ſhining <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>Performances</hi> the Church of GOD might juſtly demand from one ſo diſtinguiſhed above any Man in the <hi>American</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>SOME of the Doctor's Friends adviſed him to wear his <hi>Signet Ring,</hi> as a Token and Aſſertion of his <hi>Doctorate in Divinity,</hi> to which he was admitted as above; and not to do it from any Vanity of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but out of Obedience to the <hi>Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which directs us to aſſert the Honor of any Dignity, in which the Providence of GOD may ſtation us.</p>
                  <p>THE Doctor therefore would wear this <hi>Ring;</hi> and made this Action, ſo ſeemingly inconſiderable, a great Engine of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> HE <hi>look'd</hi> on <hi>the Ring</hi> as a <hi>continual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> to him, to do <hi>nothing</hi> below the Character, of which that was a Memorial; nothing diſagreable to the <hi>Gravity</hi> the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>ſuperiour Behavior</hi> with which a <hi>Doctorate</hi> ought always to be attended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT effectually admoniſhed him, that in his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> there ſhould paſs nothing out of his Lips that was mean, or not according to the Laws of <hi>Wiſdom, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ONE Original to the Ceremony of a <hi>Ring</hi> for <hi>Doctors of Divinity</hi> was to intimate, that they ſhould be ready to ſet their <hi>Seal</hi> to the Advice which may be received from them. The Doctor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this as a Caution: His Advice was asked on many Occaſions; he would be very conſiderate, and on ſuch Occaſions deliberate and look up to Heaven, deſiring to ſpeak nothing but what he ſhould be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>ſeal</hi> it and ſtand to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THE Emblem on the Doctor's <hi>Signet</hi> is A TREE with Pſal. 1.3. written under it; and about it GLASCUA RIGAVIT. The Caſt of his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, conſtantly provoked him to pray, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. THE Reſpect which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> paid him, did alſo very much encourage him, and fortify him in his Eſſays to do Good, while it added to the ſuperior Circumſtances, in which he was placed above the Contempt of envious Men.</p>
                  <p>'TWAS in the Year 1714. he received a Letter from the Secretary of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> [RICHARD WALLER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>] dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. 1713. in which are theſe Words; <hi>As for your being choſen a Member of the Royal Society, that has been done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>

                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:003188_0100_0FF0144B708BEAE0"/>
AFTER this he had ſeveral Letters from many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gentlemen of that society, who always Superſcribed their Letters to him as <hi>F. R. S.</hi> And he was aſſured by ſeveral of them, that he ought to affix <hi>that</hi> Title to his Name before his Works: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would never have done it.</p>
                  <p>BUT there are a few in <hi>New-England,</hi> who, as they grudg'd the Doctor <hi>any</hi> Honor, were ſo very fooliſh and impudent as to doubt, nay to deny his Right unto <hi>that</hi> Title: The Reaſon they gave for it was; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Name was not in the <hi>Liſt of the Members of that Society:</hi> But they are ignorant of it, that, altho' his Majeſty's Subjects in any of his extended Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be a <hi>Fellow of the Royal Society,</hi> they may not have their Names in the <hi>Liſt</hi> of the Society if they are abſent; which is the only Reaſon why the Doctor's was not. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

They are <hi>Foreigners</hi> and are allow'd this Honor becauſe they are ſo: whereas no Man among his Mejeſty's Subjects may have this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, unleſs he be preſent and be formally admitted.—Several Gentlemen of the Society wonder at the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of thoſe People who doubt this, and in their Letters expreſs their Amazement at it: I have at this Time in my Hand, Letters from Mr. WALLER, Dr. CHAMBERLAIN, Dr. WOODWARD, Dr. JURIN, and others who give Dr. MATHER his Title, and expreſs Concern that ſome ſordid People <hi>here</hi> will not allow it.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Doctor was very eaſy, as well he might; for if he <hi>had not</hi> the due <hi>Title</hi> allowed him, he <hi>deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> it; as his <hi>Chriſtian Philoſopher,</hi> his <hi>Curioſa A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericana,</hi> or Letters to the Royal Society, together with his (unprinted) <hi>Angel of Betheſda</hi> abundantly teſtify.</p>

5. I know not how better to diſmiſs this Head than with a pious Tho't which the Doctor had, upon the <hi>Honors</hi> of this World, and a Name among the Learned of the World.</p>
                  <p>THERE is (he tho't) an accurſed <hi>Idolatry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when we take Notice of this and that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in any <hi>Man,</hi> and conſider not at the ſame Time the great GOD as the Author of all this Excellency. <hi>Man</hi> ought to be look'd on as nothing, any f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>THE moſt of Men will celebrate the <hi>Learning,</hi> the <hi>Vertue,</hi> the <hi>Conduct</hi> of an eminent Perſon without the leaſt Obſervation of our Maker in all; much leſs do they give <hi>all</hi> the Glory of <hi>all</hi> to GOD, and behold <hi>Man,</hi> as no other than a <hi>Veſſel</hi> choſen by the <hi>Grace of GOD,</hi> to exhibit <hi>ſomething</hi> of HIS own Glory in the Points which render the <hi>Man</hi> obſervable.</p>
                  <p>Dr. MATHER therefore trembled, and was fill'd with a ſhuddering Horror, at the Tho'ts of having a <hi>great Name</hi> in the World, or being applauded, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and mightily talk'd of. The Reaſon of this Regret was, becauſe he tho't thoſe that ſpoke w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He was afraid <hi>his</hi> poor Name ſhould have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly lodg'd upon it, ſome Regards that ſhould be transfer'd to the glorious GOD alone.

Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE likewiſe very ſweetly entertained and highly gratified the Doctor with his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> as well as his <hi>printed</hi> Compoſures.</p>

                  <q>O my dear LORD; Thy FATHER has committed my Soul into Thy Hands: There is a <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> in which I am concerned: I know my <hi>Election</hi> by my <hi>Vocation,</hi> and my Concernment in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> by my being made willing to come under the Shadow of thy Wings in <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> Now in that ancient <hi>Covenant</hi> the FATHER ſaid unto the SON, <hi>Such a Soul there is that I will bring into thy Fold, and Thou ſhalt undertake for that Soul, as a ſufficient and an eternal SAVIOUR.</hi> Wherefore I am now in thy Hands, O my LORD: Thy FATHER has put me there, and I have put my ſelf there; O ſave me, heal me, work for me and in me the good Pleaſure of thy Goodneſs.</q>

                  <p>CONCERNING this Matter I have had a Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation which had a moſt melting Efficacy on me.</p>

A godly Man is a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD; a <hi>living Temple;</hi> dearer to Him than any Temple of <hi>mere Matter,</hi> tho' the moſt ſplendid and coſtly in the World. And our SAVIOUR comes into an <hi>Heart</hi> which is continually inſtructing, reforming and ſolacing it ſelf by <hi>thinking</hi> on Him.

                  <p>AS this my SAVIOUR is very GOD, and my <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in Him is all animated from that Conſideration; ſo, being one GOD with the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER and SPIRIT, who thro' Him communicate

My <hi>Serviceableneſs</hi> to the Kingdom of my SAVIOUR was the <hi>laſt Thing</hi> that in <hi>my Death to all Things here below</hi> I parted with; The Thing which I could <hi>leaſt</hi> of all part with: But this <hi>Darling,</hi> which I would fain have had ſaved <hi>from the Power of the Dog,</hi> I have alſo <hi>Sacrificed.</hi> I have ſubmitted unto it that the Ever-Bleſſed ONE ſhould not only make me <hi>vile</hi> among His People, but alſo utterly lay me aſide from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more <hi>Services for His Kingdom in the World.</hi> — I have been entirely <hi>dead</hi> unto every Thing elſe, and have had nothing but this <hi>one Thing</hi> left unto me, <hi>That I may have my JESUS not only</hi> doing <hi>for me, but alſo</hi> dwelling <hi>in me; and enabling me perpetually to feed and live upon</hi> HIM. This will be <hi>enough.</hi> I care not if I am ſtript of every Thing elſe, if I may but enjoy <hi>this Felicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN purſuance of <hi>this Felicity,</hi> 'tis not eaſy for me to delineate or enumerate <hi>the Methods of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with my only SAVIOUR,</hi> wherein I have been inſtructed of GOD. And it is impoſſible for me to expreſs the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> that irradiates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhes my Mind upon the Diſcoveries of any <hi>new Methods</hi> for it. No Affluence of any <hi>Worldly Wealth,</hi> no, nor any Advances in any <hi>Sciences</hi> could ſo tranſport and raviſh me!</p>
                  <p>THE Bleſſedneſs of the <hi>Heavenly World</hi> lies in our <hi>being with CHRIST;</hi> and by being <hi>with the LORD,</hi> and <hi>beholding His Glory</hi> in <hi>precious Thoughts</hi> of HIM here, I apprehend my ſelf even in <hi>Heaven upon Earth:</hi> And indeed the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Joy; Strength</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> with which it fills my Mind carries a <hi>Foretaſt</hi> and <hi>Earneſt</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>I ſoar up to an inexpreſſible Contemplation on my SAVIOUR, as the <hi>Wiſdom of GOD,</hi> who is the <hi>Archetype</hi> of the whole <hi>Creation,</hi> and in whom there are the original <hi>Ideas</hi> of all that is produced
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003188_0117_0FF014770333ABF0"/>by His Hands in the World, even that <hi>Platform</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> of which all Creatures are but the <hi>Iſſues</hi> and the <hi>Shadows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am hence wondrouſly reconciled unto my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>Death,</hi> inaſmuch as going from <hi>Creatures</hi> here, I go to Him in whom I ſhall find all that I leave and infinitely more.</p>
                  <p>IN the mean Time I am ſure, that whatever I find <hi>amiable</hi> or <hi>comfortable</hi> in any <hi>Creatures</hi> here, is much more to be found in Him.</p>
                  <p>HENCE when I ſee any Thing that is <hi>amiable</hi> in any <hi>Creatures,</hi> I commonly fly away from them to my SAVIOUR and think, <hi>How great is His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his Beauty!</hi>

                  <p>WHEN I find any Thing that is <hi>comfortable</hi> in any <hi>Creatures,</hi> I commonly haſten away unto my SAVIOUR, and think, <hi>What Benefits will flow from Him to me?</hi>

                  <p>UPON the <hi>withdraw</hi> of any <hi>Creatures,</hi> or when any deſireable <hi>Enjoyments</hi> are witheld or taken from me, I think, <hi>What is it that would recommend theſe Things unto me?</hi> And I preſently find my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR commended unto me by ſuch and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Qualities. In his being <hi>mine</hi> I find every Loſs repaired abundantly! Dead unto every Thing but my SAVIOUR, I thus expreſs my Sentiments;</p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Delights</hi> of <hi>this World.</hi>— Such <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> as I taſt in the mere Tendencies of <hi>Nature,</hi> I would in the Taſte of them think, <hi>The Will of GOD, expreſſed in the Nature of His Works is thus complied with. But, Oh, What ſhall I find in the Infinite GOD Himſelf upon my going back unto Him!—</hi> Thoſe <hi>Delights</hi> which are moſt helpful to me in ſeeing and ſerving of GOD are thoſe which I would have the moſt Value for: And even my <hi>Appetites</hi> for my <hi>Food</hi> particularly ſhall be ſo

                  <p>FOR the <hi>Honors of this World.</hi>— My Abhorrence of having the great GOD robbed on my Account, by People gazing on <hi>me</hi> without being led thro' me to <hi>Him,</hi> renders all the <hi>Honours</hi> in the <hi>Praiſe of Men</hi> very diſtaſteful to me. I do nothing to gain Honors for my ſelf; and if I do ſecure any Thing of <hi>Eſteem</hi> or of <hi>Station,</hi> it ſhall be purely for the Intereſt of GOD.— If I be accepted with my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR and employ'd in Work for His <hi>Kingdom</hi> and have His <hi>Image</hi> imprinted on me: Here are all the <hi>Honors</hi> that I wiſh for.</p>

IN drinking a Diſh of <hi>Tea,</hi> (of which he was a great Admirer) he would take an Occaſion for theſe Tho'ts eſpecially with the Ingenuity of <hi>Occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> and <hi>agreable Similitude,</hi> that ſhould have many ſweet Acknowlegements of the glorious JESUS in them. And whatever <hi>Delight</hi> any of his <hi>Senſes</hi> enjoy'd, it was ſoon ſanctified and rendred more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful by his making ſuch an Improvement of it.</p>
               <p>THE Servant of the LORD could ſay, <hi>Mine Eyes prevent the Night Watches, that I might Meditate in thy Word.</hi> When the Doctor waked in the <hi>Night,</hi> he would impoſe it as a Law upon Himſelf ever before he fell aſleep again to bring ſome <hi>Glory of his SAVIOUR</hi> into his Meditations, and have ſome agreable <hi>Deſire of his Soul</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>WHEN he paid what he <hi>ow'd</hi> at any Time, he would reflect on what he <hi>ow'd CHRIST for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Debt tot he Juſtice of GOD,</hi> and was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that he ſhould <hi>owe no Man any thing but Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AMONG the <hi>Occaſions</hi> for the Expreſſions of <hi>Piety</hi> and Thankfulneſs, he would affectionately take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>mean Employments</hi> wherein he ſaw other People occupied. When he ſaw thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it was to <hi>dig in the Earth,</hi> to ſweep <hi>Chimneys,</hi> cleanſe the <hi>Kennels,</hi> or drive <hi>the Coach, the Cart or Wheel-barrow,</hi> or exerciſed in the like <hi>low Degree;</hi> I ſay, whan he ſaw thoſe Men, it raiſed his Heart in Wonders at the Goodneſs of GOD, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him with nobler Employments.</p>
               <p>WHEN he viſited a <hi>Sick Perſon</hi> he would fetch ſome Admonition relating to the <hi>moral Diſtempers</hi> in his Heart and Life, analogous to the Circumſtances of the diſeaſed Perſon.</p>
               <p>IF any Thing began to raiſe any Ebullition of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> in him, he would endeavor to allay it by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>"What Provocations have I given to the great

               <p>WHEN he <hi>waſhed his Hands,</hi> he muſt think of the <hi>clean Hands,</hi> as well as <hi>pure Heart,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Citizens of Zion.</p>
               <p>AND when he did ſo mean an Action as <hi>paring his</hi> Nails, he tho't how he might <hi>lay aſide all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Naughtineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOMETIMES he had kind Preſents made him: He would by the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Preſents be awakened unto particular <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions.</hi> He would think, <hi>What Good Thing ſhould that Man wiſh, and what Good ſhould he do, whom GOD obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by beſtowing ſuch Things upon</hi> Him? And he would always add a Reflection upon the <hi>Humiliation</hi> of our SAVIOUR who wanted ſuch Things, thro' the Ingratitude of an evil World.</p>
               <p>WHENEVER he met with any <hi>Crooked Thing,</hi> he reflected after this manner; <hi>My Will is croſſed; but what particular Inſtance of Diſobedience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Will of GOD ſhould this Affliction lead me to conſider of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE had for many Years a <hi>Morning Cough:</hi> it every Morning <hi>raiſed</hi> proper <hi>Diſpoſitions of Piety</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>IN managing his <hi>Correſpondencies,</hi> He would think, <hi>What honourable Mention can I make of my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR here,</hi> and <hi>what Service may I do for the Kingdom of my SAVIOUR on this Opportunity?</hi> He afterwards added three Reflections. Firſt; When he was <hi>Sealing</hi> a <hi>Letter</hi> and ſending it away, he would with an act of <hi>Reſignation</hi> put it over into the Hands of the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> for the Safety and Succeſs of it. Secondly; When he was opening any Letter, he would lift up his Heart to Heaven that

Thirdly; In his <hi>laſt Prayers</hi> in his Study at Night before he went to reſt, he would call to mind whom he had received any <hi>Letter</hi> from in the Day, and would make particular mention of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and pray for ſuitable Mercies for him.</p>

               <p>WHILE he was joining with another in <hi>Social Praying</hi> he would fix his wandring Heart by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a pertinent <hi>Ejaculation</hi> unto every Sentence that was uttered as, <hi>"LORD, I own it,</hi> or <hi>LORD I ask it!</hi>

               <p>BEFORE his Preaching of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> he revolved it in a Meditation that ſhould turn every part of it into ſome <hi>Ejaculation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS Courſe of <hi>daily Meditation,</hi> which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, had agreable <hi>Ejaculations</hi> intermixed in the whole Exerciſe.</p>

THERE was once a Time and a Thing in which the Doctor was full of diſtreſs. His Temptations and Difficulties were extraordinary: He thought himſelf called unto more than ordinary Humiliations, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Reſignations. In this Time he rarely let a Week paſs without ſetting apart a <hi>Day for Faſting with Prayer</hi> for many <hi>Months</hi> together; and ever now and then he had his <hi>Vigils</hi> for a Converſation with Heaven; and every Day for the moſt part he had one ſecret Prayer more than he uſed to have and lay proſtrate in the Duſt with Tears before the LORD, yet he tho't it neceſſary to do ſomething more than all this.</p>
               <p>HE had often in his Life kept <hi>two Days of Faſting and Prayer</hi> in <hi>on Week:</hi> But now he was reſolved to ſpend <hi>Three Days</hi> after this manner in his Study, and <hi>beſeech the LORD thrice, knocking</hi> at the Door of Heaven for <hi>three Days together;</hi> and he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thro' the Undertaking even beyond what his feeble Conſtitution could have looked for.</p>
               <p>HE was deſirous that <hi>each Day</hi> ſhould have it's <hi>peculiar Character,</hi> tho' there were many <hi>general Strokes</hi> of Devotion which were common to all the Days.</p>
               <p>THE Character of the <hi>firſt Day</hi> was <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of, and <hi>Contrition</hi> for the Sins which might expoſe him to the Diſpleaſure of Heaven; (in which he uſed a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of Things <hi>forbidden and required in the Commandments,</hi> as well as the Ingredients of <hi>Original Sin</hi>) and he petitioned for the Pardon of all thro' the Blood of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THE Character of <hi>the ſecond Day</hi> was <hi>Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Will of GOD</hi> in whatever Sorrows had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, and in the ſorrowful things which he could imagine might poſſibly be inflicted on him He found aſtoniſhing Entertainment from Heaven in this Action.</p>
               <p>THE ſingular Character of the <hi>third Day</hi> was <hi>Requeſt;</hi> firſt for Help under and againſt all the

                     <hi>The Evil that I feared came upon me,</hi> but yet I received a marvellous Harveſt of the <hi>Three Days.</hi> The Deſign of them was obtained to Admiration.</p>

                  <p>IT was a Day full of aſtoniſhing Enjoyments, a Day filled with Reſignation, Satisfaction &amp; Heavenly Aſtoniſhments. Heaven has as it were been opened unto me this Day.

I ſaw that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> mentioned the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the good <hi>Angels,</hi> about <hi>the Heirs of Salvation</hi> with Frequency; and I ſaw that my Life had been wondrouſly ſignalized by the Miniſtry of thoſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> Wherefore loth to be guilty of ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtful Neglect of the <hi>Angels</hi> as the Generality of the Faithful who enjoy the Aſſiſtances of thoſe <hi>Heavenly Guardians</hi> are, I devoted this Day to glorify the GOD and Father of my LORD JESUS CHRIST for <hi>the Miniſtry of ANGELS,</hi> which has notably befriended me unto this very Day. And I expected in this Way not only to render my ſelf more agreable to thoſe <hi>excellent Spirits,</hi> but alſo to obtain from <hi>their</hi> and <hi>my</hi> LORD a more ſignal ſhare of their Influence than had ever yet been granted me.</p>
                  <p>IN the Evening before this Day, I was <hi>amaz'd</hi> when I beheld, but happy that I <hi>plainly</hi> beheld, the happening of ſeveral Things that ſeemed as it were contrived on Purpoſe to indiſpoſe me for the Duties now before me: But I comfortably got over all the Indiſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>TWILL be needleſs to relate how many <hi>Hymns</hi> I ſang referring to the <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Morning I wrote an Illuſtration upon a Text about the good <hi>Angels:</hi> And I made my <hi>Family-Offering</hi> ſuitable to the Deſign before me.</p>
                  <p>AND one <hi>Law</hi> which I laid upon my ſelf this Day was, that in all the <hi>Intervals</hi> of more <hi>ſtated Thinking,</hi> as I paſſed from one Object to another, I would make <hi>Ejaculatory Thanksgivings</hi> unto the LORD upon all the Occaſions which offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto me. But how many Scores of <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> thus occaſionally acknowleging the Greatneſs and Goodneſs of GOD paſſed from me this Day, I cannot reckon.</p>
                  <p>MY chief Exerciſe in the Forenoon was, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider exactly, and with as much of Scripture and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003188_0141_0FF014B2E5BAFF20"/>Learning as I could, the <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> the <hi>Properties</hi> and the <hi>Relations</hi> of the good Angels; and, the <hi>Honor,</hi> but not <hi>Worſhip,</hi> due to thoſe benign Spirits: And then to run over the marvellous References to their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which I have here and there found ſcattered in the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD; whether towards <hi>particular Saints</hi> or towards the <hi>Church in General.</hi> Theſe Conſiderations with a vaſt Variety took in the chief of the Story of the <hi>Bible</hi> together with the <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Prophecies, eſpecially in the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> wherein <hi>Angels</hi> are concerned. But my Conſiderations were ſtill directed unto the LORD with my Deſires, that HE ſhould forever be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and glorified for the Things, in which he had thus commiſſioned his <hi>Angels</hi> to be his Meſſengers and his Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>I cannot fully expreſs <hi>the Elevation of Soul</hi> with which I went thro' theſe noble Exerciſes; which Exerciſes at laſt I concluded with Aſſurances, that I ſhould one Day come to <hi>praiſe HIM that ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN the Afternoon, I looked over ſome <hi>Catalogues of Mercies</hi> received from the GOD of Heaven, which I had heretofore entred into my <hi>Diaries;</hi> and by comparing of what I read in the Book of Heaven about <hi>the Agency of the Angels,</hi> I examined, where I might make an Allowance for their ſubordinate Agency in my own Affairs.</p>
                  <p>THE main Heads of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> done for me which the Word of GOD permitted me to count <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> were theſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>— Accordingly I conſidered;</p>
                  <p>HOW the <hi>Angels</hi> were continually engaged in beholding and admiring the <hi>Glories</hi> of the great GOD. [<hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 10.]</p>
                  <p>HOW <hi>They</hi> were continually ſtudying the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Redemption by JESUS CHRIST with the Characters and Approaches of His Kingdom. [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.]</p>

                  <p>HOW the <hi>Angels,</hi> in fine, were very <hi>Holy.</hi>— Theſe Things I conſidered for my own <hi>Imitation.</hi>

               <p>HE conſidered that the Primitive Chriſtians in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to that Command of <hi>Watching unto Prayer</hi> ſometimes had their VIGILS which were of great Uſe unto them in their Chriſtianity.

And ſo the <hi>Doctor</hi> likewiſe found it. He has frequently withdrawn from his Lodging agreable enough unto Him, and in the Dead of the Night has retired unto his Study; where he has thrown himſelf on his Floor in the Duſt, and wreſtled with him in Prayer for a great while together. In doing thus he was rewarded with unutterable Communications from Heaven.</p>

               <p>THIS Variety of Duty (I find) was done by him on <hi>one Sabbath:</hi> And altho' he found himſelf very <hi>weary,</hi> yet his Spirit found thoſe unſpeakable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations and Advantages from ſuch <hi>unwearied Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batizing,</hi> as carry'd rich Compenſations with them.</p>
               <p n="4">[4] WHEN he <hi>read the Scriptures,</hi> he had one very holy and uſeful Practice in it.</p>

The <hi>Reading the Scriptures</hi> in ſuch a Manner and with ſuch an Affection proved unto him a moſt glorious Opportunity for Converſing with GOD. And he gave more Thanks to Heaven for teaching him this way of Living than if he had the greateſt Earthly Revenues beſtowed on him.</p>

                  <p>I will here write thoſe Sentiments of theſe Things of which the Doctor juſt before he died had a firm Belief from a ſtrict Enquiry, long Study and much Prayer; and, as near as I can, I will expreſs his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in his own Words in the following Aſſertions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. THE <hi>ſecond Coming</hi> of the LORD will be <hi>at</hi> and <hi>for</hi> the Deſtruction of <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of <hi>the Roman Monarchy</hi> under <hi>the Papal Form</hi> of it. He tho't that, altho' Wiſe Men have interpreted our SAVIOUR'S <hi>Coming in the Clouds of Heaven</hi> and <hi>the Brightneſs of his Appearance</hi> as if it me'nt any Thing beſides <hi>His Perſonal Coming,</hi> herein they ſpoke fooliſhly and unaccountably. For as their Interpretations leave us deſtitute of any Proof that our LORD will <hi>ever come at all,</hi> ſo they go very far towards a Treſpaſs on the <hi>third Commandment.</hi>

                     <item>2. THE <hi>Conflagration</hi> deſcribed by the Oracles of GOD in ſtrong Terms, and which we are warned of <hi>by the Mouth of all the Prophets;</hi> this <hi>Conflagration</hi> will be at the <hi>ſecond Coming</hi> of the LORD. To make the <hi>Petrine Conflagration</hi> ſignify no more than the laying of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her Daughter in Aſhes: And to make the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and the <hi>New Earth</hi> ſignify no more than <hi>the Church State of the Goſpel.</hi> — Theſe are ſhameful Hallucinations. And as for the <hi>New Earth,</hi> before the Arrival of which no Man can reaſonably expect <hi>happy Times</hi> for the Church of GOD upon Earth, it is the greateſt Abſurdity to ſay that it will take Place before <hi>the Petrine Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and there is no Proſpect of arguing to any Purpoſe with ſuch as can talk ſo very ridiculouſly.</item>

IT is impoſſible to find any Inhabitants for the <hi>New Earth,</hi> but a ſet of People that ſhall eſcape the <hi>Conflagration.</hi> It is a Thing plainly revealed unto us, that our deſcending Redeemer, while yet at a further Diſtance than he will anon come, when he ſets <hi>Fire</hi> to the Earth, will by his Almighty Voice <hi>raiſe the Dead,</hi> whom he intends for Bleſſedneſs, ſo fetch them to him as to <hi>bring them with him:</hi> As he is going on in his nearer Approaches with his illuſtrious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to give Order for the tremendous <hi>Fire,</hi> he will hear the Cries of his choſen, called and faithful ones, and he will ſend <hi>His Angels</hi> to do for them as once for ELIJAH; Theſe <hi>Hundred and forty four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Servants of GOD and Walkers with HIM, that have <hi>the Mark</hi> of GOD upon them, when the <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> are going to <hi>hurt the Earth,</hi> ſhall be <hi>caught up to meet the LORD</hi> and with HIM they ſhall be in Safety, while they ſhall ſee the <hi>Earth</hi> flaming under them.

                  <p>THE Doctor was very much diſpleaſed with thoſe, who, propoſing rather to <hi>carp</hi> than to <hi>ſearch,</hi> think they have at once routed all Hopes to underſtand <hi>the Scriptures</hi> and ſecured an unintelligible <hi>Obſcurity and Ambiguity</hi> to the <hi>Divine Oracles</hi> only by demanding with an Air of Contempt, <hi>Where will you find Gog and Magog?</hi> They are not ordinarily capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Rational Anſwer till they have more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tho't on what is to arrive a <hi>thouſand Years</hi> before the Riſing of <hi>Gog and Magog.</hi> Suppoſe (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Doctor would not allow) the Queſtion to be unanſwerable: He would then ask, Is there no <hi>Queſtion</hi> concerning the <hi>Raiſed Bodies</hi> of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful which theſe People will confeſs cannot yet be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered?

                  <p>THUS I have given a brief Account of Dr. MATHER'S lateſt Sentiments concerning the <hi>ſacred Prophecies:</hi> I have been the more conciſe, becauſe I hope I ſhall procure a Publication of His <hi>Triparadiſus;</hi> which will give the World a more ample Account as well as Proof, of his Perſuaſion.</p>

                  <p>In one Sickneſs I find he was ſure all his <hi>Sins</hi> were <hi>pardoned,</hi> that he was above the <hi>Fear of Death</hi> and that he eſteemed <hi>Patience under Sickneſs</hi> to be better than Health it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>IN this Illneſs I likewiſe met with his Enquiries after the Reaſons why moſt Men chuſe rather to <hi>Live</hi> than to <hi>Dy?</hi> The Cauſes why the Generality deſire <hi>Life,</hi>

                     <p>WHEN I was pouring out my Prayers unto the LORD, I mentioned the <hi>Prolongation of my Life</hi> to enjoy and improve more Opportunities of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Him. In my Prayers, I humbly repreſented to the LORD, that there were two Objections againſt my <hi>dying,</hi> which <hi>my Fleſh</hi> would be ready to make; but thro' His Grace I had conquered them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, My <hi>Fleſh</hi> pleaded that the <hi>Comforts of Earth</hi> were too agreable Things to be eaſily forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

                     <p>Secondly, My <hi>Fleſh</hi> pleaded, What will become of my <hi>Offspring</hi> when I am gone? But my <hi>Faith</hi> is perſuaded and ſatisfied, that GOD will be a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to my <hi>Fatherleſs Offspring;</hi> and my LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom I have ſerved without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as many others would have done, to enrich my ſelf with a Portion for my Children, will marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly become ſuch a <hi>Guardian</hi> unto them, that they ſhall not <hi>want any good Thing.</hi>
                     </p>

THE uſual Method for the Publication of ſuch a Work, has been by SUBSCRIPTIONS, and in the Propoſals to give a computation of the number of Sheets, and the price of the Books to Subſcribers in Quires, and when Bound: But in the preſent Caſe the preciſe Number of Sheets cannot eaſily be known, which will occaſion ſomething of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>However, IT is ſuppoſed that the Work will be contained in <hi>Three Volumns</hi> in FOLIO, and may be afforded for between <hi>Three</hi> &amp; <hi>Four Pounds Sterling;</hi> and in <hi>New-England</hi> Money according as the Exchange ſhall then be. Whoever ſhall Subſcribe and Pay for <hi>Ten Sets</hi> ſhall have <hi>One</hi> Gratis, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably reduce the price. And as a farther Motive, it may be ſaid, That this Performance will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the Works of the Excellent POOL, BURRIT, or HENRY: It being the conſtant ſtudy of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to avoid it, and in this to add whatever other curious things have yet been publiſh'd on the ſacred Scriptures.</p>
