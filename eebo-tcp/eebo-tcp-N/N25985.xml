            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE American Philoſophical Society offered laſt year, among other premiums, one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars "for the beſt Syſtem of liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and literary inſtruction, adapted to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Government of the United States; comprehending alſo a plan for inſtituting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting public ſchools in this country, on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the moſt extenſive utility"—They reſerved to themſelves, however, the right of giving, in all caſes, ſuch part only of my premium propoſed, as the performance ſhould be adjudged to deſerve; or of withholding the whole, if it ſhould appear to have no merit above what may have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publiſhed on the ſubject. But candidates were aſſured that the Society would always judge liberally of their ſeveral claims.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:034558_0005_0FFE283F1EDB6618"/>
VARIOUS communications having, in conſequence, been received, the Society, at a ſtated meeting held on the 15th of December 1797, proceeded to the adjudication of the premium. Although none of the Syſtems of Education then under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view appeared to them ſo well adapted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Society in this Country, as could be wiſhed; yet conſidering the ſuperior merit of two of the performances, the one entitled "An Eſſay on Education;" the other, <q>Remarks on Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Illuſtrating the cloſe connection between Virtue and Wiſdom: To which is annexed, a Syſtem of liberal Education:</q> the Society adjudged to each of the authors a premium of 50 dollars, and ordered the Eſſays to be publiſhed. On open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſealed letters accompanying theſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, it appeared that the former was written by the REVD.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following pages were written in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 1796. They are preſented to the public with only a few verbal alterations, as they were then written. New ideas have ſince occurred to the author, and thoſe which are contained in the eſſay might, in many inſtances, have been better expreſſed. But as the production, as it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, received the premium, it was thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to make any ſubſtantial additions.</p>
            <p>As this performance may be read by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unacquainted with the author, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſtate that he neither claims the reverence due to age, nor the reſpect attached to eſtabliſhed reputation—The fewneſs of his years preclude the former, while his moderate attainments withhold the latter. If the efforts which he has made ſhall excite the genius of his fellow-citizens, and he ſhall prove, in a degree however limited, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of attracting the public attention to a ſubject of all others the moſt momentous, he will be rewarded to the extent of his wiſhes.</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON EDUCATION.</head>
            <p>THE man, who aſpires to the honour of forming a ſyſtem of education adapted to a republic, ſhould either poſſeſs the capacity of original reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that of improving, without adopting, the ideas of others. His hatred to vice, and averſion to error, ſhould be as ſtrong, as his attachment to virtue, and love of truth. He ſhould look upon the ſentiments of the dead with diſtruſt, and oppoſe with intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity the prejudices of the living. As the tribunal to which he appeals may be ſhrouded in deluſion, he muſt have the courage to rend the veil that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the light of truth. He muſt conſider the firſt ſuggeſtions of his own mind as treacherous; nor ſuffer them to form a link in his chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, till they ſhall have paſſed the ordeal of rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated inveſtigation. Having undergone this trial unimpaired, he will dare to hold them forth to truth, as her legitimate offſpring, and to prejudice, as her
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034558_0008_0FFE28420E7FF1D0"/>
merited ſcourge. No motive can bear him through this arduous performance, but a ſupreme ſenſe of duty, which, feeling ample retribution from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of doing good, neither ſolicits nor deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes general applauſe.</p>
            <p>THE two great objects of a correct education are to make men virtuous and wiſe.</p>
            <p>THE terms virtuous and wiſe, do not ſeem ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of abſolute definition. Accordingly, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to different perſons, and varying circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they preſent different aſpects; though it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nay probable, that the elements or firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of each, however modified by endleſs combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are the ſame. This hypotheſis derives ſome confirmation from the great affinity of one virtue to another, and the cloſe alliance between the ſeveral departments of ſcience and literature.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT attempting preciſe definition, it may be ſufficiently correct, ſo far as it regards the objects of this eſſay, to ſtyle VIRTUE that active exertion of our faculties, which, in the higheſt degree promotes our own happineſs and that of our fellow-men; and WISDOM, that intelligent principle, which improves our faculties, affords them the means of uſeful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determines the objects on which they are exerciſed.</p>
            <p>WHILE wiſdom and virtue have united, time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, to panegyriſe each other in reference to the general good they produce in the world, two
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034558_0009_0FFE27FEC0CA8B90"/>
queſtions of great importance have remained unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>I. WHETHER wiſdom and virtue are in any degree neceſſarily connected; and if they are, whether univerſally, or partially?</p>
            <p>II. WHETHER wiſdom, in its greateſt practical extenſion, would, if univerſally diffuſed, produce the greateſt portion of general happineſs?</p>
            <p>IT will be acknowledged that theſe points deſerve a patient diſcuſſion, as their deciſion will determine the definite objects of education; and as it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that man ſhould know the <hi>objects</hi> he deſires to accompliſh, before he can apply, with the proſpect of a ſucceſſful reſult, the <hi>means</hi> adapted to ſecure them.</p>
            <p>I. THE firſt enquiry is, "Whether wiſdom and virtue are, in any degree, neceſſarily connected; and if they are, whether univerſally, or partially?"</p>
            <p>IT has been the opinion of ſome diſtinguiſhed philoſophers that virtue and inſtinct are the ſame; and that a wiſe providence has not left the direction of the moral principle under the capricious and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble influence of reaſon: while others have contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that although man be by nature ignorant and entirely deſtitute of moral principle, yet that he poſſeſſes faculties capable of high improvement, if not of perfection itſelf. Both theſe ſyſtems, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their numerous votaries, are probably founded in error.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:034558_0010_0FFE28451B85FD70"/>
IF inſtinct and virtue be ſynonimous, it is clear, that where there is moſt inſtinct, there ſhould be moſt virtue, and that, as the brute creation poſſeſs inſtinct in a much higher degree than man, they muſt likewiſe poſſeſs virtue in a higher degree. This reſult will not be ſeriouſly contended for by any one. For, however ferocious and ignorant man may be, he is infinitely ſurpaſſed in theſe qualities by every animal that has the capacity of being fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. In this contraſt too, it is proper to obſerve, that, however the inſtinct of the brute may withhold him from doing injury, is ſeldom, if ever, inſpires him with the ardour of doing good.</p>
            <p>WERE inſtinct and virtue the ſame, it would be clear that the infant would be more virtuous than his fire, and the ſavage inhabitant of the foreſt more virtuous than the offſpring of civilization and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For the ears of the infant are open to the voice of nature alone, while thoſe of its parent are not altogether regardleſs of the dictates of reaſon. A preciſe analogy exiſts between the infant and its parent, and the ſavage and civilized man; the mind of the ſavage is ſtill in its infancy, while civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the expreſſion be allowed, imparts manhood to the mind.—If this point remain ſtill undecided in the mind of any, let it be aſked, if the ideot or the lunatic are ever eſteemed virtuous? It will then be ſeen that virtue without reaſon is a phantom which never exiſted.</p>
            <p>THOSE, who would aſcribe every thing to reaſon and nothing to nature, probably adopted their ideas,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034558_0011_0FFE2800462CD750"/>
more from a conviction, that the rival ſyſtem was falſe, than from any diſtinct conviction of the truth of their own; and from that diſpoſition of the mind, which makes us readily, if not eagerly, embrace the reverſe of that which we have found to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>TO affirm that becauſe education does much, it can therefore accompliſh every thing, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a maxim refuted by univerſal experience. Every circumſtance in this life partakes of a finite nature; and the power of education, however great, has doubtleſs its limits.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER difficult, if not impoſſible, it might be to gain the aſſent of ſome philoſophers to the ſyſtem of natural inequality in reference to virtue or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; they will, without heſitation, agree, that the phyſical part of man is infinitely modified by nature; they will alſo grant, that an infinite variety ſeems to be delighted in by the author of nature; and that this variety is moſt diſplayed in thoſe works, which abound, in the higheſt degree, with qualities that excite our admiration or regard. Both theſe inſtances, borrowed from material objects, furniſh ſtriking analogies, illuſtrative of the exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of variety of morality and intellect in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent minds uninfluenced by education. Is it to be believed that an object ſo important, as variety ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be in the eſtimation of the author of nature, ſhould be left to the controul of cauſes, operating ſo unequally, and in ſo contracted a ſphere, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034558_0012_0FFE28469ED5E3F0"/>
and civilization? Were it to depend entirely on theſe accidental circumſtance, might it not be highly endangered? Might it not be loſt?</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome things, which, however contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the refinements of philoſophy, will always continue to be held in ſecure belief by the good ſenſe of mankind. Such is the conviction of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral biaſs; of one perſon poſſeſſing genius; another, fancy; a third, memory; &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>THE deductions from this conciſe and neceſſarily ſuperficial view of a ſubject, in ſome reſpects intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, are, that nature is neither ſo liberal, nor edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſo omnipotent, as the rival ſyſtems affirm; that man is indebted to both; that certain paſſions are born with him, which he cannot exterminate, but may control; that a varied capacity is imparted to him, which, by education he can weaken or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. But, that ſtill the traces of nature are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his thoughts and actions; and that her voice never ceaſes to be heard amidſt all the refinements of art.</p>
            <p>BUT even granting, what is far from being the truth, that man, unenlightened by education, has engraven upon his heart certain great principles of duty, and is poſſeſſed of the means neceſſary for their diſcharge, it yet remains unconteſted, that theſe principles are few and undefined; and that they do not comprehend half the relations in which men ſtand towards each other. It follows, of courſe,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034558_0013_0FFE2805FA69DF68"/>
that they muſt be extended and improved, before they can anſwer the great purpoſes for which they were originally implanted in man, and ſubmitted to his guidance, modification and extenſion.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, it ſhould never be forgotten in diſcuſſions ſimilar to this, that man is already in a great degree civilized; and that though it may be poſſible for the ſavage to reſiſt the force of improvement, and remain unſhaken in his attachment to his original ſtate, yet that man, once civilized, has it not in his power to return to his natural condition. He may overturn all the trophies of the arts, he may conſign to the flames every veſtige of ſcience, he may extinguiſh every ſpark of genius; but he is ſtill unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce himſelf to the ſavage ſtate. We behold him more debaſed, perhaps, than the barbarian, but without his ferocity. The world abounds with ſcenes in which the triumphs of ſcience have been ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt brutal ignorance; over which fear, meanneſs, and indolence have ſpread their gloomy features; features the very oppoſite of thoſe which characterize the ſavage life.</p>
            <p>WE cannot, therefore, err in aſſuming it as a fact that virtue and wiſdom are in ſome degree neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily connected; that the crude wiſdom which nature beſtows is unequal to the production and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of virtue, ſuch as man in his purſuit of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs diſcovers it to be his intereſt to practice; and that to inſure this deſirable object, it is neceſſary
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034558_0014_0FFE284C5CB88230"/>
that the original faculties of the mind ſhould be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly exerciſed, extended, and ſtrengthened.</p>
            <p>IT ſtill remains to be conſidered whether wiſdom and virtue are partially or univerſally connected.</p>
            <p>IT is generally agreed that no being can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good without being perfectly wiſe. Such is the ſublime idea we form of deity. It will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that perfect goodneſs is not here made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſolely on the <hi>intention</hi> of the agent, but alſo on the <hi>good effected;</hi> as we now conſider virtue an efficient principle exerting all the energies of its nature.</p>
            <p>THE aſſertion that the man, who, without equall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this character, approaches it the neareſt, would partake in the higheſt degree of the divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, might be deemed correct, were not the world full of examples of men, who, though poſſeſſed of comprehenſive powers of mind, are not only defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the exerciſe of virtue, but actually famed for the moſt profligate indulgence in vice. This enigma, however, admits of eaſy ſolution. Great endowments of mind are ſo rare, that they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom diſplayed without exciting more envy than at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. He, who not only admires but eſteems another for his talents, muſt poſſeſs no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of talent himſelf; juſt as the beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a ſupreme love of virtue is a high regard for the ſource of all virtue. The claſs of men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of theſe qualities being ſmall, and that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034558_0015_0FFE280780ED32A8"/>
of different, if not hoſtile qualities, being very numerous, it is not ſurpriſing that reſentment and malice ſhould be active in their efforts to cruſh ſo formidable an adverſary. Thus the moſt unworthy means are uſed to nip in the bud talents qualified to enlarge the ſphere of human happineſs.</p>
            <p>HUMAN virtue has its limits. To be the object of unceaſing calumny and detraction, without ſighing for vengeance, would argue an apathy of heart by no means mortal. The ſubject of oppreſſion, has now, in his turn, recourſe to thoſe means, which had been ſo ſucceſſfully applied to his ruin; and finding them ſucceſſful, he throws away the crutch of truth for the ſtaff of deception. Ceaſing to feel an intereſt in that virtue which he had juſt ſeen ſo much deſpiſed, his ambition graſps objects which bring with them immediate gratification, and lull the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to a dangerous repoſe. Wealth, power, and pleaſure, throw out their gay and ſplendid ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and virtue is exiled from the heart in which it lately delighted to dwell.</p>
            <p>THIS would not be the caſe, if virtue and talents were as common as vice and ignorance. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a majority enliſt themſelves on the ſide of the former marks the aera of their eternal reign. This aera is that which all good and great men ſhould unite to haſten.</p>
            <p>FROM a review of hiſtory, it will appear, that juſt in proportion to the cultivation of ſcience and the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034558_0016_0FFE284DDE767E10"/>
arts has the happineſs of man advanced in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which cultivated them. And this aroſe in a great meaſure from this conſideration. The wants of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are few in its unimproved ſtate. Man of courſe is exempt from the neceſſity of making any great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for his ſupport. He is therefore indolent. Not dependent on another, for any thing which his heart holds dear, he is reſerved, diſtant, unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating in his deportment. He ſcarcely merits the epithet of a ſocial being. Of courſe, if his vices are not numerous, his virtues are ſtill leſs ſo.</p>
            <p>THE very reverſe of this takes place as ſociety im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. The deareſt part of man's happineſs, in this ſtage of his exiſtence, is connected with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of articles, which depend on the induſtry of one, who is alike dependent on him. Hence a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity of wants! Hence the origin of new and permanent regards, the parents of a thouſand now virtues! From what ſource do theſe proceed, but from the developement of reaſon, ſuggeſting to man the improvement of his ſituation? This improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems ſuſceptible of endleſs extenſion. Hence the concluſion, that reaſon in alliance with virtue admits of progreſſion without termination, and that the purity of the laſt is beſt ſecured by the ſtrength of the firſt.</p>
            <p>WE proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>II. WHETHER wiſdom itſelf, in its greateſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would, if univerſally diffuſed, produce the greateſt portion of general happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:034558_0017_0FFE280902A932B8"/>
THE affirmative ſide of this queſtion will be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by conſidering;</p>
            <p>THAT the diffuſion of knowledge actually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſome virtues, which without it would have no exiſtence, and that it ſtrengthens and extends all ſuch virtues as are generally deemed to have, in a limited degree, an exiſtence independent of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common attainments. And that,</p>
            <p>THE exerciſe of theſe virtues is the only certain means of ſecuring real happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE virtues, which are the excluſive and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate offſpring of an enlightened underſtanding, are thoſe which are diſconnected with any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time, perſon, or place. Exiſting without refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to theſe, a ſpirit of univerſal philanthropy is inſpired, that views the whole world as a ſingle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and tranſfers to it the feelings of regard which are indulged towards the moſt amiable of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. This ſentiment, free from the alloy of perſonal conſideration, or national attachment, lifts the mind to an elevation infinitely ſuperior to the ſenſation of individual regard, ſuperior to the ardent feelings of patriotiſm, and rivals, in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the enjoyment of the ſublime ideas we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect with the apprehenſion of the divine mind. This tone of mind muſt acknowledge congeniality with the nobleſt virtues. The mind is full and yet tranquil. The turbulence of paſſion is ſubdued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reverence of reaſon. Man feels himſelf too en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034558_0018_0FFE284F6224CC88"/>
to do a baſe or a mean thing. He yields to an irreſiſtible enthuſiaſm to atchieve whatever unites the higheſt portion of greatneſs with the largeſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodneſs. Language is inadequate to the deſcription of the feelings of a man thus inſpired; it haſtens to his actions, which can receive only a feeble delineation.</p>
            <p>IT will be found ſtill more unequivocally, that a diffuſion of knowledge ſtrengthens and extends all ſuch virtues as have in a limited degree an exiſtence, independent of uncommon attainments. This claſs of virtues comprehends thoſe which are created by the relation in which one man ſtands to another, and which are the baſis of what may be denominated common duty.</p>
            <p>THE diſcretion with which man is veſted implies the neceſſity of ſome knowledge. Were it not for this poſſeſſion, he would be the ſport of caſualty and accident. He would nominally be his own maſter, but really a ſlave to ſome unknown power.</p>
            <p>NATURE appears to have been liberal in its endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to moſt of her offſpring, as far as reſpects the preſervation of each ſpecies; but to have been leaſt liberal in this reſpect to man; doubtleſs becauſe ſhe has laviſhed her bounty in imparting to him alone the capacity of gradual and large improvement.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of original depravity here affords a forcible illuſtration. It is not material to decide
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034558_0019_0FFE280D68BDA448"/>
whether this belief be correctly true in the extent to which ſome writers have carried it; or whether the alleged depravity be a crime, or only a defect. It is ſufficient that ſuch a belief almoſt univerſally prevails, and that all mankind acknowledge the vaſt intermediate ſpace that lies between the barrenneſs of the ſtate of nature, and the improvement effected by a liberal education. This general opinion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is alike authoritative in regard to virtue as well as reaſon. If it has any ſuperior application, it tends more to eſtabliſh, in the natural ſtate, the abſence of virtue than of intellect.</p>
            <p>ALL agree that virtue can never be carried too far. But does not the truth of this remark depend entirely upon the manner in which virtue is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or more properly, perhaps, on an accurate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it? If this be true, will not the greateſt portion of virtue be aſcribed to the man, who, with given means, accompliſhes the moſt good? And is not this the ſame with ſaying that virtue in its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exerciſe requires the greateſt attainments? If it be enquired what theſe attainments ſhould be, it may be replied that, as all knowledge is ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of practical application, and is abuſed when it does not receive ſuch application, it is improper to fix any limits to the improvement of the mind, which in proportion to its extenſion is qualified to effect general good.</p>

            <p>THE duties of men are preciſely co-extenſive with their knowledge. If that be granted, which cannot be denied, that every man is bound to do all the good he can, then follows clearly the obligation of every one to enlarge the powers of his mind, as the only means of extending the ſphere of his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>IT has been obſerved, in refutation of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that half the knowledge of which philoſophy boaſts, withdraws the mind from uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by occupying it with conſiderations of idle curioſity and unproductive ſpeculation. But if it be enquired by whom this obſervation has been made, it will appear that literature and ſcience diſclaim it; that it has generally ariſen from the indolence and envy of ignorance, or ſprung from the malice of blaſted pretenſions. It is true that he whoſe years revolve in acquiring, without uſing, learning, is even more ſelfiſh and criminal than the miſer, as he hoards from ſociety a greater good; and, in this view of the ſubject, what Bacon ſays is ſtrictly juſt;</p>

            <p>BUT has that ſcience been ever named, the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which is entirely unconnected with the general good? Has not aſtronomy, now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the moſt ſublime of ſtudies, which unites whatever is great and aſtoniſhing both on the moral and phyſical ſcale, been the theme of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious ignorance and folly? Has not chemiſtry been aſſailed by the too ſucceſſful ſatire of illiterate wit? That ſatire which now faſtens on the departments of Natural Hiſtory and Botany? Has not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attempted to identify aſtronomy and profani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and for a time ſucceeded? And yet aſtronomy [Note A.] now holds, by an undiſſenting voice, and elevated rank among the ſciences; and chemiſtry, notwithſtanding the philoſopher's ſtone, unfolds, every day, its high practical importance; and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which, at firſt, promiſed only cold ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive truth, have produced the greateſt practical good. [Note B.]</p>
            <p>IT is worthy of remark, that all kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are intimately allied, and that the perfection of one department if ſcience depends as much on the advancement of other departments, as it does on the accurate developement of its own peculiar principles [Note C.] All excluſive devotedneſs of

the mind to one branch of knowledge, inſtead of enlarging, will impair it. Inſtead of furniſhing it with truth, it will burthen it with error. Of this tendency Locke relates ſeveral whimſical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>"A METAPHYSICIAN," he ſays, <q>will bring plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gardening immediately to abſtract notions; an alchymiſt will reduce divinity to the maxims of his laboratory, and allegoriſe the ſcriptures into the philoſopher's ſtone. And I heard once a man, who had more than ordinary excellence in muſic, ſeriouſly accommodate Moſes's ſeven days of the firſt week, to the ſeven notes of muſic, as thence had been taken the meaſure and method of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> He, therefore, who grants it to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that one ſcience ſhould be deeply explored, yields more than the ſuperficial obſerver imagines. He acknowledges the propriety of applying all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means, and theſe will be found to embrace a conſiderable acquaintance with almoſt every branch of knowledge.</p>
            <p>WERE a ſpecification to be made of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances moſt cloſely connected with the happineſs of man, it would appear in how eminent a degree they are promoted by a cultivated underſtanding.</p>
            <p>UNDER the head of morals, it would appear, that the virtues appropriate to a family would be ſecured as well as rendered more captivating; ſecured by the enlightened conviction of the intimate convecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034558_0023_0FFE28133300F608"/>
between duty and intereſt: rendered more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating by their borrowing a new character from the liberal ſpirit inſpired by reaſon. To the natural tie of parental regard would be added the grateful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation excited in the mind of a child from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of new ideas, and the production, of courſe, of new pleaſures. To the magic of inſtinct would be ſuperadded the charm of reflection.</p>
            <p>THE ſenſe of juſtice and honeſty would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the folly of injuſtice and diſhoneſty. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a general illumination of mind to prevail, the means of detecting, and the conſequences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, diſhoneſty, would be ſo eaſy and ſerious, that every rational being would ſee his intereſt inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with juſtice and honeſty.</p>
            <p>PATRIOTISM, a virtue which has fertilized the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren rock and given the greateſt expanſion to the mind and the heart, would become a ſteady and a rational principle. Founded on an unprejudiced attachment to country, we ſhould ceaſe to glory in error, ſolely becauſe it proceeded from our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Love of country would impel us to transfuſe into our own ſyſtem of economy every improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment offered by other countries. In this caſe, we ſhould not be attached ſo much to the ſoil, as to the inſtitutions and manners, of our country.</p>
            <p>IN phyſics, it would appear, that in proportion to the extenſion of philoſophical reſearch, new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and relations are diſcovered between natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034558_0024_0FFE2859B66AE0B0"/>
objects, which reſult in diſcoveries of high prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical uſe; promoting whatever tends to the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and comfort of ſocial life, enlarging the ſphere of harmleſs gratification, and giving birth to new, and frequently ingenious occupations.</p>
            <p>IT remains to be conſidered, whether the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the enumerated virtues, be not the only mean of ſecuring real happineſs.</p>
            <p>No neceſſity is believed to exiſt, to prove, that a ſyſtem of pure ſelfiſhneſs is hoſtile in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to happineſs. If this ſyſtem ſhould find any advocates but thoſe whoſe object it is to dazzle by ingenuity and wit, inſtead of convincing by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would appeal to the univerſal odium at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to an indulgence of thoſe paſſions which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre entirely in ſelfiſh enjoyment. Avarice, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, monaſtic ſecluſion, are all now the objects of impartial execration, while the practiſer of theſe ſelfiſh indulgencies holds in as great contempt the world which deſpiſes him, and feels himſelf inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent only in wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not dwell longer on this ſubject, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, from what has been already ſaid, and from that which muſt obviouſly ſuggeſt itſelf to every mind, that the exerciſe of feelings which lead to beneficent actions is the ſureſt pledge of internal happineſs.</p>

WHETHER reaſon itſelf would be fertile in the production of virtue need not be decided. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that reaſon is only that power which directs the paſſions to their fit objects, and determines the force with which they ought to be applied. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau ſays, <q>It is by the activity of our paſſions, that our reaſon improves; we covet knowledge merely becauſe we court enjoyment, and it is impoſſible to conceive, why a man exempt from fears and deſires ſhould take the trouble to reaſon. The paſſions, in their turn, owe their origin to our wants.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau on Inequality of mankind, 8 vo. Edit. p. 40.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE paſſions, as imparted by nature, are few, but impetuous. The whole energy of the ſoul here ſpeaks in every word and action. The conduct of one individual to another, in proportion as man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a more correct knowledge of duty, becomes the ſubject of a certain portion, often a moderate one, of praiſe or blame, of reward or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, accordingly, civilized man is as cautious in pronouncing an opinion on the conduct of the perſon who invites his ſtrictures, as unbridled paſſion is impetuous and raſh. The laſt knows no gradations between virtue and vice, and of courſe loves or hates in the extremeſt degree. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that man is miſerable; as miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from the conſciouſneſs of ill directed ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance or miſapplied regard, as from the ſenſe of undeſerved reſentment.</p>
            <p>

IN proportion to the advancement of the arts and ſciences, the paſſions are increaſed in number, and abridged in force, by the diverſity of objects which ſolicit their exerciſe. Man, reduced from a ſullen ſtate of independence, becomes the ſubject of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable wants, the centre of innumerable pleaſures. Avarice, ſo congenial to ignorance and indolence, is robbed of more than half is violence by the love of pleaſure, and a regard to popular opinion. It never fails to be as much weakened in the vortex of activity, as it is cheriſhed in the liſtleſſneſs of ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In large commercial towns there are few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. In monaſteries they abound. Beſides the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of acquiring more keep afloat immenſe rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which circulate till they become the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of an heir, who ſeldom feels a diſpoſition to hoard them.</p>
            <p>PITY is ſaid by ſome writers to be the ſtrongeſt paſſion of nature. But how does it operate?—Upon every object it meets. Accident accompliſhes every thing. Entirely mechanical, it as frequently encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages vice, as it relieves virtue. Whereas knowledge produces diſcernment and diſcrimination. The benevolence of an improved mind is virtue, becauſe it aids merit in diſtreſs; natural pity is often vice, becauſe it is blind, and as frequently aſſiſts the wicked as the good; perhaps oftener, as virtue is more averſe to ſolicitation than vice.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider the different effects of pity and benevolence, as here diſtinguiſhed, on the perſon
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034558_0027_0FFE2817E13868E8"/>
who exerciſes them. Pity is a mere natural impulſe; there is no merit in obeying its voice; the good which it does is forgotten as ſoon as accompliſhed; all the happineſs it affords is confined to a moment, and this is an unreflecting happineſs; it is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of an infant.—Benevolence, on the contrary, is never practiſed without reflection. It chooſes its objects with care, which when choſen it is liberal in rewarding. It does not give to depravity the debt due to virtue, and thereby generate ſelf-reproach. Virtue and merit are its creditors, to whom it ever ſtruggles to be juſt. Gratitude, almoſt unknown to the diſpenſer of pity, is the offſpring of benevolence. Remembrance recals, perhaps heightens, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures excited by the good effected; and he, who is actuated by enlightened benevolence, is amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by his own feelings, independently of the treatment he may receive from the object of his bounty, or the propitious influence of his actions on his future peace.</p>
            <p>THE ſame remarks, illuſtrating the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the paſſions of the ignorant and the wiſe, might be extenſively applied with but little variation. Suffice it in addition to ſay that with the wiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is ſupplanted by duty, caprice by conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Emulation and competition too come in with all their forces, and, perhaps, produce more virtue in the world than they found in it. [Note D.]</p>
            <p>HE who has been accuſtomed to feel within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the reſource of reflection, and the capacity of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034558_0028_0FFE285F912A41B0"/>
improvement, delights in abſtracting his attention from grovelling purſuits, and in diſengaging himſelf from the ſordid cares of low occupation. However impoſſible it be for him entirely to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from theſe engagements, yet he always poſſeſſes an unexhauſted treaſure, on which he may draw, when oppreſſed with them. Neither the mind nor the body ſeem deſigned for one uniform employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The more extenſive the objects, therefore, within the reach of man, the larger is his circle of enjoyment. Hiſtory enforces the truth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. Who more happy as well as diſtinguiſhed, than they who alternately exchanged the plough for the cloſet; who now procured food for the body, and now ſought food for the mind? Who more unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valled in tranquil pleaſure, in unambitious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſplendid conſideration, than Cincinnatus?</p>
            <p>THAT man ſeems, on the whole, to be the moſt happy, who poſſeſſed of a large ſtock of ideas, is in the conſtant habit of encreaſing them, and whom every hour of his exiſtence renders more informed. The energy of ſuch a mind is almoſt without limits; it admits of conſtant activity; for when fatigued with one train of ideas, it finds repoſe in another. A rich variety of enjoyment is ever before it, the bare conſciouſneſs of poſſeſſing which is ſufficient of itſelf to make it happy.</p>
            <p>SOME notice is due to the objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between knowledge and happineſs. It is ſaid that a refinement of ideas diſinclines the mind
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034558_0029_0FFE281D8E79EAD8"/>
to an attention to common objects, to which a very moderate degree of reflection is equal. This objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it has any preſent force at all, would be wholly removed by that knowledge becoming common which is now rare. We now find it to be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exclamation that proſperity is altogether owing to accident, and this remark is ſanctioned, in ſome meaſure, by the concurrence of the wiſe as well as the uninformed. This ariſes from the imperfection of human knowledge, whereby men obtain a good deſired, not through the fit means as diſcovered by reaſon, but as ſuggeſted by accident. Hence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is ſo often repugnant to availing itſelf of the means of acquiring a deſirable object, that it is frequently coerced into them, contrary to its wiſhes. Hence the affairs of the world are called a lottery, where fortune preſides, and reaſon is blind.</p>
            <p>As, however, every effect is inſeparable from its cauſe, and as the events of this life, which men moſt covet, depend upon cauſes, which the improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind without doubt poſſeſſes the power of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, the time may and probably will arrive, in which by far the greater part, if not the whole, of thoſe things, at preſent the gift of accident, will be the reward of virtue and reflection. It will then be as great a phenomenon for wiſdom not to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by proſperity, as it is now to be connected with it, even in reference to thoſe objects which it ever will deem ſubordinate.</p>

ONE philoſopher of great diſtinction, it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has ſaid that were man to conſult his real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he would never reflect; intimating that the act of reflection is injurious to health. This asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on ſcience can be traced, as it regards Rouſſeau, to no better origin, than that of a mind, inconſiſtent with itſelf, and diſcontented with every preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. The mind of Rouſſeau was, without doubt, a great one; it emitted, as copiouſly as geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us or fancy could deſire, the ſparks of a noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which dared to diſdain the ſhackles of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and break the chains of ignorance. But it muſt be allowed, that in thoſe caſes which admitted of perſonal application, he groſsly erred, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuffered his ſtrong ſenſe to be overruled by his inexplicable feelings. Complete refutation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will be the portion of this injurious remark, by conſidering the perſevering zeal, which has cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized the conduct of the cultivators of ſcience; by conſidering their unanimous opinion that the moment which gives birth to a new thought is a period of unrivalled enjoyment, which has been compared to the feelings of deity at the creation; [Note E.] and laſtly, by conſidering that longevity has, in a remarkable degree, been the reward of thoſe, who have cultivated ſcience. Let any one, who doubts this fact, conſult a biographical dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all the prejudices he ever poſſeſſed on the ſubject muſt vaniſh; he will grant that as the mind depends on the exerciſe of the body for its vigor, ſo the health of the body, in its turn, is promoted
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034558_0031_0FFE281F0F9614F0"/>
by the active employment of the faculties of the mind.</p>
            <p>ONE great objection cannot be here overlooked; its diſcuſſion is highly important from its connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with numerous prejudices, and particularly with the paſſion of avarice. It will be ſaid that though refined happineſs be intimately connected with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and knowledge, yet that this kind of happineſs was never deſigned for the maſs of any nation, as their ſubſiſtence depends entirely on labour, and the productiveneſs of labour depends on the time devoted to it.</p>
            <p>IT only requires a zealous diſpoſition to embrace <hi>what ought to be,</hi> inſtead of clinging to <hi>what is,</hi> to diſarm this objection of all its force. It is granted that a ſmall portion of that time, which is at preſent occupied by the labour of the body, will, ſhould theſe ideas be adopted, be abſorbed in the exerciſe of the mind. But it ſhould be obſerved;</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT it is not true, as implied in the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the mind and body are incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneous employment. So far is this from being a fact, that ſome activity of body is abſolutely neceſſary to vigorous reflection. The more ſevere the reflection, the more likely is the ſtudent to be involved in even involuntary exerciſe. Viewing this objection with the greateſt partiality, it can only apply to thoſe ſtudies that require the higheſt abſtraction of mind, which will forever be confined
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034558_0032_0FFE2866C3B43E00"/>
to a few. Thoſe trains of thought, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with practical improvement, will be aided rather than impaired by labour, if it be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſevere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The actual labour neceſſary to ſubſiſt man is much leſs than that which occupies the whole of his time. The hours at preſent devoted to labour are about twelve. Let us ſuppoſe theſe to be abridged by bringing them down to ten. A queſtion occurs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this diminution of time will leſſen the maſs of articles of neceſſity or convenience fabricated?—The ſolution of this queſtion either affirmatively or negatively is of little conſequence, though from the firſt ſuggeſtions of the mind it would ſeem impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. It is not probable it would produce the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution ſuppoſed; becauſe ten hours of active labour may in their reſult be equal to twelve; as there is a protraction of labour deſtructive of all energy. This is ſo abundantly illuſtrated in the caſe of ſlaves, compared with freemen, that the fact needs only to be mentioned to be deciſive; but yielding for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ten hours of manual labour will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo much as twelve, will not more be gained by improved modes of labour, than is loſt by this dereliction of two hours? Will not the habit of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and progreſſive improvement continually deviſe new means of accompliſhing a given object? Have not the powers of machinery already given a new creation to manufactures? And is not agriculture equally ſuſceptible of improvement?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:034558_0033_0FFE282091E89840"/>
BUT granting that this abridgment of labour would diminiſh the articles of uſe, is it unequivocal that this effect would be an evil? The neceſſaries of life would ſtill be produced in abundance. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life produced would be fully equal to a moderate indulgence of its pleaſures. The only deficiency exiſting would apply to articles of luxury. And whether theſe ought to be encouraged or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed cannot be a queſtion in a ſtate of ſociety in which every man is a candidate for equal happineſs. An indulgence in luxury is a ſelfiſh enjoyment, which may be ſaid to ſeduce every one from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The leſs, therefore, it prevails, the better for virtue and general happineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE relative wealth of individuals, under this arrangement, would remain the ſame with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old one, as far as it applied to the citizens of the United States. Some ſmall difference might be produced between the relative wealth of the United States and that of foreign nations; but its effects ſeem too unimportant to be dwelt on.</p>
            <p>LET us, then, conſider a moderate increaſe of the hours of reflection, and a ſmall decreaſe of thoſe of labour, as a leading feature in a ſyſtem of republican education. He, who thinks frequently, imbibes a habit of independence, and of ſelf-eſteem, which are perhaps the great and the only preſervatives of virtue. Let us conſider this feature as new, and as one which would be happily diſtinctive. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the prerogative of political virtue to enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034558_0034_0FFE286847D64960"/>
man, as much as it is the aſſumption of political vice to degrade him.</p>
            <p>A REVIEW of what I have written convinces me that I have entered a field which ſeems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no limits. Points of morality and expedience occur in profuſion, whoſe elucidation ſtill demands the higheſt talents, after having employed, for ages, the deepeſt powers of reſearch.</p>
            <p>IN the ſubſequent part of my remarks, I ſhall, to avoid prolixity, aim at the moſt rigid conciſeneſs, and truſt almoſt entirely to the reader for an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of what I ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE diffuſion of knowledge, co-extenſive with that of virtue, would ſeem to apply with cloſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to a republican ſyſtem of education, becauſe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. AN enlightened nation is always moſt tenacious of its rights.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is not the intereſt of ſuch a ſociety to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate error; as it undoubtedly is the intereſt of many ſocieties differently organized.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN a republic, the ſources of happineſs are open to all without injuring any.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF happineſs be made at all to depend on the improvement of the mind, and the colliſion of mind with mind, the happineſs of an individual will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the general diffuſion of knowledge and a capacity to think and ſpeak correctly.</p>

5. UNDER a Republic, duly conſtructed, man feels as ſtrong a biaſs to improvement, as under a deſpotiſm he feels an impulſe to ignorance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>WE have now reached the goal of the preceding ſpeculations. The neceſſary limits to an eſſay of this nature have prohibited minute illuſtration; but it has, we hope, been made to appear, with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>PHILOSOPHY, which is but another word for experience, has decided the happineſs of man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the labour of the body and the exerciſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034558_0036_0FFE2869CA59F2B8"/>
of the mind. It had been well for mankind, had the human race in its earlieſt age been under the control of principles of legiſlation, which by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious apportionment of the hours of reflection to thoſe of labour, had produced in infancy and youth habits deſtined from their ſtrength to remain unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in advanced age. Had the voice of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy dictated ſuch a ſyſtem, it would have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on theſe principles. Bare ſubſiſtence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires certain articles, which are the product of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Theſe are neceſſaries of life, and muſt be obtained by labour. Convenience demands a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupply, the furniſhing of which would occupy an additional period of labour. This convenience is eſſentially connected with happineſs, mental as well as corporeal. Labour would, therefore, have been called upon to ſatiſfy the claims of neceſſity and convenience; it would have been unſeduced by the allurements of luxury.</p>
            <p>UNFORTUNATELY for mankind no ſuch ſyſtem has been adopted. It has ſcarcely even been thought of. The novelty of the plan forms no objection to its truth. If it poſſeſs decided advantages, let us dare to believe human virtue equal to its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen that in a nation, in which the hours of labour ſhould be abridged, and thoſe of reflection increaſed, no injury would be ſuſtained by individuals, and little, if any, by the nation itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:034558_0037_0FFE282949510E38"/>
IT were a vain attempt, however, inſtantaneouſly to inſpire with a love of ſcience men from whoſe minds reflection has long been alienated. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement propoſed muſt be the effect of a ſyſtem of education gradually and cautiouſly developed.</p>
            <p>PREVIOUSLY to any proſpect of ſucceſs, one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple muſt prevail. Society muſt eſtabliſh the right to educate, and acknowledge the duty of having educated, all children. A circumſtance, ſo momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly important, muſt not be left to the negligence of individuals. It is believed, that this principle is recogniſed in almoſt all our ſtate conſtitutions. If ſo, the exerciſe of it would not be conteſted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whether at preſent acknowledged or not, it would produce ſuch beneficial effects, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the parent as the child, that a general acquieſcence might be relied on. [Note F.]</p>
            <p>HAVING contemplated in reference to man an abatement of two hours of labour, the next object of enquiry is what time ſhould be devoted to the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth. It ſhould unqueſtionably be much larger; as during this period the mind is unimprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as impreſſions of the greateſt ſtrength are rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made; and as the future biaſs of the mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depends upon the improvement of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The period, however, ſhould have its limits. Study ſhould never be continued after it becomes oppreſſive. The preceptor ſhould be as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in uſing every mean neceſſary to prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034558_0038_0FFE286F79683290"/>
as he ought to be zealous in exciting a thirſt of knowledge. Without aiming at rigid preciſion, in conſidering the claims of labour and ſtudy, we ſhall not, perhaps, materially err in aſſigning four hours each day to education.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>THE objects proper to be accompliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that the principle of an univerſal diffuſion of knowledge ſhould be in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree energetic. This is a principle which cannot be too extenſively embraced; for it is too true, that all the efforts of an enlightened zeal will never make a whole nation as well informed as its intereſts would preſcribe.</p>
            <p>BUT this neceſſary limit forms no objection to every practicable extenſion of it. We ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with irrefragable evidence of its beneficial tendency, on conſidering that knowledge has only produced injurious effects, when it has been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of monopoly. The efforts of ignorance to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſcience have excited a ſpirit of retaliation, which we muſt not be ſurpriſed at beholding, in its turn, its own avenger. The moment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which marks the univerſal diffuſion of ſcience, by withdrawing the temptation to, as well as the means of, injury, will reſtore knowledge to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal purity and luſtre. It is with knowledge, as with every other thing which influences the human mind. It acts preciſely in proportion to the force of the object acted upon. As the beggar cannot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034558_0039_0FFE282ACBC42560"/>
by gold the beggar; ſo neither can opulence corrupt opulence. In the ſame manner, equality of intellectual attainments is a foe to oppreſſion; and juſt as mankind ſhall advance in its poſſeſſion, the means as well as the inducement to oppreſs will be annihilated. We are correct, therefore, in declaring a diffuſion of knowledge, the beſt, perhaps the only pledge of virtue, of equality, and of independence.</p>
            <p>LET us, then, with mental inflexibility, believe that though all men will never be philoſophers, yet that all men may be enlightened; and that folly, unleſs ariſing from phyſical origin, may be baniſhed from the ſociety of men. [Note G.]</p>
            <p>THE ideas already expreſſed, and thoſe which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, muſt be underſtood as applicable to a ſyſtem of general education. They only preſcribe what it is neceſſary every man ſhould know. They do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to limit his acquiſitions. Wealth and genius will always poſſeſs great advantages. It will be their prerogatives, if properly directed, to carry improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to its higheſt eminences.</p>
            <p>IN forming a ſyſtem of liberal education, it is neceſſary to avoid ideas of too general a character, as well as thoſe which involve too minute a ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Conſiderable latitude muſt be allowed for the different degrees of natural capacity, and the vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhades of temper and biaſs. It ſeems, therefore, fit to lay down principles which poſſeſs properties common to every mind, and which will, of courſe,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034558_0040_0FFE282C4FB88170"/>
in their application, admit of few, if any, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>THE firſt great object of a liberal ſyſtem of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould be, the admiſſion into the young mind of ſuch ideas only as are either abſolutely true, or in the higheſt degree probable; and the cautious excluſion of all error.</p>
            <p>WERE man able to trace every effect to its cauſe, he would probably find that the virtue or the vice of an individual, the happineſs or the miſery of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the glory or the infamy of a nation, have had their ſources in the cradle, over which the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of a nurſe or a mother have preſided. The years of infancy are thoſe in which the chains of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or of vice are generally forged. Firſt impreſſions are almoſt omnipotent. Their reign is ſilent, but not on that account the leſs ſecure. The mind no ſooner begins to unfold itſelf than it graſps with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs every new idea. Intoxicated, as it were, with pleaſure at its reception, it ſurrenders itſelf more to enjoyment than reflection. Indeed, it has now the capacity to enjoy, but not to reflect. In proportion to the length of time any idea occupies the mind, does it acquire ſtrength and produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. And no ſooner have theſe ends been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, than it conſtitutes itſelf the judge of every other reſembling or oppoſing idea. Hence it tyrannizes with deſpotic authority.</p>
            <p>IF this view be correct, ſhould it not be thought treaſon againſt truth and virtue, to inſtil prejudice
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034558_0041_0FFE2871013C3D08"/>
and error into the young mind? If this be treaſon againſt truth and virtue, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe who inculcate principles which they know to be falſe, and attempt in this way to eſtabliſh ſyſtems that only exiſt in the midſt of human carnage and deſtruction?</p>
            <p>WHETHER we conſider man's exiſtence as termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the grave, or view him, as he doubtleſs is, the heir of a future life, we muſt conſider his happineſs as altogether dependent on the obſervance of certain moral principles. The univerſality with which theſe have been received may be conſidered as the teſt of their truth. Theſe principles are few and ſimple. As the mind expands they ſhould be explained. They require no other aid than clear illuſtration. The unperverted underſtanding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges their truth as it were by intuition. [Note H.]</p>
            <p>LET then thoſe truths in which all men agree be firmly impreſſed; let thoſe which are probable be inculcated with caution, and let doubt always hang over thoſe reſpecting which the good and the wiſe diſagree. Above all things let the infant mind be protected from conviction without proof.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be ſaid that in almoſt all the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a general plan of education, the peruſal of approved books muſt be chiefly relied on. The indiſpenſable economy of arrangements which are to pervade a whole ſociety, will prohibit the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034558_0042_0FFE282F350D38F8"/>
of preceptors of either great or original talents. It will therefore be fit that the preceptor, inſtead of inculcating his own immature ideas, ſhould be guided by preſcribed works. It is aſked, where performances explaining and enforcing plain and undeniable truths, and avoiding prejudices or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, are to be found? Such productions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be rare. It is alſo granted that this difficulty preſents one of the moſt ſerious obſtacles to ſucceſsful education. But it is not inſurmounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is attempted to be removed, as will appear hereafter, by offering large rewards for books of this nature, and by inciting the learned by other inducements to embark in ſo noble a ſervice. At preſent we muſt be ſatisfied in giving the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe works which abound moſt with truth and are the moſt exempt from error.</p>
            <p>THE elements of education, <abbr>viz.</abbr> reading and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are ſo obviouſly neceſſary, that it is uſeleſs to do more than enumerate them.</p>
            <p>OF nearly equal importance are the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mathematics, as at preſent almoſt univerſally taught.</p>
            <p>A TOLERABLY correct idea of Geography would ſeem, in a Republic eſpecially, to involve great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The intereſt of the mercantile part of the community is cloſely connected with correct geographical knowledge. Many important depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſcience include an accurate knowledge of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:034558_0043_0FFE2872852D9F60"/>
it. But the moſt important conſideration is that which contemplates the United States as either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied in friendſhip, or arrayed in hoſtility, with the other nations of the earth. In both which caſes, it becomes the duty of the citizen to have juſt ideas of the poſition, ſize, and ſtrength, of nations, that he may as much as poſſible, confide in his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in forming an opinion of our foreign relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtead of yielding his mind to a dangerous credulity. A moſt intereſting part of Geography relates to a knowledge of our own country. Correct information on this ſubject will always conduce to ſtrengthen the bands of friendſhip, and to diſſipate the miſrepreſentations of party prejudice.</p>
            <p>THE cultivation of natural philoſophy, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſo far as it relates to agriculture and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, has been heretofore almoſt entirely neglected. The benefits, however, which it would produce, are great, both as they regard the happineſs of the individual, and as they regard national wealth. Many of the labours of the farmer and the mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, ſo far from forbidding reflection, invite it. Thus the conſtant developement of new beauties in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the almoſt as conſtant production of new wonders in art, extort admiration from the moſt ignorant, and even impreſs their minds with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable delight. And yet how little do they know of the energies of nature or art? Loſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of effects, the tribute of a grateful mind finds vent in ſimple wonder.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:034558_0044_0FFE2834E749F008"/>
IF we reverſe the ſcene, and behold the farmer enlightened by the knowledge of chemiſtry, how wide a field of reflection and pleaſure, as well as profit, would acknowledge his empire?</p>
            <p>THE ingenuity of the mechanic would not long remain paſſive. Repeated efforts at improvement would often prove ſucceſsful, and be the ſource of new and rapid wealth. At any rate in all theſe caſes, whether proſpered with the expected ſucceſs or not, an adequate compenſation would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the mind thus employed, whoſe thoughts generally bring with them their own reward.</p>
            <p>THE circumſcribed advantages, attending Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical knowledge, will be greatly enlarged by a liberal acquaintance with Hiſtory. In proportion as this branch of education ſhall be cultivated, men will ſee the mighty influence of moral principle, as well on the private individuals of a community, as on thoſe who are called to preſide over its public concerns. It will be diſtinctly ſeen, that ambition has generally riſen on a deſtruction of every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of virtue, and that it much oftener merits execration than applauſe. Power, long enjoyed, will appear to be hoſtile to the happineſs, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the integrity, of the individual in whom it centres. Fanaticiſm and ſuperſtition will appear ſurrounded with blood and torture. War will ſtand forth with the boldeſt prominence of vice and folly, and make it, for a while, doubtful, whether man is moſt a villain or a fool. In ſhort the mirror which
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034558_0045_0FFE28366A7527E8"/>
hiſtory preſents will manifeſt to man what, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he will become, ſhould he ſurrender himſelf up to thoſe ſelfiſh purſuits, which centering in his own fame alone, have ennabled him without horror to wade through the blood and the tears of millions.</p>
            <p>THIS horrid truth, confirmed by every page of hiſtory, will reſtrain, as it undoubted has reſtrained, the indulgence of furious paſſion. The immortal admiration attached to great and diſintereſted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the immortal deteſtation inſeparable from great and ſelfiſh vice, will furniſh the mind at once with the ſtrongeſt incentives to the one, and the livelieſt abhorrence of the other.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond leading object of education, ſhould be to inſpire the mind with a ſtrong diſpoſition to improvement.</p>
            <p>IT is acknowledged that ſcience is ſtill in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. The combination of ideas is infinite. As this combination advances the circle of knowledge is enlarged, and of courſe, the ſphere of happineſs extended. At preſent ſcience is only cultivated by a few recluſe ſtudents, too apt to mingle the illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of imagination with the reſults of indiſtinct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Hence the reproach that theory and practice oppoſe each other. But no ſooner ſhall a whole nation be tributary to ſcience, than it will dawn with new luſtre. To adopt a phyſical illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its rays may be expected to meet with little abſorption from ignorance, but to be reflected
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034558_0046_0FFE2876DA860A00"/>
with additional luſtre, from every object they ſtrike.</p>
            <p>THE moſt ſplendid diſcoveries have not been made by philoſophers of profound erudition and abſtracted reflection, but by men of moderate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and correct obſervation. They have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſteady and patient obſervation.</p>
            <p>WERE the progreſs of a mind to improvement attended with no other effects than internal delight, it would ſtill deſerve the higheſt rank among thoſe objects which produce happineſs. Baniſhing from the mind all thoſe ſenſations of indifference, ennui, and vacancy, which produce effects the more cruel from their being almoſt wholly without remedy, it would give to exiſtence a thouſand new charms; not fleeting, but conſtant and always at command. The periods of youth and of active life would be invigorated, the cloſe of exiſtence would become a bleſſing inſtead of a burthen. Is there any thing in exiſtence more intereſting than an old man, whoſe mind is ſtored with wiſdom, and whoſe heart is full of ſenſibility?</p>
            <p>WERE it ſuppoſed probable that any objection would be made to a vigorous ſpirit of reſearch, an appeal might be made to the words of Dr. Clarke, alike eminent for diſtinction in virtue and ſcience: <q>A free and impartial inquiry into truth is far from being reprehenſible. On the contrary, it is a diſpoſition which every man ought in himſelf to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034558_0047_0FFE283951491068"/>
labour after, and to the utmoſt of his power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage in others. It is the great foundation of all our knowledge, of all true virtue, and of all ſincere religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS progreſſive improvement would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, in the third place, by inſpiring youth with a taſte for, and an attachment to, ſcience, ſo firm, that it ſhould be almoſt impoſſible to eradicate it in the ſubſequent periods of life.</p>
            <p>FOR this purpoſe ſtudies which addreſs themſelves to the heart, as well as thoſe which require ſtrong mental attention, ſhould invite the exerciſe of their thoughts. Rewards ſhould be liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, as well thoſe which furniſh the means of moderate pleaſure, as thoſe which confer diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Coercion ſhould be ſeldom, if ever applied. [Note I.]</p>
            <p>BUT this great object would be aſſiſted, more than by any other conſideration, by—</p>
            <p>RENDERING, in the fourth place, knowledge as highly practical as poſſible.</p>
            <p>THIS idea has been already noticed. But it merits a more extenſive diſcuſſion. Next to the firſt object it claims the greateſt notice.</p>
            <p>ALL ſcience ought to derive its rank from its utility. The real good which it actually does, or is capable of doing, is the only genuine criterion
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034558_0048_0FFE287B24621A28"/>
of its value. Man may indulge himſelf in ſublime reveries, but the world will forever remain uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in them. It is only when he applies the powers of his mind to objects of general uſe, that he becomes their benefactor; until he does this he is neither entitled to their gratitude or applauſe.</p>
            <p>HE is the beſt friend of man, who makes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries involving effects which benefit mankind the moſt extenſively. Moral truths are therefore of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance but little ſhort of infinite. For they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to numbers which almoſt evade enumeration, and to time which loſes itſelf in eternity. Theſe truths, all agree, are not to be ſought in the cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. They are only acquired by uniting the calm and patient reflection of retirement, with the bold and penetrating obſervation of active life.</p>
            <p>IN phyſics, the happineſs of mankind is in the higheſt degree increaſed by diſcoveries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements connected with agriculture and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Theſe two occupations employ nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenths of moſt communities, and a much larger proportion of others. Does it not then become an intereſting enquiry, whether it be not expedient in infancy and youth to communicate to the mind the leading principles of nature and art in theſe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of labour, not only by a theoretic expoſition of them, but alſo by their practical developement.</p>
            <p>IF almoſt the whole community be deſtined to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue one or other of theſe avocations from neceſſity,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034558_0049_0FFE28B884D06048"/>
and if it be the duty of an individual to ſupport himſelf, whenever he can, by an exertion of his own powers; and if theſe can only yield a ſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from an ability to be acquired in youth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a particular branch of agriculture or mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics, does it not ſeem to be the duty of ſociety to control education in ſuch a way as to ſecure to every individual this ability? If this ability ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, how much miſery would be annihilated, how much crime would be deſtroyed? Even under a government,<note n="*" place="bottom">In France.</note> in which the happineſs of men does not appear to have been the leading object, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were obliged to be inſtructed fully in the principles, and partially in the practice, of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular trade.</p>
            <p>SHOULD, however, the juſtice of abridging natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right in theſe caſes be doubted, and its expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience denied, the propriety of a union of practical with theoretic inſtruction will not be conteſted in reference to thoſe who are deſigned for agriculture or mechanics.</p>
            <p>NAKED ſpeculation is either unintelligible or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting to the young mind, while it delights in examining external appearances, and often in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their cauſes. Thoſe objects which have engaged our earlieſt, and ſurely in ſome reſpects our happieſt days, are cheriſhed and purſued by the mind with increaſing delight in advanced and old age. From this plain view of the ſubject, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034558_0050_0FFE287CA5940690"/>
that in youth the addition of practical to theoretical knowledge would add to its charms; while in maturer age the blending theoretic with practical knowledge would render labour more agreeable and engaging.</p>
            <p>As the period of education will, it is probable, in moſt inſtances, be protracted till the child ſhall be engaged in preparing himſelf for ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in life, it would be important to confine his attention, in a conſiderable degree, to the acquiſition of that kind of knowledge which would be of the greateſt practical uſe in the profeſſion for which he is deſtined. Give the mind an object worthy of its efforts, and you may rely upon their being made. In this caſe the child would realiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between its preſent purſuits, and its future proſperity, and this impreſſion could not fail to kindle new ardour in its youthful breaſt.</p>
            <p>THE fifth object ſhould be the inſpiring youth with an ardent love for mankind. To accompliſh this end, the preceptor ſhould cautiouſly avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling into the mind of his pupil a mean idea of human nature. The pages of the moraliſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing man have aided that degeneracy which they deprecate. We ſhould not even convey a ſuſpicion of the honeſty of him whom we wiſh to be virtuous. Thoſe who have led the public mind, ſo far from attending to this maxim, have almoſt univerſally pourtrayed the heart and conduct of man as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034558_0051_0FFE28BCD0CB4548"/>
depraved; and we have often beheld the gloomy ſpectacle of a miſanthropic infant. If we examine the tendency of the unperverted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of nature, we muſt acknowledge their hoſtility to that ſuſpicion and jealouſly which have proceeded from the force of education. The delight which we all feel on contemplating the abſence of ſuſpicion, is an evidence of the triumph of virtue and nature. The child has no doubt of the honeſty of thoſe about him, until his mind has received an artificial biaſs. Having received this unfortunate biaſs, and looking upon his fellow-beings as hoſtile, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on life, he treats them with ſuſpicion; and perhaps, on the ſuppoſition that they would purſue their own intereſt even to his injury, he heſitates not to purſue his to theirs. This aggreſſion, on his part, cannot fail to produce from them that conduct which he has been taught to expect; and thus irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally is ſtrengthened a conviction dictated by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>WE know, in our intercourſe with the world, that confidence is the parent of friendſhip, which forbids its ſubject to do an act baſe or diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. On the other hand, it is alike evident that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt produces enmity, and that enmity will often dictate, in the paroxyſm of reſentment, a mean and diſgraceful action.</p>
            <p>IN whatever light this ſubject is viewed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it will appear that men are the creatures of ſentiment, and that their virtue is often greatly,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034558_0052_0FFE287E29400B18"/>
ſometimes altogether, dependent on the opinion entertained of them by others. Let us then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſentiment ſo forcibly expreſſed by Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, "It is not poſſible," ſays he, <q>for a ſane mind, for any continuance, to look upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, either as emmets, below his ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as monſters, more worthy of his hatred than his regard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>THE manner of accompliſhing the objects of education!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS branch of the ſubject may, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, claim ſuperior importance to the other branches. It involves a more detailed ſtatement, and more minute and ſpecific ideas, than thoſe which have been already diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>It is to be feared, however, that the neceſſary ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of ſmall objects which it requires to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it clear or uſeful, may leſſen, in the minds of ſome, the dignity of the ſubject, and expoſe it to the edge of ridicule. But it ſhould be conſidered that as education itſelf altogether conſiſts in a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant attention to ſmall objects, and would be wholly defeated without ſuch attention, ſo that ſyſtem of education, other conſiderations being equal, muſt be the beſt, which, in theſe ſmall objects, leaves the leaſt to error, negligence and caprice. As in the natural world the boundleſs ocean takes its ſource in innumerable petty ſprings, ſo the mind, invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with extenſive acquiſitions, acknowledges its dependence on the humbleſt ideas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:034558_0053_0FFE28BE5488CE30"/>
BEFORE we proceed to adjuſt the ſeveral parts of the ſyſtem, two intereſting enquiries preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſolution.</p>
            <p>I. At what age education ſhould commence?</p>
            <p>II. SHOULD education be public or private?</p>
            <p>I. EVERY correct view of human nature ſhews the young mind, though tender, to be capable of great improvement. The injury it ſo often ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from yielding to ſuperſtitious notions, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrificed to unmanly fear, and by being wedded to numerous prejudices, abundantly atteſts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of certain ideas on the mind, which had it been honeſtly directed, would have embraced truth inſtead of deluſion, and courage inſtead of puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity. Mark the firſt dawnings of the mind, and ſay if the infant exhibit any evidence of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to falſehood? On the contrary, with the moſt engaging ſimplicity, you behold it giving expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to truths the moſt obvious. Regard the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting credulity with which the child hears a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſtory, until its mind labour under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſive burthen of a tiſſue of ſupernatual incidents. We may then aſſume it as an undeniable fact that an attachment to truth is the property of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perverted mind.</p>
            <p>WHILE this principle is in its vigour, it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely important that the mind ſhould be as highly exerciſed as poſſible. But, it is ſaid, that it ſhould not be fatigued, much leſs oppreſſed. Granted.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034558_0054_0FFE2881115729C8"/>
But, let it in reply be remarked, that at no period of our life, as at the earlieſt, are we, in ſome reſpects, ſo capable of a conſtant exerciſe of our faculties. Every object around, every idea within, is then new. Novelty is the ſource of our higheſt enjoyment; of courſe not an object impreſſes the ſenſes, not an idea is formed in the mind, which does not yield the moſt exquiſite delight. Why is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſcenes of childhood ſo dear to us, but from the intereſting recollection of ſceneſ
<q>
                  <l>"Forever varying, and forever new."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>ON this branch of the ſubject, we may gather correct ideas, by attending to the remarks of a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of antiquity, who has for the moſt part united with maſterly ſkill philoſophy and a knowledge of human nature. Quintillian ſays, <q>Some have thought that none ſhould be inſtructed in letters who are under ſeven years of age, becauſe that early period can neither comprehend learning nor endure labour.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>BUT what can they do better from the time at which they are able to talk? For ſomething they muſt do. Or why ſhould we ſlight the gain, little as it is, which occurs, before the age of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? For certainly, however little that may be which the preceding age ſhall have contributed, yet the boy will be learning greater things in that very year, in which he would otherwiſe have been learning ſmaller. This, extended to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years, amounts to a ſum; and whatever is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034558_0055_0FFE28C41A9E83A0"/>
in infancy, is an acquiſition to the period of youth.</p>
               <p>LET us not then throw away even the very firſt period; and the leſs ſo as the elements of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing require memory alone, which is not only found in little boys, but is very tenacious in them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>IT is true, that the meaſure of knowledge which infancy will receive is ſmall. But in moſt ſyſtems of education it has been injudiciouſly reſtricted. The mind has loſt half its vigor by being oppreſſed with the nomenclature of ſcience. Languages have been excluſively forced upon it; and it has been compelled to believe legitimate ſcience to be as unmeaning and as barren as the words which it has acquired.</p>
            <p>HAD a different plan been purſued; had our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive language only occupied the attention until well underſtood; had the ſimple elements of morals and phyſics received concurrent inculcation, intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength might have been ſecured inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent. The mind, engaged in objects intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with its own happineſs, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe around it, would have imbibed a love of knowledge, which would probably never have been loſt. [Note K.]</p>
            <p>THESE remarks are forcibly illuſtrated by a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous obſervation of Monteſquieu. "Another
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034558_0056_0FFE2886C4EF07F0"/>
advantage," ſays he, <q>their (the Ancients) edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had over ours; it never was effaced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary impreſſions. Epaminondas the laſt year of his life, ſaid, heard, ſaw, and performed the very ſame things, as at the age in which he received the firſt principles of his education.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ONE conſideration may deſerve ſome attention, though it is not known hitherto to have received any; and as it flows from a general law of nature, its truth is confided in. All animals excepting man are ſubmitted almoſt wholly to their own efforts as to ſubſiſtence and welfare, as ſoon as they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired phyſical ſtrength ſufficient to protect them from the invaſion of force. No animal is known to exiſt which does not require a certain portion of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to guide it. This ſagacity, it may therefore be fairly ſuppoſed to poſſeſs as ſoon as it attains its phyſical manhood. Man alone, in his preſent ſtate, paſſes a courſe of years in corporeal manhood, and mental infancy. May not the idea be hazarded that this has ariſen from falſe education, which has retarded the progreſs of the mind, and protracted the period of mental infancy beyond the limits aſſigned it by nature.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe conſiderations, it appears, that the earlier the mind is placed under a proper regimen, the greater is the probability of producing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effects. Some years muſt be ſurrendered to the claims of maternal regard: ſome will elapſe before the child is able to attend to any thing but
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034558_0057_0FFE28C59E926E68"/>
thoſe external objects which irreſiſtibly force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on its notice.</p>
            <p>MAKING an allowance of five years, for theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable ſacrifices, and for the acquiſition of thoſe elements of knowledge which are with facility ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in any ſituation, we arrive at the period of life moſt proper for commencing a ſyſtem of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral education.</p>
            <p>IT is acknowledged that there is ſomething arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in fixing the period of commencing the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth, as the mind varies in different perſons. Still however, it ſeems neceſſary that age ſhould decide the time fit for beginning education, which on the whole, with perhaps few variations, will be found the leaſt exceptionable mode of giving to this part of the ſyſtem a feature definite and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; a feature which ſhall not be under the control of parental weakneſs or ignorant caprice. If at the age of five, the mind, in ſome children, be too tender to receive much, an intelligent inſtructor will be ſatisfied with imparting little. No danger need be apprehended from intenſe application at this period of life. Every idea formed in the mind will be ſimple, and it is only in the combination of ideas that much mental vigor is required.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>SHOULD education be public or private?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE moſt diſtinguiſhed talents have been engaged in the diſcuſſion of this ſubject; and here, as in moſt
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:034558_0058_0FFE288847A6C550"/>
controverſies of a ſpeculative caſt, we find a great diverſity of ſentiment. Quintillian and Milton are warm in their eulogium on a public, while Locke is equally animated in his praiſe of a private ſyſtem of education. The great argument, which may be called the centre of all others urged, is the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of emulation by a public education; while the great objection made to public education, is the ſacrifice, alleged to be produced, of morality and honeſty.</p>
            <p>As there is, undoubtedly, truth on both ſides, it becomes neceſſary to conſider what weight the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged advantages and diſadvantages ought to poſſeſs in determining the preference of the judgment to one over the other ſyſtem. It will, perhaps, be poſſible to reconcile the apparently conflicting ideas, in ſuch a way, as to make the reſult of benefit produced infinitely larger than the riſque of injury ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>THE early period of life is under parental and eſpecially maternal control. The ſolicitude of a mother is now the beſt, the only protection, which the child can receive. Some years elapſe, before the mind ſeems capable of being impreſſed with true or falſe knowledge in a degree ſufficient to influence its future expanſion, and during this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, it is fortunate that we have not occaſion to regret the unenlightened ſtate of the female mind. But though theſe years do not mark much ſtrength of mind, yet they rapidly unfold and form the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:034558_0059_0FFE28C721F315F8"/>
which ſeldom fails to receive a virtuous bias from a mother, who, however vicious her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, feels deeply intereſted in the virtue of her offſpring. Hence thoſe amiable affections are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited which are the ornament of human nature. Before the age of five the child ſeldom feels a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to do an immoral thing; and even if it ſhould exhibit ſuch a ſymptom, the temper is ſo flexible, that it eaſily yields to a more virtuous direction.</p>
            <p>THE young mind, having paſſed five years of its exiſtence, free from much corruption, and a plan of education being now commenced, it becomes an object of conſideration whether the child ſhould remain with its parents, or be ſeparated from them.</p>
            <p>AS a large portion of parental ſolicitude ſtill exiſts, which alone ſeems capable of ſecuring a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant attention to thoſe little indications of temper and mind which now ſo profuſely appear, it ſeems highly important that the child ſhould ſtill remain under the immediate control of parental authority. That affection which, on the part of the child, is but half formed, will have time and opportunity to gain ſtrength, a love of domeſtic tranquillity will be produced, and both theſe principles will form a firm ſhield to virtue.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, the daily attendance at ſchool will withdraw the mind of the child from an <hi>entire</hi> dependence on its parents; will place it in ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034558_0060_0FFE2889C9A99648"/>
demanding the exerciſe of its faculties; and will ſtrengthen, inſtead of weakening, its attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to domeſtic ſcenes. To be deprived of that which we love is in ſome degree painful to us all; to children it is painful in the higheſt degree. Yet a habit of voluntary or compulſory abſtinence from pleaſure is abſolutely neceſſary to human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>THE child, in this ſituation, having its time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between ſchool, the hours of diverſion, and thoſe ſpent in the houſe of its parents, will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, remain as free from a proſtration of morals, as can be expected in infancy. This, indeed, is the plan, which univerſally prevails in the civilized world, and its univerſality is certainly ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its favour.</p>
            <p>LET this plan, partly domeſtic and partly public, be purſued till the mind begins boldly to expand it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to indicate an ability and an inclination to think for itſelf. The commencement of this capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of combining ideas takes place about the age of ten. We have now reached the period which claims the cloſeſt attention. The mind now feels its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and delights in diſplaying it. Ambition is kindled, emulation burns, a deſire of ſuperiority and diſtinction are rouſed.</p>
            <p>THIS, then, appears to be the era, if ever, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic education. The indulgence of parental tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould now be exchanged for the patient and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034558_0061_0FFE28CCD44DC8D0"/>
unobſtructed exerciſe of the mental powers. Let us attend to the advantages of the two rival ſyſtems at this period.</p>
            <p>WITH regard to the plan of public Education;</p>
            <p n="1">1. EMULATION is excited. Without numbers there can be no emulation. It is founded on the love of diſtinction. In a private family this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction cannot be acquired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An attention to ſtudy, when the child is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the houſe of its parent, may be unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruped; whereas while it reſides with him a thouſand trifling, menial, avocations, will always take precedence. From this reſults the conviction in the mind of the child that ſtudy is altogether ſubordinate to the objects to which it is compelled to attend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. BUT, above every other conſideration, the ſyſtem of public education, inſpires a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent reflection and conduct. Removed from a ſcene, where it has little occaſion to think, and leſs to act, the child now finds itſelf placed in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation free from rigid parental authority. [Note L.] Placed in the midſt of objects of purſuit, its prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of one object to another, is often determined by its own volition. Hence reflection is excited; and with children there is certainly no danger of too much thought;—the only apprehenſion is that there being too little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:034558_0062_0FFE288E34467A10"/>
LET a ſpirit of independent reflection animate a large number of even youthful minds, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of uſeful truths will ſoon be rapid. This ſpirit, aided by the inſtruction of enlightened pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, muſt give an undeniable aſcendency to the public over the private plan.</p>
            <p>ERROR is never more dangerous than in the mouth of a parent. The child, from the dawn of its exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, accuſtomed to receive as undoubted every idea from this quarter, ſeldom, if ever, queſtions the truth of what it is told. Hence prejudices are as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary as titles; and you may almoſt univerſally know the ſentiments of the ſon by thoſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. [Note M.] Now by education remote from parental influence, the errors of the father ceaſe to be entailed upon the child—Still farther, the child, having acquired true ideas, very often, from the ſuperior force of truth, diſſipates the errors of his parent by the remonſtrances of reaſon.</p>
            <p>As education profeſſes to improve the ſtate and character of men, and not barely to oppoſe their declenſion, it muſt follow that domeſtic education is improper, as it does no more, even if ſucceſsful, than ſecure the laſt at the expence of the firſt.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the argument urged againſt public education (for only one is urged with any tenacity) we ſhall find that the evil it deprecates ariſes from the imperfection of human nature, more than from any appropriate and excluſive property of public education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:034558_0063_0FFE28CE564775F0"/>
               <q>WHEREVER there are numbers, of children aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, there will be miſchief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</q> This is true; but is it ſo extenſively true as to countervail the numerous advantages which have been but partially ſtated? Is it equal to the injury ſuſtained by the mechanical adoption of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental error or vice? More miſchief, more immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, have ſprung from this ſource, than from the one complained of. On the other hand does not the conduct of children, in a public inſtitution, in a conſiderable degree, reſemble the actions of men in the world? The knowledge, therefore, thus acquired, though ſometimes at the expence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and truth, muſt be deemed of ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is probable that it aroſe from the ſpirit of their plans of education, that Sparta was the laſt nation that fell a prey to the Macedonians, and Crete to the Romans. The Samnites, Monteſquieu obſerves, had the ſame inſtitutions, which furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe very Romans with the ſubject of four and twenty triumphs. Indeed, though it be probable, that no plan can ever be deviſed, which ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the advantages of an honorable and zealous competition, and exclude all the injuries hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo cloſely allied as to be deemed inſeparable, yet ſome improvement ought not to be deſpaired of, amidſt the univerſal tendency of every thing to amelioration.</p>
            <p>THE diſcuſſion of this ſubject appears in ſome meaſure ſuperſeded, and the preference unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034558_0064_0FFE288FB673AE98"/>
eſtabliſhed of the public over the private plan, by the ſmall expence of the firſt, compared with the unpracticable expence of the laſt. If parents educated their children, the hours withdrawn from buſineſs would alone impoveriſh them.</p>
            <p>BEFORE a detail is given of the courſe of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed, it may be proper conciſely to ſtate the points, which it has been the object of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding remarks to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>IN THE FIRST PLACE, virtue and wiſdom have been deemed to poſſeſs an inſeparable connection, and the degree and efficiency of the one has been decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depend on the meaſure and vigor of the other. From this propoſition the inference is deduced that a nation cannot poſſibly be too enlightened, and that the moſt energetic zeal is neceſſary to make it ſufficiently ſo for the great intereſts of virtue and happineſs.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. That it is the duty of a nation to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend and even to coerce the education of children, and that high conſiderations of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency not only juſtify, but dictate the eſtabliſhment of a ſyſtem, which ſhall place under a control, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of, and ſuperior to, parental authority, the education of children.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY. The preference has been given at a certain age to public education over domeſtic edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:034558_0065_0FFE28CFD84C4A88"/>
FOURTHLY. The period of education recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed has been fixed at an age ſo early, as to anticipate the reign of prejudice, and to render the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made on the mind ſubſervient to virtue and truth.</p>
            <p>GUIDED by theſe principles it is propoſed;</p>
            <p>I. THAT the period of education be from 5 to 18.</p>
            <p>II. THAT every male child, without exception, be educated.</p>
            <p>III. THAT the inſtructor in every diſtrict be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to attend to the faithful execution of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. That it be made puniſhable by law in a parent to neglect offering his child to the preceptor for inſtruction.</p>
            <p>IV. THAT every parent, who wiſhes to deviate in the education of his children from the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, be made reſponſible for devoting to the education of his children as much time as the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſyſtem preſcribes.</p>
            <p>V. THAT a fund be raiſed from the citizens in the ratio of their property.</p>
            <p>VI. THAT the ſyſtem be compoſed of primary ſchools; of colleges; and of a <hi>Univerſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. THAT the primary ſchools be divided into two claſes; the firſt conſiſting of boys from 5 to 10 years old; the ſecond conſiſting of boys from 10 to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:034558_0066_0FFE289564452418"/>
18.—And that theſe claſſes be ſubdivided, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, into ſmaller ones.</p>
            <p>VIII. THAT the inſtruction given to the firſt claſs be the rudiments of the Engliſh Language, Writing, Arithmetic, the commiſſion to memory and delivery of ſelect pieces, inculcating moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, deſcribing natural phenomena, or diſplaying correct fancy.</p>
            <p>IX. THOUGH this claſs is formed of boys between the age of 5 and 10 years, yet ſhould rapid acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions be made in the above branches of knowledge at an earlier age than that of 10, the boy is to be promoted into the ſecond claſs.</p>
            <p>X. THE moſt ſolemn attention muſt be paid to avoid inſtilling into the young mind any ideas or ſentiments whoſe truth is not unequivocally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the undiſſenting ſuffrage of the enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and virtuous part of mankind.</p>
            <p>XI. THAT the inſtruction given to the ſecond claſs be an extended and more correct knowledge of Arithmetic; of the Engliſh language, compriſing plain rules of criticiſm and compoſition; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſtudy of General Hiſtory and a more detailed acquaintance with the hiſtory of our own country; of Geography; of the laws of nature, practically illuſtrated. That this practical illuſtration conſiſt in an actual devotion of a portion of time to agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and mechanics, under the ſuperintendance
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034558_0067_0FFDC72D3B850B98"/>
of the preceptor. That it be the duty of this claſs to commit to memory, and frequently to repeat, the conſtitution, and the fundamental laws of the United States.</p>
            <p>XII. THAT each primary ſchool conſiſt of 50 boys.</p>
            <p>XIII. THAT ſuch boys be admitted into the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege as ſhall be deemed by the preceptor to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, from a manifeſtation of induſtry and talents, of a more extended education. That one boy be annually choſen out of the ſecond claſs of each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſchool for this preferment.</p>
            <p>XIV. THAT the ſtudents at college ſo promoted be ſupported at the public expence, but that ſuch other ſtudents may be received, as ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their parents.</p>
            <p>XV. THAT the ſtudies of the college conſiſt in a ſtill more extended acquaintance with the above ſtated branches of knowledge, together with the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of polite literature.</p>
            <p>XVI. THAT each college admit 200 ſtudents.</p>
            <p>XVII. THAT an opportunity be furniſhed to thoſe who have the ability, without interfering with the eſtabliſhed ſtudies, of acquiring a knowledge of the modern languages, muſic, drawing, dancing, and fencing; and that the permiſſion to cultivate theſe accompliſhments he held forth as the reward of diligence and talents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:034558_0068_0FFE2896E58489B8"/>
XVIII. THAT a National Univerſity be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which the higheſt branches of ſcience and literature ſhall be taught. That it conſiſt of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents promoted from the colleges. That one ſtudent out of ten be annually choſen for this promotion by a majority of the ſuffrages of the profeſſors of the college to which he may belong.</p>
            <p>XIX. THAT the ſtudent ſo promoted be ſupported at the public expence, and be lodged within the walls of the Univerſity; remaining ſo long as he pleaſe on a ſalary, in conſideration of his devoting his time to the cultivation of ſcience or literature, in which laſt caſe he ſhall become a fellow of the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>XX. THE number of profeſſors in the College, and the Univerſity is not fixed; but it is propoſed that the laſt contain a prefeſſor of every branch of uſeful knowledge.</p>
            <p>XXI. IT is propoſed that the profeſſors be in the firſt inſtance deſignated by law; that afterwards, in all caſes of vacancy, the profeſſors of the college chuſe the preceptors of the primary ſchools, and that the profeſſors of the Univerſity chuſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the colleges.</p>
            <p>XXII. FOR the promotion of literature and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is propoſed that a board of literature and ſcience be eſtabliſhed on the following principles:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:034558_0069_0FFE28D8A8DD5978"/>
IT ſhall conſiſt of fourteen perſons ſkilled in the ſeveral branches of, 1. Languages. 2. Mathematics. 3. Geography and Hiſtory. 4. Natural Philoſophy in general. 5. Moral Philoſophy. 6. Engliſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Belle Lettres, and Criticiſm. 7. Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 8. Manufactures. 9. Government and Laws. 10. Medicine. 11. Theology. 12. Elements of taſte, including principles of Muſic, Architecture, Gardening, Drawing, &amp;c. 13. Military Tactics. And in addition, 14. A perſon eminently ſkilled in Science, who ſhall be Preſident of the board.</p>
            <p>THE perſons forming the board ſhall, in the firſt inſtance, be determined by law, and in caſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, a new election ſhall be held by the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of the board.</p>
            <p>TWENTY years ſubſequent to the commencement of the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, all vacancies ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by a choice made in the firſt inſtance by the profeſſors of the Univerſity, which ſhall be then approved by a majority of colleges, the profeſſors of each college voting by themſelves; and finally ſanctioned by a majority of the fellows of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity voting. No perſon under 30 years of age ſhall be eligible.</p>
            <p>THE perſons, ſo elected, ſhall hold their offices during life, and receive a liberal ſalary, which ſhall render them independent in their circumſtances. No removal ſhall take place unleſs approved by the ſuffrages of three-fourths of the colleges, three-fourths
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034558_0070_0FFE289867E31710"/>
of the profeſſors of the Univerſity, and three-fourths of the fellows of the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>IT ſhall be the duty of this board to form a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of national education to be obſerved in the Univerſity, the colleges, and the primary ſchools; to chuſe the profeſſors of the Univerſity; to fix the ſalaries of the ſeveral officers; and to ſuperintend the general intereſts of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>AS merit and talents are beſt ſecured by liberal rewards, a fund ſhall be eſtabliſhed and placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the control of this board, out of which premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums ſhall be paid to ſuch perſons as ſhall, by their writings, excel in the treatment of the ſubjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the board for diſcuſſion, or ſuch as ſhall make any valuable diſcovery.</p>
            <p>IT ſhall further be the duty of this board to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe all literary or ſcientific productions ſubmitted to them by any citizen, and in caſe they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any ſuch work worthy of general peruſal and calculated to extend the ſphere of uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it ſhall be printed at the public expence, and the author rewarded.</p>
            <p>IT ſhall be the eſpecial duty of the board to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what authors ſhall be read or ſtudied in the ſeveral inſtitutions, and at any time to ſubſtitute one author for another.</p>
            <p>As the extenſive diffuſion of knowledge is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably promoted by libraries, it ſhall be in the power
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034558_0071_0FFE28DA2BA55700"/>
of the board to eſtabliſh them, wherever it ſhall ſee fit; and to direct all original productions of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be introduced into them.</p>
            <p>IT is not concealed, that on the eſtabliſhment of this board, the utility, the energy, and the dignity of the propoſed ſyſtem are deemed greatly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. It will therefore be proper to exhibit with ſome minuteneſs the reaſons which render ſuch an inſtitution expedient, or in other words to ſtate the advantages which may be expected to be derived from it.</p>
            <p>OUR ſeminaries of learning have heretofore been under the management of men, either incompetent to their ſuperintendance, or not intereſted in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient degree in their welfare. Voluntary and diſintereſted ſervices, however honorable, are but rarely to be obtained. The zeal, which embarks a man of talents in the promotion of any object, will cool, unleſs ſuſtained by ſome ſubſtantial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, either received or expected. It is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in this country for the caſe to be different. Affluence is ſo uncommon that few are to be found who poſſeſs it in union with intellectual attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Independent of this conſideration, it is generally conceded that more knowledge is to be expected from men in a ſubordinate ſphere of life, who are conſtrained to cultivate their minds, than from thoſe who can live, without ſuch cultivation, in eaſe and affluence. From this combination of acknowledged facts, it muſt clearly appear that every
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:034558_0072_0FFE289E18777168"/>
advantage will flow from the inſtitution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed board, which either does or can proceed from thoſe formed on the exiſting plans, and that great and excluſive additional benefits may be expected.</p>
            <p>THE high reſponſibility of this board will inſure its fidelity. Every member of it, being diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by eminent attainments in ſome department of learning, will be conſtrained by the powerful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations due to character, to ſuperintend with zeal and honeſty thoſe concerns ſpecially delegated to him. No branch of ſcience or literature will flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at the expence of another, as they will all be repreſented at this board. This board being the ſource from which all inferior appointments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, if it be governed in its choice of perſons by incorrupt and intelligent motives, the ſeveral ſtations of profeſſors and preceptors will probably be filled with men equally eminent for knowledge and induſtry.</p>
            <p>So far the advantages connected with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſuch a board have been contemplated in their immediate relation to the education of youth. Benefits, equally great and more ſplendid, will flow to ſociety, from the ſecurity given to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and the impulſe given to ſcience. To this board, if liberally endowed with funds, talents will look for ſure protection and encouragement. Not only talents previouſly exiſting will be rewarded and animated to the nobleſt efforts, but talents which had never otherwiſe exiſted, will trace their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:034558_0073_0FFE28DBB044E730"/>
to this inſtitution. The reliance on having publicity given to their diſcoveries and reſearches, and the being rewarded by fame and ſome ſhare of pecuniary aſſiſtance, will encourage all thoſe who feel conſcious of poſſeſſing great powers of mind, to give them activity and expanſion.</p>
            <p>As it may be relied upon that a body of men, well known, and poſſeſſing a full ſenſe of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of character, will guard with peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, the intereſts of virtue, and will only reward talents when exerted in its cauſe, we may expect that authors, as they regard the approbation of this board, will be careful to promote and not attack morals. Hence it may be inferred that fewer vicious productions will iſſue from the preſs, than at preſent diſgrace it.</p>
            <p>WHEN it is conſidered how ſlow literary merit is at preſent in receiving its reward, and that poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous is more frequent than living fame; when it is conſidered how detrimental this circumſtance is to the acquiſition of knowledge; when it is further conſidered that poverty is almoſt always the ſure lot of devotion to ſcience; it becomes difficult to aſſign limits to the advantages which ſcience would derive from always knowing where to meet with protection, and receive both reputation and pecuniary reward. Every work recommended to general acceptance by this board would ſurely go into a rapid circulation, which of itſelf will generally amply recompenſe the author.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:034558_0074_0FFE289F9C0CF438"/>
IF any one circumſtance be more connected with the virtue and happineſs of the United States than another, it is the ſubſtitution of works defining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, political, moral and religious duty, in the place of thoſe which are at preſent in uſe. The radical ideas we have already eſtabliſhed, and which are in a great meaſure peculiar to us, claim a new and entirely different expoſition from that which they have yet received. Every new work, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which comes from the pen of a citizen, may be deemed an important acquiſition, a ſtay to our virtue and a ſhield to our happineſs.</p>
            <p>EXCLUSIVELY of the enumerated advantages, which ſcience may derive from this board, great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in knowledge may be expected from the individual contributions of its ſeveral members. Inured in the early period of their lives to cloſe application, having acquired the habits of patient and perſevering ſtudy, and at length being placed in independent and eaſy circumſtances, we need not fear diſappointment in expecting from them performances and diſcoveries of the firſt order.</p>
            <p>IN conſidering the objections likely to be urged againſt embracing the plan of education here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, only two of much importance are foreſeen. The firſt is its extenſiveneſs, the ſecond its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>As the extenſiveneſs can only be objectionable in reference to the expence, this alone ſeems to require examination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:034558_0075_0FFE28E0038C4F58"/>
TO give a fair trial to this ſyſtem, liberal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſhould be allowed to the preceptors and profeſſors. Their offices ſhould be eſteemed as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable as any employments, either public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, in the community; and one ſure way of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them ſo is to attach to them independence. Without this appendage we ſhall in vain expect that excluſive attention to ſcience and profeſſional duty, which can alone accompliſh the ends deſired.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſary expence muſt, then, be ſubmitted to without reluctance. On an enquiry into the ſources of taxation we ſhall find more encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than diſcouragement. When it is ſtated that the wealth of the ſtate of Pennſylvania alone may be eſtimated at more than 400 million of dollars, it will at once be ſeen how little the moſt liberal ſum, raiſed for the purpoſe of education, would partake of burthen or oppreſſion. When on the other hand the greatneſs of the object is correctly eſtimated and truly felt, all prejudices ought at once to be annihilated; and it is only doing juſtice to the patriotiſm of our citizens to believe that they would be annihilated.</p>
            <p>TWO ſubjects connected with a general ſyſtem of education, <abbr>viz.</abbr> female inſtruction, and that which has been called ornamental, have been avoided: Both of theſe certainly involve very important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. But in the exiſting diverſity of opinion reſpecting the nature and extent of the firſt, ſuch coincidence and agreement as to produce a ſyſtem
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034558_0076_0FFE28A286396DF8"/>
muſt abſolutely be deſpaired of. It is ſufficient, perhaps, for the preſent that the improvement of women is marked by a rapid progreſs, and that a proſpect opens equal to their moſt ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.—With regard to ornamental inſtruction, it would ſeem to reſt more on principles of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency than of neceſſity. It may, alſo, be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a kind of mental luxury, which like that of a groſſer nature, will imperceptibly, but ſurely, by the allurements and pleaſures which its cultivation holds forth, inſinuate itſelf into general acceptance. But as it is of ſome conſequence, that a plan of inſtruction in the polite arts ſhould be deviſed, which ſo far from being incompatible with, might aid the promotion of branches of knowledge more immediately neceſſary, it is propoſed, that a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opportunity be offered in the colleges, and a full one in the univerſity, to become acquainted with the principles as well as execution of every polite art. The effects of theſe elegant purſuits on the mind and temper are of the moſt beneficial nature. [Note N.] They may be emphatically denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the finiſhed offspring of civilization and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, a ſyſtem of ſufficient comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs ſhould contain a department for every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of genius. Every ſpark of mental energy ſhould be cheriſhed. The mind ſhould be left free to chuſe its favourite object, and when choſen ſhould find the means of proſecuting it with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>

               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:034558_0077_0FFE28E2EB37DF90"/>
SUCH is the ſyſtem propoſed. Its imperfections are beyond doubt numerous. Of this fact, no man can be more ſenſible than their author. In the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of a ſubject, which has ably employed the pens of the moſt diſtinguiſhed writers, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a general conviction of the preference of one plan over another, it became the writer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe as much diffidence as conſiſts with the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of truth. If he has manifeſted in any part of the preceding ſpeculations the appearance of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant confidence in his own ſentiments, he truſts it will be aſcribed to his impreſſions of the importance of the ſubject, and not to a vain attachment to his peculiar ideas. He who is ſolemnly impreſſed with intereſting truths, will think with energy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his thoughts with deciſion.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the univerſal agreement of all men in this country as to the neceſſity of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in education, ſo eſſentially do their profeſſions diſagree with their actions, that nothing ſhort of the commanding eloquence of truth, without <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thundered on their ears, can produce that concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of action, that unity of effort, which ſhall give efficiency to a wiſe ſyſtem of education. Let then the voice of the good man mingle with that of the wiſe in announcing the neceſſity of ſpeedily adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a meaſure. Inſtead of one party denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing another for equivocal political crimes, let all parties unite in atteſting their patriotiſm by their co-operating efforts in ſo great a cauſe. Is it a
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034558_0078_0FFE28A4181F4718"/>
queſtion with any man whether our liberties are ſecure? Let him know that they depend upon the knowledge of the people, and that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge depends upon a comprehenſive and energetic ſyſtem of education. It is true that ſome nations have been free without poſſeſſing a large portion of illumination; but their freedom has been precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and accidental, and it has fallen as it roſe.</p>
            <p>THE two things which we are moſt intereſted in ſecuring are harmony at home, and reſpect abroad. By calling into active operation the mental reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a nation, our political inſtitutions will be rendered more perfect, ideas of juſtice will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the advantages of the undiſturbed enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tranquillity and induſtry will be perceived by every one, and our mutual dependence on each other will be rendered conſpicuous. The great reſult will be harmony. Diſcord and ſtrife have always proceeded from, or riſen upon, ignorance and paſſion. When the firſt has ceaſed to exiſt, and the laſt ſhall be virtuouſly directed, we ſhall be deprived of every ſource of miſunderſtanding. The ſword would not need a ſcabbard, were all men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by a conviction of their true intereſts.</p>
            <p>HARMONY at home muſt produce reſpect abroad. For the aera is at hand when America may hold the tables of juſtice in her hand, and proclaim them to the unreſiſting obſervance of the civilized world. Her numbers and her wealth vie with each other in
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034558_0079_0FFE28E5D18D7438"/>
the rapidity of their increaſe. But the immutable wiſdom of her inſtitutions will have a more efficient moral influence, than her phyſical ſtrength. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of both ſhe cannot fail to aſſume, without competition, the ſtation aſſigned her by an overrul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the bright proſpect of national dignity and happineſs, if America give to her youth the advantages of a liberal and juſt education. On the other hand, ſhould avarice, prejudice, or malice, fruſtrate this great object, and ſhould a declenſion of knowledge, gradually, but not the leſs deciſively as to a future period, be ſuffered to triumph, the proſpect is gloomy and dreadful. Gigantic power miſapplied, towering ambition unſatiated with cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal gratification, avarice trampling poverty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, mark but a few of the dark ſhades which will in all probability, envelop our political hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. On ſuch an event, we muſt expect the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of oppreſſion at home, and conqueſt abroad.</p>
            <p>IT may intereſt the attention, as it certainly will amuſe the fancy, to trace the effects of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles of education on a future age. It has been obſerved that however virtuous, enlightened and vigorous our firſt efforts to aggrandize the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character, it were, notwithſtanding, folly to expect the celerity of preternatural agency. A ſyſtem founded on true principles muſt gradually and cautiouſly eradicate error, and ſubſtitute truth. The period, will, therefore, be remote before the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034558_0080_0FFE28A70CA8C4B8"/>
world is benefitted by its complete develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>LET us contemplate the effects of a juſt ſyſtem,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. ON THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.</item>
               <item>II. ON THE UNITED STATES.</item>
               <item>III. ON THE WORLD.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. THE citizen, enlightened, will be a freeman in its trueſt ſenſe. He will know his rights, and he will underſtand the rights of others; diſcerning the connection of his intereſt with the perſervation of theſe rights, he will as firmly ſupport thoſe of his fellow men as his own. Too well informed to be miſled, too virtuous to be corrupted, we ſhall behold man conſiſtent and inflexible. Not at one moment the child of patriotiſm, and at another the ſlave of deſpotiſm, we ſhall ſee him in principle forever the ſame. Immutable in his character, inflexible in his honeſty, he will feel the dignity of his nature and chearfully obey the claims of duty. He will look upon danger without diſmay, ſo he will feel within himſelf the power of averting, or the faculty of diſarming it. With Lucretius, he may ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT is a view of delight to ſtand or walk on the ſhore ſide and to ſee a ſhip toſſed with tempeſt upon the ſea, or to be in a fortified tower, and to ſee two battles joined upon a plain. But it is
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034558_0081_0FFE28E8B22DBFB8"/>
a pleaſure incomparable for the mind of man to be ſettled, landed and fortified in the certainty of truth, and from thence to deſcry and behold the errors, perturbations, labours and wanderings up and down of other men.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THE love of knowledge, which even a moderate portion of information never fails to inſpire, would at the ſame time ſhut up many ſources of miſery, and open more ſources of happineſs. The love of wealth would ceaſe to be the predominant paſſion of the heart; other objects would divide the attention, and perhaps challenge and receive a more conſtant regard.</p>
            <p>THE acquiſition of knowledge is open to all. It injures no one. Its object is diſintereſted. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in diſtinction only ſo far as it increaſes the maſs of public good. Here then is an object which all may purſue without the interference of one with another. So far from producing interference, it will conſtantly tend to deſtroy it; for the more men think, the more they will reſemble each other, and the more they reſemble each other, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will their mutual attachment be.</p>
            <p>II. VIEWING the effects of ſuch a ſyſtem on the United States, the firſt reſult would be the giving perpetuity to thoſe political principles ſo cloſely connected with out preſent happineſs. In addition to theſe might be expected numerous improvements in our political economy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:034558_0082_0FFE28ACB70D9CD8"/>
BY theſe means government without oppreſſion, and protection without danger, will exiſt in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſtrength.</p>
            <p>POLITICS are acknowledged to be ſtill in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. No circumſtance could ſo rapidly promote the growth of this ſcience as an univerſal illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind. The minds of millions centering in one point, could not fail to produce the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt diſcoveries. Hence the proſpect that our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical inſtitutions would quickly mature into plans as perfect as human happineſs would require.</p>
            <p>IF all the genius of a nation could be impelled into active exertion, philoſophy, both moral and phyſical, would ſoon preſent a new face. Every new diſcovery would probably tend to abridge the labour of the body, and to allow opportunity, as well as inſpire inclination, to cheriſh reflection. Man would feel himſelf in poſſeſſion of two exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſources of enjoyment, the exerciſe of the body, and the reflection of the mind; and he would ſoon find the laſt as ſubmiſſive as the firſt.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtate of things could not fail to elevate the United States far above other nations. Poſſeſſed of every ſource of happineſs, under the guardianſhip of all neceſſary power, ſhe would ſoon become a model for the nations of the earth. This leads in the third place to,</p>
            <p>III. THE conſideration of the effects of ſuch a ſyſtem on the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:034558_0083_0FFE28EA5BEB6660"/>
NATION is influenced as powerfully by nation, as one individual is influenced by another. Hence no ſooner ſhall any one nation demonſtrate by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical illuſtration the goodneſs of her political inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, than other nations will imperceptibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce correſponding features into their ſyſtems. No truth is more certain, than that man will be happy if he can. He only wants a complete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the means, to purſue them with energy and ſucceſs. This conviction the United States may be deſtined to flaſh on the world.</p>
            <p>INDEPENDENT of this neceſſary effect, other effects will be produced. Many of the moſt enlightened of our citizens will traverſe the globe with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of philoſophical reſearch. They will carry with them valuable information and an ardent enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm to diffuſe it. Its diffuſion will be the aera of reform wherever it goes.</p>
            <p>BUT more important, ſtill, will be the example of the moſt powerful nation on earth, if that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exhibit dignity, humility and intelligence. Scarcely a century can elapſe, before the population of America will be equal, and her power ſuperior, to that of Europe. Should the principles be then eſtabliſhed, which have been contemplated, and the connection be demonſtrated between human happineſs and the peaceable enjoyment of induſtry and the indulgence of reflection, we may expect to ſee America too enlightened and virtuous to ſpread the horrors of war over the face of any country,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034558_0084_0FFE28AE38FF7DE0"/>
and too magnanimous and powerful to ſuffer its exiſtence where ſhe can prevent it. Let us, then, with rapture anticipate the aera, when the triumph of peace and the prevalence of virtue ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſecure by the diffuſion of uſeful knowledge.</p>
