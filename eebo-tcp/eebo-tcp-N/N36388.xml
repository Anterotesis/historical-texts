            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE BLIND CHILD.</head>
            <p>MR. WYNDHAM, of whoſe family I am about to relate ſome Anecdotes, was an eminent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. He married an amiable woman, by whom he had four children. Their reſidence, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the winter, was in one of the beſt ſtreets in the city of London, and in the ſummer months, at his fine eſtate in the country, on which he had built an elegant houſe, and where the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047559_0008_1023C4983A289490"/>
riches his induſtry, and that of his father, had gained, were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in decorating his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But it is not of Mr. Wyndham only I mean to ſpeak, though his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, his probity, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous virtues, might well employ a more able hiſtorian than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is true, he will ſometimes appear to great advantage in the following pages: but ſince I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf to a yout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>e, and Mr. Wyndham will appear in a more amiable light as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other. As a good mother too, Mrs. Wyndham will,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047559_0009_1023C408C91466E0"/>
I doubt not, excite many grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compariſons in my young friends, who will read in her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter thoſe virtues which have been exerted by their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and not one ſentiment of regret will, I hope, be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a review of her actions, except in that feeling youthful boſom, which mourns the loſs of an indulgent parent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wyndham's eldeſt child was a daughter, named Emily. She was, at the time when this hiſtory commences, juſt turned of fourteen, and at that age gave promiſe of every amiable and virtuous quality; I ſay gave <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> becauſe at that time of life, the character cannot be decided. Neither had ſhe been injudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forward according to the faſhion of the times, which, haſtening the ſummer of life,

               </gap>lken bud, and forces an immature fruit, neither fair to the ſight, nor pleaſing to the taſte. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, excited by my ſubject, may, I hope, be excuſed; for, ſhould my young readers paſs it over as unimportant <hi>now,</hi> it may hereafter recur to their memory, as neither untrue nor uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting.</p>
            <p>Emily, with a form of the moſt delicate order, had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed ſo early to habits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and exerciſe, that her frame had acquired a ſtrength which nature had denied, and her countenance a bloom, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened it with the moſt graceful vivacity. She was not a beauty, but ſhe was perfectly agreeable. Her healthy appearance, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent

That is the great thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in learning a language; as to little common-place phraſes, or mere converſation, they may be amuſing, and they may at times be ſerviceable; but a language can never be entirely uſeful, till one can tranſlate it liberally and eaſily.</p>

After breakfaſt, Mrs. Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſent a ſervant to know how Mrs. Neville did; and heard, with pleaſure, ſhe found herſelf ſomething better; and, therefore, propoſed to Mr. Wyndham, that they ſhould ſpend the afternoon with their neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney: ſhe intended to take only Emily and Arthur with her, leaving Helen and Maria with an old faithful ſervant, who was accuſtomed to take care of them when Mr. and Mrs. Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham were abſent.</p>

               <p>Could you, then, had you it in your power, do her greater unkindneſs? In making people
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:047559_0099_1023C4B7ADBDB398"/>
ridiculous, we injure them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely. A nick-name, as it is called, given to children, grows up with them, they are known by it; thoſe who are not acquainted with them, form a light, if not a bad opinion of their characters: in the mean time, perhaps, they correct the faults or the follies that gave riſe to it, but that is not known, while their nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names precede their entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every company. It is the ſame with every ſpecies of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule; if your brother and ſiſters were to hear to Miſs Sidney ten years hence, they would connect with her name, the awkward, diſagreeable idea you have given them of her character; they might, perhaps, unguardedly, expreſs the opinion they had formed of her, and thus puniſh her for the faults ſhe might have long

               <p>Even were there no excuſe to be made for Harriet Sidney's faults, I could not allow you to employ <hi>ridicule</hi> to expoſe them.

               <p>I ſee, Mamma, that I have been guilty of a very great fault, I am much concerned for it, and willing to ſubmit to any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſhall think proper.

               <p>Not in themſelves, perhaps, but by a little exaggeration, which a true mimic never ſpares, they become ſo; nay, Emily, even my tender attention to my grand-mother, who was very old, and required conſtant, aſſiduity, was ſet in the ſame point of view; it was deemed a diſturbing and importunate <hi>"rout about nothing."</hi> an affectation of fondneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>By no means—I pitied my young acquaintance very much; it had been laughed at, and ſhe was encouraged to mimic everybody, and no one had ever told her it was wrong.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>EMILY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I ſhall never mimic any body again. But, Mamma, you uſed to laugh very much at Mr. Harris, when he imitated ſome of the players in London.</p>

               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>That is true—but that was not perſonal ridicule; he merely imitated the particular ſtyle of ſpeaking in each; ſome of them, you remember, were not laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

only thoſe of the comic actors, and that becauſe they were exactly like. He alſo imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the manners of ſailors and clowns, but that was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ridicule, it was aimed at no <hi>one</hi> in particular.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>Under certain circumſtances it may be, but it requires a very nice judgment to direct it, and in a <hi>woman</hi> it never can be right. It diſcovers an inclination to ſet herſelf off; beſides, it muſt be accompanied by a ſelf-poſſeſſion, inconſiſtent with the modeſty of the female character. Every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to what is called <hi>humour,</hi> ought to be diſcouraged in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; it puts her too forward

diſappointed on the occaſion; however, ſhe felt too much the conſtant juſtice of her mother to have murmured, even if ſhe had not been convinced that in this inſtance ſhe deſerved her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon Mrs. Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham went to Mrs. Neville's, whom ſhe found ſo extremely ill, that ſhe could not prevail on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to quit her, but ſent word home, that ſhe ſhould remain with her friend that night.—In the morning Mr. Wyndham ſent to know how Mrs. Neville was, and heard, with great concern, that ſhe could not live many hours; he communicated this intelligence to Emily, and immediately went to Mrs. Neville's houſe, leaving Emily exceſſively diſtreſſed.

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:047559_0109_1023C4D372303888"/>
by ardent wiſhes, to alleviate her mother's anguiſh; ſhe had an inceſſant ſtruggle to reſtrain her tears; but a wiſh to emulate the fortitude and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of her mother, prevailed on her to repreſs them as much as poſſible, and to ſit down with her ſiſters, ſupplying, as well as ſhe could, the place of Mrs. Wyndham.

little girl to other ſubjects, in which at times ſhe ſucceeded; but Charlotte frequently ſpoke of her mother, in a way which affected all who heard her.—Mrs. Wyndham remained alone till the evening, when ſhe admitted Emily, who remained with her till bed time. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs Wyndham returned to her family, compoſed though deeply dejected, thus ennobling grief by not yielding to its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate impulſes; though for many weeks it required a violent ſtruggle between her reaſon and her feelings, to appear with that dignified ſerenity ſhe ſo much wiſhed to retain. Emily, ſtruck by this example of fortitude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to profit by it; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a leſſon to her heart, which ſhe never afterwards forgot.—From this time ſhe ſtrove, with

undeviating attention, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her own faults, that ſhe might be a worthy pattern for Charlotte to follow; ſhe ceaſed not to exert the utmoſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and patience towards the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl, who, in being an orphan, ſeemed to have a ſufficient claim on the affections of this amiable family, and ſhared equally with Maria the fondneſs of them all.

            <head>ELFRIDA, OR, THE MIRROR. A FAIRY TALE.</head>
            <p>THE limitation of man's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has been, in all ages, a theme equally choſen by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt and the diſcontented. The firſt of theſe characters has from
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:047559_0118_1023C5991D6E5128"/>
thence deduced many profitable concluſions to the chaſtiſement of our preſent vanity, and the exaltation of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uture hope.—While the laſt has murmured at this confinement of his faculties, which reach not even to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underſtanding of thoſe things more immediately under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and are conſequently very unequal to the diſcernment of future events or diſtant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. To check, in ſome degree, the diſſatisfaction of the latter, and to add ſtrength to the reaſonings of the former, the tale of Elfrida ſhall attempt; nay more, in ſpite of its puerile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it ſhall ſtrive to place the ſubject in another point of view, and conſider the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our capacity in this ſtate of our exiſtence, as one great ſource of the comfort we enjoy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="unknown:047559_0119_1023C4E1DAE30E80"/>
Faſhioned by the hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with every charm to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſenſes, Elfrida poſſeſſed alſo a ſoul of the higheſt order: and that aſpiring genius which graſps eagerly at knowledge, and having received all that its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors have to beſtow, like Alexander, weeps for more <hi>worlds</hi> of <hi>information</hi> to ſubdue. Elfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da was the daughter of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Baron, who was high in the favour of the third brave Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In the various wars of that king, Elfrida's father took an active part. She was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the cloſe of her ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, when Fitz-Richard was ſummoned from his caſtle to attend his ſovereign to the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh wars. But a few months had he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> freed from the weight of his armour, yet he reſumed it with alacrity, and felt a regret
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:047559_0120_1023C4E491E43340"/>
only in parting from his fair and innocent child.—He left her overwhelmed with grief under the care of her governeſs and her women, for her mother had ſlept many years in the ſilent tomb. Elfrida, who enthuſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally loved her father, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in him all the affections of a very ſenſible heart, lamented his departure with inceſſant regret.—The ſolitude in which ſhe had been educated, and which, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſidence in it, had for her every charm, now became inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid. She frequently wandered from her governeſs and her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to indulge her ſorrow, and waited for hours, at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the park, in the hope of ſooner receiving intelligence from the Baron. One day, when ſhe had finiſhed her morning ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which were become unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:047559_0121_1023C4E613F2FEA0"/>
to her, ſhe retired from the heat of the ſun into a natural ſort of grotto, formed in a rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through which perpetually ran a clear ſtream, and whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance was ſhaded by a luxuriant growth of jeſſamine and honey ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, which had been planted and reared by the <hi>ſportive</hi> labour of Fitz-Richard and Elfrida. This place recalled to her mind the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of her father in all its force.—"He has been gone," ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <q>three weeks, and I have heard from him but once. Perhaps at this moment, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued by toilſome marches, he faints beneath the heat of this burning ſun. In vain may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="unknown:047559_0122_1023C4E908282A50"/>
enjoying the luxurious cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his favourite retreat, to what perils may my father be expoſed? Shortly, too, new dangers will ſurround him; the dangers of unſparing war! His valour will place him foremoſt in the ranks of of battle, and who can tell.</q>—The ſuggeſtion which her heart inſpired, her tongue refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expreſs; a ſhower of tears fell from her eyes—ſhe trembled and was ſilent. At length ſhe proceeded—<q>Oh that I could be at this moment informed of thy welfare, my father! that ſome beneficent being would inſtruct me how thou art em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed! Why, alas! has hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven denied the privilege of knowing how thoſe we love are ſituated during their abſence from us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>—Elfrida had no
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:047559_0123_1023C4ED5E0C13E0"/>
ſooner pronounced theſe words, than ſhe was ſtruck with a ſenſe of their impropriety, and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to implore the pardon of Heaven for an expreſſion which her delicacy of feeling taught her immediately to renounce as preſumptuous. Still, however, her heart acknowledged a deſire that a conſtant information of her father's ſituations might be made conſiſtent with the will of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Deeply engaged in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, Elfrida ſcarcely heard a flight noiſe in the back part of the cavern; but at length, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining ſhe heard the ſound of light footſteps, ſhe raiſed her eyes, and ſtarted on beholding a figure, whoſe appearance ſpoke it of a different order of beings. The ſtature of this form ſcarcely exceeded a foot in height, and
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:047559_0124_1023C4F0194C70C0"/>
its dimenſions were proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſmall. Its features, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diminutive, were regularly beautiful, and its countenance beſpoke tender benevolence.—On its head was placed a turban of the fineſt blue, the texture of which ſeemed like the leaf of a flower. It was ornamented with a circlet of precious ſtones, which, though ſmall, was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible brightneſs. Its gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a ſort of robe deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in folds to the ground, of the moſt exquiſite whiteneſs, and ſhining like the flight threads which in the autumn are ſeen floating over the graſs at ſun-ſet. In one hand it held an ivory wand, and in the other a <hi>mirror</hi> of the moſt admirable poliſh.</p>
            <p>Elfrida, ſtartled by this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural appearance, would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:047559_0125_1023C4F19B2F80D0"/>
of irreſiſtible impulſe. Her eyes eagerly ſurveyed the ſhining ſtranger, who, advancing, ſaid: <q>Be not alarmed, Elfrida; for innocence, and goodneſs of heart like yours, have from me nothing to fear. You have heard, and, with propriety, deſpiſed, a thouſand idle tales of the fairies, which have no exiſtence but in imagination. You have rightly judged it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the wiſdom of the Supreme Being to ſuffer a ſet of inferior agents to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mankind with impunity. But learn, fair Elfrida, that although they exiſt not for purpoſes ſo vain, they yet <hi>do</hi> exiſt. Under the controul of ſuperior power, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by their inviſible agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to direct the ſmaller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of man's life. Once in

an age their perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is allowed to ſome favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mortal, who, like yourſelf, poſſeſſes a heart ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeduced by the allurements of vice. I have heard your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and your wiſhes, and to me it is given, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove the one, yet to fulfil the other. Your father is gone on a ſervice of danger, but it is alſo a ſervice of glory. He is himſelf perfectly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſituation, nor would he exchange it for the inglorious repoſe of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtation. The only allay to his ſatisfaction is the neceſſity of quitting you, but he anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates the time of his return with hopeful pleaſure. Be it your taſk to improve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of his abſence by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting attention to your

improvement in thoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments he wiſhed you to poſſeſs. Do not by vain regrets impair the health, and laviſh the ſenſibility on which Fitz-Richard depends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Elfrida, who had liſtened at firſt with ſome degree of terror, which inſenſibly wore away, now haſtened to aſſure the fairy, that ſhe was perfectly convinced of the propriety of her remarks, and to promiſe, that ſhe would in future more ſteadily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repreſs a too great ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.—<q>You ſay well, gentle Elfrida, replied the fairy, and I read in your heart the ſincerity of your purpoſes.—But why wander the eyes of my fair favourite? I ſee you are curious to know more of me. I am the queen of the

fairies, and to me is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly allotted the care of the young and beautiful. This wand is the ſcarce of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this mirror, Elfrida, ſhall be to you, if you ſtill wiſh it, all you have aſked from Heaven. Tell me, do you yet ſeek to be conſtantly informed of your father's ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? I ſee you do.—Take, then, this mirror: three times in every day, (with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of at leaſt half an hour between each time) for five minutes, it ſhall dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Elfrida eagerly extended her hand, and for the firſt time loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her attention to the fairy, ſhe caſt her eyes on the ſo-much deſired gift. She there beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

aſtoniſhment, returned to the eaſtle. To her governeſs alone, in whom ſhe had a perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe repeated the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ſurpriſing viſion; at firſt the governeſs treated it as a vapour of the imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on ſeeing the mirror, began to believe in the truth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Elfrida, that her mind might be perfectly ſatisfied, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to caſt her eyes on it at the ſame time with herſelf; the governeſs complied, and they both ſaw the Baron Fitz-Richard. He was on horſeback, and while they gazed, the horſe fell and thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w his rider to the ground: Elfrida ſhrieked and dropped the mirror! Inſtantly ſhe caught it again from the earth; but, alas! in that moment the picture had vaniſhed! The exceſs of her anxiety and dread may, perhaps
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:047559_0131_1023C50369FC0048"/>
be conceived; ſhe wept, ſhe trembled, and at intervals giving herſelf up to the horrors of her imagination, ſhe ſcreamed aloud in agony.—Thus paſſed the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted half hour which muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene ere ſhe could again ſee any thing; the moment it expired, ſhe ſeized the glaſs, and beheld her father extended on a couch pale and languid, his arm was bound round by a ſcarf, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frida believed he had broken it; this was all that appeared, and Elfrida remained as unſatisfied as ever. In this interval her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs endeavoured to impreſs on the mind of Elfrida the folly of ſeeking to know more than Providence had revealed; but Elfrida, diſtracted with anxiety, heard her not, waiting, with her eyes fixed on the mirror, till the alotted half hour ſhould expire.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:047559_0132_1023C50610045780"/>
At length the heavy minute; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and the ſame ſcene was again preſented to her view. And now the mirror had for that day loſt its power, and in vain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frida wept and rejected ſleep. Ere the night was ſpent, an expreſs arrived, who brought letters from the Baron. Elfrida opened them with impatience, they were dated five days before, and though they gave the moſt ſatisfactory accounts of his health at that time, Elfrida, who knew what had paſſed ſince, received no pleaſure from them. She threw them aſide, and waited for the morning dawn with a paſſionate impatience, which deſtroyed the natural ſweetneſs of her temper. Ere it arrived, however, ſleep cloſed her weary eyes, and ſhe opened them in conſequence of the ſun-beams which darted
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:047559_0133_1023C50793A6DE58"/>
through her windows. Angry with herſelf for having ſlept ſhe ſeized the mirror, and ſaw her father at the door of his tent; he raiſed his hands in thankfulneſs to Heaven, and Elfrida at once perceived that his arm had not been broken, and that by the quickneſs of his recovery, in all probability, the accident had been comparatively ſlight. She firſt ardently thanked Heaven for his escape, and then exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>Ah, miſchievous preſent, what grief has it cauſed me! Had I not accepted this mirror, theſe letters would have been to me a ſource of delight; I ſhould have known nothing of a circumſtance which has been in itſelf of little conſequence, and which, even had it been worſe, I could not have reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. I will return this mirror
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:047559_0134_1023C50A8FBD1938"/>
to the fairy, and henceforth content myſelf with the gifts which Heaven has beſtowed.</q> Her governeſs applauded her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, and Elfrida haſtened to the grotto, ſhe impatiently dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the mirror into the ſtream, and the fairy immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.—<q>Take back your fatal gift,</q> ſaid the fair Elfrida, <q>I have already proved the miſery which attends it, already have diſcovered the folly of my wiſhes.—With pleaſure I receive it, replied the fairy, a pleaſure which ariſes from the joy I feel in ſuch an inſtance of your prudence. I knew when I gave it to you, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which muſt accompany the knowledge you deſired, but ſcarcely hoped that you would have been ſo ſoon convinced of its inefficacy to make you happy.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:047559_0135_1023C50EB2118CF8"/>
—'Tis true, I might have made the gift more perfect, but if it had continually reflected the image of your father, you would have neglected every thing to gaze upon it, and your time would have paſſed unmarked by improvement. I ſee you have no deſire of the kind remaining; but, Elfrida, although this gift is uſeleſs to you, yet the experience it has brought will not prove ſo. Henceforth you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced when you are tempted to form <hi>wiſhes,</hi> that if granted, they would in all probability conduce as little to your real happineſs as <hi>this</hi> has done. None could wear a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance than this, which ſeemed prompted by filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but ſuſpect in future, Elfrida, that every deſire of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:047559_0136_1023C5115725A4D8"/>
whatever ſort, is unreaſonable and improper, if it leads to <hi>diſcontent.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The fairy ended, and Elfrida, after ſincerely thanking her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the caſtle with a mind deeply impreſſed by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which had befallen her.</p>
            <p>This ſtory, and the comments it occaſioned, employed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the evening. Emily requeſted to know why her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objected to Helen's and Maria's hearing it, and Mrs. Wyndham explained to her the difficulty which ſuch young minds would have had to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the fiction from the truth of the ſtory.</p>
            <p>A few days afterwards, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:047559_0137_1023C512D9322E18"/>
and Helen were invited by a lady who lived near them, to accompany Mrs. Wyndham to hear her concert, which ſhe had formed at her own houſe to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the birth-day of her ſon; this party they anticipated with the greateſt delight, they were both extremely fond of muſic, and it formed, indeed, almoſt the only pleaſure which Helen could enjoy without imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; opportunities of hearing good muſic in the country are ſcarce, and thus the two girls fixed all their wiſhes for ſeveral days before on the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſcheme. They were accordingly dreſt to go, and the carriage was ordered, when a meſſage arrived from the lady to whoſe houſe they were going, ſaying, that ſhe was very ſorry
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:047559_0138_1023C5154EEC6388"/>
it was not in her power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, as ſhe had juſt heard of the death of a relation, which obliged her to renounce her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended plan for the evening. Emily immediately ſaid, <q>Poor Mrs. Selwyn, how ſorry am I for her!</q> and ſeemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her own diſappointment in concern for the cauſe; but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len directly burſt into tears, and ſeemed quite overwhelmed with mortification. Mrs. Wyndham took no notice of her for a few minutes, hoping ſhe would of herſelf overcome the impatient ſorrow into which ſhe had fallen; but perceiving ſhe indulged it, and ſullenly rejected the ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her ſiſters, ſhe ſpoke to her.</p>

            <p>Helen, however, continued crying with great violence, and as Maria attempted to careſs and conſole her, ſhe puſhed her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with an impatient air.</p>

Theſe words ſeemed to make ſome impreſſion on Helen, but paſſion again got the better of her feelings, and ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be led from her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, much hurt, deſired Emily to change her dreſs, and then as the carriage was ready, ſhe would take a ride with her, as the evening was delightful—Emily cheerfully obeyed, and by the time ſhe returned, Helen was once more quiet. Mrs. Wyndham then called her to her, and ſaid,</p>

               <p>Helen, if we ſuffer ourſelves to ſay we cannot help being fooliſh and unreaſonable, we ſhall ſoon become really incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of avoiding it, and thus throw away the beſt of our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, reaſon and ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

The children were exceſſively delighted, and ſetting out in the higheſt ſpirits, they enjoyed their ride without any mixture of regret.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of a day or two, Mrs. Wyndham went with her eldeſt daughter to pay a viſit in the neighbourhood; there were three or four young people, and it was propoſed they ſhould ſtroll a while in the garden; they did ſo, and on their return, Mrs. Wyndham, accuſtomed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the looks of Emily, ſaw that ſhe returned diſſatisfied with her companions, and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed at ſomething which had happened. When they were ſeated in the carriage to return, Mrs. Wyndham queſtioned her on the ſubject, and Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thus:</p>

               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:047559_0150_1023C5387B2163E0"/>
It is true, Mamma, I was diſpleaſed with the behaviour of the young ladies with whom I walked.</p>

               <p>When we firſt went into the garden, Miſs Darnford ſaid to me, <q>You'll excuſe me, Miſs Wyndham, if I walk with Miſs Smithſon, I have not ſeen her before to-day, and I have a great deal to tell her.</q> I thought this a little ſtrange, however I begged ſhe would do as ſhe liked beſt; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhe took Miſs Smithſon by the arm, walked on with her, and entered into a long talk, laughing and ſpeaking with ſo much agitation, that I concluded
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:047559_0151_1023C53BA20D73F8"/>
ſhe muſt have met with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkably droll and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Miſs Martin, who walked with me, ſaid, <q>I think Miſs Darnford is very rude, when one of her <hi>friends,</hi> as ſhe calls them is with her.—She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, I ſaid, to have ſomething of conſequence to relate to Miſs Smithſon.—Nonſenſe,</q> replied Miſs Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <q>ſhe ſaw her laſt night, and ſhe only behaves in this way to give herſelf an air to to you of being very clever, and very fond of her friend. As to what ſhe has to tell her, <hi>I'll lay you a wager</hi> I know it beforehand; ſhe told me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you came a great deal about it, and her father would be very angry with her if he knew ſhe told.</q>
               </p>

               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>I think, Emily, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent her, Miſs Martin has a very blunt, odd manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>EMILY.</speaker>
               <p>Oh yes, Mamma, ſhe uſed very odd expreſſions, and I thought ſpoke ſtrangely. She told me, then, that Miſs Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was repeating a converſation which had paſſed before her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her father and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on ſome buſineſs, about which they had quarrelled. I was quite ſhocked to think ſhe ſhould ever mention what had paſſed in her father's houſe! By this time the ſtory was ended, and the ladies joined us, Miſs Darnford ſaying, <q>Be ſure you don't mention it, Papa would be very angry if he ſhould
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:047559_0153_1023C53FEB425B28"/>
hear of it.</q> They then walked with us, and Miſs Darnford be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſk me queſtions, how I employed myſelf, whether I learned muſic and dancing, and whenever I anſwered, I ſaw ſhe looked at Miſs Smithſon, and they both ſeemed ready to laugh, which confuſed me very much. At laſt Miſs Darnford ſaid, <q>So you've no governeſs, and your Mamma teaches you herſelf; well that is very odd!</q> I aſked her "Why?" and ſhe ſaid, <q>Oh, I don't know, only I hear ſhe goes on quite different from the common way, and that you and your ſiſters are to be <hi>vaſtly clever!</hi>
                  </q>—Here both the ladies laughed, and Miſs Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid, <q>Well, thank my ſtars, my Mamma has no ſuch whims—ſhe does not trouble her
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:047559_0154_1023C543E1B17D00"/>
head much about us; why they ſay, Miſs Wyndham, that you never go out without your Mamma—that you are employed all day with her—and that ſhe makes you tell her every thing you know.</q> I found by this time, Mamma, that theſe young people were not well educated, nor very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo I ſaid very coolly, <q>You are mis-informed, my mother is incapable of <hi>whims,</hi> ſhe is all goodneſs, I am never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py but when I am with her; and as to telling her all I know, I never knew any thing with which ſhe is not acquainted.—What,</q> ſaid Miſs Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <q>do you tell her the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets your friends truſt you with?—I told her, I was too young to be entruſted with
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:047559_0155_1023C546C6671960"/>
ſecrets of any importance, and that I had no particular friends out of my own family.—How, no friends!</q> ſaid Miſs Darnford, adding in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected tone, <q>poor thing! How unhappy you muſt be! Oh, I pity you, ſince you never knew the delight of <hi>perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi>
                  </q>—"Pardon me," I ſaid, <q>I talk with perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to my mother!—Oh, ſaid ſhe, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</q> And here, Mamma, the converſation was ſtopped by our being called into the houſe. But will you explain to me why theſe young ladies behaved ſo ſtrangely?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>I can do that eaſily, but it will take up ſome time, ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:047559_0156_1023C5494E2A05B8"/>
every word they ſpoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome falſe principle. I knew ſomething of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Miſs Darnford, and had you been a year younger, or your principles leſs fixed, I ſhould not have permitted you to walk with them. In the firſt part of her behaviour to her <hi>friend,</hi> (a name abuſed by ſuch an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) Miſs Darnford ſhowed great want of good-breeding—for politeneſs forbids us, if ever ſo much attached, to ſingle out the object of our <hi>affections,</hi> as the ſole object of our <hi>attention</hi> in any party; even if we are wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

not theſe conſtant teſtimonies of love, it truſts in its friend, and believes her incapable of miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing our attention to others. We ought, then, never to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the next place you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in Miſs Darnford, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that hateful <hi>exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> againſt which I have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten warned you. At thirteen (Miſs Darnford's age) it is not
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:047559_0158_1023C54DA0174D30"/>
poſſible that the character ſhould be ſufficiently formed, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough enlightened, to admit of our chooſing a real <hi>friend.</hi> At that age, in general, the imagination has moſt power. A fine face, an intereſting figure, are recommendations ſufficiently powerful to win the heart. Some young people are brought up, particularly at ſchools, with the idea that they muſt form an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with ſome one; thus they ſelect the firſt perſon who pleaſes their fancy, her only recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, perhaps, what they call being very <hi>good-natured;</hi> they tell her all they know; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach themſelves from their family; its ſecrets if they can learn them, are divulged; a thouſand ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences follow, of which you will one day, my dear Emily, be
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:047559_0159_1023C551B0E4A9A0"/>
more ſenſible than I can make you now. When you ſhall be of age to judge, do not ſuppoſe I ſhall object to your forming a ſtrict intimacy with any one, whom you ſhall then believe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your eſteem—at preſent I hope your mother is your friend.</p>

               <p>You muſt have ſeen in Miſs Darnford enough to diſguſt you with that ridiculous affectation of friendſhip which at her age cannot exiſt. Young people are too apt to deceive themſelves on this point; they find the deceit at laſt, and the next perſon they ſee at all agreeable, ſupplies the place of the diſcarded friend; they have choſen lightly, again
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:047559_0160_1023C554452AB160"/>
are deceived, and again change their connexion. Thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a habit of ſickleneſs and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price; they learn to exaggerate their feelings, the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all errors. They never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their reaſon, never aſk them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether they really love her whom they call their <hi>friend,</hi> whether they are capable of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſacrifices for her ſake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they really eſteem her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Theſe are the only proofs of <hi>real</hi> friendſhip, and judge, then, whether falſe intimacy and confidence are worthy of the name.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. WYNDHAM.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly; ſhe did not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:047559_0161_1023C555C7052268"/>

At leaſt ſhe makes the young perſon ridiculous, and if, like Miſs Darnford, ſhe has dared to diſcloſe the affairs of her family, think what dreadful conſequences may enſue. How many quarrels, how much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, how many horrid events have flowed from theſe ill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed connexions! If, fearing theſe, a young perſon acts more <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi> and does not diſcard the <hi>friend</hi> ſhe no longer loves, think what miſery ſhe has propoſed for herſelf, to live in habits of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy which ſhe dares not break, with a perſon ſhe has no regard for, whom, perhaps, her better

            <p>In regular attendance on their ſeveral ſtudies, the Wyndhams paſſed the ſummer; however, for the firſt time, they ſaw the approach of winter without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, as the oculiſt, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they had taken, gave them hopes that by that time he ſhould be able to perform an operation on Helen's eyes, which would, if any thing could, reſtore her to ſight. We may judge with what extreme anxiety the whole family awaited this important period;
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:047559_0165_1023C5623362D8A0"/>
they took care not to inform Helen of their hopes, left they ſhould be diſappointed, and ſhe ſhould be more dejected than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The autumn they ſpent very agreeably, enjoying the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſerenity of the weather and the different ſcenes of harveſt and fruit-gathering, in all of which the children were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſſiſt. At the end of October the whole family went to London, and in a week after that, Helen was to ſubmit to the deciſive operation, from which they all hoped ſo much. Her mother, with infinite feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tenderneſs, prepared her for it, and received her promiſe to ſit patiently and quietly. The day arrived, and the anxious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily aſſembled to witneſs the event, Charlotte Neville and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:047559_0166_1023C564DD6E1A78"/>
excepted, whoſe vivacity they feared would interrupt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. Mrs. Wyndham, alike unable to fee the operation, or to quit the room, retired to one end of it, trembling, pale, her hands and her heart lifted up to God, but concealing her face on the ſhoulder of Arthur, whoſe arms were thrown round his mother, while his tears fell faſt on her cheek. Emily, ſtruggling with the extreme agitation of her mind, but by a ſtrong effort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, knelt with her eyes fixed on Helen, and one of her arms round her waiſt, while the other hand held both the hands of Helen. It is not poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the conflicting emotions which were viſible on her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; hope, fear, tenderneſs, and devotion, were mingled in
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:047559_0167_1023C56792BCAD38"/>
her eyes, which were now raiſed to Heaven, now fixed on her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at intervals ſeeking to penetrate the thoughts of the operator. Mr. Wyndham ſtood on the other ſide of Helen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her to have courage, yet feeling on his heart every touch of the inſtrument which the ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tender oculiſt applied to the eyes of the patient, quiet Helen; behind whoſe chair ſtood two female ſervants; hardly da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they breathe, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </q>—At this exclamation Mrs. Wyndham roſe ſuddenly, but unable to endure her ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe fainted. Mr. Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

Emily, her complexion changing every inſtant from white to crimſon, the tears ſtreaming down her cheeks, could no longer ſuppreſs her anxiety.—"Oh, Sir," ſhe ſaid, "does ſhe ſee!"—"Huſh," replied the ſurgeon, and Emily was again ſilent.

            <p>Juſt then Mr. Wyndham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.

<pb n="178" facs="unknown:047559_0176_1023C5808ADCF5C8"/>
misfortune of loſing a wife, who was not only peculiarly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but whoſe ſoul was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every virtue, and of every elegant accompliſhment. She was ſuddenly cut off in the flower of her age, after having lived twelve years with the beſt and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate of huſbands. A perfect ſimilarity of temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, a kindred delicacy of taſte and ſentiment, had linked their hearts together in early youth, and each ſucceeding year ſeemed but to add new ſtrength to their affection. Though poſſeſſed of an affluent fortune, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the tranquillity of the country to all the gay pleaſures of the capital. In the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtate, in che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the virtuous induſtry of its inhabitants, in ornamenting a beautiful ſeat, in the ſociety of

one another, in the innocent prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of their little children, and in the company of a few friends, Mr <hi>Wentworth</hi> and his <hi>Amelia</hi> found every wiſh gratified, and their happineſs complete.</p>
               <p>My readers will judge then, what muſt have been Mr. <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth'</hi>s feelings, when <hi>Amelia</hi> was thus ſuddenly torn from him, in the very prime of her life, and in the midſt of her felicity.

His countenance was pale, and his eyes betrayed
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:047559_0180_1023C58BB6DF7C40"/>
that his heart was ill at eaſe; but it was that ſilent and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſorrow which commands our reverence and our admiration.</p>

Having ſomehow made his eſcape from thence, the dog had that morning found his way home; and, as ſoon as he ſaw Mr. Wentworth, leaped upon him with an exceſs of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I ſaw my friend's lips and cheeks quiver. He catched his little Frank in his arms; and, for a few moments, hid his face in his neck.</p>
               <p>As we traverſed his delightful grounds, many different ſcenes naturally recalled the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Amelia. My friend, indeed, in order to avoid ſome of her favourite walks, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us an unuſual road; but what corner could be found that did not bear the traces of her hand? Her elegant taſte had
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:047559_0183_1023C594C3080FE0"/>
marked the peculiar beauty of each different ſcene, and had brought it forth to view with ſuch a happy delicacy of art, as to make it ſeem the work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone. As we croſſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paths in the woods, and paſſed by ſome ruſtic buildings, I could ſometimes diſcern an emotion in my friend's co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but he inſtantly ſtifled it with a firmneſs and dignity that made me careful not to ſeem to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>Towards night, Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth having ſtolen out of the room, his brother and I ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out to a terrace behind the houſe. It was the duſk of the evening, the air was mild and ſerene, and the moon was riſing in all her brightneſs from the cloud of the caſt. The fineneſs
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:047559_0184_1023C597999AB3E8"/>
of the night made us extend our walk, and we ſtrayed into a hollow valley, whoſe ſides are covered with trees overhanging a brook that pours itſelf along over broken rocks. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached a ruſtic grotto, plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſequeſtered corner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a half-impending rock. My companion ſtopped. "This," ſaid he, <q>was one of Amelia's walks, and that grotto was her favourite evening retreat. The laſt night ſhe ever walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and the very evening ſhe caught that fatal fever, I was with my brother and her, while we ſat and read to each other in that very place.</q>—While he ſpoke, we perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man ſteal out of the grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and, avoiding us, take his way by a path through a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:047559_0185_1023A162D3CA0E28"/>
of trees on the other ſide. "It is my brother," ſaid young Wentworth; <q>he has been here in his Amelia's favourite grove, indulging that grief he ſo carefully conceals from us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We returned to the houſe, and found Mr. Wentworth with the reſt of the company. He forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſome converſation, and even affected a degree of gentle pleaſantry during the whole evening.</p>
               <p>Such, in ſhort, is the noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of my friend, that, in place of finding it neceſſary to temper and moderate his grief, I muſt avoid ſeeming to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and dare ſcarcely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear even to think of the heavy calamity which has befallen him. I too well know what he feels; but the more I know this, the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:047559_0186_1023C59D68850430"/>
more does the dignity of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection and fortitude excite my admiration, and command my ſilent attention and reſpect.</p>
               <p>How very different is this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and reſerved ſorrow, from that weak and teazing grief which diſguſts, by its ſighs and tears, and clamorous lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? How much does ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortitude of deportment call forth our regard and reverence? How much is a character in other reſpects eſtimable, degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a contrary demeanor? How much does the exceſſive, the importunate, and unmanly grief of <hi>Cicero,</hi> diminiſh the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high reſpect which we ſhould otherwiſe entertain for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted character of that illuſtrious Roman?</p>
               <p>Writers on practical morality
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:047559_0187_1023C5A05E419330"/>
have deſcribed and analyzed the paſſion of grief, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preſcribe remedies for reſtoring the mind to tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but, I believe, little benefit has been derived from any thing they have adviſed. To tell a perſon in grief, that time will relieve him, is truly applying no remedy; and to bid him reflect how many others there may be who are more wretched, is a very inefficacious one. The truth is, that the exceſs of this, as well as of other paſſions, muſt be prevented rather than cured. It muſt be obviated, by our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that evenneſs and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of temper, which can ariſe only from an improved under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and an habitual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with refined ſociety. Theſe will not, indeed, exempt
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:047559_0188_1023C5A1E3453878"/>
us from the pangs of ſorrow, but will enable us to bear them with a noble grace and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will render the preſence of our friends (which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy) a very effectual cure.</p>
               <p>This is well explained by a philoſopher, who is no leſs elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than he is profound. He juſtly obſerves, that we natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on all occaſions, endeavour to bring down our own paſſions, to that pitch which thoſe about us can correſpond with. We view ourſelves in the light in which we think they view us, and ſeek to ſuit our behaviour to what we think their feelings can go along with. With an intimate friend, acquainted with every circumſtance of our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, we can, in ſome meaſure, give way to our grief, but are
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:047559_0189_1023C5A4B48E6438"/>
more calm than when by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Before a common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, we aſſume a greater ſedateneſs. Before a mixed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, we affect a ſtill more conſiderable degree of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Thus, by the company of our friends at firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, by mingling with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, we come to ſuit our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to what we think they will approve of; we gradually abate the violence of our paſſion, and reſtore our mind to its wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranquillity.</p>
